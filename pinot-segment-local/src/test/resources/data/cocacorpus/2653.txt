Bartering is trading services or goods with another person when there is no money involved . This type of exchange was relied upon by early civilizations . There are even cultures within modern society who still rely on this type of exchange . Bartering has been around for a very long time , however , it 's not necessarily something that an economy or society has relied solely on . <p> What is a Barter System ? <p> A barter system is an old method of exchange . Th is system has been used for centuries and long before money was invented . People exchanged services and goods for other services and goods in return . Today , bartering has made a comeback using techniques that are more sophisticated to aid in trading ; for instance , the Internet . In ancient times , this system involved people in the same area , however today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be negotiated with the other party . Bartering does n't involve money which is one of the advantages . You can buy items by exchanging an item you have but no longer want or need . Generally , trading in this manner is done through Online auctions and swap markets . <p> History of Bartering <p> The history of bartering dates all the way back to 6000 BC . Introduced by Mesopotamia tribes , bartering was adopted by Phoenicians . Phoenicians bartered goods to those located in various other cities across oceans . Babylonian 's also developed an improved bartering system . Goods were exchanged for food , tea , weapons , and spices . At times , human skulls were used as well . Salt was another popular item exchanged . Salt was so valuable that Roman soldiers ' salaries were paid with it . In the Middle Ages , Europeans traveled around the globe to barter crafts and furs in exchange for silks and perfumes . Colonial Americans exchanged musket balls , deer skins , and wheat . When money was invented , bartering did not end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , bartering became popular in the 1930s during the Great Depression . It was used to obtain food and various other services . It was done through groups or between people who acted similar to banks . If any items were sold , the owner would receive credit and the buyer 's account would be debited . <p> Disadvantages and Advantages of Bartering <p> Just as with most things , there are disadvantages and advantages of bartering . A complication of bartering is determining how trustworthy the person you are trading with is . The other person does not have any proof or certification that they are legitimate , and there is no consumer protection or warranties involved . This means that services and goods you are exchanging may be exchanged for poor or defective items . You would not want to exchange a toy that is almost brand new and in perfect working condition for a toy that is worn and does not work at all would you ? It may be a good idea to limit exchanges to family and friends in the beginning because good bartering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to think the item you desire is worth more than it actually is and underestimate the value of your own item . <p> On the positive side , there are great advantages to bartering . As mentioned earlier , you do not need money to barter . Another advantage is that there is flexibility in bartering . For instance , related products can be traded such as portable tablets in exchange for laptops . Or , items that are completely different can be traded such as lawn mowers for televisions . Homes can now be exchanged when people are traveling , which can save both parties money . For instance , if your parents have friends in another state and they need somewhere to stay while on a family vacation , their friends may trade their home for a week or so in exchange for your parents allowing them to use your home . <p> Another advantage of bartering is that you do not have to part with material items . Instead , you can offer a service in exchange for an item . For instance , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs work , if you are good at fixing things , you can offer to fix their bike in exchange for the skateboard . With bartering two parties can get something they want or need from each other without having to spend any money .

@@11804624 @404624/ <h> The Ultimate Guide for the History of Money <p> History of Money <p> If we think about the money that we use everyday , it essentially symbolizes a value that other people recognize . The value of money is always dependent on how other people perceive it . Imagine being stranded on a desert island with a million dollars in cash . Since there is nodiv else around , it would actually be rather worthless . Suppose there was a native tribe on the island . Offering them a million dollars in paper money would likely be scoffed , since it poses no real value to them . On the other hand , offering them a large amount of food in trade for other goods might easily be more welcomed . In this article , we explore the history and evolution of money , from its earliest roots to the digital versions we use today . <p> Bartering <p> Before money , as we recognize it today , was ever created , people used a bartering system to exchange goods . Bartering can be tricky to pin down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal or exact . For example , suppose a farmer suggested trading milk for some cloth from a tailor . How would they agree exactly how much milk would be equal to a bolt of silk ? In many bartering situations , it was highly likely that one person in the transaction was not receiving the true value of the goods that they were trading for . Eventually people recognized this problem and turned to a more standardized solution : money . <p> Early Forms of Money <p> Before modern forms of money came into use , people relied on units of weight to solve their trading problems . The Mesopotamians introduced this concept via the shekel . For example , a certain amount of grain might be equivalent to a predetermined amount of gold or other precious metals . <p> Commodity Currency <p> In its earliest incarnation , money was not made from paper or even metal . Instead , it was represented as tokens or goods that were widely regarded as having a high value . A famous example is cowrie shells . It was much more convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cattle or baskets of food . Eventually , people in China began to create metal versions of cowrie shells , and this is considered to be the earliest types of coins . Later on it evolved into flat , round coins with a hole through the middle . Several coins could be linked together on a length of thread or cord and worn by a person . There are still some coins around the world that feature a hole in the middle . Commodity currency allowed people to trade for perceived value rather than goods . For example , a person might want to buy a farmer 's crop in advance . If he has no goods to trade , he could use money , or a commodity currency , to buy the crop . This would be useful to the farmer , since money does not spoil or rot ; instead it retains its value year round . <p> Paper Money <p> Once again , when it comes to paper money , China is known to have produced the first versions .

For example , a person could pay for goods with a paper note that promised a certain sum at a later date . In the early days , people would actually handwrite their monetary promises on specially issued paper from the bank . Later on , the bank simply printed it themselves and issued these banknotes to the public . <p> Gold Backing <p> In 1816 , England introduced gold as their currency 's standard of value . It was evolved from the practice of money lenders , merchants , and other money exchangers who kept enormous amounts of gold in banks for safety . Using gold as currency value meant that each banknote symbolized a certain amount of gold . The same practice reached the United States in 1900 , leading to the birth of the central bank . 
@@11804625 @404625/ <h> 4 Economic Factors that Can Affect the Value of Your Currency <p> Stock markets and major commodities such as oil and gold seem to get most of the mainstream financial market headlines these days . Despite being the- largest and most liquid trading markets in the world , the global currency markets do not nearly get the same attention . <p> There are a few key reasons for this - the lack of a true central currency exchange , the relatively small daily price changes and the seemingly opaque reasons for changes in currencies . <p> However , the value of our nation 's currency can have a strong affect on the stock market and the- commodities markets as well as have a real affect on our lives . Our currency 's value is a basic fundamental component of our wealth and our ability to purchase goods - especially in this age of globalization .

A strong currency will make our exports more expensive to foreign buyers while possibly making imports downright cheap for us to buy . <p> As a currency trader , I can tell you that there are many economic factors to take into consideration when it comes to evaluating a currency 's strength . Some economic factors can have more influence at different times and for different countries . <p> Below , I touch upon four factors that I believe to be among the most important economic indicators anyone can follow by reading the news . <p> 1 . Interest Rates <p> The first factor contributing to the general strength or weakness of a currency is a country 's interest rate . Simply , interest rates are the amount it costs to borrow money . The interest rate level is moved higher or lower by a country 's central bank to either stimulate or slow down an economy . Higher interest rates impose a more costly fee to borrow money while lower interest rates lessen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap credit ) in an economy . <p> When it comes to demand for a particular currency , however , the higher the interest rate usually means the higher the demand for that currency . Lower interest rates usually decrease the demand for a currency . The reason investors look to buy currencies with higher interest rates is it creates an additional rate of return on their currency exchange . A trader is compensated by the interest rate differential when the trader buys the currency with the higher interest rate compared to the lower interest rate currency . There is a popular currency trading strategy called the " carry trade " that seeks to exploit the differences in country 's interest rates ( see more on the carry trade here ) . <p> The mechanics behind this can take some time and effort to fully comprehend , but the general take away is : Higher interest rates make a currency more attractive . <p> 2 . Inflation <p> Inflation is next in our economic factors list and is defined by the rise in prices of goods and services . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an underlying demand for that product . Higher prices may not seem good to a consumer , but it is generally considered healthy for a country to have a moderate increase in inflation in a growing economy . Many central banks have a target inflation rate for their economy of around 2 percent a year . <p> When an economy sees too much inflation , the central bank will try to cool off rising prices and access to cheap credit with an increase in interest rates . This brings us back to number one in our list , where we see that higher interest rates make a currency more attractive . So in a growing economic environment , rising inflation rates will tend to increase expectations that interest rates will rise , which will in turn make traders have a positive outlook for the rise of the currency . <p> There are also downsides to inflation when not accompanied by a growing economy called stagflation ( high unemployment , low growth , high inflation ) and the dreaded deflation , which is when prices are in decline . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goods are falling , leading to declining wages in worker paychecks and less money workers will have to buy goods . <p> 3 . Economic Growth <p> The strength of an economy can go a long way to boosting the strength of the nation 's currency . A strong growth rate in a country will see a growing demand for products and services with better job prospects for workers as well as being an attractive destination for capital and investments . <p> The easiest way to watch a country 's economic standing is to pay attention to the gross domestic product ( GDP ) . A strong GDP reading is growth of 3 percent or more in many cases , while growth close to zero percent or a negative reading shows that the economy could be headed for a recession . A typical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth . <p> In an economy like the United States , which is driven by consumer spending , expanding growth that produces more jobs and better wages will allow workers to feel wealthier and help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bring higher inflation rates and the expectations for interest rate increases . Foreign investment and demand from companies abroad can also play an important factor in boosting the local currency of a strong economy . <p> 4 . Current Account Balance <p> The last on our list is the current account balance . It is considered to be the most extensive gauge of cross-border transactions of a country . Simply put , it is the total amount of goods , services , income and current transfers of a country against all of its trading partners . A positive current account balance signals that a country lends more to its trading partners than it borrows , and a deficit current account balance shows that the country borrows more from its trading partners than it lends . <p> This total amount of trade can influence the country 's exchange rate positively if there is more demand for that country 's goods ( and currency ) from other countries . A deficit or borrower country will see less demand for its own local goods and currency overall . <p> Conclusion <p> Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Price movements can seem volatile and hard to understand , but for those seeking basic insight into currency trends , these important economic factors can go a long way .

In fact , the numbers far outweighed that of the previous wars fought on American soil and this led to the thinking that the country needed a pension program . In all actuality , the nation 's first pension program was passed back in 1776 before the Declaration of Independence was even signed . <p> Between 1889 and 1920 , the US experienced changes in its very social fabric . In 1890 , 28% of the country 's population lived within city limits . However , by the time 1930 rolled around , that percentage had doubled .

Thanks to better sanitation , health care and the effective health programs established by the government , Americans began to live longer . From 1900 to 1930 , the average life span of an American grew by a decade . It became the largest and most rapid increase in recorded history . The result of this growth was the creation of the actual Social Security Administration and Social Security Act in August of 1935 by President Roosevelt . <p> Those who initially benefited first were not minorities and women . Since the 1930 's were still a trying time for America concerning some issues , minorities and women were not allowed the benefits of Social Security , no matter how long the people worked or what jobs they had . Also , if a worker was employed in the area of nursing , teaching , agriculture , library services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital workers , social security would probably be denied as well . If a worker did not work full time or they worked intermittently , they were excluded as well . All in all , this meant that nearly half of all working Americans did not qualify for Social Security benefits . <p> For the first five years of the program ( until 1940 ) , the government paid Americans their benefits in one lump-sum payment . These payments were meant to help people by giving back some of the money they put into the system . Most of the people who received lump-sum payments were ones who would not be contributing long enough due to age or work reasons . The first ever check that was cut was for $0.17 . <p> President Roosevelt designed the CES , or Committee on Economic Security , which was designed of four parts .

Here are 6 damaging side effects of having bad credit . <p> 1 . Your Loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowers with poor credit as high risk , which means they 'll be less inclined to lend you the money you need . Whether you 're looking for a mortgage to buy a home , or a loan to finance a new car , you might find your loan applications being denied . <p> 2 . You 'll Be Subject to High Interest Rates <p> If you do get approved for a loan , you 'll most likely end up being stuck with a really high interest rate . Since lenders see people with a poor credit score as risky business , they 'll make you pay for it by attaching your loan with a sky-high interest rate . The higher your interest rate on your loan , the more you 'll be paying towards interest rather than the principle over the long run of your loan period . <p> 3 . You 'll Be Subject to Higher Insurance Premiums <p> Even insurance companies check background credit scores . Their claim is that poorer credit scores are associated with an increased number of claims filed . This theory prompts insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they find that you 've got a credit score that 's less-than-par , you 'll most likely be charged a higher premium , no matter how many claims you 've actually filed . <p> Do you know the ramifications of having a bad credit report ? <p> 4 . You Might Have a Tougher Time Landing a Job <p> Many jobs - especially ones in upper management or in the financial industry - have specific criteria that potential employees need to meet , including having a strong credit score . You might find it a lot more challenging to land the job you want because of your bad credit history , particularly if you 've got exorbitant debts amounts outstanding , or even a history of bankruptcy . <p> 5 . Starting Your Own Business Might Be a Challenge <p> Not only will finding a job be more difficult with a low credit score , but even starting your own business might be a challenge . Many new businesses need the assistance of a bank loan to get started . With a low credit score , banks will be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business idea is a great one . <p> 6 . You 'll Have a Harder Time Getting Approved for an Apartment <p> Even landlords check the credit history of potential tenants . If you 've got bad credit , the landlord might be less inclined to approve a lease , and will sign it over to a tenant with good credit instead . Landlords , much like insurance companies and banks , make the assumption that those with poorer credit are more likely to be delinquent on monthly payments , which puts them at a greater financial risk . <p> The consequences of having poor credit may be a lot more extensive than you may have thought .

@@11804640 @404640/ <h> The Best Resources on the History of Chinese Currency <p> When we think about money we think about paper bills , which are also called " bank notes , " and coins . We do n't usually think about leather money . The Chinese did , however , and designed the leather bank note in 118 B.C. Scholars believe this was the first bank note used by any nation , and it was made from white deerskin . Leather money was much larger than the paper money we are used to today . The Chinese cut the deerskin into 1 square-foot pieces . They also painted the edges of the currency with bright colors . The Chinese exchanged the leather currency for goods , beginning one of the earlier systems of commerce . <p> When studying the history of paper money , we also see that the Chinese were the first to introduce paper currency in 9th century . In fact , the Chinese used their paper currency for centuries before European nations began to accept the bank note . European history of paper money dates back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency in his writings . Despite its practicality " coinage was extremely heavy at that time and paper money was lighter and easier to carry " Europe did not formally adopt paper currency until 1661 , when the Bank of Sweden introduced the " Stockholms Banco . " <p> It is no surprise that the Chinese were the first to design and adopt the bank note . When studying the history of Chinese currency prior to leather money , we see that this nation has been using some form of currency for over 3,000 years . Some scholars even believe that Chinese currency dates back as far as 4,500 years ago " during the New Stone Age " when it first began trading goods for cowry shells . These small shells look almost like tiny eggs and are either white or come in a variety of colors and patterns . China was n't the only nation to use cowry shells for currency . Over the centuries , Africa , Australia and America have also used cowry shell currency . <p> Qin Shi Huang was the first Chinese emperor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign in 221 B.C. , and ruled over China until his death at the age of 49 in 210 B.C. During his dynasty , Huang implemented a uniform monetary system . He did away with all the types of currency that the Chinese were using up to that point and introduced the copper coin as China 's official currency . This paved the way for the leather and paper bank notes , which were used alongside the copper coins until the late 19th century when the yuan was introduced as China 's official currency . <p> Today , all nations use some form of paper bank note and/or coin currency . This is , in large part , due to the history of Chinese currency and its impact on the exchange of goods for money . China , itself , has three forms of active currency : the renminbi , Hong Kong dollar and Macanese pataca .

Earning Money And Making Money Are Different <p> When adults and teens learn that there is a big difference between " earning " money and " making " money , they get excited because they 've just learned there is an alternative to having a job for the rest of their lives . <p> The concept of making money often gets a bad rap because people sometimes associate making money with get-rich-quick or pyramid schemes . Making money , however , means something entirely different . <p> Let 's contrast making money with earning money to learn the difference and see why understanding that difference is so important when it comes to becoming financially free . <p> What it means to earn money <p> You earn money when you trade your time and energy for money . In other words , you work for an hour , you get paid for an hour . It does n't matter whether you 're being paid by the hour or you receive a monthly salary - you 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . <p> It 's important to remember that when you 're earning money , you are usually dependent upon some other entity - be it an individual , business , non-profit organization or government div - for the money that supports your lifestyle . Also remember that , generally speaking , your time and energy are finite resources . There are only 24 hours in a day and you only have so much physical and mental energy to go around . <p> An additional distinction is that when you earn money , you only get paid once for every hour you work . Remember this as we explore the idea of making money next . This is where it starts to get interesting ( and a whole lot more fun ) . <p> What it means to make money <p> Making money is when you use your own time and energy and a bit of creativity once , and get paid over and over and over again . Making money puts you in the driver 's seat . It allows you to be independent , not dependant on someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Making money can look like ... <p> Creating a new or improved product the market needs and wants that you can sell over and over again . <p> Writing a book and getting paid every time it sells , sometimes for the rest of your life . <p> Coming up with an invention that you sell or license to a person or company and for which you receive an ongoing royalty . <p> Writing a play that you license to a production company , who turns it into a TV show or movie . <p> Composing a jingle for a commercial where you get paid every time it plays . <p> Investing in rental properties and renting them out for more than the mortgage and other expenses . <p> Investing in a parking lot where you rent out the same spaces day after day after day . <p> Installing ATM machines in stores where you get a small percentage of every transaction . <p> Building an Internet marketing business that you put on autopilot that creates monthly income ( cash flow ) for you . <p> Investing in dividend-producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You get the idea . The point is that you do it once and get paid over and over and over for it . Some people refer to this as passive income as opposed to earned income , but anyone who has their money invested in an income-producing asset knows it 's rarely completely passive . There is usually some , or much , work that must be done to ensure that the asset continues to produce a regular income on which you can live . <p> Which comes first , earning money or making money ? <p> That depends on whether you believe in the saying , " It takes money to make money . " If you believe this , then you 're probably going to earn money first in order to invest it into the types of assets you choose to use to make money on a regular basis . <p> However , if you believe that it does n't always require your money to make money , you might be able to start making money right away by using what is referred to as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called leverage . <p> Lastly , sometimes it does n't take much money to create an income-producing asset . Sometimes we 're simply in the right place with the right idea surrounded by the right people and what happens seems easy and miraculous ... and maybe it is ! <p> Why is leverage so important ? <p> Leverage is when you utilize other people 's time , energy and money to make YOU money . And leverage is a great thing . It 's also how many financially free people get , and stay , financially free . <p> Using someone else 's money to make you money could look like : <p> Hiring a ghostwriter to write or help you write a book quicker than you might be able to do yourself . <p> Finding an inventor and creating a partnership where he/she invents and you market the inventions , or visa versa . Joint venturing is a wonderful way to start making money . <p> Taking your idea for a play to someone who is already a playwright but who has n't been successful financially yet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hiring someone to write music for you while you develop relationships with advertising companies looking for jingles . <p> Learning how to spot profitable real estate deals and then working with an investor who does n't have the knowledge or time to find the deals but does have the money for the down payment - and maybe borrowing the balance you need to buy the property from a lender . <p> Borrowing money for a piece of real estate from a bank or other investor to help you invest in cash-flow-producing real estate . <p> You get the idea . You do n't necessarily have to have all the money yourself in order to invest in an asset that is going to make you money on a regular basis . Quite often , it is nice when you control the whole process , but using leverage to partner with someone in the beginning of your making-money career can be a great way to get started . <p> So why is it so important to understand the difference between earning money and making money ? <p> Eventually , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your chosen lifestyle , you 're what we call " financially free . " At this point , it 's completely up to you to continue earning money ( i.e. , giving up your day job ) to live off the money you 're making . <p> You can also choose , like most financially-free people do , to continue building the amount of money you make so you can take this extra money and do a whole lot of good in the world . <p> While you 're at it , if you have children , make sure that you teach them these concepts while they 're young . It may just make the difference between having an adult child who creates a financially success life and one who , at some point , has to come live at home for awhile to get back on his or her feet . <p> What are you waiting for ?

Most people understand the importance of having good credit while others , such as college students and people who are just beginning their financial journey , may find themselves wondering what is a credit rating and why it is so important . A credit rating , or score , is a number that is used to determine to what degree a person is credit worthy . The score is determined by several factors that are evaluated and scored by a credit rating agency . This number appears on a person 's credit report and will indicate whether a person is a low or a high risk . A person with a high score is considered a low-risk and is more likely to be approved for loans , etc . A person with a low score is considered a high risk and is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-signer . Loans and credit are not the only reasons why it is important to have a high credit rating . Depending on where a person lives , his or her credit may also be used to determine insurance rates or as a determining factor when renting an apartment or a home . A poor credit rating can even threaten a person 's future by preventing him or her from being hired if potential employers perform credit checks . To keep one 's credit from slipping a person should understand what factors affect credit score ratings . These factors include paying bills on time , the amount owed on credit cards , loans , mortgages , etc. , and the length of one 's credit history .

@@11804647 @404647/ <p> More than 10,000 books have been written about personal finance . You could spend a lifetime reading them . Some of them are great1 ; others are 99% motivation , 1% actual , actionable information2 . The truth is personal finance is simple . Every one of these books can be reduced into three basic principles : <p> Spend less than you earn <p> Make the money you have work for you <p> Be prepared for the unexpected <p> While the principles might sound like common sense , the real trick is to truly understand them , and more importantly , to apply them . <p> Our Stance:Mint.com was founded to make personal finance simple , understandable , and ultimately life-enhancing . Money , after all , is a means to an end . Its a tool for doing more , and having more time . Its not just about increasing your net worth or saving for retirement . As we say at Mint , money is for living . <h> Spend Less Than You Earn <p> Put another way , " spend less than you earn " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't  get yourself into debt and start saving . Easy to say , not so easy to do especially given the appeal of a new car , a sweet home theater , a couple nights each week out with friends , and a posh tropical vacation every once in a while . <p> You have a job for a reason you want the good things life has to offer . You could forgo dining out for cooking at home , always buy generic , get your clothes on sale at the end of the season , and save a few dollars whenever possible . But really there are four big decisions that affect your expenses ( and therefore your ability to save for other things ) more than anything else . These are the areas where you need to go in understanding the costs involved , so that you come out remaining financially strong . <p> 1 . Buying a House <p> A house is likely the most expensive purchase you 'll ever make . And its not just the mortgage , its property taxes , home owners insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn . Too many people think that buying a home is automatically a good investment , since you 're " not throwing money away on rent . " <p> While owning a home of your own may be the American dream , it does n't  always make economic sense . If you live in California , the Northeast , or Southwest where housing prices have doubled or tripled in the last 10 years , its almost always better to rent and invest the difference ( more on this in principal #2 ) . <p> Even if you live outside those regions , if you move within the next five years ( and if you 're in your 20s that 's almost a certainty ) , the closing costs and 6% realtor fees will eat away your gains . By contrast , if you plan to stay in the same area indefinitely , a house may be one of the best investments you make . <p> To determine what 's right for you , I like the NY Times Rent vs . Buy Calculator . Its the best one on the web , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price to buy a comparable place3 . <p> 2 . Kids ( and when to have them ) <p> Children can be an amazing source of joy in your life . If you 're planning to have some , its important to realize the expense involved , so you can make the best decision on when to do so . Kids mean more money spent on a bigger house , a bigger car , food , clothes , healthcare , and education . The cost of raising a child calculator at BabyCenter does a good job of breaking things down by region and household income level . In todays dollars , most estimates approach $200,000 per child ( excluding college ) . That 's about $11,000 per year per child . <p> This cost can be lessened dramatically by waiting a few years . If you wait to have kids for 4 years , and instead invest that $11,000 per year at a 10% return , you would have $67,000 by time your child is born . As you begin to take $11,000 per year out for child-related expenses , part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years spent raising your child , you will expend only $100,000 out of pocket . Its like having a child at half the cost . <p> 3 . Where you live <p> You probably choose where to live based on job opportunities , proximity to family and friends , or a great climate . But where you live has a big impact on how much you can save . <p> For example , if you make $75,000 a year in Austin , you would need to make $135,000 in San Francisco to maintain your lifestyle . That 's an 80% increase in cost of living . Unfortunately , moving from Austin to San Francisco , salaries typically increase by only 30% . <p> To compare major cities , I like BankRates cost of moving calculator . It shows the difference in housing costs , doctors appointments , and even the cost of a haircut . <p> 4 . Car ( new or used ) <p> Automobile manufacturers and dealers spent more than $15 billion in 2007 to convince you to buy a new car4 . Seriously , that 's billion with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a 2009 Chevy Malibu because it will " only " cost $21,000 . Three years later , the car has depreciated by $8,000 and you 've paid more than $3,000 in finance charges a total expense of $11,000 . If you bought a used 2005 Malibu instead , depreciation and finance charges add to only $3,500 . That 's a $7,500 difference . You can see the calculation yourself at Edmunds . <p> Maybe you want something better than a Malibu . Buy a 2005 BMW 545i for $28,000 instead of the 2009 550i for $60,000 . It will cost $32,000 less to buy used , and youll save $25,000 in depreciation and finance charges over the next 3 years . Always buy used , even if only last years model ( I myself own a 94 and a 96 ) . Impressing the neighbors ( or the ladies ) with an ever so slightly better model probably is n't worth it . <h> Easy Ways to Maximize Your Savings <p> Beyond the " big four " financial decisions , there a few things everyone can do to maximize savings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle . <p> Get a credit card that pays you : <p> Always use a credit card instead of a debit card , checks or cash if you pay off your balance in full each month . A credit card gives you a 30-day interest free loan , more rewards , and in conjunction with a tool like Mint , better visibility into exactly where your money goes . <p> Turn the tables on your credit card company and make them pay you with a rewards card . Whether you opt for points , miles , or cash back is up to you , but do n't  settle for anything less than 1% back ( or 1 point or mile per dollar ) . <p> Usually , you can do much better . Discover- More Card with $50 Cash Back Bonus offers 5% cash back in categories like travel , home improvement stores , gas , restaurants , and groceries , and up to 1% on all other purchases . Capital One- No Hassle MilesG Rewards earns you 1.25 miles for every dollar spent on purchases . <p> The catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap on rewards . Keeping track of all the restrictions , and calculating whether its better to get cash back on restaurants or utilities is difficult . Fortunately , Mint does all that work for you . Based on your unique spending categories , Mint finds the card that maximizes your rewards . <p> If you carry a balance on your credit card , maximizing your rewards is secondary . Paying down your debt comes first . A $5,000 credit card bill paid off at a $100 minimum monthly payment takes 9 years to pay off . In that time , you will have spent $5,100 in interest charges alone ! You can do the calculation yourself at Yahoo Finance . <p> If you switch to a 0% introductory rate card ( and keep switching when the introductory rate expires ) , that $100 a month payment means you 'll be debt free in less than half the time . The Citi- Platinum Select- MasterCard- charges no interest on balance transfers for up to 18 months and has no annual fee . <p> Upgrade your bank account : <p> This year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion in fees5 . To add insult to injury , the average savings account pays you only 0.50% interest ( and most checking accounts earn no interest at all ) . <p> Banks work by accumulating deposits , then loaning that money out as a mortgage or to a business . Those loans are paid back at an interest rate that is typically around 5.00% 8.00% . If the average bank pays you only 0.50% , they 're taking that difference as profit profits that could go to you . Get a savings account from Ally Bank or Capital One that pays much more . <p> Better rates , better savings . Why settle for 0% from your checking or 0.50% from your savings ? When compared to an account at 0.50% , a savings of $20,000 in a 5.00% account can earn you an extra $1,000 per year ! <p> No one likes to overpay , but most of us do . Are you sure you 've got the best price for your internet , TV , or mobile phone service ? Probably not . New plans , equipment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest savings come from bundling multiple services together . By switching to Comcast or AT&amp;T you can get phone , TV and internet all for about $100 a month ( including taxes and fees ) . That can save an average household $300-$800 each year . <p> A dollar saved is many dollars earned : <p> Lower prices on everyday bills , a credit card that pays you , and a bank account that earns maximum interest add up . On Mint , we 've found that the average household can save nearly $1,800 each year . If you start when you 're 30 , investing that savings at a 10% return means $569,000 by age 65 . And that leads us to our next topic : the power of compound interest . <h> Takeaways : <p> Consciously weigh the financial impact of buying vs. renting , when to have kids , &amp; where you live . <p> Buy your cars used . <p> Get a credit card like Discover- More Card with $50 Cash Back Bonus or Capital One- No Hassle MilesG Rewards that pays you back with cash or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You <p> If you saved $10,000 a year for the next 40 years and earned no interest , you would have $400,000 . If you invested $10,000 a year and earned a 10% return each year , you would have $5,267,155 . Why the difference ? Because your interest earns interest , and its interest earns interest , and so on . The result is exponential growth . Remember calculus ? This time it actually works for you . <p> To obtain real wealth , you need to redeploy your money . And that means investment . Its how capitalism works . You can put your money into stocks where you own a part of a corporation ; bonds where you loan your money out and earn interest in return ; real estate ; or start your own business . Managing real estate can be a full time job , and owning your own business certainly is . Since both of these may require radical changes in life style , well ignore them to focus on investments open to everyone : stocks and bonds . <h> Stocks vs . Bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently and reliably outperformed bonds . Not counting inflation , stocks have averaged 10% a year ; and 14% for the past 20 years . Accounting for inflation , stocks have provided a " real " return of 7% annually , doubling their value every 7 years . By contrast , bonds have produced an average real return of 4.5% , doubling only every 16 years1 . <p> For money you need in the next four years , stocks may not be the right choice . In the short term , the market may swing widely up or down . You can lose money . In the long term , however , a portfolio weighted heavily in stocks has consistently outperformed one weighted towards bonds or other fixed-income investments ( such as CDs or money market funds ) . <p> Individual stocks are risky . Any one company might go out of business , suffer an accounting scandal , or miss their quarterly earnings . To distribute your risk ( or in investment terms " diversify your portfolio " ) , buy a mutual fund . But be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " vs. " indexed " . <p> Some mutual funds are actively managed by professionals . This active trading comes with a cost : management fees , administrative fees , and transaction costs can eat up to 2% of your investment each year . Active trading also means more taxes in the form of short term capital gains . Are they worth the cost ? Often , they 're not : 80% of mutual funds under-perform the S&amp;P 500 index . <p> You should also be aware that choosing the right mutual fund is nearly as hard as choosing the right stock . By contrast , index funds are " passive " these funds invest in specific set of stocks designed to simply mirror the market instead of trying to out-guess it . The result : fees at index funds like the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 are less than 0.20% annually . <h> Pay Yourself First : <p> You pay the government . You pay your rent ( or mortgage ) . You pay your bills . How about paying your ( future ) self for change ? They key is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to spend or even see the money . If your company has a 401k plan , start contributing . This money comes out of gross-pay and is not taxed . Even better , companies often " match " employee contributions . You put in $1 , they put in $1 ; its like doubling your money immediately . Even if you company matches only $0.50 to the dollar , that 's still an instant 50% return . <p> If your company does not have a 401k ( or you 've maxed it out ) , you can setup " automatic " investments with E*Trade , Fidelity , Vanguard , and most major brokerages . Each month , theyll take $1,000 from your checking account , and put it towards the investment ( hopefully an index fund ! ) of your choosing . <h> The Magic of Compound Interest : <p> The end result of automatic monthly investments : wealth that grows year after year . <p> Monthly Investment <p> Age <p> Total Invested to age 65 <p> 7% <p> 10% <p> 13% <p> $100 <p> 20 <p> $54,000 <p> $379,259 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $632,408 <p> $1,617,907 <p> 30 <p> $42,000 <p> $180,105 <p> $379,664 <p> $843,184 <p> 35 <p> $36,000 <p> $121,997 <p> $226,049 <p> $437,327 <p> 40 <p> $30,000 <p> $81,007 <p> $132,683 <p> $224,709 <p> $200 <p> 20 <p> $108,000 <p> $758,519 <p> $2,096,500 <p> $6,193,482 <p> 25 <p> $96,000 <p> $524,963 <p> $1,264,816 <p> $3,235,813 <p> 30 <p> $84,000 <p> $360,211 <p> $759,328 <p> $1,686,368 <p> 35 <p> $72,000 <p> $243,994 <p> $452,098 <p> $874,654 <p> 40 <p> $60,000 <p> $162,014 <p> $265,367 <p> $449,418 <p> $500 <p> 20 <p> $270,000 <p> $1,896,297 <p> $5,241,251 <p> $15,483,705 <p> 25 <p> $240,000 <p> $1,312,407 <p> $3,162,040 <p> $8,089,533 <p> 30 <p> $210,000 <p> $900,527 <p> $1,898,319 <p> $4,215,920 <p> 35 <p> $180,000 <p> $609,985 <p> $1,130,244 <p> $2,186,635 <p> 40 <p> $150,000 <p> $405,036 <p> $663,417 <p> $1,123,546 <p> $1,000 <p> 20 <p> $540,000 <p> $3,792,595 <p> $10,482,502 <p> $30,967,409 <p> 25 <p> $480,000 <p> $2,624,813 <p> $6,324,080 <p> $16,179,066 <p> 30 <p> $420,000 <p> $1,801,055 <p> $3,796,638 <p> $8,431,839 <p> 35 <p> $360,000 <p> $1,219,971 <p> $2,260,488 <p> $4,373,270 <p> 40 <p> $300,000 <p> $810,072 <p> $1,326,833 <p> $2,247,092 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be a millionaire ? Be wary of taxes . Instead of a 10% return , taxes knock it back to 7% . If you 're 30 , that means your $500 a month investment drops from $1,898,319 to $900,527 . But there is a way to avoid taxes ; its called an IRA ( Individual Retirement Account ) . <p> Like a 401k , an IRA allows your money to grow tax-free until you take it out for retirement . Unfortunately , if you need to money before retirement , you 'll be hit with penalties and be forced to pay the extra taxes . A better alternative , especially if you 're young , may be a Roth IRA . Contributions to a Roth IRA are made from after-tax income . As a result , you can withdraw your original contributions at any time , penalty and tax-free . By " avoiding taxes " and investing small amounts every month , anyone can achieve financial security . <h> Takeaways : <p> Weigh your long term portfolio heavily towards stocks . <p> For money needed in less than four years , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or CD . <h> Prepare for the Unexpected <p> The best laid financial plan can be quickly ruined by a streak of misfortune : job loss , fire , theft , or health problems . You need to protect yourself , but its not nearly as hard as you think . <h> Emergency Fund : <p> Without savings , living paycheck-to-paycheck leaves you vulnerable . You need a buffer , a way to get back on your feet if disaster strikes . Save enough for at least three months expenses . For most people , that should be $10,000-20,000 . This is savings separate and distinct from your vacation fund and your investments . Its your " open in case of emergencies only " fund . <p> Build your emergency fund . <p> Earn rates much higher than that of the national average .

And no , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are in life . Medical bills are cited in about half of all bankruptcies1 . And its no wonder . Break your leg rock-climbing and you could be stuck with a $5,000+ bill . If your company does n't  provide it , you need health insurance . <p> If you 're in your twenties or early thirties , choose an inexpensive plan with a high deductible . You want something to protect you from disaster , but without breaking the bank . In most states , you can find a plan with a $2-3,000 deductible for $50-100 per month . You may not have the prescription drug benefits , or the low co-pay of those $300 per month plans , but if you only go to the doctor once or twice a year , you 'll come out way ahead . <p> If you rent , you need renters insurance . Sadly , only about 33% of renters actually buy this coverage2 . Renters insurance protects you against fire , theft , and most natural disasters . Step back and think about how much it would cost to replace your computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you own . With renters insurance , you can get $20k in coverage for only $10-15 a month . Its dirt cheap and worth it . <p> Renters insurance also protects you outside your apartment . If your car window is smashed and someone grabs your laptop , your car insurance will only cover the window , not the laptop . A good $20,000 renters insurance policy would give you up to $2,000 to replace your loss . Keep in mind that roommates possessions are not covered ; your roommate needs a policy of his or her own . <p> Takeaways : <p> Save $10-20k in an emergency fund . Keep that fund in a high-yield savings account like Ally Bank or Capital One . <h> Financial Success in Three Steps : <p> We 've now reduced personal finance to three simple principles , and no more than a dozen action items .

Pay off your credit cards ( highest rate first ) <p> We 've already shown you that a $5,000 credit card bill paid off at $100 a month will take nine years and $5,100 in additional interest charges . If you 're paying 20% interest on credit card debt , action item number one is to pay it off before you do anything else . There 's no point investing your money at a 10-15% gain , when it could be used to avoid a 20% loss . <p> 3 . Setup automatic investments <p> The key to wealth is compound interest . Invest just $200 every month when you 're 25 and at a 10% return , you 'll have $1.2m by 65 . You 'll also have savings in case of emergency , money for your childrens college , and the ability to borrow from your investments for a down-payment on a house . <p> Not sure you can find $200 a month ?

If you 've never budgeted before , and have procrastinated up to this point because you 're not sure how or where to start , the following 4 tips can help . <p> 1 . Keep Things Uncomplicated <p> You might hate math , which is huge reason why budgeting just has n't made it to your to-do list . Although budgeting involves some level of mathematics , it does n't necessarily mean that you need to be a calculus professor in order to maintain a proper , working budget . Start off using a simple formula - your take-home pay minus your expenses ( including your mortgage/rent , car payments , utility bills , cable bills , and so forth ) . <p> The difference between the two is what you have leftover to spend on leisure expenses , such as dining out , going out to the movies , going on vacation , etc . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 've got to cut back on certain expenses in order to keep the number in the positives . Once you 've set this simple formula , you can break it down and elaborate on it as much as you want or need to . <p> 2 . Automatically Set Money Aside For Savings <p> Many people will come up with excuse after excuse as to why they did n't - or could n't - put a certain amount of money aside each month into a savings account . Whether they just did n't have any money left over to do it , or simply ' forgot ' to , many times the savings account is growing nothing but dust . Instead , set it and forget it . Have a portion of your pay check automatically deposited into an account that you do n't have to touch . If your employer offers a retirement savings plan , take advantage of it , and contribute to it as much as you can , especially if they match a percentage of your contribution . <p> 3 . Pay Your Bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , right ? Perhaps , but paying your bills in full and on time every single month will not only help you avoid those sky-high interest rates on outstanding debt , it will also help keep your credit score healthy . The lower your credit score , the harder it will be for you to get approved for loans , including mortgages , car loans , and so forth . Why waste money on late fees ? An easy way to counter this is to set up your bill accounts on auto-pay so there 's no need to remember when to make the payment , and for what bill . You may even consider trying out an account management tool that will remind you when you have a bill coming due soon . <p> Using a simple budget template can help make budgeting a cinch <p> 4 . Get an Accurate Idea of How Much You 're Spending Every Month <p> Without actually adding up every cent you spend on a monthly basis , it 's difficult to know exactly how much you 're actually spending . While you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're bringing in every month , determining how much you spend is a much more detailed endeavor . A quick way to determine this number is to keep every receipt and bill you get , and plug those numbers into a simple budget template on a spreadsheet . This will help you visualize everything you 're spending , and whether or not your income is able to cover it all . <p> The best - and easiest - way to keep your finances in order is to use a handy tool , like a simple budget template that can be found at Mint.com .

No matter how much debt you have or how little money you make , financial freedom is attainable for anyone , and these nine easy steps will help you get there . <p> - <p> 1 . Make a realistic budget <p> Making a budget is n't difficult , but it can seem daunting if your finances need a big overhaul and you 're desperately trying to build up your net worth . There are plenty of helpful- budgeting tools to get you on the right path , but the most important thing to remember is to make your budget realistic . When you 're trying to decide what to cut from your current spending , look for things you know you can live comfortably without . That means getting rid of your magazine subscriptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or anything else that 's more of a want than a need . <p> After you 've made those cuts , divide your income into three piles : one to pay your bills and basic necessities with , one for savings , and one just for fun . Too strict of a budget will drive you crazy , and the best way to maintain good financial habits is by rewarding yourself , even if it 's just with a fancy latte or new outfit from time to time . <p> 2 . Set specific savings goals <p> Even if you make the most amazing budget in the world , without setting any specific savings goals , the chances of you actually sticking to your budget are pretty slim . Do you want to save up to buy a home ? Pay down your student loan or credit card debt ? Quit your job so you can backpack around Southeast Asia for a year ? Whatever your goals are , give them price tags and deadlines to give your budget purpose and to keep you motivated . <p> 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online banking is that for almost everything , you can set it and forget it .

This will help reinforce the habit of paying yourself first , and will save you time and effort as well . <p> 4 . Spend with credit , not debit <p> Many people are wary of using credit cards since it can lead to hefty debts if not used responsibly , but not only are they generally more secure to use than debit cards , they can also make you money that you can put directly into savings . Depending on the cash back credit card you get , for every dollar you spend , you 'll get money back either directly onto your card or in cheque form . Now that 's just easy money ! <p> 5 .

Same with donating to charities , as long as you keep the receipts and the charity is government registered . <p> 6 . Know your worth and be paid for it <p> Although sometimes you might just be thankful to have a job , it 's important to know your worth and be paid accordingly . Do some research to see if you 're being paid the median salary for your current role , and if not , it might be time to ask for a raise or look for a new job that pays better .

Invest , invest , invest <p> Putting money into savings is important , but to make sure that money grows or even just maintains its worth over the years with inflation , you need to have an investment strategy .

@@11804658 @404658/ <h> Guide to the History of US Coinage <p> Everyday we use coins and we do n't even really think about how they evolved or where they came from . Occasionally though , we do look twice when we notice an older date imprinted on a coin . Unlike many older civilizations , US coinage only came about fairly recently during the late 1700s . Before that , people simply traded for goods , such as tobacco , with foreign coins . Of course , with the birth of a new country , it had to have its own unique currency . Let 's have a look at how coins in the United States evolved over the last few centuries . <p> Beginning of Coins in the U.S. <p> In 1792 , American Congress passed the country 's first coinage act . This meant that the United States Mint was officially responsible for creating coins for public use . Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were two of the men who contributed research and ideas towards the early versions of the coins . The Treasury Seal that was developed actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coin History <p> Today the word " dollar " is synonymous with American currency , but did you know that it is actually derived from a medieval European coin ? When masses of Dutch settlers moved over to the New World , they brought the concept of leeuwendalers , a Dutch coin , with them.The idea of US coinage by way of a dollar coin was developed to discourage people from trading with other foreign currencies . When U.S. coins were introduced , there was a transitional period of a few years before foreign coins were officially not recognized as legal tender any more . However , in the beginning the U.S. was experiencing a shortage of silver and gold ; both vital for coin production at the time . To get around this , the government declared that Spanish coins would indefinitely be legally recognized even though it was a foreign currency . By the mid-1800s , the Californian Gold Rush produced a sudden influx of gold , thus allowing the Spanish coin exception to be revoked . <p> Sacagawea History <p> The Sacagawea dollar coin was released by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same name . Sacagawea history is popular since she joined Lewis and Clark on their expedition as their guide . Together they explored massive amounts of unknown territory in the Western States . In those days , and to some extent even by today 's standards , it is a very impressive feat . The journey was difficult and dangerous ; at some point the group even resorted to consuming tallow candles when they lacked sufficient food . Pomp , the baby that appears on Sacagawea 's back , was the child that she had with her French husband , Toussaint Charbonneau . Sacagawea became so well known that she was later honored with statues in many different areas . The Sacagawea history coin named after her is a gold colored coin released intermittently between 2000 to the present . <p> Evolution of Coins Today <p> During the 1950s , a new act was issued to modify the metallic content of the coins .

Today in the U.S. , the Mint issues new coins fairly regularly . Occasionally special coins are issued as a commemorative or collector 's item .

Coin collecting is a major hobby in the United States and abroad . Many people enjoy collecting , cataloging , and studying historic American coins .

The same thing goes for e-books , MP3s , subscriptions to streaming sites , and the like . <p> The more you shop online , the more reliant you will become on cards in your everyday life . <p> ATM Fees Can Pile Up <p> Unless your bank 's ATM is everywhere , then you may often find yourself forced to withdraw your cash from the competition 's ATMs , which will cost you anywhere from $2-4 per pop . <p> This adds up to a ridiculously high amount , as it 's estimated that the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While not all of that amount is ATM-related , a large chunk of it is , and could easily be saved with the use of cards . <p> Smart Card Use Can Help You Build Your Credit Score <p> Finally , while cash is great , it does absolutely nothing to improve how companies and lenders look at you . Responsible credit card use , on the other hand , not only helps you purchase what you want and need , but helps build up your credit score . <p> There 's a good chance that not having using a card could negatively affect your credit score or nullify it altogether , since you 're not giving the credit agencies any information about your financial habits . <p> So get a card or two , use it when necessary , use cash every other time , and you should achieve a pleasant balance between the two that can only bode well for your fortune going forward . <p> Whether you use cash or plastic , Mint.com can help you budget every penny of your finances .

If you have already moved abroad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do this without delay . <p> The reason is that life insurance premiums are worked out taking into account a whole host of factors including age , health and where you live . Any changes to any of these factors could alter the premium , and omitting to notify your insurer of them could render a policy null and void . <p> Keep your loved ones protected in the event of your passing . <p> You May Need New Coverage <p> Becoming an expatriate can actually invalidate your coverage altogether , especially if you are moving from a low-risk country to somewhere considered to be high risk . Insurers will , unfortunately , use any excuse not to pay out , so it is essential to contact your insurer or broker and ask them to check your policy .

Life insurance coverage can be very reasonably priced , but it is important that it takes into account your unique circumstances , and this can make it complicated to set up .

If you are divorced , you may also have obligations from a former marriage to take into account . A professional financial advisor will be invaluable in guiding you through the life insurance minefield , reviewing your requirements and exploring the options available to you . <p> In Conclusion ... <p> It is also worth remembering that a move abroad will mean a change of domicile and of jurisdiction , which will have an effect on the laws governing succession in the event of your death . This could significantly affect the amount payable on your estate in inheritance tax , and life insurance coverage should be adjusted accordingly to take into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved ones from having to pay these .

In 2013 , the average tax refund was $2,744 . While we 're only human and most of us want to splurge a little with our refund , careful money management for the majority of your refund is a very smart financial move . Here are 10 smart ways to use this year 's tax refund . <p> 1 . Pay Down Existing Debt <p> The average interest rate on new credit cards is just over 15% , and many credit card rates charge even higher rates . Paying down credit card debt is one of the smartest money management moves for your tax refund . Paying down other debt , such as a car loan , is also smart . Just be sure your loan does n't impose early payment penalties . <p> 2 . Build Your Emergency Fund <p> Ideally , three to six months ' worth of income should be stashed in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much , any emergency fund is better than none . Open an emergency account if you do n't have one , and sock away at least part of your tax refund . You 'll be glad you did when the car breaks down or an unexpected medical expense occurs . <p> 3 . Fund Your Individual Retirement Account <p> Even if you have a 401K through work , you can open your own individual retirement account ( IRA ) . As long as you and your spouse together have a modified adjusted growth income of less than $181,000 , you can contribute up to $5,500 to a Roth IRA in 2014 , or $6,500 if you 're age 50 or older . This long term money management is something you 'll thank yourself for when you 're older . <p> 4 . Invest <p> So , you 're in a good place financially , with an emergency fund , a retirement fund , and little to no credit card debt . Maybe it 's time to open a brokerage account and start investing with your tax refund . Online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to The Motley Fool . <p> 5 . Consider Buying Flood Insurance or Increasing Liability Coverage <p> With less than $1,000 you can purchase flood insurance from the National Flood Insurance Program if you live in a low to medium risk area . For under $500 , you can buy an umbrella liability policy with $1 million in coverage beyond the limits of your car or homeowner 's insurance . Sometimes good money management means addressing the painful " what if " questions . <p> 6 . Start a Savings Account for Something Big <p> If you want a great vacation in 2014 , or have decided it 's time to get serious about saving up the down payment for a house , open an account just for these big expenses . Keeping the money separate from your regular bank accounts makes money management for major purchases easier and means you 're less likely to dip into it for splurges . <p> 7 . Make Home Improvements <p> For under $1,000 , you can make home improvements that will improve your daily quality of life . You could repaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a programmable thermostat , add new landscaping , or de-junk and organize your garage . Increasing the value and enjoyment of your home is smart long term money management . <p> 8 . Donate to Charity <p> Receiving your tax refund gives you a perfect opportunity to donate money to a cause that 's close to your heart . Be sure to save your receipts from donating , so you 'll have the proper documentation if you itemize your deductions next year . One important aspect of good money management is sharing some of your wealth with those less fortunate . <p> 9 . Replace an Inefficient Appliance <p> If you 're still using an old refrigerator or washer-dryer combo that 's energy inefficient , consider donating your old appliances to a charitable organization and buying a replacement that 's more energy efficient . You 'll enjoy a new appliance , and your utility bills could be lower as a result . Now that 's smart money management . <p> 10 . Invest in Yourself <p> Perhaps you 've wanted to take a college course or learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an investment in yourself . Learning a new skill that 's relevant to your job could aid your career , and learning a new home-based skill , like cooking , can lower bills and improve your quality of life . <p> Sure , you 've probably had your eye on a pair of shoes or a couple of console games for when your tax refund arrives . There 's nothing wrong with a treat , but beyond that , consider making your tax refund work for you and your family 's future through careful money management of the majority of your tax refund .

@@11804668 @404668/ <h> The Best Resources on the Equal Pay Act of 1963 <p> For many decades in the United States , women have struggled with equality issues . Men have often been treated as superior , leaving women to feel inferior and less important . This has occurred even in the workplace . The right for women to be able to vote was an example of a battle that was fought long and hard against the powers that be . As women evolved and their influence within the workplace grew , the need for women to take on the roles as an employee and not just a housewife also increased . With this influx of female workers also came the need for fair wages . Women often worked just as many hours as their male counterparts , but were not given equal pay for the level of work they were performing . This was commonly known as the gender pay gap . This form of discrimination became a common problem until the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was implemented . <p> Equal pay for women was an issue that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed into law by President John F Kennedy on June 10th , 1963 . The law states that there shall be no discrimination or bias between genders at any establishment where someone is employed , and that wages shall be equal or competitive as long as all employees perform the same or very similar skill sets of work within that establishment . In other words , equal pay for women who do the same level of work as men do . If a man is a police officer and must pass boot camp , and accept the risks that come with the job , and a woman within that same police department must do the same , both shall be paid the same wages upon beginning their position . In decades past , women who did a similar job may have been subject to lower wages , which is in essence , a form of gender based discrimination . <p> Women approached the government with a proposal that all workers , regardless of sex , should receive " equal pay for equal work . " There are many factors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genders equal pay . These factors include skill , effort , working conditions , and the particular establishment for which all parties work . This does not mean , however , that companies are restricted in giving some employees raises based on a job well done or time worked for the company , but they can not do so based on gender alone . This law helps to level the playing field and gives women and men an equal opportunity to achieve their career goals without the worry of being treated unfairly . <p> For more information on the gender pay gap issue and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 , please refer to the following websites :

Not only do prices determine the likelihood of purchase , but the way that you display your prices and whether or not you use price promotions ( sales promotions based on discounted prices ) can affect the loyalty of your customers . - <h> Paying Money Is a Risk <p> Customers are always trying to reduce their risks when they are faced with the need or desire to buy something . They are either concerned with spending too much money , or they are worried about getting the wrong product for their needs , regardless of the price . Little , if any , of this analysis is done by shoppers on the conscious level - almost all of our decisions to purchase a product or service are subconscious . <p> Prices and the way they are displayed are powerful triggers for this subconscious analysis . Customers look at a price and instantly decide whether or not to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The decision whether or not to buy is partly based upon the impact of the price on those self-regulated , internal values . <p> Some businesses respond to this issue with the use of price promotions . But this focuses solely on price , without realizing that it is just one part of the loyalty puzzle . Indeed , simply working out the amount of money to charge as part of a price promotion is a complex consideration in itself . This is because of the expectations people have about the prices offered by their favorite companies . - <h> Reference Pricing Is Key <p> One of the ways in which we all determine the expected price of an item is through a " reference price . " For instance , you might expect a car in your price bracket to be $20,000 . Therefore , you perceive $20,001 to be more expensive than your expected price and $19,999 to be cheaper . The instant you see the price , your brain determines whether or not it is less or more expensive than you imagined . Poorly considered price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat confused . <p> This example , where a customer has an expected price , is known as " internal reference pricing . " It is the kind of reference price that is " inside the head . " It comes from experience buying similar products in the past , discussions with friends and colleagues and our own thoughts and feelings based on expected value . <p> However , we can also determine our willingness to pay for something by using " external reference pricing . " This is where we compare the price offered to that of another supplier . Comparison shopping online , for instance , is based upon this kind of price analysis ; we check prices against those of another supplier and then make the decision whether or not to buy from our preferred company . - <h> Loyalty Is Partly Based on Reference Pricing <p> Customer loyalty appears to include reference pricing as a key component . We tend to be most loyal to companies that match price expectations . However , research from Syracuse University shows that it is external reference pricing that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people who are most loyal are the ones who know what your competitors are charging . Indeed , the study found that people who use internal reference pricing , the ones who have a " gut feeling " as to the price of something , are the ones who are least likely to remain loyal to a brand . That also suggests that simple price promotions would only appeal to people who are likely to be less loyal . <p> This finding also suggests that price displays on websites should include competitor pricing information . Show the price on your website and the price of your competitors , and you will encourage more , not less , loyalty to your business . That 's probably because of the impact of that subconscious analysis , too - showing your competitors ' prices let 's your customers know you are confident , which is bound to have an impact on their decision-making . <p> The point is , you ca n't rely on promoting your price against the competition . Loyalty is not just about the prices you charge .

Some ignore the household budget completely , and just hope for the best . <p> Whatever your finance style , there 's probably room for improvement . Some budget snafus wo n't lead to an outright disaster . But some mistakes can hurt you now , and even more as the years go by . <p> Here are the 6 Deadly Sins of personal finance , and how to repent : <p> Emergency Savings Should n't be Optional <p> You should be saving every month , but toward what ? Sarah Kaufman , for Motley Fool , lists no emergency fund as the #1 financial mistake . Emergency savings can be the difference between staying afloat or sinking under if a crisis hits . <p> Emergencies come in all shapes and sizes . It could be a job loss , a medical emergency where insurance does n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs thousands of dollars . Start an emergency savings fund now , if you have n't already . <p> Minimum Monthly Payments Equal Treading Water <p> The minimum monthly payment is just that -- the bare minimum . Minimums are not designed to help you make progress . They do , however , provide the company you owe with a tremendous amount of profit in the form of interest . <p> Whenever possible , pay more than the minimum required . This applies to your mortgage , credit cards , and any other debt that you 'd rather leave behind . Check for prepay penalties , which some mortgages have . And do n't forget to earmark the extra you pay each month so it will apply toward the principal . Otherwise , it might just go toward interest or the next month 's minimum payment . <p> The Credit Conundrum <p> You 'll read a lot of advice about avoiding debt , and getting out from under the debt you already have . But credit is also a good thing . The important part is striking a balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no debt , it also means you have no credit history . No credit history means your credit score might be just as poor as someone with excessive debt and years of late payments . Aim for some credit that you manage well .

In fact it might be , and that 's a good thing . You need years and years to save if you want to live comfortably when the time comes . <p> Retirement savings ca n't happen overnight , unless you inherit a windfall or win the lottery .

Their pictures earn them points and rewards , and their peers and mentors encourage their behavior with likes and comments . We have 12 weekly modules to encourage behaviors that align with our curriculum . <p> See , the problem with most youth financial education efforts is that they happen in the classroom , where none of a student 's financial decisions occur . Our program meets students where they are in the classroom , but really engages them in between class sessions so that they can learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage teachers who can better relate to the state that young people are in .

The second is that it 's not cool or appropriate or acceptable to talk about money in a constructive way - one that embraces possibilities and potential . In many families , money is so associated with greed , insecurity , and pain that it 's become a taboo subject .

And all too often , these factors do ruin lives and limit dreams . So let 's just get that out of the way . We 're never going to claim that financial education or mentorship is some kind of panacea to poverty . <p> What we do believe , however , is that every human being has unlimited potential inside of them ; and that with the right combination of experiences , friends , role models , knowledge , and tools , dreams are achievable .

Economic futureproofing . That 's what we 're in the business of . <p> What are some things that young people in particular should watch out for , including common mistakes or misconceptions ? <p> Vending machines .

The point is that you 're signaling to your employer that you CARE more than the other applicants . That 's what will get you the job . Stand out . Show that you care . Show that you get it . <p> How important is organization to getting and staying out of debt ? <p> Fairly important . But less important than you 'd think - only in the sense that getting and staying out of debt is n't as complicated as most people think . You do n't need to be an Excel wizard or have some crazy software program or pay a financial advisor a ton of money . You just need to know how much you owe , make sure you 've negotiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a monthly plan to pay it off . Using an app like Mint can really help , too .

After all , every ship has a crew . It 's good to make use of a financial advisor as a result . But navigating the Internet looking for sound financial advice can also be tricky . <p> Do n't worry , we 're here to help . Today we speak to Roger Wohlner , CFP , creator of The Chicago Financial Planner blog , where he writes about issues concerning financial planning , investments , and retirement plans . He is also a frequent contributor to US News . He is highly qualified and we thought a couple of questions would be fruitful . <p> Tell us a bit about who you are , your site , and why you do what you do . <p> I am a fee-only financial advisor who accepts no fees or commissions from any provider of financial products or services . I became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing and more importantly to provide my clients with the type of unbiased financial advice that is often lacking in the marketplace .

My writing focuses on what I do as a professional financial adviser like financial planning , investments and retirement plans . I try to share my insights and opinions in these areas as well as my thoughts on how investors should go about choosing a financial advisor . I try to help readers look beyond the hype that they see in the media and from financial services firms and focus on what is important in financial planning and investing . <p> How you encourage people to not feel overwhelmed about investing ? <p> The financial services industry tries awfully hard to make investing seem like something that is beyond the intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the professional , I attempt to explain investing and financial planning topics in a fashion that is easy for non-financially oriented readers to easily understand .

However , before investing it is a good idea to arm yourself with some degree of knowledge about investing and to formulate an investment strategy . <p> When do you advise we start investing ? <p> I suggest that folks start investing as soon as they can . Goals such as retirement require saving some large amounts of money and so the sooner you start the better shot you have at success . A good practice is to participate in your company 's 401(k) if they offer one and then add other investments as your income and budget permit . <p> How do you think tools like Mint help us to work with our money and put money towards investing ? <p> Mint and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial picture , helping them to control their budget and spending which often allows them to free up funds for investing . <p> How would you sum up your investment philosophy ? <p> My investment philosophy starts with a financial plan . Once an investor has a financial plan in place , this then logically leads to an investment allocation that is in line with the investor 's goals , their time frame for those goals , and their tolerance for risk . I believe in using asset allocation and rebalancing to that allocation once or twice per year . I focus in using mutual funds and ETFs , and a large portion of those investment vehicles tend to be index funds . <p> Can you recommend some great , easy-to-read books on investing ? <p> Most of what I read on investing tends to be articles and other materials on the web . <p> Is it ever too late to start saving for retirement ? <p> Today is the best day to start saving for retirement .

Kids pick up on whether you plan your shopping , put money into savings , or spend irresponsibly . At its most fundamental , teaching money management to children is about setting a good example . You should also take the time to help your children learn how to manage money with specific lessons . Here are 6 good money management lessons to teach your kids : <p> 1 . Start With Physical Currency , Then Teach About Banks <p> With younger children , physical currency is a great , tangible way to learn about money . Whether you teach them to put their coins in a piggy bank or keep paper money in designated envelopes , handling money demonstrates the basics of money management . As kids get older , around ages 9 to 12 , they are capable of learning about savings accounts and why they 're important . Kids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put into an interest-bearing bank account to get into the habit of saving money for later . High school students can learn to use representational currency , like debit cards , for money management . <p> 2 . Teach Kids About Saving , Sharing , and Spending with Allowance <p> Whether allowances are tied to chores is an individual decision for each family . One method that works well is to give kids a flat allowance in exchange for the basics expected of them ( like making their beds and feeding household pets ) , and giving them the opportunity to earn more with bigger chores ( like mowing the lawn or handling the family laundry ) . However you deal with allowances , you should emphasize that saving and sharing are just as important as spending . Kids can set aside money for saving and for charity in separate piggy banks or envelopes if they 're young , while older kids can use a bank account for setting aside portion of their allowance . <p> 3 . Help Kids Learn to Comparison Shop <p> Children in elementary school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you making a shopping list and looking at sales circulars in order to note where certain items cost less . Take your child grocery shopping with you and show how you compare brands to make your money buy more . When your child wants to buy something with her allowance or money she 's been saving , show her how to comparison shop with online sales circulars and by checking store websites for prices , so she can get the most for her money . <p> 4 . Encourage Older Kids to Earn Extra Money <p> Middle school-age kids may not be eligible to get a traditional job , but that does n't mean they do n't have opportunities to earn extra money . Here are some ways kids can earn a little extra : <p> Collecting recyclables and taking them to the recycling plant Organizing and setting up a family garage sale Doing yard work in summer , and snow shoveling in winter for neighbors Babysitting Doing housework for elderly or infirm neighbors Tutoring students who are struggling with academic subjects Pet sitting and dog walking <p> 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saving , and spending are important , so is helping out those less fortunate . Explain to your kids why you give money to charity and encourage them to give some of their allowance or other earnings to the less fortunate . Learn about what your child feels strongly about and show him ways to help . If he loves animals , for instance , help him raise money for a local animal shelter . If he 's especially fond of his grandparents or great grandparents , find out if he can help with your local Meals on Wheels program . Children should understand that giving of their time is an important way to help others when they do n't have a lot of money to donate . <p> 6 . Teach Kids About Credit in an Age-Appropriate Way <p> While your kindergarten student is n't ready to learn about credit cards and loans , you can still teach her the basics of " credit " with games like " the marshmallow test " that show the value of delayed gratification . When your middle schooler wants to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save up , or borrow the money from you - with interest and a loan due date . If she fails to pay you back on time , show her the consequences by adding a penalty cost . High school students are capable of understanding credit scores , and organizations like Credit Karma have credit report cards , which can help teens understand the importance of handling credit responsibly . <p> Sound money management is one of the most valuable life skills you can teach your children , and starting when they 're young is best . Demonstrating good money management yourself is extremely important , because kids are so good at absorbing what 's going on around them . Tailor your money management lessons to their age and maturity level , and you lay a solid foundation for good money management skills once they 're grown and out of the nest .

Either set up automatic payments for bills via your bank 's bill payment feature , or receive alerts and notifications directly to your smartphone . Most financial institutions have apps ; download the ones you use the most . <p> Still , some bills require payment each month , so why not do it as you 're eating your sandwich at lunch or waiting in line at the coffee shop .

Read on : <p> - <h> Tell us about Everplans . When and why did you start your business ? <p> We launched Everplans in the fall of 2012 . While I was planning my wedding , I used the myriad of wonderful online resources to help me , and began to wonder what was out there to guide me through the next major phases of life . Do n't ask why my brain went there -- I 'm not quite sure -- but I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , I started to become obsessed with what was out there for the less happy life stages ; namely , death and dying and planning . I was pretty surprised at what I found . There was practically nothing . <p> I mentioned the idea to a colleague , Adam Seifer , a fellow tech entrepreneur with deep experience building massive , viral , consumer-facing platforms ; and after further investigation , we realized there was in fact a huge hole here and we might be able to do something about it . We decided to take our passion and expertise and turn it towards an area that seemed so drastically left in the dust . <p> We began by offering content and resources at first . Our site has thousands of articles on it today ( anything from " How To Write a Will " to " How To Create a Digital Estate Plan " to " What To Wear To a Funeral " ) . But more importantly , we have a service that allows people to create , store and share all the most important information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to them . This includes wills , life insurance policies , health directives , and even online accounts and funeral and burial wishes . <p> The service launched in March of 2014 , and we now have thousands of people who have created plans on it . This January , we unveiled a new Enterprise platform for financial advisors , insurance professionals , estate attorneys and others who wish to offer this plan to their clients . It 's an innovative and more personalized way for these trusted experts to provide additional value to their clients , and a plan that goes way beyond the typical estate plan . <p> - <h> How does an Everplan work ? <p> It 's really simple . After you sign up for an account at www.everplans.com , you 'll get taken to your dashboard which outlines all of the important information you need to start working through . If you want , you can take a short assessment that will help our system personalize your experience . The dashboard is broken down into five easy-to-manage sections : Personal , Health , Financial/Legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want to complete in each section and start adding information immediately , or follow our suggested To-Dos . <p> After you populate your Everplan with your personal information , we urge users to invite " deputies . " Deputies are people you trust and are who you want to leave the information to . You get to pick and choose what bits of information you share and with whom . For example , you may want to share your entire plan with your spouse , but you may only want to share your financial and legal information with your financial advisor . We offer a free version of the Everplan , but the Premium version ( $75 per year ) offers a much more robust experience and enables members to upload actual scans of documents into their plans , invite an unlimited number of deputies , and more . <p> - <h> What do you think are the biggest challenges facing individuals making end-of-life plans ? <p> For so many people , this can be an overwhelming process , so we see the biggest challenge is quite simply just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers so many different entry points . From there , it 's all about keeping your plans up-to-date and readily available when you need them . You might have a life insurance policy , but if your beneficiaries do n't know it exists or where it is , they may never get the payout . You might never have created a will ; but if you do n't tell anyone , your family could spend countless hours searching for something that does n't exist . You may have even mentioned to someone at some point that you want to be cremated . But if you do n't make it clear , it might not happen . <p> By making it more straightforward and accounting for all the variables , we will eliminate all the challenges people cite for not planning . <p> - <h> Why do you think many of us avoid making these plans ? What 's the fallout of not having plans in place ? <p> People avoid planning because it 's often perceived as either too complicated or depressing . We 're here to debunk both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle it all at once , it can be overwhelming . We 're not saying it 's easy , or you wo n't have to make some tough decisions , because you will .

We also help navigate the more complex planning aspects , organize all the important things you need to accomplish , and make it an empowering experience . We know you do n't want to deal with it . So we 're dealing with it for you . And we promise it will make you feel so good once you do a plan . <p> What many people do n't realize is that if you do n't plan or share any of your decisions , then there actually is a plan in place for you .

And of course , families can be torn apart by a lack of planning . When children , health or money are involved , even the most rational among us can get rattled . However , you can avoid these nightmare scenarios by making all these decisions now so your family does n't have to . <p> - <h> What do you think are the most common oversights we make in end-of-life planning ? <p> The most common oversight is believing you have everything completely under control because you completed a few planning components .

Where do you keep that family favorite recipe ? These are just a few examples . We 've found that even the most prepared people can still leave a mess behind for their family . Our goal is to make that a thing of the past . <p> - <h> What 's the minimum planning you think everyone should do ? <p> It really depends on what stage of life you are in . <p> If you 're a new parent , naming a guardian for your child in your will and getting life insurance so that your family is taken care of if something happens is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make sure it 's protected , then creating trusts or naming a power of attorney are also important in addition to your will . <p> If you 're aging or have any specific health concerns , then specifying your medical decisions in an advance directive is the next step . <p> After any planning has been done , though , making sure it 's stored properly and shared with those who need to access it becomes just as important as the planning . <p> Everplans helps to identify your stage in life and find out what 's most important to you , and then our service prioritizes things for you and gives you an action plan that outlines step by step what you need to complete and how you can get it all done . <p> In addition to the legal documents , there are also practical and more emotional things you probably also want to pass down .

And nowhere is that truer these days than the banking industry , where top-down management and vertical silos have hampered innovation and new ways of thinking . <p> The organization was founded in order to bring together banking , design , and technology professionals and pave the future of how they serve their customers . <p> " Like healthcare and education , banking is something we all have a vested interest in , and yet the industry at its core is not well positioned to adapt to the changing consumer needs and behaviors , " Rob says . " I see that as a huge opportunity for everyone in the industry to try things in new ways . It 's not just that we want to be innovative - we have to !

The industry was dominated and decided by senior bankers with traditional mindsets . <p> Next Bank was born to give a genuinely democratic , accessible , and creative platform for everyone to participate . It started with events and has led to wider community formats and people connecting in various ways . We want to change banking for the better through design , innovation , and entrepreneurship . <p> So how does banking relate to technology and design ? Where do these topics intersect ? <p> Historically , technology has played a very central role in the ways bank operate and in the future will become almost the core capability in many banks . Adding design to the mix now creates a powerful combination of digital and data technologies with customer-centric methodologies that really test the way we 've always done things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and experiment , without fear of failure or consequence , and it also helps make banking simpler and , possibly , just a little bit more pleasant . <p> What are the most exciting trends and innovations in the banking industry today ? Why do they excite you ? <p> The most exciting trends and innovations in banking are multi-lateral - there are exciting new and simpler ways to pay , better and more insightful ways to manage money , and there are new sources of funding that might not be the typical way . Beyond the customer experience , there are really interesting new ways for bankers to run their businesses , make better decisions , and be more customer focused . Most of these new trends focus around the power of data and how it 's gathered , analyzed , and presented . I 'm also excited by the diversity of the world 's banking industry , particularly those in emerging markets , where innovation contextual to their locations makes for great approaches and outcomes . <p> What are consumers demanding from their banks today ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than ever , are demanding that their needs be heard and met . Many other industries do this well already , and the consumer now expects that of us , too . They 're demanding more personalization , better service that really solves problems , and channel experiences that are not just adequate , but potentially beautiful as well . Many banks are now scrambling to employ the talent and resources to understand customers better and design solutions directly against these needs . Recently adopted methodologies such as Design Thinking , Human-Centered Design , User Experience Design , Jobs to Be Done , and Lean Startup are all being employed at banks to produce better , faster outcomes . <p> What sorts of traditional banking practices would you like to see evolve ? <p> I 'd love to see some of the senior management practices change . Whilst many " manufacturing " and experience development practices are learning from outside industries or banking leaders , there is still a strong hierarchical or top-down leadership approach that I fear closes the door on too many opportunities .

What lessons did you learn ? <p> The 2008 crisis really sent a wave of newfound lack of trust across the industry . It also made many governments and regulators question their role , and gave many a startup or innovator a real boost of opportunity . The lasting impact here will be that banks may still hold the core license to bank , but they are now a legitimate target of the entrepreneur and sometimes the customer , too .

You 're not alone : giving gifts for big life occasions can be tricky for anyone . <p> The traditional guideline for wedding gifts is that if you 're invited , you should send a gift whether or not you attend . There is no " correct " amount of money to spend on a wedding gift . The amount should be guided by your closeness to the couple , and your budget . Here is some guidance for choosing and giving wedding gifts . <h> The " Cover Your Plate " Guideline <p> Youve probably heard this " rule . " When people do n't  know how much to spend , they may gauge it based on how much the couple is spending per guest. - This is not a hard and fast rule , so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't  buy birthday gifts based on the value of the cake you expect , and its not your job to match your gift to the bride and grooms wedding budget . Choose the most generous gift you can afford that you will feel comfortable giving . <h> Dollar Figures <p> Here are some- rough guidelines- for how much to spend on wedding gifts , but keep in mind that there are exceptions : <p> Wedding of a close relative or close friend : $100 to $200 <p> Wedding of the typical friend or relative : around $100 <p> Wedding of a work colleague or boss : $75 to $100 <p> Wedding of a neighbor or acquaintance : $50 to $75 <p> Think of these figures as a starting point , and use other factors to fine-tune your wedding gift budget . <h> Registries <p> When a registry consists of a range of gifts in a range of prices , it makes your job as a wedding guest much easier . Registering online is a common practice now , and that simplifies things further . If you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register at retailers ranging from Walmart to Tiffany &amp; Co. , so you 'll have plenty of choices and will worry less about gift duplication . You do n't  have to use the gift registry , but if you want to go off-registry , its still a good idea to look over the sites the couple is registered on for ideas . <h> Giving Money <p> There 's nothing wrong with giving money as a wedding gift . As with gifts , how much you give depends on your relationship with the couple and your budget . You can use the gift guideline dollar figures above as a starting point . If you 're bringing a " plus one " to the wedding , consider bumping up the dollar figure a bit . <p> Typically , you 'll want to hand cash gifts to a close family member , such as a parent of the bride or groom .

However , you 're not relieved of your obligation to give a gift . Destination weddings can be expensive for guests , and most couples understand that you 've already spent a lot getting there .

In 2015 , you have many more options , and peer-to-peer lending is proving to be an attractive choice for many borrowers looking for a good deal " plus individual lenders looking for an investment option .

We have the scoop for you . <h> What is peer-to-peer lending ? <p> Peer-to-peer ( P2P ) lending marketplaces offer loans outside of traditional banks by using algorithms that match borrowers with investors according to each partys requirements .

@@11804687 @404687/ <p> When you sat down with your high school guidance counselor to pick your career , chances are " small business owner " was n't even an option . <p> This is true despite the fact that , according to Forbes , 75% of all businesses in America do n't have any employees apart from the owners . These nonemployers ( or solopreneurs , as Dequiana Jackson puts it below ) , grossed $989.6 billion in 2011 in the United States alone . With the uncertainty of the regular economy , the prevalence of home-based businesses , and the availability of work due to the Internet , this figure is bound to increase . <p> Dequiana Jackson has always been passionate about small business , from selling candy and friendship bracelets at 8 , to starting her first solopreneur venture at 23 as a single mother . Her passion for business and learning took her to one of the nation 's leading business schools , but she has remained committed to small businesses and the spirit of entrepreneurship . She shares her passion , extensive knowledge , and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment to talk to us about her website , her business background , and what she anticipates for the near future of entrepeneurship . <p> How did Entrepreneur Resources get started ? What differentiates you from the other financial websites out there ? <p> I started Entrepreneur Resources in December 2005 when I was attending my first year at the University of Chicago 's Booth School of Business . <p> Growing up , my family encouraged me to go to school , get a " good job " and work until I retired . While that was great for them , it was n't the path I wanted to follow , and I knew there had to be others out there who felt the same way as me . I know I was blessed with the opportunity to learn from some of the best business minds in the world at U of C , and I wanted the blog to be a platform where I could share that knowledge with current and aspiring small business owners . I wanted them to know that entrepreneurship is a viable career option . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ websites because we recognize that being a small business owner does n't mean your financial needs are the same . We aim to provide information that targets small business owners in a variety of situations : working full-time with a business on the side and a family to take care of , working as a single solopreneur , looking for capital to fund a new venture , or working as a business owner with employees . <p> Can you tell us a bit about your personal background and how it has led into writing for small businesses ? <p> The majority of my background is in small business . In fact , I 've loved it my whole life . As a child , I sold friendship bracelets , snacks and greeting cards to classmates and neighbors . I started my first company as a solopreneur and mom at 23 . Though I had the skill and the passion , I did not have a clue about marketing . It took me 6 months to land my first client ! Luckily , I was accepted to a great business school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company a success . Now I share those same strategies on the blog . <p> I 've always loved writing , too . I have kept a journal since I was 8 years old , but it was my high school English teacher , Mrs. Barshes , who really honed my skills . She stressed adding structure to my writing and drilled into us that a first draft is never a final draft . We edited everything , even A papers . I hated it then , but I appreciate all of her lessons now . When I started the blog back in 2005 , I was excited to be able to combine these passions as a small business writer . <p> Entrepreneur Resources is specifically designed for small business owners . What are some issues that are specific for entrepreneurs that you have written about ? <p> Working as an entrepreneur is very different from working as an employee . A few of the things you need to look out for are n't even specifically business-related : lack of time management , isolation and burnout . <p> As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boss that you must meet . You know you 'll be in the office Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. , and you set the appropriate pace to get things done . You also know that you might get reprimanded if you miss one deadline and fired if you miss too many . <p> As an entrepreneur , on the other hand , you control your own time . In fact , many of the deadlines you set will be artificial with no immediate consequence . <p> Say your company 's website needs an overhaul , for example . You want to get it done in 30 days , but if you do n't finish , there 's no one over your shoulder scolding you for not completing it . Instead , you have to set mini-goals and stick to them -like Day 1 , hire a web designer ; Day 10 , finish all web copy ; Day 15 , approve design ; Day 30 , final approval and launch . <p> Isolation is also something entrepreneurs deal with , especially if they work from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office full of coworkers to being by yourself during the work week . Sometimes all you need is a change of venue . Take your laptop to the library or local coffee shop and work there . Schedule lunch with a friend ; and most importantly , expand your network to include other entrepreneurs . They 'll know what you 're going through and can help you beat the isolation . <p> Lastly , entrepreneurs can suffer from burnout . Most employees have the benefit of shutting things down at the end of the day . Weekends are great because they can leave work at the office and not pick it back up again until Monday . Not so for the entrepreneur . If you 're working on something you 're passionate about , it 's hard to wind down . I know there are many weekends that I worked straight through . It felt good at the time , but eventually fatigue crept up on me . Now , I advise entrepreneurs to schedule office hours and stick to them . I tell them the work will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you decide to take a vacation . This is also why we write about outsourcing and having proper systems in place on the blog . It 's about working smarter . <p> You also offer marketing coaching services for women entrepreneurs . First of all , what are some of the areas that you coach your clients in ? Secondly , what are some issues that women entrepreneurs specifically have to deal with ? <p> Though I am a marketing coach , many of my coaching sessions start with lessons on having the proper mindset for entrepreneurial success . There is a lot of mind clutter my clients need to get through before they even implement any marketing strategies - things like " Do I deserve to have success in business ? " or " Why would anybody pay me for this ? " I 've learned that when my clients do n't feel they deserve something , they sabotage themselves . It ends up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy . <p> For example , if they do n't believe anyone will pay them for their knowledge , they 'll charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , they really wo n't get paid much for what they know . Once we work together and the mind clutter is gone , we dive straight into marketing and branding fundamentals : getting to know your target consumer , understanding how your product/service fixes a problem , branding yourself and your company , creating multiple streams of income , utilizing systems and making sure you have an actual marketing and promotion plan that matches your brand . <p> Many women entrepreneurs are faced with a choice between focusing on their careers and focusing on their family . The choice does n't have to be mutually exclusive , but it takes proper planning and support to be successful at both . If you have a big client meeting and your child 's dance recital is happening at the same time , there will need to be a tradeoff . I 've coached women on figuring out what was most important to them and structuring their business around that . <p> Having a proper support system of family , friends and other entrepreneurs is important . Also , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , you sometimes have to limit your exposure to those negative people or cut them off entirely . Some married clients have also had to deal with an unsupportive spouse . Their husbands did n't believe entrepreneurship was a viable career option . In those instances , my clients would have to build their businesses slowly and prove themselves , in a sense , before their husbands were on board . <p> Starting one 's own business is increasingly becoming an accepted path , where once it was considered unrealistic . What are some reasons why entrepreneurship is gaining traction in your experience ? What are a couple of pointers you might have for people who are starting their own business for the first time in 2015 ? <p> I believe one reason entrepreneurship is gaining traction as an accepted career path is because of all the media attention it 's gotten over the past few years . There are now entire shows dedicated to helping entrepreneurs be more successful like Hotel Impossible , Restaurant Stakeout and Bar Rescue . Each show focuses on how to turn around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always take the expert 's advice , viewers can glean some great information . The businesses profiled are from all over the country , giving viewers a sense that " if these people can do it , I can do it , too . " Shark Tank is also a great show because you get into the minds of investors and learn what really makes a large company viable . <p> For people who are starting their own business for the first time in 2015 , I would first tell them to make sure they have a business idea with a large enough market that wants to buy it . Every great idea is n't meant to be a business . I would also advise them to think about financing . Getting money from family and friends is n't an option for every entrepreneur , so they 'll need to work a full or part-time job and save money while also growing their business on the side . I would also tell new business owners to surround themselves with a good team . Even if you 're in business by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisors and subcontractors to help you along the way . <p> You have a section on your website for resources for small business owners . What are a couple of your favorite apps and websites for different areas of business ? <p> My email inbox seems to always need cleaning , and I just found a website that will help . Unroll.me is a service that uses your email address to help find all the mailing lists you 've used that address to subscribe through . Then you can scroll through the list and easily unsubscribe to what you do n't want . <p> Mint.com is great for monitoring personal cash flow . All the information is put in one place so you can get a full picture of your income and expenses . I think it 's a great reality check , especially if you 're looking to save money or eradicate debt . It 's hard to focus on running a company when you 're worried about how you 're going to pay your electricity bill . Knowing where you 're spending money and what you can cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free tool I use is Google Alerts . Once set up , Google sends me regular emails whenever my name , my blog 's name or my company 's name appears in online media . I 've also done regular searches with some of the popular search engines , like Google , Yahoo and Bing . I search for my name in quotes to find out the latest buzz . <p> You also have a section for Marketing on your website . Can you give us a couple quick pointers for people who are just starting to spread the word on their business for the first time ? Can you speak briefly about dividing one 's time between business and advertising ? <p> If you 're just starting to spread the word on your business , you first have to know your target customers inside out . Who are they , and what problem is your business solving for them ? Please do n't fall into the " my business is for everyone " trap . Not everyone will want what you have , and even if they did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to or manufacture products for that many people . G <p> Once you know your target customer and their buying habits , design campaigns to put your company in front of them at the right time . Speak their language and speak to the benefits they 'll gain from trying your product or service instead of a competitor 's . <p> Also think about marketing as a comprehensive plan to get your business into the minds of your target consumers rather than an afterthought . It 's not just putting together a Facebook ad campaign or running a coupon in the local paper a couple times a year . I encourage entrepreneurs to create a yearly marketing calendar listing all their proposed activities and campaigns . This is what most large corporations do to ensure they 're covered throughout the year . It should include the products you want to focus on during a particular season , how you will promote it , how long you 'll promote it and how you 'll measure success . Set goals for each campaign and measure afterwards to know what worked and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars wisely . <p> If you put your plans in motion ahead of time , you wo n't be left scrambling to pull something together each month . This also leaves you more time to work on other aspects of your business , like creating new products and services , hiring employees or attending networking events . <p> You wrote a post recently with some tips for optimizing your business in the New Year . What are a couple of things people can do to grow their business ? Do you have any advice on expanding or raising awareness , while still taking care of the business you already have established ? <p> To grow your business , you can either sell to new customers or get your current customers to buy more from you . As entrepreneurs , the tendency can be to gain market share by new customer acquisition and spend little time thinking about existing customers . This is the wrong approach . <p> People buy from those they know , like and trust .

Instead , keep in touch with these customers via a mailing list and social media . Send tokens of appreciation like coupons or company swag once in a while .

Often , this advice is given to people who find themselves in varying levels of hardship . As a result , they are almost forced to create a budget so that they can make ends meet . <p> However , crafting a budget and sticking to it is n't just for people who 've run into hard times . A budget is a stress reducer . <p> Here are 5 ways that making a budget can ease financial stress : <p> 1 . A Budget Can Help You Build Savings <p> Without the benchmark established by a budget , it 's tempting for some people to spend money that they have . They see the money in their checking account as " available " and decide to use it to buy the latest digital tablet or eat out a nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment expense , but it will also , if followed , keep discretionary expenses from getting out of hand . As a result , you 'll end up with a cash surplus at the end of every month . That money can be used to help build savings , and savings will provide financial peace of mind . <p> 2 . A Budget Forces You to Look for Ways to Save Money <p> The great thing about a budget is that it shows you , at a bird's-eye view , your monthly income and expenses . You can use that information as an incentive to look for opportunities to save money . <p> You might be tempted to simply look for expense items that can be eliminated . While that 's a great start , it 's also important to find ways to reduce the expenses of items that you ca n't immediately cut . For example , you might consider contacting your credit card company to have your interest rate lowered . <p> 3 . A Budget Will Help You Meet Long-Term Financial Goals <p> What are your long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your 50 's ? Do you want a sports car as a means of handling your mid-life crisis ? <p> With a budget , you know how much money you have left over at the end of every month and you can determine how much money you 'd like to put into savings for early retirement or the purchase of a big-ticket item at some point in the future . <p> If you 're in a lot of debt , then creating a budget that itemizes responsible debt service can help give you peace of mind . If you 're interested in getting out of debt fast , then you 'll need to make payments in excess of the minimum ( especially for credit cards ) every month . Fortunately , a good budget can show you exactly how much you can afford in monthly debt payments . <p> 5 . A Budget Helps Build Self-Discipline <p> When you decide to start living within the confines of a budget , you might find that it is challenging at first . However , once you 've taken the first steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a habit of spending less . That , in the long run , will lead to more cash in your pocket and a greater peace of mind . <p> Making a budget takes just a little bit of your time .

The response ? The hardest lesson was overcoming difficult situations and learning how to accept full responsibility for failure . <p> The key to overcoming this is to recognize and accept your mistakes and then learn as much as you can from the experiences to move on and improve . <p> " It 's applicable to investing , but maybe even more so in everyday life ! " IB says . <p> Here , IB discusses everything from how the blogger got interested in investing to better understanding investment principals to why the blogger wants to be more like Warren Buffett . Read on : <p> Can you tell us the story behind The Investment Blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture and share some of my thoughts and experiences on investing and personal finance . <p> Over time the blog focused on investing rather than personal finance , as it 's my area of interest and expertise . I feel that it also helps to fill a void . There are a lot great of personal finance blogs out there , but far fewer blogs that talk about investing . <p> In my articles , I usually talk about the concepts , thought processes and methods that I 've used successfully in investing , hoping that I can help other investors achieve similar successes . <p> I also found that I actually enjoy writing about investing , but I 'm not making it a career . It 's a hobby and an outlet for me to help people see what they are n't seeing or think in a way they are n't thinking . <p> How did you become so passionate about investing ? <p> There are two things , really . The first is that I love learning about the world around us and how it works . Investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially when learning about specific businesses and the industries they operate in . <p> The second goes a bit deeper and is more personal . People often talk about investing as a way to build wealth . But that 's more of a mechanical byproduct of investing , not an end goal . The real importance is that the results of investing give you freedom and choices in life , and I believe that 's worth being passionate about ! <p> You write that you want to be Warren Buffett ... what 's been your strategy for realizing that goal ? <p> I admire Warren Buffett , but I would n't want to be him exactly ( the billionaire CEO of a giant conglomerate ) . I would like to be like him in terms of being a savvy and skilled investor . Over the years , I also came to admire his attitude in life , and the very respectful way in which he treats other people , regardless of their social status . I also admire his polymath business partner Charlie Munger and his " worldly wisdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . They both share their valuable knowledge openly and freely . <p> My strategy for realizing the investing aspect is to not only learn how Buffett and Munger select investments , but also to understand their larger thought process . That way , I can consistently make smart decisions in both business and life . My strategy for the second part is emulating their attitude and mindset . <p> What have been some of your favorite resources for learning about investing ? <p> My favorite resource has been Buffett 's writings ( reports and letters to shareholders , Op Ed pieces , etc . ) . They are a rich treasure trove of practical business lessons and investment specific advice . It 's really tough to find material that is better than this collection . They are free and available on Berkshire 's website . <p> Another favorite resource has been business books , often those written by entrepreneurial CEOs . <p> I also like listening to conference calls , as they are extremely insightful . Often , management talks about the intricate details of their businesses , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment principles you think all new investors should be aware of ? <p> All investors should be aware of and understand the concepts of value , investment risk and margin of safety . <p> Value is the real worth of something . For stocks it 's the value of the entire business , not the selling price . People understand this concept when they go shopping , but not when they buy investments . <p> Investment risk is the possibility of losing your investment principal . But this is often confused with volatility and the movement of prices or the market . <p> Margin of safety is how much room you have for error when analyzing investment opportunities . <p> I have n't found a better detailed explanation of these concepts than in the classic book The Intelligent Investor , by Benjamin Graham ( Buffett 's teacher ) . <p> What are the most common misconceptions or myths about investing that you hear ? Can you set the record straight on them ? <p> I often hear people say that you need a lot of money in order to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the real barrier to investing . You need knowledge , and a little bit of money . Knowledge is what allows you to grow a little bit of money into a large amount of money . <p> Another myth is diversification . Conventional wisdom has taught people that you should use broad portfolio diversification in order to reduce risk . However , as we saw during the recent financial crisis , a well-diversified portfolio consisting of stocks in many industries and sectors , as well as government and corporate bonds , did not protect the investor from declining prices . They all declined in unison . The only real way to reduce risk is to increase your knowledge ! <p> What are some good habits you think any smart investor should get into ? <p> Some good habits for any smart investor are continual learning , independent thinking , **25;31;TOOLONG , emotional self-control , patience and discipline . I think if an investor can cover these , they 'll be in great shape . <p> What are your favorite types of investments ? <p> My favorite type of investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the major North American stock exchanges , there is such a wide variety to choose from . This also means there are many opportunities for mispricing . With stocks there is a low barrier to entry . You do n't need a lot of capital to get started , and it 's easy to learn how to invest in them . They also allow you to own a slice of some of the greatest businesses in the world ! <p> Although stocks are my favorite , that is n't to say that they are the best type of investment . I do n't think there is a type that will be the best in all situations or for all time periods . But with stocks you can find good opportunities in both bull and bear markets . <p> When should someone enlist the help of a financial professional when investing ? What should they look for in an advisor ? <p> That 's a very tough question . I believe everyone should take on the role of investing their own assets , but it 's also very difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is someone who can help to fill in the knowledge gaps that you might have . If someone is to enlist the help of an advisor at the beginning , they should look for one who is interested in the longer-term focus of helping you learn how to invest , rather than selling you financial products . <p> For those who may have a lot of difficulty investing on their own due to health reasons or other limitations , they should still look for an advisor who has the attitude of trying to help you learn . These types of advisors will usually have your best interests in mind , but also be competent enough to help you . <p> If someone is enlisting the help of a professional money manager , they should look for a manager who only gets paid when they make money , not when they do n't . I only think it 's fair that there be some form of direct responsibility for the investment decisions made .

A job loss can be upsetting , or it can be financially devastating . It depends on how well you 've prepared for that unexpected blow . <p> One thing you never want to face during unemployment is withdrawing money from your 401k , or anything else that 's presumably growing until you retire . These often carry a hefty penalty for early withdrawal , and they put you behind on two fronts . You 'll have less for retirement , plus you 'll pay the fees . What you need are emergency funds . <p> Savings come in several forms , including retirement , smaller goal-oriented savings , large purchase savings , and emergency funds . Your emergency savings help you navigate around potential disaster if you 're suddenly laid off . <p> Determine How Much You 'll Need <p> At one time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's no longer the case . Many financial experts now suggest 6 or even 9 months worth of living expenses are needed to offset the loss of income . That might seem like an enormous goal , but with longer average periods of unemployment , less than 6 months of savings might not be enough . <p> When calculating how much you 'll need , do n't plan for just your largest bills . You 'll need enough to cover mortgage or rent and vehicle payments , but you 'll also need to pay utilities , credit cards , insurance , and buy groceries . Everything that 's in your normal budget should be considered . Estimate a bit higher than your average monthly expenses , and you 'll have fewer worries about falling short . <p> Get Started Sooner , Not Later <p> Job security is a thing of the past .

If you can set aside more than that , all the better . <p> A budget app let 's you monitor savings . <p> You Can Survive Unemployment <p> Managing finances through a period of unemployment is challenging , even with emergency savings . Each time you withdraw money to pay expenses , your cushion gets smaller and smaller . Unemployment benefits help reduce your dependency on savings , but they are temporary . The amount you can receive varies by state , and it 's usually a fraction of your normal paycheck . <p> If your job loss is long-term or permanent , your state may help you train for a different line of work . For example , Washington state offers a program called Worker Retraining , which pays tuition for training unemployed or dislocated workers who receive unemployment benefits . Information about programs in your state are available through the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor and Workforce Development . <p> Unemployment can happen to anyone at any time , and you wo n't always know in advance . Going from two incomes to one , or from one income to none , can create financial problems that remain long after you 're employed again . <p> Prepare for that unexpected event by setting up an emergency savings account now .

Be open to discussion ; this is n't a lecture , but an opportunity to work together . <p> Who 's the Boss , Anyway ? <p> Be sure that your money worries are real , and not based on an unrealistic idea of who has the right to do what . Some money problems emerge when there 's an income imbalance . When one spouse earns significantly more than the other , someone could feel left out .

It only makes sense that both partners share in its creation and implementation .

@@11804695 @404695/ <h> Expert Interview with Tom Copeland on the Business of At-Home Daycares for Mint <p> In 2011 , 32.7 million U.S. children spent time in childcare regularly while their parents worked or spent time outside the home ; 13 percent of preschoolers were cared for by non-relatives ( not including organized daycare facilities ) , according to the- U.S. Census Bureau . <p> These non-relatives are often friends or neighbors who love children and open up their homes to provide a safe environment for parents to leave their kids . And while they might be great at supervising youngsters , these at-home providers do n't always excel at the non-kid-related parts of their job . <p> " Unfortunately , many providers do n't understand that there is a business side to childcare , " says Tom Copeland . " They do n't realize that failing to pay attention to this will cost them later in time and money . " <p> Tom is a consultant , trainer , author and advocate for the business of family childcare . <p> He has several recommendations for new providers : <p> Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written contract with parents that requires them to pay at least one week advance and pay for the last two weeks of care in advance . <p> Identify at least three benefits of their program they can use to promote their business to parents . <p> Track all the meals/snacks they serve each day . <p> Record carefully for two months all of the hours they work in their home after the daycare children are gone . <p> We recently checked in with Tom , who offered his insight and advice on at-home providers and what they can do to manage their businesses better . Here 's what he had to say : <p> I started it in September 2010 after I left a childcare agency I had worked for 28 years . I wanted to continue my national work helping family childcare providers with the business side of their work , but I needed to create an independent presence on the Internet . So , I hired a social media consultant and launched my blog . <p> The purpose of my blog is to provide a comprehensive resource on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of articles , posted an insurance and tax preparer directory , linked to every IRS document dealing with family childcare and much more . I make myself available to answer business questions at no cost ( tomcopeland@live.com ) . I 've been conducting workshops , seminars and webinars across the country for the past 30 years , and my goal is to help make family childcare providers become more successful as a business . <p> How did you become interested in helping family childcare providers ? <p> My lifelong interest has been in writing , speaking and communicating . I happened upon the family childcare field and decided to apply myself when I saw how much providers needed business assistance . Family childcare providers go into business because they love children . Financial reasons are secondary . Most providers know little about the business side of their work and are appreciative of my work to help them . I enjoy helping providers who work so hard for so little financial reward . <p> How common are family childcare providers today compared with 10 years ago ? Are there any challenges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There has been a decline in the number of state licensed family childcare providers over the past 10 years . At the same time , there has been an increase in the number of unregulated caregivers working out of their home . Competition from commercial childcare centers has also increased . <p> Today , family childcare providers face multiple challenges : low payments from state-subsidized childcare make it difficult to make a living caring for low-income families ; lack of business skills ( marketing , record keeping , budgeting , etc. ) makes is hard for some providers to compete against childcare centers ( who have more financial resources ) and against unregulated caregivers ( who charge less ) . <p> What are the advantages of being a childcare provider ? <p> The ability to be at home caring for their own children ; the ability to be their own boss and create their own career ; and most importantly , the opportunity to help young children grow and learn . Providers are proud to be making a positive impact on the lives of young children . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your home ? <p> Isolation , frustration with parents who do n't appreciate the hard work they do , low pay and no benefits . <p> Providers work an average of 11 hours a day , five days a week caring for children . They work an additional 13 hours a week , on average , on business activities in their home ( cleaning , activity preparation , record keeping , etc . ) . <p> Many low-income parents ca n't afford the cost of high-quality childcare and states do not provide enough subsidy to adequately reward many providers . Even middle-class families find childcare to be expensive , yet many providers make less than minimum wage ( after subtracting their many business expenses ) . <p> What are the most common concerns or questions your readers come to you with ? <p> The most common questions I receive are about record keeping and taxes : <p> What can I deduct ? <p> Should I file quarterly estimated taxes ? <p> Over how many years should I depreciate my fence ? <p> What do I do when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What should I do when I disagree with my tax preparer ? <p> I also handle many questions about contracts with parents ( A parent left owing me money , now what ? ) , marketing ( How do I compete against a childcare center ? ) , legal and insurance issues ( What should I do when a parent shows up without a car seat ? ) , money management and retirement ( Where can I get a loan to refinance my home ? ) . <p> What about legal basics that these business owners should be aware of ? <p> The vast majority of providers should operate a sole proprietor ( also known as self-employed ) . The only time providers should consider the other alternatives of a partnership or corporation is if they have a ton of personal assets , do n't mind doing additional record keeping and plan to be in business for many years . Because this is decision is complicated , I strongly recommend providers consult with both an attorney and tax preparer who is familiar with their business before taking this step . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a provider purchasing an adequate amount of business liability insurance ( with coverage of $1 million per occurrence and $2 million aggregate ) . <p> What are your favorite **35;58;TOOLONG that you recommend to providers ? <p> All providers should join the- Child and Adult Care Food Program . This program provides reimbursements for serving nutritious food to children , and providers can expect to receive either $550 or $1,140 a year per child . <p> What do you think is a good routine providers get into for managing their finances ? How often should they be dealing with the money side ( daily/weekly/monthly ) ? What sorts of numbers should they look at ? <p> The last thing most providers want to do is record keeping or managing their finances ! There is no one way to do this . I recommend providers review their records at least monthly to be sure they have tracked : attendance records , payments received , miles driven , hours worked and receipts saved . <p> It 's easier to reconstruct records at the end of the month rather than the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the financial benefits of doing so are lower taxes and the ability to meet financial goals . <p> I greatly appreciate the work that family childcare providers do .

Our work focuses on prevention and intervention , arming young people with the life skills to live independently , tackle debt , form positive habits like saving , and examine their behaviours and relationship with money . <p> We also focus on giving young people a tangible enterprise experience with real interest-free loans , ethical products and market challenges that bring business to life . MyBnk places a high priority on equipping young people with employability skills : forming business plans , forecasting sales , calculating profit/income and analyzing risk and rewards using SWOT analysis . <p> - <h> Why are you so passionate about educating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young people fulfilling their potential . To give them the best chance possible of achieving this , it is important that they are equipped with all the necessary skills and knowledge in order to make informed decisions in their life . I believe financial education is key to this . <p> " Money does not equal happiness " is true to an extent ! But if your basic needs are not being met , if you want to live independently or start your own business , financial capability matters . Having a positive relationship with money also directly correlates with good mental health , general well-being and resilience . <p> There are also the facts on the ground , the need is still there . Also , who is going to teach young people these skills ? A traditional view is still held by many that it is the job of parents or peers to teach these lessons and instill prudent values ; and that young people should learn the hard way , like I did . However , with U.K. personal debt standing at -1.4 trillion and a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddle through like we may have done so in the past . <p> I 'm also passionate about what works . Despite the huge achievement of getting financial education on the national curriculum , there is no extra funding for teacher training in this niche area , those over 16 will miss out on these lessons , and academies and free schools can opt out . What class time there is will be limited . This need for expertise in order to maximize the impact was picked up by the think tank Centre for Social Justice 's " Restoring the Balance " report , which strongly recommended the Government fund and instruct schools to bring in experts from the third sector to deliver money lessons . <p> - <h> What areas do you think young people are often most confused or frustrated about when it comes to money management ? <p> We 've noticed that a lot of frustration comes with simply not knowing what terms like APR or AER mean . They see advertisements for Wonga and insurance , yet ca n't grasp the consequences of bad decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with money after making an uninformed decision . Trust is an issue . <p> - <h> Beyond personal finance , why do you like to focus on entrepreneurship ? <p> We see enterprise as a catalyst for financial education and gaining employabilty skills . Young people are increasingly rejecting the traditional route of working for someone else and are drawn to being entrepreneurs . If as a country , we are to train , attract and harness this trend , we shall need to better equip our young people with the appropriate financial skills . <p> Despite record numbers of young people starting their own businesses , fewer than 4 percent go on to create a company that pays a wage or makes a profit . Youth unemployment and long-term joblessness is still stubbornly high . Initiatives to counter this , like Start-up Loans and the New Enterprise Allowance , work best when young entrepreneurs ' skills are developed earlier . Our real , structured and tangible education experiences increase young people 's workforce potential , including exploring entrepreneurship as a route into work . The ability to assess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal skills such as leadership , communication and problem-solving . <p> - <h> What has excited you or surprised you the most while educating young people about money ? <p> You 'd be amazed at the conversations something like tax , insurance or the minimum wage can kick off in a classroom ! Young people are energized by money ; it already plays a big role in their lives and they want to know how to control it . One thing that never ceases to blow me away is their reaction to investment and moneymaking . The entrepreneurial spirit comes natural to them ; it 's up to us to harness it . <p> - <h> What methods have you found work the best when talking to youth about money ? How do you wow them ? <p> Budgeting , costing structures , taxes - they can be ... well , boring ! That is why our mission is to bring financial education and enterprise to life for young people . Our motto is " every young person must be wowed ! " How do you make learning about interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the heart of it . <p> MyBnk are often a young person 's first exposure to these topics , and we know first impressions last ; this is why we build programs with young people themselves via our Youth Advisory Panel . Our YAP is made up of 11 to 25 year olds who take an active role in co-creating programs . They advise us on what and how they want to learn . <p> We take a holistic approach to education , catering to audio , visual and kinaesthetic learners with many extensions and ability variations . Using real-life case studies , colorful resources , games , videos and links to popular culture , we enable young people to gain practical skills like budgeting and explore and form their own opinions regarding their relationship with money and enterprise . When working with vulnerable young people , we combine activities with discussions , personal experiences and story sharing . Some of these young people have low self-confidence around money management and lack the " soft skills " needed for enterprise , so our programs challenge negative attitudes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> - <h> What methods seem to fall flat ? <p> A PowerPoint style , click-through , sit down , blah blah blah is not going to get a 35 year old engaged , let alone a 13-year-old boy . You have to make the subject matter relevant to their lives . <p> - <h> What are some of your favorite tools or resources ( books , blogs , websites , publications , etc. ) for understanding and managing money ? <p> The Money Advice Service is a great go-to site for all the latest calculators and walk-through guides to making important decisions like , your first car or life events like losing a losing a job . Moneywise produce a fantastic money manual ; and as always , quantitative easing only seems to make sense if you 've read it on the BBC website ! 
@@11804705 @404705/ <h> Expert Interview with Joseph Sangl on Getting Out of Debt <p> Eight years ago , Joseph Sangl was broke , with an average of about four dollars in his bank account . Being broke was threatening to tear his life and relationships apart , and Sangl resolved to do something about it . <p> Fast forward to today , and not only is Joseph Sangl no longer broke and still married , but he has become a respected financial advisor . He shares his experience , strength , hope , and financial guidance in his business I Was Broke . Now I 'm Not .. <p> Joseph Sangl talked to us about how he saved his marriage and tattered finances , and how anyone else can follow in his footsteps . <p> - <h> Can you talk about how you got started writing about finances ? How has your life changed because of it ? <p> I got started after I experienced a massive turnaround in my own personal finances . I was so excited about the results that I could not stop talking about it . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I saw it as a great way to begin to share my experience and help others experience the same financial freedom . <p> - <h> You wrote a book called I Was Broke . Now I 'm Not . First of all , were you broke , and how did you change that ? Secondly , can you give us a brief overview of what 's in the book ? <p> I was broke . My bank balance literally averaged $4.13 . I was contributing money to my retirement account , but every dollar that came home was in serious danger of being immediately spent . My turning point came when I changed employers in December 2002 . I somehow forgot the fact that your previous employer will stop paying you when you leave them ! I did not know my new employer 's pay schedule . I had saved zero money . And it was Christmas ! As a result , I made the poor financial decision to run up my credit cards again to fund basic living expenses and Christmas gifts . At that moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I prepared a realistic budget for the first time and actually followed it . This simple act literally changed our financial future . It became our habit to plan our finances every month BEFORE the month began , and we agreed to follow the plan . In 14 months , we paid off all of our non-house debt ( including student loans , our truck , and credit cards ) . In 10 years and 1 month , we paid off our house when I was 38 years old . During that time , we 've also been able to start a business ( named I Was Broke . Now I 'm Not. ) and purchase another business . <p> I Was Broke . Now I 'm Not . chronicles our family 's journey in the first three chapters . We then provide a " financial roadmap " of our journey that others can use to prioritize their next financial steps . I call this the " I Was Broke . Now I 'm Not . Ladder . " The rest of the book is focused on equipping individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , debt elimination , investing , and insurance . Managing money is far simpler than most people make it out to be , and it was my goal to demonstrate this in the book . <p> - <h> You 've also got three free new eBooks coming out soon about managing finances as a single parent or as part of a married couple . What are some things that normal people can be doing to get their finances under control ? What are some non-physical effects that an out-of-control budget can have ? <p> eBooks are awesome because they can be hyper-focused on a particular topic . During financial coaching sessions , I always begin with this question : " What are your plans , hopes , and dreams ? " I start here because I believe we should allow these plans , hopes , and dreams to inform our money decisions - not the other way around . Most people are stuck in the " my finances are horrible so what 's the point of dreaming " mode . Once they have documented several of their life goals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget is key to maximizing money and ensuring progress toward the funding of a dream . <p> A person with out-of-control finances experiences more stress . Studies have shown them to be less productive at work . They also have to spend extra time and money " fixing " financial mistakes - like shelling out late payment fees or spending time in conversations with creditors . They are far less likely to accomplish their plans , hopes , and dreams . Even more , they may give up entirely on dreaming and attempt to " just get by . " Life is too short to live this way - plus , we only get one life ! <p> Out of control finances can also damage relationships . I commonly see relationships between spouses destroyed by financial mismanagement or financial infidelity ( hiding spending or debt from their spouse ) . It is also common to see parent-child , sibling-sibling , and friendships destroyed because of a person 's financial instability and poor decisions . <p> It is common for a person with out of control finances to believe that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to work more hours or get a second job . This costs them time and energy and can really have a negative effect on their family - particularly when they are married and have children . <p> - <h> It is your mission " to help people accomplish far more than they ever thought possible with their personal finances . " How do you help them do that , and what have been some success stories you 've had ? <p> I believe most people are one or two key decisions away from completely changing their financial future . However , most people do not wake up saying , " Yes ! I get to budget today . " or " I 'm so excited to speak with my insurance agent today ! " Every day , I attempt to help people see that money management does not have to be scary , and in fact , it can be a lot of fun . We provide over 100 free financial tools through our website . I 've also provide practical personal finance tips and stories via my blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping young people win with money ( What Everyone Should Know About Money Before They Enter The Real World ) and another book focused on investing and the importance of diversification ( Oxen : The Key To An Abundant Harvest ) . I also speak on the topic at churches , businesses , and conferences nearly 120 times a year throughout the United States and Canada . I have also developed a 12-month intensive financial training course called the " I Was Broke . Now I 'm Not . Core Coaching Program " that allows our teaching to go to a much deeper level than a book or speaking event could go . <p> We have too many success stories to count ! Mark had $85K in non-house debt when he and his wife met with me for financial coaching in 2006 . In less than three years , they paid off all of this debt . In fact , their church did a great video story on their journey . <p> We also ask people call us when they become debt-free and shout WOOO-HOOO into the phone . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we celebrate knowing it is a real reminder of the impact we are having on people 's lives . <p> Everyone should know that WRITTEN plans , hopes and dreams are much more likely to happen than those that are UNWRITTEN . They should also know that PLANNED money accomplishes far more than UNPLANNED money . Every young person should clearly know how compound interest works . They should also go to college for the job they want , not because they love the school . It is important for them to graduate in four years for a four-year degree ( not five or six ) not only because of the increased costs of additional years of education , but also the income lost by not being able to work . <p> One specific challenge young people face today is competition for employment from experienced employees who lost employment during The Great Recession . Many young people are also strapped with student loan debt that will accompany them for the next 20 years or longer . <p> Many young people are not taught about money management by their parents or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the real world " having little knowledge of budgeting , credit scores , investing , insurance , or taxes . This puts them at a great financial disadvantage . <p> - <h> How has writing about money and teaching other people affected the way you approach your own finances ? <p> It has brought great clarity to my own personal financial management . The hundreds of thousands of people I have taught also bring an enormous amount of accountability ! <p> - <h> You offer individual financial counseling as well . What are some of the things that you go over with people during a consultation ? <p> About 75 percent of our meetings are focused on helping them prepare a budget and calculating their debt freedom date - the time it will take for them to become debt-free - with and without their home mortgage eliminated . The other 25 percent is a mix of crisis management ( lost job , overwhelming bills , pending divorce , etc. ) and longer-term planning ( pre-marital financial coaching , investing , insurance , etc . ) <h> What are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help them save money and get out of debt ? How possible is it to enjoy yourself while doing so ? <p> Use cash for " impulsive " spending categories like food ( groceries &amp; dining out ) , clothing , entertainment , and spending money . The principle goes like this : ( 1 ) Plan your spending BEFORE the month begins , ( 2 ) When paid , pull cash out of the bank for these " impulsive " categories , ( 3 ) Only use cash for these spending categories ( no debit or credit card ) , ( 4 ) When the money is gone , the spending is over until your cash is replenished with the next budget/payday . This principle prevents overspending , which is very common in these categories . <p> Another great tip is , for a given amount of time ( not forever ) , eliminate a daily expense - like coffee , a newspaper , or lunch at a restaurant every day ( pack a lunch ) . Or eliminate a monthly expense for a period of time like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper/magazine subscription . <p> It is actually a liberating experience to do this ! I canceled cable TV and discovered there were people in my house ! And we actually talked to each other ! It really revealed the amount of time we were wasting on non-shared activities . <p> And I can say without reservation that the results have been truly amazing . Being able to eliminate all non-house debt and paying off the house by age 38 have positioned us to prosper like we 've never dreamed . <p> - <h> What have been some of the most memorable moments of your financial career ? Do you ever get to hear how you have helped improved people 's lives ? <p> Paying off my credit card and realizing they owed me 26 cents ! Paying of all of our non-house debt in February 2004 .

@@11804706 @404706/ <h> 9 Effective Ways to Accurately Keep Tabs on Your Finances <p> Keeping track of all your money these days can be a big headache . On average , we hold 15 different financial accounts , according to financial technology company Personal Capital . <p> Although many new products and services have sprouted up over the years promising to simplify the process , getting started can be daunting . So here are nine effective ( and efficient ) ways to accurately keep tabs on your finances . <p> 1 ) Your Bank 's Online Banking Service <p> Almost every bank and credit union offers online banking to help you keep track of your transactions and balances . More sophisticated banks will offer budgeting , alerting , and mapping tools to help you understand where you money is coming from and how you 're spending it . <p> Using these money management tools can be a great place to start for most people . While some banks will allow you to pull in data from other financial institutions , these management tools are most effective if you hold all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank instead . <p> Over the past few years , over-the-top banking services , like Simple , have sprung up on the banking scene . They offer very sophisticated transaction tracking , budging and spending management tools . You get a bank account , a debit card , a web dashboard and a mobile app at your disposal . Think of it as an Internet bank on steroids . They oftentimes have lower fees , 24-hour customer service and other benefits . <p> The downside is that you have to shift away from using a traditional bank and all of the benefits they offer , such as physical presence , cash transaction handling and local employees . And although your money is FDIC insured , these types of companies do n't actually hold a bank charter . Instead , they have a silent partner bank that holds your money and takes care of the back-end operational requirements . <p> There are tens of millions of Americans who can not or choose not to hold a bank account , unflatteringly referred to as the unbanked or underbanked . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sound enticing : low fees , easy reload convenience , money management tools ( sometimes ) and a plastic debit card you can use to shop in-store and online with . <p> However , these services are not a true replacement for a regular bank account .

You can only spend as much money as you decide to load on there . <p> Verdict : Stay awayGetting Started : EasyEffectiveness : Not really <p> 4 ) Online Financial Management Tools <p> There are dozens of financial management tools online that promise to simplify tracking your finances .

The data you provide could be used to market products back to you . For example , if you carry a high cash balance in your checking account , the service may recommend that you open a savings account with a " trusted partner , " from which they are earning a referral fee from . Additionally , some services may sell your data to marketers outright . <p> There 's really only one piece of desktop-based financial management software left on the market that 's worth considering : Quicken . This product , made by Intuit , has been available for many years . But it was created for an era where online banking did n't exist . <p> Their tools to analyze your spending , savings and balances are robust . But you only get out what you put in .

You 're solely responsible for inputting data , updating numbers , tracking changes and other tasks . There 's little to no automation here , except when you download pre-made Excel templates with embedded macros . <p> Verdict : A big task to keep updated in the long run ; avoid unless you know what you 're doingGetting Started : EasyEffectiveness : Depends on how much work you put into it <p> 7 ) Pen &amp; Paper <p> Another brute-force way to track your money is by writing down your transactions and balances .

@@11804708 @404708/ <p> Toronto 's real estate market is booming despite the fact that they have more demand than houses , a fact which helps to keep home prices high - sometimes unreasonably so . While a trusted real estate expert is always a good idea , when trying to move to a new city or upgrade your living situation where you currently dwell in Toronto 's diverse and shifting marketplace , expert guidance is practically mandatory . <p> John Pasalis gave us a behind-the-scenes glimpse into Toronto 's many different neighborhoods - what 's hot , and what 's not - and also provided some insights on distorted facts and figures , which will help the savvy investor to find the best imaginable deal . - <h> A recent exclusive piece for The Globe And Mail by Realosophy Realty Inc . Brokerage showed an increase of 8% increase in sales price and a 6% increase in sales from last year . First of all , what are some reasons for the increase ? How is the housing market in Toronto these days ? <p> The main driver behind Toronto 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for houses . The Greater Toronto Area ( GTA ) has roughly 100,000 new people moving into the city every year , but we are not building enough houses to keep up with the demand . This imbalance is greatest for low rise houses ( detached , semi-detached ) since only 1/3 of all new homes completed each year are low rise houses as opposed to condominiums ( condos ) which currently dominate the new construction market . <p> The relative increase in condo stock is in part due to governmental policy to promote high density building ( for example , through the Places to Grow Act ) , but land scarcity is probably the key driver of why developers have n't built more houses . While the building of condos has successfully introduced more options into the housing market ( particularly as our rental housing stock had n't increased since the 1960s ) , when it comes to houses , there just is n't enough supply to meet consumer demand in that segment of the market . - <h> The most drastic reduction in sales price I noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from last year . What are some other areas that have been experiencing some strong fluctuations ? Are there are any neighborhoods that might be particularly good for people looking to get into the Toronto area ? <p> It 's important to take all short-term real estate stats with a grain of salt . The strong fluctuations we see in some areas are typically driven by one of two factors . In the case of Rural Whitby , because very few houses sell there each year , one very high end sale in 2014 was able to significantly skew the average price . In areas that have a mix of houses and condos , if more condos sell in the current year compared to last year , this will typically pull the average price down because condos are generally less expensive than houses . <p> Toronto has undergone substantial revitalization at the neighborhood level over the past decade that has resulted in a number of lower-priced but attractive options opening up across the GTA . For starter homes , I like Woodbine Heights , Wallace Emerson and Oakwood Vaughan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs , and if so , what are some reasons for that ? How easy is it to commute into Toronto proper from the suburbs ? Is the Toronto area a car-centric culture , or is it friendlier to mass transit ? <p> We generally mean two things by the term " suburbs " in Toronto . One is the " inner suburbs : " areas that were formally amalgamated into the City of Toronto over 15 years ago which have already seen an increase in home prices , particularly in neighborhoods along our North-South and East-West subway lines . These areas combine the ease of family living ( detached houses , bigger lots ) with urban amenities such as the subway ( the fastest mode of public transit within Toronto ) . <p> We 've also seen an increase in demand in Toronto 's outer suburbs , which are the towns and cities lying adjacent to the west , north and east ( comprising the Greater Toronto Area or GTA ) ; and again , this is mainly because home prices in Toronto and its inner suburbs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their search to include the outer suburbs . As the average price for a home in Toronto compared to the suburbs widens , the suburbs will offer buyers more value than they did ten years ago . You will find substantially bigger houses on larger lots then you would find in Toronto . And I should say that for some buyers , there is a consumer preference for the newer-built houses and wider roads of the suburbs than the older houses and crowded street parking typical of Toronto proper . <p> Commuting to downtown Toronto from a suburb is relatively easy provided you live close to a GO station , Toronto 's intercity commuter rail . But the GO takes commuters to and from one main location downtown , Union Station ; so getting from your suburban home to anywhere else in Toronto ( or anywhere else in the suburbs ) is not easy , making the car the dominant mode of transport in the suburbs . The provincial government has set up an agency called Metrolinx to improve on this , and local governments are making their own efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to making public transit a more viable option in the suburbs . - <h> Some reports say that homes from the ' 80s and ' 90s tend to stay on the market longer , since they 're not old enough to seem vintage but not new enough to seem modern . Is this true in your experience ? Is this something people could keep an eye on if looking for a bargain in the Toronto area ? <p> We definitely see homes built in the 1980s staying on the market longer than average , in particular in older Toronto neighborhoods . Many buyers looking to buy in the city like the architecture and design of the century old houses in many downtown neighborhoods . The few houses downtown that were built in the 1980s are more reminiscent of the type of home that one might find in the suburbs , which is not what many downtown buyers are looking for . <p> For those whose preferences are not as fixed , I do suggest that buyers who want a larger detached house will find more value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in TheStar.com lists five things real estate agents might not tell you . In your experience , what are some things a real estate agent might withhold ? And can you give an example or two of what the right questions to ask might be ? <p> The best question a home buyer can ask their agent is , " What can you tell me about this home that is not in the MLS listing ? " The MLS ( Multiple Listing Service ) and its associated website , realtor.ca , is simply an advertising platform for home sellers ( and their agents ) ; yet most home buyers and their agents simply rely on whatever information the seller 's agent is advertising about a home ( known as a listing ) . When you are a buyer , your own agent should be doing research about the home you 're considering buying , including researching the ownership and previous sales history , verifying whether the parking advertised is legal , checking to see if the recent renovation to the home is legal , advising on the quality of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the difference between buying a great house or a future money pit . - <h> In another recent post for The Star , they posted an article about four couples finding homes for less than $500,000 in the desirable " 416 " neighborhood . What makes the 416 so attractive ? And what are some things for people to look for to find these kinds of bargains for themselves ? <p> 416 is a short-hand for Toronto proper ( as opposed to the suburbs ) ; it comes from the phone number area code that was once exclusively associated with Toronto ( there are more area codes now ) . A shift in consumer lifestyle preferences for urban living and growing commute times between downtown Toronto and the suburbs has driven what we sometimes call the " Manhattan " effect , with many people trying to buy within a finite boundary - that boundary in Toronto being the area between Eglinton to the north , Victoria Park to east , Lake Ontario to the south and Humber River to the west . <p> Given how competitive it has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for a good value neighborhood to help them get onto the ladder . To do this , you first want to identify all the popular up-and-coming neighborhoods that are regularly highlighted by the mainstream media , and then you want to go and visit the slightly more affordable neighborhoods right next to them . These lesser known neighborhoods tend to offer good value , in part because they are a bit more under the radar and because they start to change for the better as they attract buyers priced out of the established pockets next door . <p> With both " up-and-coming " and " next up-and-coming " neighborhoods , you want to be sure you understand why a particular neighborhood is predicted to do well . If there are no obvious reasons other than a marketing effort by a condo builder , you want to be wary , as some " up-and-comers " fail to arrive . The best reason is spillover from a high demand area as I mentioned . Other reasons may include proximity to the subway . And even with a neighborhood that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ; can you live with not having a local grocery store for a few years ? - <p> Toronto is a relatively clean city , so fortunately pollution is not a major factor that influences most consumers ' buying decisions . Toronto is also a very green city , with many parks , rivers and trails for people who enjoy the outdoors . Two of the greenest neighborhoods in the city would have to be Riverdale and High Park ; Riverdale because of the two large parks in the neighborhood ( Riverdale and Withrow ) and its access to the trails in the Don Valley down below - you 'd never know you were in a city - and High Park because it 's home to one of the city 's largest and most picturesque parks ( also named High Park ) that is beloved for cherry blossoms and outdoor theater. - <h> In your experience , does it seem like millennials are starting to enter the housing market or will be soon ? And do you have any advice for people who hope to own their own home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? <p> Millennials are definitely eager to get into the housing market , but the price of Toronto houses has made it unaffordable for anyone other than dual income households . Condos are becoming more of a first option for first time buyers , including dual income and single millennials . <p> My advice for would-be first time buyers is to cut your expenses as much as possible and put the money you 're saving directly into a savings plan for your down payment , so you can see it grow and stay motivated . I see many recent university grads opting for a more luxurious lifestyle , spending $1,800 per month to rent a one bedroom condo in a new building when they could rent an apartment in an older building for a fraction of what they 're spending . Saving for a down payment does require a bit of sacrifice in the short term , and it 's easier to do this before you upgrade your lifestyle . <p> For more updates from Move Smartly and Realosophy , like them on Facebook , and follow them on Twitter . 
@@11804709 @404709/ <h> Personal Finance Interview with Wendell Santos on the Internet of Things <p> When asked why regular Joes and Janes should be interested in API 's , Wendell Santos of ProgrammableWeb cited everything from former vice president Dick Cheney 's pacemaker to baby monitors to electric cars ; all modern devices that contain APIs , Application Programming Interface . <p> " In the near future , billions of non-computing devices will be connected to the Internet ; everything from refrigerators to smoke detectors to the buttons on your shirt . It will be an Internet of Things , " says Santos . " And once they 're connected , they 'll be programmable through these APIs . " <p> APIs make all of our lives easier , allowing us to turn on the lights in our house when we 're on vacation or close the garage door from the office . But they 're also vulnerable to hackers ; Cheney recently told " 60 Minutes " that he 'd had doctors disable the wireless function on his pacemaker out of fear that someone could hack the device and assassinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cable dramas , they have way more value in our day-to-day lives , enabling software developers to create solutions for just about every web-related problem we could think of . <p> Here Wendell offers a little primer on APIs and why everyone from moms to business owners should be interested in them : <p> Tell us about yourself ... what 's your professional background ? <p> I 'm based out of Seattle and act as the editor of ProgrammableWeb . My educational background is as an Electrical Engineer although I bounced around a number of odd jobs until going back to get an advanced degree in Information Management . It was there that I first learned of APIs and ProgrammableWeb . After graduating , I worked briefly for a web developer , assisting her with various project management duties all the while keeping in touch with ProgrammableWeb 's founder John Musser . Eventually , I joined the team and have been here ever since . That was in 2009 and in that time I 've researched and profiled APIs for our directory , written posts for the blog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the growth of what some have called the API Economy . <p> What is ProgrammableWeb ? Who uses your site ? <p> ProgrammableWeb aims to be the most authoritative source on all things API related . We provider readers with the latest news , trends , information and opinions on the Web as a Platform . We maintain the leading directory with over 10,000 APIs , act as a reference with listings of code libraries , tutorials , product reviews and more . As the Internet grows and the world becomes more connected , we 'll grow along with it providing coverage of all things that make up the programmable web . <p> For the non-tech-geeks like myself , tell me how I might find ProgrammableWeb.com interesting and/or useful ? <p> When the Web first came out 1993 , it was truly an enabling technology . Back in ' 93 , it started with only a few very simple websites and look what it has blossomed into since then . APIs , the central focus of ProgrammableWeb , are similarly enabling , and similarly in a nascent phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people might not have realized that soon enough , they 'd have interest in the web . They go to websites with relatively little regard for all of the technology that makes such activity possible . Business people with little or no tech savvy know when it 's time to start a website to enable their business or to set up a Twitter or Facebook account . The same is true of APIs and ProgrammableWeb is the world 's most authoritative source on the matter . TechCrunch called us the official " Journal of the API Economy . " <p> So , what will trigger interest explosive interest in APIs ? <p> Recent news events that have made big headlines are evidence of the rising importance of APIs in our world . For example , there was the story that Dick Cheney had to take extra precautions to ensure that his pacemaker was n't hackable . Pacemakers can be reprogrammed wirelessly . These are programmable interfaces ( or APIs at work ) . Or , the story that cars from electric vehicle manufacturer Tesla were hackable by developers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Foscom Baby Monitor where a hacker was spying on and shouting obscenities at a baby . Again , programmable interfaces at work . <p> In layman 's terms , what are APIs ? <p> API stands for Application Programming Interface . Whether you 're using an app on your mobile device or going on the Web , the user experience you 're seeing was , in part , created by a software developer . The developer had an easier time creating that user experience because of APIs . For example , if a website incorporates Google Maps into its functionality , the developer had a choice . She could have built the mapping capability herself , from scratch and essentially recreated her own version of Google Maps . This would take millions of lines of software code to develop . Or , with one or two lines of code , she could " call " an API like the one for Google Maps in a way gives her the same functionality as she would have developed herself , but for less effort . In this case , Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it . <p> It 's not unlike the AVERAGE() function in Excel . As someone who is creating a spreadsheet , you can average a range of numbers the hard way ( by individually adding them all up and then doing the necessary division ) . Or , you can just use the average function . In the same way that Excel contains functions that do a lot of heavy lifting , ultimately making it easy for the spreadsheet user to perform otherwise complicated tasks , APIs do the exact same thing for developers . <p> The one key difference is that the API is often doing some heavy lifting for something that is across the Internet . From New York , the application on your smartphone can change the temperature setting on the thermostat on your chalet in Switzerland . The person who developed that application was able to do that with one line of code that accessed an API that was made available by the manufacturer of the thermostat . <p> Where would the average consumer come across them in their everyday life ? Why should we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly all the apps on your phone are backed by an API . If you use Netflix or Hulu to watch TV , those are powered by APIs . We 're seeing car manufacturers increasingly make their cars connected allowing not only for in-dash entertainment systems but also storing diagnostic information . Various government organizations have launched APIs as a means to open up their data and hopefully let developers find a way to give that data purpose . As the world continues to grow increasingly connected , what we 'll see is that more of our everyday experiences will be in someway touched by APIs . <p> How do businesses use APIs ? <p> Businesses can use APIs in any number of ways but the biggest value proposition is that APIs allow companies to drive their business in ways they never could have before . APIs expose a company 's core assets such as business processes and data . So if businesses think of these assets as their product , then APIs are the channel through which that product can be distributed to their customers . In short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the process they help open up new business channels and opportunities . Therefore APIs become a component of the overall business strategy , they help support the overall business goals . There are even companies such as Twilio and Stripe where the API itself is the product and where the business strategy can really be called the API strategy . <p> APIs can be open meaning that developers outside of the business can access the API and build on top of it . This outside developer community can be a source of innovation , uncovering uses of APIs that may not have been thought of otherwise . A far greater number of APIs though are internal meaning they are only exposed to developers within the business or their partners . Often these internal APIs allow systems using dissimilar technologies to integrate with one another , which brings benefits such as increased efficiencies . <p> What new APIs are you most excited about or interested in ? Why ? <p> I think I 'm most interested to see what happens with the so called Internet of Things which will one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet . Over the next decade we 're going to see upwards of 50 billion non-computing devices become connected and it will be APIs that drive this . While the APIs themselves may or may not be terribly interesting ; it 'll be the aggregate impact of these devices that I 'm curious to watch . Think of how you interacted with the world before smartphones , now try to imagine a world where everything around you is online . This has the potential to be a change that wo n't fully be understood for years . <p> What are mashups ? <p> Traditionally mashups were a way of taking data from multiple sources , via APIs , and presenting it in a new way . When ProgrammableWeb started , the most popular kind of mashups were mapping ones many of which made use of the Google Maps API to show interesting data on a map . So for example , you could take the locations of your Facebook friends and plot them on a Google Map . A mashup though does n't have to take data from multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and present the data uniquely . By this definition , nearly all of today 's mobile apps can be thought of as mashups . <p> What 's your favorite website , app and/or device of all time and why ? <p> A couple that I use all the time are Evernote and Rdio . Evernote is great because when I 'm on my laptop I can save articles that look interesting and come back to read them later on my phone when I have time . I also use it to keep lists . For example , if I am at a restaurant and have a great cocktail , there is zero chance I 'll remember its name let alone the ingredients . Evernote let 's me quickly tap in the name of the drink and a few notes about it . Rdio is great because it allows me to listen to music pretty much anywhere I 'm at and it has a great interface for discovering music I was n't aware of . It 's far from perfect , but it satisfies most of my music needs . 
@@11804710 @404710/ <h> 4 Types of Purchases That Need a Credit Score Report <p> There are certain big purchases in life that will most likely require some sort of financing if you 're not able to pay cash to cover the full cost . In these cases , creditors will look at a few things about your financial history first , including your credit score . Knowing what your credit score is essentially gives your creditors an idea of how much of a risk it will be to lend money to you . <p> Some of life 's biggest purchases will most often require financing , and therefore a check on your credit score report . <p> The following are 4 types of purchases that will require your credit score report to be looked at before financing can be secured . <p> 1 . Buying a Home <p> Many home-buyer hopefuls are looking to enter the housing market right now in order to take advantage of current low mortgage rates , some of which are even lower than 3% . But before you can buy a house , you 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape , particularly if you want to qualify for a low interest rate , or just to get approved for a mortgage at all . <p> You 'll typically need a credit score of at least 660 in order to qualify for a mortgage . While not long ago you may have been able to get a loan with as little as 580 , banks and lenders these days are more cautious because of the mortgage crisis that plagued the US a few years ago . <p> The lower your credit score , the higher the rate of interest . To illustrate , on a 30-year , $200,000 , fixed-rate mortgage , a 3% interest rate would amount to $841.21 a month , with a total of $102,832.85 being paid towards interest over the 30 year amortization period . In contrast , a 7% interest rate with the same figures will amount to $1,317.21 per month , with a total of $274,191.54 being paid towards interest by the end of 30 years . That 's a big difference . <p> It 's therefore in your best interests to do everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options for a mortgage are not limited , and more money is saved on interest charges . <p> 2 . Buying a Car <p> Your credit score report is commonly used in the purchase of a new vehicle . In the majority of cases , before you can finance the purchase of a new car , the dealership will probably check your credit score first . In much the same way that your credit score helps lenders predict your ability to sustain regular mortgage payments when applying for a mortgage , so will car dealerships use your credit score to assess whether or not you 're too risky to be approved for a financing plan . <p> How high your credit score is will determine the interest rate you 'll have to pay . <p> For the most part , in order to be successfully approved for a car loan with low interest rates , you 'll probably have to have a credit score somewhere in the 740 range . Having a score in the upper 600s should be fine , but it will probably mean you 'll be paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you plan on purchasing land , you 'll most likely need a loan . While not usually more pricey than land with a home already built , land can still be pretty expensive , and securing a loan for one can be challenging with bad credit . Banks and major lenders might be more hesitant to approve you for a loan for an undeveloped land purchase than they might for a typical mortgage . If you have a low credit score , you might have a problem getting a loan , and even if you do , the fees and interest rates make it financially impossible . <p> 4 . Buying a Boat <p> Buying a new boat will also require a loan if you have n't got the cash to cover the entire cost of the purchase . After all , a boat can be as big of a purchase as a vehicle - if not bigger . The two most common options for obtaining a boat loan are a traditional collateral loan and a home equity boat loan . However , another option may be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal loan . Either option you choose will depend on the health of your credit score in order to be approved . <p> Before you 're able to strengthen your financial health , you first need to know what state your finances are in . A simple way to do this is with an organizational tool that can be easily accessed via your computer or mobile device , such as- Mint 's online financial applications . <p> Lisa Simonelli Rennie is a freelance web content creator who enjoys writing on all sorts of topics , including personal finance , investing in stocks , mortgages , real estate investments , and anything else to do with the world of economics .

And while it is true that fathers are more likely to be the primary income providers , today 's responsibilities are now more shared and fluid . <p> But in workplaces especially , men who prioritize family face two stigmas . <p> " First , men and women who buck ' all in ' work culture are often seen as less dedicated to the company , and this has impact of career trajectories , " Behson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family at work are also seen as violating gender norms , and face additional scrutiny . " <p> The result is that dad 's concerns stay under the radar at the workplace and are more likely to be ignored . This is further exacerbated by the fact that many men have internalized more rigid gender norms - and sometimes end up contributing to their own predicaments . <h> Can you tell us the story behind Fathers , Work and Family ? What prompted you to start the site ? <p> Back during my graduate studies , I was interested in workplace flexibility , and a lot of the work in that area had to do with managing work and family concerns . As I read further , I noticed that most of the work in this area either explicitly or implicitly focused on addressing the needs of working mothers as a way employers can retain key female talent . <p> Even though I was not a father at the time , it struck me that dads are parents , too , and that most of the dads I knew cared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers . This was always in the back of my mind in my subsequent teaching , academic work and professional work with companies . <p> In 2012 , I decided I wanted to write a book specifically to help dads navigate work and family . A friend of mine gave me the great advice , " if you want to write a book in two years , start a blog now . " So I did . That 's how the Fathers , Work and Family blog was born , and also how my book happened - just a little over two years later ! - <h> Why was it important to you to be a voice for working fathers ? How have readers responded ? <p> After I became a father , I understood just how hard it is to be the primary income earner for my family while also being as involved as I wanted to be with my son . As a college professor , I have an unbelievably flexible job with lots of autonomy over when and where I work . I have a fantastic wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy and I make a decent living . Even so , work-family balance is often difficult for me . Most dads have it much tougher . <p> I thought that my dual perspective as a busy involved dad and as a scholar/consultant in work/life policy could be helpful to my fellow dads . This is especially true given that my wife is a stage actress . Her career is very demanding and her schedule is always changing . I saw the importance in my life for really managing our family 's work-family balance , and thought others could benefit from our experience . <p> Also , I am convinced that the No. 1 reason why things get difficult for working dads is that no one , not even dads themselves , discuss these issues . There 's a weird " wall of silence " around the issue of involved fatherhood . I think just by creating a community where we can talk about our concerns makes us feel far less alone in their struggles . <p> When I started my blog , I feared a great big collective yawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I attracted media attention . I think the time was right for advancing this conversation ; and because there are still too few voices in this area , the blog skyrocketed . From this initial success , I have been able to write for Time , The Wall Street Journal and Harvard Business Review , and appeared on MSNBC , CBS , Fox News , NPR and Bloomberg Radio . I even got to speak at the White House ! It 's been a wild ride for me , but I think I just happened upon the right topic at the right time - just before the tipping point . - <h> What are the biggest issues working fathers are concerned about today ? <p> For white-collar dads , the concern is overwork and the fact that work demands often creep into family time . Most professionals work considerably more than 40 hours a week , and many feel tethered to work via emails , smartphones , etc . When clients and bosses are free to call you on the weekends , this time is no longer set aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic overwork and burnout as well as interruptions to family time . <p> For dads in hourly jobs , the lack of schedule and income security are the primary problems . A construction worker may spend a month working 60-hour weeks and then work very little over the next few months . A waiter may get 25 hours one week , but get called in to work several extra shifts the next . As a result , it is difficult to plan one 's family life around work . Who picks up the kids from school ? Who can get there in an emergency ? - <h> How do you think spouses/parents can work more effectively with one another to ensure both sides feel satisfied with how their time is being spent while also meeting financial goals and responsibilities ? <p> This is difficult , but you have to start with honest conversations about priorities . When my wife and I first got engaged , we talked about how important our careers were for both of us and how we 'd both need to occasionally bend to support each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more conversations . We looked at the trade-offs between career concerns and being hands-on parents , and discussed the financial implications of our decisions . Because we already shared priorities , it made our subsequent decisions and actions easier . We 're a really great team . <p> There 's no one-size-fits-all solution . We chose a shared-care approach . Other families chose traditional approaches . As long as your approach matches BOTH of your values and priorities and puts your kids first , you are well on your way . But I see too many families suffer because they are not on the same page . When this happens , typically it is the dad who works more than he 'd like and misses out on family time , and it is the mom who reluctantly derails her career and misses out on living in the world of adults for too long . This puts major strains on marriages , which is good for no one . <p> I do n't want to inappropriately plug my book , but this is where I begin , with a discussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Work- and family-related decisions all need to flow from priorities . - <h> How has trying to find this balance affected how you look at family finances ? <p> We try to practice what I call 85 percent budgeting . By this , I mean we try to get all our regular expenses ( mortgage , utilities , tuition , etc. ) to fit within 85 percent of my very steady and secure salary . Now , we have freedom of choice . I can pursue other work if it feeds my soul ( like the blog or the book ) or turn down even more lucrative opportunities if they do n't fit my family priorities . I can instead spend that time coaching little league , working on professional development , or enjoying lazy afternoons with my son . Similarly , my wife can choose roles based on a range of criteria like artistic merit and long-term career implications , and not just on short-term money . <p> It can be very hard to reduce expenses and manage one 's career so that regular expenses fit comfortably into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get us further than we think . If your mortgage means you have to work extra hours , you are working for your possessions , not vice-versa . <p> Also , 85 percent budgets mean you can deal with emergencies or even splurge on the fun things in life . - <h> What do you think employers should be doing to facilitate a better work-family balance ? What 's the ideal you 're working toward ? <p> I am convinced that most white-collar jobs can be done better than they are now if the employee could work 30 percent to 40 percent of the time at places other than the office and at times other than regular work hours .

We need to use it wisely at work and at home .

What are some of the benefits of delayed gratification ? <p> We decided to step out of the immediate gratification culture so prevalent in the United States when we made the decision ( after losing our business and home in 2008 ) to build a mortgage-free homestead . Every penny is accounted for in our budget , and there was no room for the immediate gratification of running out to buy something we thought we needed . <p> As we prepared to move into our tiny house , we were spending so much time getting rid of stuff we accumulated that we became aware of the time commitment of stuff .

I knew for sure that we had to be careful about bringing in any more stuff . <p> Over time , delayed gratification has become second nature for us . We keep a wish list on our bulletin board .

Secondly , do you have any tidbits of wisdom for people who want to reduce , re-use , and recycle ?

Better to let it go so someone else can make use of it . <p> An assignment in my eCourse is to commit to a certain amount of time every day , and spend that time sorting your stuff . Spending even 10 minutes a day sorting stuff and hauling it off to a donation center or preparing it for a yard sale is liberating . I think the challenge is looking at the amount of stuff one accumulates over a lifetime . It 's overwhelming to imagine the work involved in sorting , evaluating and then letting go . It feels like too much . If you look at the tiniest shelf in your house and start there , you 'll get started . Commit to a certain amount of time a day and get to work .

There has been nothing negative about living within our means , but that does n't mean it 's always easy . <p> Because we live within our means , we parent with this philosophy , too . Our kids do n't have lavish requests , and when they do want something , they 've had a lot of practice in thinking it through before acting on the impulse . <p> - <h> At this point , you do n't necessarily have to go primitive to simplify your life and live closer to the earth .

Our team of CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNERG practitioners lives by the fiduciary standard . A CFP- professional who acts as a fiduciary always puts the needs of clients first . Be very wary of people who call themselves financial advisors but really just sell insurance or annuity products . <p> Our team of CFP- professionals is trained to look at clients ' entire financial picture , help them prioritize their financial concerns , identify weaknesses that a family may not be aware of and then develop a plan of attack to achieve clients ' financial priorities . Once a base financial plan is created , we use technology to monitor progress . A client 's entire financial picture should be compared with the base financial plan at least once each year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth. - <p> When the market dips , young people should be trained to buy more . Timing the market when you are young means almost nothing ; however , the timing of your withdrawals in retirement is extremely important . Unfortunately , I have met many people who retired just prior to 2007 without a withdrawal plan and without a safe-money reserve . Even though the S&amp;P 500 is now ahead of the 2007 market highs , many people who retired without a withdrawal plan and without a cash reserve have less money than they started with due to the horrible timing of their withdrawals . These people were forced to continue to sell and draw on their portfolio as the market declined by nearly 50% . That means they had even less money invested as the market started to recover in 2009 . <p> Part of preserving wealth is to be able to make it through the tough years in the market . <p> Protecting against serious losses is paramount to long-term success . For the last 16 years on radio , I have been teaching people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to retirement . We go through a careful process to determine the annual portfolio withdrawal of a retiree , and we make sure that we have three years of that amount in accounts that are typically FDIC insured or insured by the government . <p> This solves the problem of people being forced to sell in a down market to maintain their standard of living . Once we determine the acceptable risk level of the client , we then develop an asset allocation and rebalancing plan around the safe money . Rebalancing and maintaining a certain risk level are one of the most difficult tasks individual investors face because rebalancing means selling and taking profits . Taking profits and replenishing the amount you have spent from the three years of safe money in rising markets are key in maintaining enough cash and income needed to make it through the occasional market dip . This process of rebalancing and replenishing the safe money should be done at least every three to six months in a rising market . If the portfolio is allocated properly , dividends and interest will allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longer end of the typical market correction cycle of peak to trough and back to peak . <p> Social Security maximization strategies and bond alternatives are also important in an era of very low interest rates . The 10-year treasury is yielding only about one-third of its yield prior to the credit crises . Monetary stimulus around the world has crushed the returns on CDs and bonds and made retirement more expensive . The 4% withdrawal rule created in the 1990s is in danger , and people need a very clear and detailed projection to be able to truly see how long their money will last . Creating a detailed withdrawal plan and asset allocation target helps remove any emotion from the decision-making process of when to sell and take some of your profits . <p> Estate planning is the foundation of wealth preservation . Estate planning laws tend to change drastically every five years ; however , a family should review their document annually . For example , many families that have a living trust drafted prior to the December 2012 law change likely have a bypass trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first death . They may no longer need this trust , and it may actually cause the heirs to pay more income tax than they need to . Many wonderful strategies exist to help clients leave more to their children and favorite charities rather than pay a large estate tax . <p> What are some small ways individuals can help achieve their financial goals ? <p> Live by the idea to " always pay yourself first . " Every savings plan should be an automatic deduction from either your paycheck or your checking account . You will be blown away by how quickly the funds grow . Accumulate assets , not liabilities . Your 401(k) contribution should be bigger than your car payment . If you start saving 10% of your pay right out of college , you can likely retire at 65 . If you procrastinate and start saving at age 40 , you will likely have to save 20-25% of your pay to retire at age 65 . <p> Most families can not afford to save 20-25% of their pay , so waiting to save means you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a financial plan that an individual can adhere to ? <p> A financial plan should include a financial " to-do list " covering each area of the financial plan : <p> Taxes : Tax reduction strategies and tax-efficient investing .

@@11804719 @404719/ <p> Crowdfunding can be a major boon for a burgeoning business . This can be a bit of a Catch 22 , however , as crowdfunding requires a wide reach and great community engagement to be ultimately successful . Businesses that are just beginning might not have the necessary network . <p> We talked to Daryl Hatton , the CEO of the company Fundrazr , to get some useful advice on how to run a successful crowdfunding campaign . - <h> If crowdfunding is all about telling your audience a compelling story , could you share a few tips or ideas on how to convery a compelling narrative in a crowdfunding campaign ? <p> A compelling story about your need for funds IS very important . Make sure you answer the 5 W 's ( Who ? What ? Where ? When ? Why ? ) in your story in a very succinct way . But what is even more important is helping a potential contributor understand the magnitude of the problem or opportunity , its effects on you , and the impact that their contribution will make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and do n't hold back . This is n't about complaining ; it is about stating the facts so that there is no doubt . Then , describe how a contribution will make things better or help solve the problem . If you 've done a good job of telling your story , the contributor will have an emotional response . Sometimes the emotion is sympathy or concern . Sometimes it is hope or excitement that they can help . Regardless , evoking that emotional component is important to motivate them to take action . <h> Great videos are an important aspect of a successful campaign . For companies that have never made a video , how might they go about finding a good director to work with ? What should they look for ? <p> There are really two levels of video quality : very professional and good enough . If you can afford the professional version of a campaign , it is obviously preferred . Networking ( you 're doing that , right ? ) and asking other entrepreneurs is a great way to find out who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for someone who is focused on helping you tell your story in the most succinct way possible . The emphasis should be on the message and not on the production . Multiple camera angles and trick shots look great but can sometimes overdo it . If you look like you went all out on an expensive video , it can hint that you do n't need as much money as you are asking for . <p> If you ca n't afford the professional version , one technique is to approach the local media schools . These are filled with students looking to make their mark in the industry but without tons of experience . They can frequently do a great job ( sometimes as part of their course ) at a very low cost . We 're done this a few times ourselves and have been very pleased with the results . <h> Great photography is another mandatory feature of a successful ad campaign . Do you have any quick guidelines for how to show a product in its best light ? <p> Unless you are a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best thing you can do is find a professional to shoot the product for you . Depending on the size of the product , " doing it right " may require lots of special lighting and rigging . As an entrepreneur , know when to outsource and when to try to do it yourself . You may not have much money , but the amount of time ( which is really your most precious resource ) you can spend on getting the shots to look great is likely much better spent on either driving your idea forward or prepping your networks to help support your launch . <h> Do you have any thoughts on how to get friends and families to support a campaign , without being overly pushy or burning people out ? <p> Many people do n't realize that getting support for your campaign from your friends and family first is MASSIVELY important . Crowdfunding works on trust and transparency . One way that people learn to trust your campaign is to evaluate it based on the trust shown by others . Getting your first group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot product ) . Your friends are your best chance of making that happen . Once they have contributed , others are more likely to want to help because they believe that someone has done the work or has the experience of working with you to verify that trust . <p> Given that , the best way to rally support from friends and family is to be very clear about what you are asking them to do and why . We talked earlier about helping your contributors understand the impact of their contribution . This is crucial to do with friends and family if you want to maintain good relationships with them over the lifespan of your campaign and afterwards . <p> To put it in very straightforward terms , ask them directly for what you want . If you want them to pledge to support you , ask for that . If you want them to help you promote it to their friends , ask for that . If you ask clearly , you are more likely to get a clear yes/no answer . Once you have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . Constantly asking for help overtly ( or worse , hinting at it all the time ) is a great way to burn out your relationships . Being clear , asking for their help in a sincere way , telling them why their help is important and being OK if they say " no " is the only way to do it . And make sure you never , ever , over-promise them something . Your relationship with them is WAY more important than any short-term gain from getting their money under false pretenses. - <h> How might someone go about finding Twitter users that might be willing to support the cause ? <p> The trick with getting anyone to help promote your campaign is to figure out what the potential " win " for them is in helping you . In the case of Twitter users , the win is usually helping them a ) look smart , savvy , or plugged in and b ) achieve higher engagement with their community , i.e. you 've given them something to talk about with their followers that the followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote you does n't usually work . To get great results , you need to do the work for them and give them a good story line that incorporates their online personality . This might include figuring out a key aspect of your campaign that will intrigue them and/or their community and then writing tweets in their style that they can simply cut/paste . <p> Now that you know what you need to do for them , the question is how do you find users who you can help ( as opposed to just looking for those that can help you ) ? Start searching for hashtags or words that you might use to describe your product or campaign . You are looking for a Twitter user who is considered an authority or original source for material on these topics . You should start seeing patterns in the posts . Dig into those patterns and you should be able to find the sources . From there , contact them using a DM or even tweet about them identifying that you see them as an authority . If they are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dialog of getting them to promote you . - <h> With the diminishing organic reach of Facebook , should companies spend time and resources on a Facebook campaign ? And should they consider a paid promotions campaign ? <p> Many people think that Facebook is becoming less relevant because it is harder than ever to broadcast a message to a large audience . If your purpose is to just try to push your message out to a mass audience , then it is no longer the mechanism for you . But you should consider using Facebook as THE mechanism to build a community around your campaign , not just an audience . A community is engaged with your cause and wants a dialogue with you , not just a one way stream of messages aimed at them . Once they engage , they can be incredibly useful at sharing your message and your CONVERSATION with their friends . This helps you engage other like-minded individuals and builds a much stronger base of support . Twitter can help you push a message to many more people , but the engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-existent at worst . Facebook conversations are less temporal , i.e. they last much longer . You can actually build a base of good content that sticks around to be useful to others , not scrolls off your screen never to be seen again . <p> I would consider paid promotions for your Facebook page once you have created enough content there to be " sticky " enough that a user will Like you and stay engaged after they visit just once . Grow your page organically for a while , pay attention to the conversations about your product or your campaign that you can have there , and eventually you 'll get to a spot that you can leverage this investment . It takes some significant effort to make this happen , but that is the new reality of social media . The Wild West days where you could use it to shout from the rooftops and actually be heard are fading behind us . <p> Ideally , your choice of a crowdfunding platform leverages Facebook deeply . At FundRazr , we have the ability to not only publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well - and most importantly , directly on a tab on your Facebook page . This helps drive all the social media activity to your Facebook page and makes it easier to build your community there from even casual visitors directed to your campaign by your supporters . - <h> Are there any other social media networks that have proven to have a particularly good ROI in your experience ? <p> If you have a very visual product or campaign concept , Pinterest can be a great way to build a community of interest that will help share your imagery with a broad base of users . If you have a very business-orientated concept , LinkedIn can be a good place to promote it and start a community discussion about it ( similar to Facebook above ) . I think of LinkedIn as a place to essentially blog about your product in a way that might attract a community of interest . My team tells me that certain products ( gaming and gadgets in particular ) do well on Google+.

Enhance the good points , work to lessen the not-so-great points , and you 'll create a more stable , comfortable lifestyle . <p> By definition , fixed incomes do n't vary , at least not by much . The downside is that inflation could impact its value , and you ca n't predict to what degree . The best course of action is the same , whether your income is fixed or not : Cut expenses and build up savings . You might have a bit less to work with , but at least you know what you 've got . <p> Understand Your Income <p> Before you can create a workable , fixed-income budget , determine exactly what you 've got . This should be the simplest step .

That 's a benefit that people who do n't live on a fixed income ca n't enjoy . <p> Determine Your Monthly Expenses <p> Everything that you pay for regularly , such as a mortgage , utilities , groceries , vehicle loans and credit cards , are essentially fixed . These are the expenses that you ca n't simply cut out . You 're probably living within your means , so determining expenses is just another step toward helping you manage your money more wisely . <p> If your income does n't outweigh your expenses , a good budget can help you reach a more comfortable position .

Fixed expenses should consume no more than 50 percent of your income . <p> Calculate Non-Essential Expenses <p> Anything that you do n't have to spend is non-essential . Dining out , vacations , sending a bit of money to help out a grandson in college , and new landscaping are all expenses that you can change if need be . This is the most challenging part of creating a budget , since non-essentials are sometimes difficult to track , and surprising once you add them up . <p> Save receipts , especially for cash purchases , and check credit card and bank statements .

They are transmitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of an open protocol where asset ownership can be reassigned at minimal to no fees in an openly shared ledger usually referred to as a " blockchain . " Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to inhibit those characteristics and is still the largest one in terms of market capitalization . You can also roughly think of it as the digital version of gold . - <h> How did you become interested in Bitcoin , in the first place , and what about the topic inspired you to to start CoinJabber ? <p> I have always been interested in achieving the goal of limiting the power of the state by stripping it of its ability to create money and inflate our money in perpetuity , along with all the unspeakable horrors that this kind of power has unleashed upon human society for the past centuries . Bitcoin seemed like the perfect solution to that challenge . <p> I started getting into Bitcoin mining for a little while with my business partner James in 2011 and we soon had a bad encounter at the now defunct exchange Mt .

These could be businesses or nonprofits that accept cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Litecoin ( or any of the 200+ others we have currently listed ) , publications that write about the the industry , and many more .

Is this just the currency of the underground , or do you expect it to gain more mainstream acceptance in the near future ? <p> I could easily make the case that the US Dollar is being used for far more drug and black market arms purchases than Bitcoin ever has been . I would also consider the drone bombing and slaughter of millions of innocent civilians and the kidnapping and caging of peaceful individuals utilizing a harmless plant for recreational purposes , illicit activities ( all of course brought to you via limitless central bank fiat money facilitated deficit financing ) , just to name a few . By the way , a US Dollar bill is actually more anonymous than a Bitcoin . <p> Bitcoin is a neutral medium of exchange . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a knife can be used to stab someone or to spread butter . But it 's not the job of Bitcoin to prevent people from doing bad things with it , anymore than it is the knife 's job to remain in the kitchen . It is up to us , as individuals in society , to promote peaceful trade and exchange amongst all and to discourage and punish aggression and theft . I believe that Bitcoin can help us get there and that it will play much more of a mainstream role as a reliable global digital asset in the years to come . - <h> Do Bitcoin always remain virtual , or are you starting to be able to use virtual currency in the real world ? <p> I would avoid the term " virtual " when it comes to Bitcoin . The private keys that you hold to prove ownership are very real things , to the point where people actually store them on paper only for maximum security . But yes , you can absolutely buy real things with Bitcoins in the real world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco ; cocktails in New York ; beer and dinner in Berlin ; cookies online , all with Bitcoins .

Hardly a day goes by without a new big real-world player jumping on board . - <h> Do Bitcoin get taxed ? <p> I am not a tax attorney , so please do n't take my uneducated opinion on this matter as any sort of tax advice . The question of how Bitcoin is to be handled from a tax perspective is still being debated , and answers vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction . <p> In the US , for example , as far as I know , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a profit , you owe capital gains tax just as you do on any other asset . If you earn Bitcoins , then you owe taxes on your earnings just as you would if you were paid in cash . - <h> What I think everybody wants to know is : Can you make real money with Bitcoin ? And , if so , what are some methods that people use to do so ? <p> An easy way to potentially make some money would be to buy a small amount that you 're comfortable losing , and then hold on to it for a while . For example , one guy bought $25 worth in 2009 and in 2013 looked at his Bitcoin wallet to see that it was now worth $800,000 , part of which he used to buy an apartment in Oslo .

You need incredibly specialized hardware ( so called ASIC Miners ) in order to be able to even think of mining Bitcoins . You can buy this hardware from various specialized vendors in the space , but once you 've bought it you need to have the money ( for electricity cost ) , skills , time , electricity infrastructure , cooling , and resources to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large mining facility near the arctic circle and all of the aforementioned prerequisites , you 're really much better off just buying some Bitcoins and holding on to them for a while .

Have you noticed any particularly dependable investments lately ? <p> Dependable is not a word I would use . A consistent and reliable investment might be a balanced fund , such as a target date fund .

In light of high unemployment rates and $1 trillion in student loan debt , rentals are a fact of life for many . <p> But what if you do n't have any rental history ? Or are having a hard time finding a place ? Or have to live with a bunch of roommates just to make ends meet ?

So if you 're looking to impress a landlord or find a cheap place to grab a cocktail in Atlanta , My First Apartment has answers . <p> How did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the blog initially ? <p> The blog is a family venture . We started it with my writer son after he went through a challenging first apartment experience . He unknowingly rented a roommate share in a Chicago building where a tragic balcony collapse had killed many young people at a party a year before . He basically did not check anything before he signed the lease , and was shocked to discover the building 's history when it was too late . My daughter , who is in graduate school , has inspired posts with her first apartment experiences in New York too , and she has also worked on the site 's marketing and analytics . <p> I am a business consultant to media companies and run My First Apartment on a part-time basis with a team of bloggers from around the country . <p> Who is My First Apartment 's main audience , and what are some ways your content is specially suited for their needs ?

@@11804728 @404728/ <p> User data is a hot commodity these days . Huge companies like Facebook and Google export their users ' histories and preferences to marketing companies for major dollars . <p> Why not make a few dollars yourself ? <p> Qmee is a free browser plug-in that let 's the user collect micropayments just by clicking on links that are registered with Qmee in a way that benefits both users and businesses . <p> Qmee 's Nick Sutton took a moment to tell us about the company . <p> Can you briefly describe Qmee ? What 's the premise ? <p> Qmee is a free search-loyalty , cash-reward browser app installed easily into any major browser that rewards you with actual cash micropayments for clicking on results you otherwise would click for no reward . <p> Essentially anytime you do a search using a browser such as Google or Yahoo , if Qmee has relevant results to your search , the app pulls up these results that will appear on your screen in addition to the results you would normally see . Each click on a Qmee search result that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 and 14 cents typically , and the payments are made in actual currency to your PayPal account . <p> A typical user will collect about $5 per month . That 's $60 of free money per year just for doing what you usually do . In addition to the cash you collect through searching , Qmee will reward you with $1 in your piggybank for every referral you send when that person becomes a Qmee user . <p> The premise behind Qmee was that Internet companies like Google for example are making vast sums of money from consumers ' online activity , and we wanted to find a way where we could still help advertisers get their results in front of the right people , but find a way to give some of the value generated back to the consumer at the same time . <p> Who is your main audience ? What are some ways that a business might make use of your services ? <p> Qmee is relevant to anyone who searches online - so pretty much everybody - and that 's the beauty of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK and the US with a valid PayPal account ; and we are actively looking at adding other countries to the roster . Canada will likely be next . <p> From an advertiser perspective , Qmee is a great way to get your services and products in front of consumers at a point where they are actively searching . Qmee is focused on relevance ; and by rewarding the user for engaging with the advertiser , this builds stronger engagement . The cost to a business of showing their search result on Qmee is a fraction of that of the major search engines such as Google , Yahoo , Bing , etc . <p> Who are some of the businesses that work with Qmee ? How do they reward customers using the app ? <p> We work primarily through affiliate and Ad networks and we 're always looking to add new partners . We 've managed to build up quite a recognizable list of brands through which we 're able to populate search results for our users including : Peapod , Starbucks , Perry Ellis , Nordstrom , JC Penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Express ( gift cards ) , Ann Taylor , Banana Republic , Macy 's , Kenneth Cole , New Balance , eHarmony , Expedia , Fandango , Fathead , Garmin , Hertz , Hotels.com - and these are just a few among thousands . <p> One of the ways that Qmee helps businesses find the best customers is by measuring what 's being clicked and for how long . How might users go about finding this information on their own , and how can they convert those insights into useful leads ? <p> This is actually sort of the opposite of how Qmee works . Our users are consumers who are presented with Qmee search results during their regular , everyday search activity if we 've got something that 's relevant to what they are looking for . If we show them something they like , they can click on it and earn their cash reward ; and if they do n't like what we 've showed them , our Qmee results will disappear from the left of their screen after about 30 seconds . <p> We 've always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something Qmee users really enjoy is that all of our search data is anonymized , so their privacy is very well protected . All we know about any of our users is the email address they used to sign up with - and even that gets anonymized in the system once they 've got the app . <p> However , in general we are able to see for example how many people in a month click on a particular link ; and then from there how many of those people spent time on the destination site ; and even further , the number of people that ended up making a transaction . This is obviously valuable to companies because they can analyze conversions on their end and determine the value in them contributing to Qmee 's user rewards . The beauty behind Qmee for advertisers is that they could n't get this data on their own ; we provide another level of data they ca n't find anywhere else : the relation between search and transactions . <p> You also help businesses target their ads for customers most likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for to measure interest ? Where would they go about looking for that data ? <p> Again , we do n't work with companies directly , but rather through affiliate and Ad networks , and our user is the consumer . Our search results are based on keyword relevance : in other words , keywords on a company 's site and how closely they match what a user has typed into a search engine like Google or Yahoo . <p> On the advertiser end , I 'd say this type of data is most effectively collected through the trial and error of different SEO tactics . <p> You have a section on your blog for Money Saving Tips . What are some ways Qmee can be used to save money for the user ? <p> The great thing about Qmee is that people do n't have to change anything about their daily routine to be able to use it and earn money through the app . You just get the app by signing up with your email one time , and it works in the background in conjunction with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a way to get rich quick , but it is a really easy way to earn a little extra money for doing what you 're already doing . I always tell people it 's like walking by a dollar bill on the street ; you 're going to pick it up , and that 's one more dollar you did n't have before . <p> When we read about personal finance , we always hear about how the little expenses add up ; when people analyze where they spend the most frivolously , it 's typically on small things like coffee or eating out for lunch . Well , the little amounts can add up the opposite way as well . An extra few dollars here and there add up at the end of a year . The typical Qmee user who is a moderate " searcher " is earning about $5 per month through their regular daily search activity . <p> You also wrote a post recently about useful apps for the holidays . Are you aware of any apps or websites that are particularly useful for someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful ? <p> It 's interesting because the evolution of the Internet has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for people interested in making money ; it just depends on how much effort you 're willing to put in . Qmee falls on the " no effort required " side of the spectrum . There are sites like Elance , for example , where people can bid on jobs in a variety of different fields . This can require quite a significant amount of effort ; however , it does present people an opportunity to generate extra income from home or on the side . <p> If people are looking to save money , I 'd say the most important thing is to not fall victim to a " spend to save trap . " There are many apps that claim to save you money , but require you to actually purchase something to get cash back for example , or rewards sites that reward you in points or gift cards that can only be spent in places dictated by them . So sure , there is monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money if you have to spend to get it . <p> What would you say to someone who thinks that saving money has to be a hardship by going without all the things they enjoy ? How can savings actually help someone to enjoy their life ? <p> I would say again , the little amounts add up so it does n't have to be this huge , scary task to start saving . Use Qmee , earn a little extra for doing what you 're already doing . Empty spare change out of your pockets at the end of each day and collect it in a jar . Give yourself a weekly allowance for extra things ; so for example , this week instead of buying a coffee every day , I 'm only going to buy it on Friday . Making small adjustments in several different areas can go a long way in saving , and it 'll add up faster than you think . <p> I would also say set things up automatically . Even if it 's just $25 a month for example , set it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes automatically from your checking to your savings account . Or to use Qmee as an example again , Qmee pays you your rewards via PayPal , but if you want to use Qmee specifically for saving , you can leave all your rewards there for up to two years and then cash out in one lump sum ; and either leave the money in your PayPal account , transfer it to your savings , or decide that you 've saved up enough and it 's time for a treat ! This way , you never see it ; and again , it adds up faster than you think . <p> I think savings can help in two ways . I think first it alleviates stress , because you have the comfort in knowing you have some funds saved up . But also , it allows you to surprise yourself in life . If you have extra money saved at the end of a month or a year , the beauty is that you have it and it 's yours to do what you like . So you can roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself - maybe buy something you 've had your eye on , or go on a trip . I think savings gives you a sense of financial freedom and choices .

This loss of " organic reach " has caused some consternation , especially among those not accustomed to paying for advertising to " boost " their Facebook page posts . Many of the people who invested time and resources into building an audience on Facebook now feel like they ca n't reach that audience because of these algorithm changes . But you can adjust your strategy on Facebook and elsewhere to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to people and focus on providing helpful information , not just consist of ads or be purely self-promotional . Looking at your page insights to see what posts are getting traction ( and what time of day people are engaging ) is also helpful . Consider spending a little money to boost posts and see what the results are . You should also create an expectation among your supporters that you will share valuable and useful information on Facebook . Then encourage them to deliberately visit your Facebook page while improving your other social media and email channels too . <p> You also wrote a post recently about seven good reasons for a company to have a blog . What are a few of those reasons ? How can a blog bring in new customers and help to establish an identity within their industry ? <p> A blog forces you to think strategically about your field and your industry , so it 's a great professional growth tool ; but it also shows your personality and thoughts in a public forum .

So blogging can add a lot of value to your bottom line and your brand . Read more in my blog post . <p> Educating yourself about Twitter and how it operates was one of the tips I offered in that blog post . It 's important to not only talk about yourself on Twitter . I see this often with new book authors , business owners or nonprofits joining Twitter . The newbies post every 5 minutes a commercial reminder telling the world to buy their book , offer their services like an ad , or share only about donating money to a cause . You need to answer the question of " Why ? " Why should someone care about your book , product , business or organization ? Educating yourself about Twitter , hashtags and how people connect and relate in that forum can go a long way to helping you plan your strategy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting new customers and sales ? <p> I find that all social media sites can help build your brand and share who you are . But some platforms are more effective depending on what you are selling and who you want to talk to . I personally prefer to use Twitter , LinkedIn and my blog on my website to attract new customers and followers , but we also use Facebook for our business and other platforms . I think you have to think about social media channels as building relationships that can lead to business . <p> Participate in a Twitter chat once a week on a topic that relates to your industry - this gets your username out there for others to see . <p> Be yourself - even in 140 characters or less - personality can show . <p> Do you have any advice for businesses or marketers to showcase their product or business without being pushy or spammy ? <p> Do things that are fun and show your excitement in what you post . If you are excited about what you do , other people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your business and share your products . But do that within the context of talking about your industry and your brand and sharing content from other people , too . That does n't mean you need to share your top competitor 's tweets on your feed , but try to mix up your content stream so a variety of information is being shared . Also , try blogging to give you more content to share in social media . <p> In your experience , what are the best times to post on Twitter for businesses ? What about Facebook ? <p> Twitter I find is very active in the morning and afternoon , but that afternoon stretches into early evening because of the time zones . I use auto-scheduling software to help me keep information going out all day . One could argue that posting in the off hours - late at night or on the weekend - will get you more attention because you are competing with fewer people for attention . <p> Facebook is very active toward the end of the work day , in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publish a blog post on Monday morning , you might want to wait until Monday afternoon to share it . I wrote about these " golden hours " on a blog post in 2012 , and I think much of the advice still holds . The most important piece of advice , though , is to do what works for you . Facebook pages provide analytics , and you can tell from your Twitter feed when you are being re-tweeted or getting interaction . Keep doing what works for you , and do n't be afraid to try something else if you need to .

This is how you pay yourself and create a more dependable income . <p> Taxes : Freelancers do n't have the luxury of an employer that withholds taxes . You 'll have to do this on your own .

" Think of it like you 're buying a ticket to the opening day of a really hot play or movie . If you get there first , you have your choice of the best seat in the house - after which the theater fills up . The latecomers get seats with lousy views , are left to stand , or do n't get into the theater at all . <p> This is a quote from our interview with Caitlin O'Malley of the specialty investment publishing house Money Map Press when asked how they go about finding the latest investment trends and why smart investors should always be on the lookout for those golden tickets . <p> While the Internet and countless publications may bring terabytes of news , features , and financial analysis daily , it can be hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in one place . <p> Money Map Press set out to fill that need by bringing in investment professionals from every aspect of the financial world - from stockbrokers to investment bankers and industry insiders - to bring unparalleled insights and expertise under one roof for all of your investment information needs . <p> Can you introduce us to Money Map Press ? When was your company founded ? Where are you based out of ? <p> Money Map Press is a Baltimore , Maryland-based financial-research publisher . It was founded in 2007 by Publisher Mike Ward , and is a unit of Agora Inc. , one of the country 's largest publishers of financial , health , travel and special-interest books and newsletters . <p> Like its parent , Money Map Press is based in the historic Mount Vernon district of Baltimore . In fact , we operate out of a renovated three-story brick building that 's had nine owners - including 19th-century land investors , coal businessmen , attorneys , and Baltimore City engineers . The building at 16 W. Madison St. ended its residential days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building in a manner that retains much of its period-correct appointments . But it added computer networks and a state-of-the-art recording studio - creating a collegial workspace that fosters the creative thinking Money Map Press was built on . <p> For Money Map Press , that 's not just a " tagline " or marketing motto - it 's a mission statement . <p> It 's what we believe , what we try our very best to do for our subscribers ; in fact , everything we do stems from that core value . <p> When Mike Ward and his team formed Money Map Press in 2007 , the group did so with the belief that Main Street investors - the regular folks who make up the retail-investing crowd - could take charge of their own financial futures ... and could do so successfully . <p> If anything , this independent mindset , which would free them from the games that Wall Street plays , would be an asset and an advantage . <p> We are a specialty publisher . Our goal is to help our subscribers make money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write and provide our readers with the best possible advice , research , recommendations , and strategic insights . <p> We seek to bring on as many subscribers as we can - and keep them by providing a service they wo n't find anywhere else . <p> In the introduction to your publication " The Money Map Report , " you talk about getting your money in ahead of the next big trend as being the key to real wealth . First of all , what are some of the different aspects you look at to determine " the next big thing ? " Secondly , what have been some solidly performing trends of the past few years ? Is there anything looming on the horizon ? <p> The reality is that , as an investor , you will always make the most money by being ahead of " the crowd . " Think of it like you 're buying a ticket to the opening day of a really hot play or movie . If you get there first , you have your choice of the best seat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latecomers get seats with lousy views , are left to stand , or do n't get into the theater at all . <p> Investing is like that . If you 're first , you 'll get the best price . You wo n't be forced into a badly-timed or poorly-positioned trade . And you wo n't be left out , watching as others enjoy the " performance " of the stock they bought cheap and are getting rich on . <p> Here 's another way to look at it : if you buy a stock before the hype starts pushing its price higher , all the subsequent buyers provide the liquidity needed to drive your holding higher in price . In other words , the subsequent buyers do all the heavy lifting while you reap the reward . <p> There 's a risk-minimization benefit to being ahead of the crowd , too . Stocks rise because more buyers come in to bid up their prices . The later you are in that cycle , the fewer " new " buyers that remain behind you . And if you 're the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why our experts use their insights , years of experience , and systems they 've developed both to spot individual opportunities and to identify powerful trends that they are predicting or are just starting to form . <p> The " next big thing " is a bit of a misnomer ; it implies a " fad " which can flame out quickly . The trends we look for are backed by new developments in technology , shifts in the economy , powerful changes in public policy , or massive shifts in the flow of money . <p> And when you can find a " confluence " ( intersection ) of several of these developments , it 's even better . <p> Take biotechnology . Advances in science ( new ways of creating medicines ) , shifts in public policy ( new FDA programs to fast-track " breakthrough " drug therapies ) , imminent market changes ( expiring patents on a slew of " blockbuster " drugs , known as the " patent cliff " ) , and capital flows ( big hoards of cash held by Big Pharma players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) led to some very big winners for us . <p> One company , Pharmacyclics Inc . ( Nasdaq : PCYC ) , had developed a highly effective new drug for treating several different blood-related cancers . One of our " trading services " recommended it to our subscribers in a special report in early 2012 , saying we believed the drug alone was promising enough to ignite a big gain in the stock . And the potential for a takeover was a possible " kicker , " we predicted . <p> It played out just as we predicted . The drug , Ibrutinib , received several " breakthrough therapy " designations from the FDA . That alone , in concert with the big run-up in biotechs , ignited a massive gain for our subscribers . In early 2015 , Pharmacyclics agreed to be bought by AbbVie Inc . ( NYSE : ABBV ) , a company with a " patent cliff " issue . Subscribers who followed that " call " made more than 800% on the stock . <p> With an aging population , additional innovations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marketplace , we expect biotech to continue to be a big opportunity . <p> Generally speaking , we favor the stocks of companies that provide necessary products and services as opposed to " nice-to-have " offerings . So-called " need-to-have " providers , if chosen well , figure to provide the steadiest long-term profits , and to fare the best during the inevitable rough spots the stock market periodically doles out . <p> Technology fills that bill , and so does biotech . There is no end to opportunities in both those areas . <p> A subscription to Money Map Report comes with urgent profile alerts that tell an investor when to exit a position . What are some warning signs that a stock is about to fail ? How can these urgent alerts help prevent damage rather than trying to compensate for it ? <p> According to Money Map Press Chief Investment Strategist Keith Fitz-Gerald , the best way to avoid such " failures " is to very carefully screen the companies before you invest in their shares . Take care to research their core businesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure strong growth prospects remain . <p> That said , there are some signs that a company is headed for trouble , Keith says . Watch for CEOs who are making major changes in their company 's business focus - something the veteran investor likes to refer to as " going off the reservation . " Sometimes shifts in strategy are necessary , or even healthy . But too often , a company 's desire to move away from the markets or strategies that made it a winner turn out to be ill-advised . So if a firm is proposing big changes , research and understand what 's unfolding . If it does n't make sense , appears risky , and will affect earnings , best to sell the stock and move on . <p> Look , too , for companies that are losing touch with their core market . <p> Keith last year took stalwart McDonald 's Corp . ( NYSE : MCD ) off his " Buy " list for the first time in more than a decade because he correctly perceived that the burger giant had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Money Map Report comes with reports on different market sectors , like commodities , energy , and more . First of all , are certain sectors better for faster yields , while some others perform more slowly and steadily ? Does each sector have its own rules as far as performance , and what are some ways that you deduce how each is doing ? <p> According to Keith , it 's certainly true that different sectors , markets and investments will give you different returns at different points . <p> " There are certain points in the business cycle that favor certain sectors over others , " Keith said . " You really need to know where you are at any given point in that business cycle . Understanding that can increase your returns significantly . For example , right now , we are in the latter third of the fourth-biggest bull market in the last 85 years . And that favors tech companies , medical companies , and even certain energy companies . We look for companies that offer attractive values and the opportunity for sustained growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes with Keith Fitz-Gerald 's The Money Map Method : How to Create Lifelong Wealth in a Forever Changed World . To begin , can you briefly describe " The Money Map Method " and what it covers ? Can you also talk about what you mean by " a forever changed world ? " Do you perceive these changes to be positive , negative , or neutral ? <p> Keith is definitely a glass-half-full kind of guy . He agrees that because of technologies that speed things up , the growing global nature of the financial markets , the willingness of governments and central banks to intercede , and other factors , the world investment markets are experiencing more change than ever . <p> With change , however , comes opportunity , he believes . <p> So he puts aside concerns about whether those changes are " good " or " bad , " and instead looks for the opportunities . <p> He urges investors to embrace that same mindset . <p> For instance , you may not like the fact that China continues to emerge as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fabric of the " forever-changed world . " And its emergence creates opportunities . <p> One example : the growth in China 's economy is helping turn Asia into an important trading bloc . That will create new high-growth opportunities - markets like Vietnam , for instance . <p> Savvy companies recognize this and are adapting . Intel Corp . ( Nasdaq : INTC ) , for instance , has shifted production of its PC chips to Vietnam . This year , a full 80% of the world 's PC chips will be made in that country . <p> So if big companies are recognizing the realities of the " forever-changed world " - and are not only adapting , but are moving to capitalize on the opportunities these changes are sparking - individual investors should , too . <p> Another example has to do with demographics . Here in the United States , people are living longer and are remaining healthy at older ages . That 's creating opportunities for investors in terms of healthcare , retirement , medical technology and recreation . <p> " Whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing markets , or new product-and-service markets altogether , the fact is that the changes we see do create massive profit opportunities , " Keith says . " To me , that 's exciting . It gives us the chance to examine an array of change-driven opportunities and to pick those that offer the biggest returns and the lowest levels of risk . " <p> That last line speaks to the philosophy underpinning the Money Map Method . <p> " The goal is to position money in a way that an investor captures much of the upside the stock market provides , while minimizing the downside , " Keith said . " We do that , in part , by how we recommend investors construct their portfolios . And we also do it by identifying big opportunities - before those ideas go mainstream . " <p> One example was Becton , Dickinson and Co . ( NYSE : BDX ) , a company that specializes in crucial but " single-use " medical supplies . Keith realized that the growth in worldwide medical threats would make it inadvisable to reuse many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big spike in demand should any kind of an outbreak occur . <p> Sure enough , when the Ebola outbreak occurred in 2014 , it ignited a rally in Becton , Dickinson 's share price . Because he identified the company 's upside long before the masses and recommended it to his readers , Keith 's subscribers already had a hefty profit . But since the Ebola scare , BDX shares have risen another 26% . <p> You also talk about the 50-40-10 balanced portfolio allocation . What is the 50-40-10 allocation ? What are some reasons it 's important to have a balanced portfolio ? <p> The " conventional wisdom " Wall Street sells to investors is that it 's best to have a super-diversified portfolio - kind of a financial extension of the old adage " do n't put all your eggs in one basket . " <p> We believe that 's a mistake . <p> And we 're not alone . <p> Back in his day , writer Mark Twain once remarked : " Put all your eggs in one basket - and then watch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy that investing icon Warren Buffett has adhered to through the years , he 's much more Twain than Wall Street . <p> Wall Street believes in broad diversification . We believe more in " concentration ; " that is , using a strategy where you allocate 50% of your investments in " base builder " investments , 40% in " global growth and income , " and 10% in high-octane " rocket rider " stocks . <p> With this strategy , which Keith Fitz-Gerald created , you build your " base " and work your way up from there . <p> Base-builder investments are defensive positions that will hold their value in most market conditions . Global growth and income plays consist of world-recognized brands with strong balance sheets and high-cash flows that pay above-average dividends . <p> It 's an apportionment strategy Keith says he 's spent years developing , and one that 's backed by just as much research . <p> " The 50-40-10 portfolio is focused on a group of core economic realities - equities , interest-rate instruments , income production , commodities , and systemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall portfolio less susceptible to economic downturns because the risk is much more evenly distributed . Furthermore , because the Money Map Method requires that we constantly re-balance our risk , we can easily shift with varying market phases - growth , contraction , inflation , and even sentiment-driven events - all without placing significant portions of our capital at risk .

The emergency fund protects you against small losses ; insurance protects you against big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big your emergency fund should be ( $1000 ? Three months of expenses ? Six months ? ) , but we all agree on this : any emergency fund is better than none . Keep it in an FDIC-insured savings account ; an online account that pays a little interest is a good choice . <h> Invest Your Gold Wisely <p> Most of us will have to fund a substantial portion of our retirement from our own savings . That makes it critical to invest well . Luckily , this does n't  require supernatural abilities . Choose low-cost funds ( such as index funds ) , do n't take more risk than you can handle ( always own both stocks and bonds ) , save aggressively , and do n't be impulsive . Make a plan and stick to it regardless of what your cousin warns you about on Facebook .

Instead , consider what you could save on housing or transportation . Voluntarily downsizing or giving up one car in favor of public transit , cycling , or car sharing can save hundreds per month , and there 's no evidence that it will make you any less happy . ( Unless you reduce your commute time or get some cardio in on the way to work , in which case it 'll make you more happy. ) 
@@11804736 @404736/ <h> 6 Ways to Instill a Positive Money Mindset <p> Many of us know what we 're supposed to do when it comes to basic money management - spend less than you earn , save an emergency fund , and invest for retirement . However , establishing good habits is always easier said than done . <p> Money management , like many important things in life , requires discipline . And discipline is n't a natural mental state for everydiv . Add to that the guilt and shame that some of us carry when it comes to finances , and you have a recipe for money management misery . Or , at least , a sense of why the " ostrich approach " can seem more appealing than tackling underlying issues . <p> But , as appealing as it may seem , there is not a single financial guru advocating the ostrich approach as a means to achieving financial fitness ! In fact , going that route will only serve up more guilt and shame in the long run . <p> Fortunately , there are some relatively simple steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discipline to a positive money mindset and great habits . <p> So , let 's go ! <p> 1 . Forgive Yourself for Your Financial Mistakes <p> There are likely few people who can claim that they have NEVER missed a credit card or bill payment , never gone on an impromptu over-spending session , and never raided their savings for no good reason . If you are one of those people , you should probably be the next financial guru . For the rest of us , it 's time to practice self-forgiveness . <p> Brittney Castro , Certified Financial Planner and founder of Financially Wise Women , says , " Forgiveness is a powerful tool because it prevents us from being a prisoner to our past . If we shift our focus away from shame we can make room for better practices and a healthier attitude towards money . " It 's important to acknowledge and accept what has happened . Make your apologies to yourself ( and those around you , where necessary ) and focus on moving forward . <p> Please also remember these wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you - your self-worth is independent of your mistakes . " <p> 2 . Understand Your Money Mindset <p> While you may think you know your attitude towards money , it 's possible that you 're not fully aware of how your views are shaping your decision-making . <p> Brittney Castro suggests tracking the thoughts that come up each time you make a money decision . As we make so many money decisions in our lives , doing this for just one day and then reviewing the results for patterns can be enough to deepen your awareness of your attitudes . With more clarity on your mindset , you can identify beliefs and habits that affect your ability to stick to ( or even create ) goals and plans . <p> 3 . Stop Comparing Yourself to Others <p> In this age of social media , reality TV , and celebrity magazines , it 's far too easy to get sucked into making comparisons . We compare ourselves to other family members , to our friends , to celebrities , and to fictional characters on TV . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons : <p> You 're comparing what you know about yourself ( i.e. , everything - " warts and all ! " ) to what you see of someone else ( i.e. , their best side that they choose to show you ) . <p> Furthermore , you do n't know the intimate details of the other person 's finances . Someone may appear to have a fantastic life filled with fabulous clothes , vacations and other fun stuff , but it could be fueled by credit card debt ... or worse ! If you need a real-life example , check out the Real Housewives of New Jersey . All that glitters is not gold . <p> When you make comparisons and find yourself lacking , you 're diverting attention ( and , potentially , activity ) away from focusing on your own finances and aspirations . <p> So , create attainable goals for yourself and compare yourself to those . Celebrate the wins and update your goals as you reach them . <p> 4 . Create ( and Maintain ) Good Habits <p> Once you have some goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish the habits that will ensure you meet them . If you 've never delved deep into your income and expenses or created a budget , this is a good time to try that . Understanding where you 're spending your money will help you determine where you can save more , if that 's your goal . This awareness will also help you pick goals that are achievable - even if they 're a stretch - so that you can build on your success rather than end up paralyzed by defeat . <p> One particularly effective habit is committing to a set time - one hour per week - to review your finances and monitor your progress . If one hour seems like a lot , it 's worth noting that- millionaires spend , on average , 8.4 hours per month managing their money . That works out to about two hours per week . You can use a platform like Mint.com , your bank account app , or a simple spreadsheet - just make sure to review everything . <p> If you 're in a relationship , pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be fully present for the duration of the conversation . Granted , money discussions are n't always smooth sailing for couples , and arguments can ensue . However , pushing through the discomfort can be the difference between staying together or splitting up for some couples . <p> Even if you decide that one of you is going to be the primary money manager , personal finance expert- Farnoosh Torabi recommends , " Make sure to get on the same financial page and agree to goals so that there 's no miscommunication . Once you both have a clear picture of the finances , figure out together how you want to delegate money . " <p> 5 . Optimize Your Budget for Happiness <p> The very word " budget " can fill people with dread because it brings to mind restrictions . <p> Manisha Thakor has a more positive outlook , as she believes , " Gentle boundaries can set you free . " This is because knowing where you 're spending your money - as opposed to having no idea where it 's going - is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensures that you can tweak your spending so that you 're directing your hard earned cash towards what matters to you most . As- Ashley Feinstein , founder of " Knowing Your Worth , " states , " Sometimes we spend on things that do n't actually make us happy just because we think we should . How much of what you 're spending is for you and your goals ? ... What are you spending on that truly brings you joy ? " <p> A great guideline for budgeting is the 50/30/20 rule . This comprises directing 50% of your earnings to needs ( housing , food , gas , medicines ) , 30% to wants ( vacations , that painting class you 've always wanted to take ) , and 20% to saving . If you 're carrying debt , that 20% may be directed to paying that off first . If you keep the 30% and 20% separate from the 50% , you 're probably going to be OK without having to review everything on an itemized basis every month . Plus , you can go wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> 6 . Practice Gratitude <p> Last but not least , daily affirmations and gratitude for what you do have can be really powerful . <p> GoGirl Finance contributor- Kali Hawlk suggests keeping a journal : " Start by writing down one thing every day for which you are grateful ( financially and personally ) . Return to your gratitude journal any time you feel overwhelmed or negative about your own finances ( or any situation in life ) .

@@11804737 @404737/ <h> 6 Ways to Take the Stress out of Stressful Money Situations <p> Stress over finances takes a psychological toll . Last year , a group of researchers from the UK , US , and Canada- reported groundbreaking findings about the effects of chronic financial stress on the brain . In short , money problems place a disproportional cognitive load on people , who may find themselves short of the motivational and coping capacity necessary to address those problems . Coping effectively with financial stress is the first step to resolving financial difficulties . Here are 6 ways to take some of the stress out of difficult financial situations . <p> 1 . Concentrate on the Present <p> Everyone makes financial mistakes . Shame over them can become entrenched , causing a cycle of anxiety that does n't help you make better financial decisions . Additionally , focusing too much on the future can be daunting . Conquering bad financial habits is a long term process , and focusing too much on the road ahead can increase stress . When you 're under considerable about money , remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Make longer term decisions once the stress is under control . <p> 2 . Face Your Problem Honestly <p> Your bank account status may make you cringe , but you need to know facts . Looking at your bank account , credit card balances , and credit history ( which you can do once a year for free ) does n't mean you spring into action that moment . You want to make plans from a position of knowledge and understanding , and you ca n't do that when you avoid acknowledging reality . <p> Perhaps it 's Sunday , and you ca n't speak with the electric company until Monday morning about your late bill . Sitting around and stewing about it wo n't do you any good at this point . Distracting yourself by cleaning the kitchen , working on a knitting project , or inviting a friend over to watch the game keeps your mind off a financial problem you ca n't tackle yet anyway . <p> 5 . Create a Budget <p> You may think your finances are too much of a wreck for budgeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to plan your entire financial life right now , but you can get started with positive habits at any time . Here are some pointers : <p> Review bills and expenses . Calculate your monthly income . This alone can show you where your biggest financial pain points are . Whether credit card interest is eating your lunch , or your utilities are unreasonably high , you can identify a starting point for handling your finances . <p> Examine expenses that can be reduced . Does anyone actually watch that premium cable you 're paying for ? Do you really need to be paying someone to mow your yard when you have two able-bodied teenagers in the house ? You do n't have to act on all these ideas , but knowing you have options can be empowering . <p> Organize revolving debt information . Knowing how much you owe on each credit card and the interest you 're paying helps you devise a plan for paying them off . You could throw an extra ten dollars at all of them every month , or choose one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next . <p> Use a budget app like- Mint to organize your bills and accounts . You can use the app 's suggested line items , or create your own . Set up reminders to let you know when bills are due so you can avoid late fees . Link the app with your phone so when you 're out you can get information you need about whether purchases are affordable before you buy . <p> 6 . Enlist in Professional Financial Help <p> Do n't be afraid to enlist in professional financial help . If your credit is a mess , there are- legitimate non-profit credit counseling services that know how to help people just like you , even if your credit situation is really bad . If your problem planning for retirement , a- certified financial planner can get you on track with a realistic strategy for your future . Managing finances is complex , both short term and long term , but there are people qualified to help you learn how to do it .

Charles Verruggio , the Senior Financial Advisor of Wolf Group Capital Advisors , was kind enough to answer our questions . Read on to learn the first steps you can take to save and how to know whether you 're on the right track to building a sound financial future . - <h> What is your professional background ? How has it served you in your position with Wolf Group Capital Advisors ? <p> I 've worked in a wealth management capacity for the vast majority of my career . Whether it be an issue involving financial planning , investment management or tax planning , I 've most likely seen it in a prior position or while working at Wolf Group Capital Advisors . Having that robust and varied background really serves me well when solving problems for clients or in coming up with the optimal solution for a client 's particular situation . - <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why ? What can they expect to find there ? <p> Just about any high net worth individual with questions about their financial life should be visiting the website . I say this because at The Wolf Group , we serve individuals who have needs in financial planning , investment management , tax planning/consulting and/or tax preparation . That said , individuals with international interests may find even more value on the website , as we tend to cater towards those who have international ties of some sort . <p> The website is helpful in that you can find out more about our team , our culture , and the services we provide our clients . Many of our firm 's quarterly letters and blog posts are contained within the website , so one can read up on our investment philosophy or even get a better perspective on our take on current events if they so choose . - <h> What do you think most people need to learn about personal finances ? <p> When it comes to personal finances , there are so many important things to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed , I would say that having a comprehensive financial plan would be the most crucial piece to getting yourself on track towards a fulfilling financial life . As basic as it sounds , simply having a plan will put you well ahead of the average person . <p> Additionally , it serves as a great guidepost for keeping one on track and making the most of your earning years and beyond . A plan does this by putting into focus what is most important and providing a roadmap for how to get there .

For example , if your employer provides free matching up to 5% of salary , your annual contribution should be no less than 5% . You do want to keep in mind that you 'd like to have diversified asset bases , so saving regularly in a taxable investment account is also a good initial step . - <h> How can the average person get started with investing ? <p> It is much easier to get started these days than it was in the past . Now there are dozens of financial firms out there willing to take on smaller clients . You can simply call up a well-known financial firm and let them know you 'd like to open a taxable account with $x , and they are typically more than happy to help you . Buying a handful of ETFs to produce a well-diversified portfolio is typically a good way to get started for those under $100,000 . <p> For those individuals who have assets of $500,000 or more , we typically recommend they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels of wealth , you often begin running into more complicated issues . Additionally , many wealth managers are able to help clients sift through the various investment vehicles available to help in crafting a portfolio with particular goals in mind . An advisor can help put together a portfolio with certain risk and return metrics in mind that the average person may have great difficulty doing on his or her own . - <h> Is there anything else you 'd like to share with our readers ? <p> I 'd like to share one last tip by quickly mentioning the often overlooked aspect of one 's lifestyle on wealth accumulation . Most individuals tend to focus on how high they can get their income . Rare is the person who brags about how low they have gotten their expenses . <p> In American society , it 's much more common to talk about high incomes . Think about it from a conversational point of view . How often do people talk about other people 's salaries ? Pretty often . Having a conversation around other people 's spending is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how much income is earned , the only way to accumulate wealth is to live below one 's means . The individual who makes $40,000 per year on an after-tax basis and spends $25,000 per year is saving more than the person who makes $140,000 per year and spends $135,000 . <p> The person with the higher income may have more " stuff , " but ultimately when it comes time for retirement , $15,000 of savings per year ( over one 's entire working career ) growing at a reasonable rate of return may be enough for the lower income person on which to retire . The person with the lesser income may not even have to alter his or her lifestyle ! On the other hand , it would be next to impossible to retire on $5,000 per year growing at a reasonable rate of return . This is especially true for someone spending $135,000/year . <p> Ultimately , everyone has to keep in mind there are two parts to the equation . Certainly , income is important . I think that point is understood and possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spending side of the coin is equally important . Unfortunately , it often gets overlooked and people tend to " kick the can down the road " when it comes to getting spending in check . <p> The earlier one realizes that spending today has huge implications for tomorrow , the earlier that individual will be on an easier path to financial freedom in his or her retirement years . Lastly , spending less during one 's working years has a compounding effect during retirement , as most individuals keep about the same lifestyle in retirement . So , spending less when one is 35 , 45 and 55 almost always leads to spending less when one is 65 . <p> Sign up for Mint and get free budgeting tools and tips that can ultimately help with your retirement plans . <p> Charles Verruggio wishes to state regarding his answers in this interview : <p> " This interview is for informational purposes only , and does not constitute , and should not be construed as , investment advice or recommendations with respect to the securities listed . <p> Investing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk .

Last November , we decided to move to Houston , Texas in hopes of better jobs with higher salaries . We had struggled for years , yet always somehow managed to stay above the water in the financial sea that we found ourselves drifting in . <p> Below is my story on how my husband and I paid off over $19,000 of debt in less than 18 months , and saved-up to purchase our first home with the help of Mint . <h> Debt free and setting new goals <p> With the help of our new salaries , we paid off my husbands student loans ( $19,000 in 18 months ) in April of this year and I was then able to set my eyes on yet another goal : saving up for a house . I had no idea how much it would actually cost to buy our first home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a week or two of paying down the student debt . I took the payments I was making on the student loans and instead sent them directly to the savings account , upwards of $1,500 a month ! <h> Living frugally and new additions <p> We had been living with my husbands cousin since moving to Houston and we were paying him rent for a room in his three-bedroom home , saving hundreds each month in rent alone . As we continued to live frugally and save what we could afford , we began to discuss the possibility of expanding our family . I knew it was n't the ideal time ( where would we even put the baby ? ! ) , but we announced over the summer that wed be expecting our first child , due in February 2015 . <h> Serious savings <p> That 's when things started to get real .

Every purchase was up for discussion between my husband and I. We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow us to miss . I called our realtor and mortgage lender to find out just how much we 'd need to save to purchase a home , and was shocked to find out it was nearly $15,000 for the price range we were looking in . <h> The light at the end of the tunnel <p> Our pennies were pinched even further and we continued to save , as I knew we had to move out by the end of December to allow us time to unpack the towers of boxes stacked in my parents garage and " nest " before the baby arrived in February . Following my strict guidelines I had created for how we handled our money , we continued to stay the course and adjust budgets as necessary . By mid-November , we had reached our goal and then some . We saved $16,000 to purchase our first home in seven months , which would cover closing costs and the down payment . We had cut it so close , but we did it ! <h> Time to make memories <p> During the first day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we put in an offer on a 1,650 square foot home ( perfect for our minimalist lifestyle ) and short commutes to our jobs .

When did you get started ? What prompted you to start your own company ? <p> XLYourFinances is a Microsoft Excel personal finance spreadsheet . I have used Excel virtually every day for the past 15 years in the various jobs I have had as an accountant . This has allowed me to learn some of the advanced programming capabilities that exist in Excel in order to build user-friendly spreadsheets to solve complex problems and processes . <p> As I would learn tricks at work , I would incorporate them into my personal finance spreadsheet . In 2009 , I decided to tackle making my spreadsheet " unbreakable " so that others could use it as well . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I put together instructional videos and created a website , it was towards the end of 2010 . <p> I have always wanted to have my own company , but had never found something that I had enough passion about to pursue . Personal finance is definitely something I have passion about , so it made sense to create the spreadsheet and the website , and start helping people with their finances . <p> Who is XLYourFinances geared towards ? Who is your main clientele , and what are some ways that XLYourFinances is particularly geared towards their needs ? <p> XLYourFinances is definitely for Excel users who are looking for an all-in-one solution to organizing and managing their finances . You must own Excel 2007 or newer to use it . I have found there are a variety of people who absolutely love the spreadsheet . I get comments like , " I have been searching for a long time and this is exactly what I was looking for ... " Sometimes it is an advanced Excel user , and sometimes they are novice users ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spreadsheet is saving them . <p> Even though you touch on it in your FAQ , what are some reasons why people might want to use Excel in conjunction with online finance sites like Mint ? <p> Once a person realizes how easy it is to download their transactions into XLYourFinances instead of manually tracking , they have that " Aha ! " moment and they save themselves hours of time each week . Mint.com has made the downloading of transactions into Excel so convenient that Mint users save even more time . The way Mint compiles all your financial accounts into one spot , real-time , is simply amazing . I actually have a " Mint " button in my spreadsheet that takes the Mint download and converts it to the XLYourFinances format in one click . <p> The other great benefit of Mint is the app . When you use XLYourFinances ' budgeting tool , you can easily come up with how much you have to spend by category . The Mint app allows you to easily see how you are doing real-time , so if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can pull up the app and see how much room you have left in the budget . <p> XLYourFinances is for those individuals who like having their transactions downloaded and available offline in a spreadsheet that is built to make it easy for budgeting , summarizing results , calculating their spending vs. income percent , forecasting their bank balance for the next 30 days , creating a personal financial statement , and giveing them the ability to drill down into the data . <p> What are the advantages of having all of your finances in one place ? <p> Virtually all businesses utilize some sort of accounting system . It is n't even a question of whether it is needed or not ; it is a given . However , when it comes to personal finance , many people do n't have a system . Your personal finances should be viewed as a small company . You have income and expenses , you need a budget and you have to file taxes . The complexity of personal finance is often underestimated , and this creates a lot of problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for success and avoid the common pitfall of overspending , which is often caused by not knowing your true financial position . <p> XLYourFinances can display the information for a virtually unlimited amount of years on one spreadsheet . How is this an advantage , and what are some circumstances where this could be useful ? <p> Budgeting is so much easier when you can compare to past years by category and have the ability to drill-down and see what was behind the total . Also , seeing your personal financial statement does n't have much meaning until you view it across multiple years . You start to see the story behind your finances and the fruit of all your effort as you see your equity position improving . Finally , it is invaluable to be able to easily find specific transactions . Just the other day , I was on the phone with my Internet provider discussing our Internet speed , which was too slow . They wanted me to purchase a new router . I knew it was n't that old , and with one quick search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once I could tell them this information , it changed the conversation and we searched for a different solution . Ultimately , we ended up resetting the router to factory defaults , and it fixed the problem . It is often to your advantage to be able to know exactly what has happened in the past . <p> How important is it to be organized at this stage of the game , and why ? How much time and money can people hope to save by having their finances in one place ? <p> The sooner you can get your finances in order , the better . Think of it like cleaning your house . You can do spring cleaning and get everything organized ; but if you do n't stay on top of it , it does n't take long before you ca n't find things again . You are better off doing a little bit each week , and then things are n't so overwhelming . <p> In terms of saving time : if you are manually keeping track of your spending , you can save several hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you currently are n't doing anything with your finances , you should expect to spend 10 to 20 minutes a week depending on how complex your finances are . <p> In terms of saving money : by setting goals , sticking to a budget and knowing your true financial position , your money savings are only limited by how motivated you are . It takes motivation to stick to a plan . XLYourFinances let 's you know how well you are doing . Just like a game , if no one keeps score , it 's kind of pointless . XLYourFinances helps you keep score . <p> When you know your financial position , you can make better buying decisions . People usually assume this just means not spending money ; but the reality is , it also gives you confidence that you can afford what it is you want to purchase .

" Being in debt is kind of just a way of life for a lot of us . I think making a commitment to get out of debt is one of the best things you can do . I 'm not as worried about our mortgage , which is for a house that typically retains its value . I am concerned about our credit card debt , where we are buying things we can not afford and then paying them off over time . When you use your credit card , make sure that you can pay it off in full each month , and make sure that you are spending less than you are making . <p> In summary , it is difficult to make positive changes which is why I love this quote from Robin Sharma ...

@@11804747 @404747/ <h> Mint and Coinbase : Your New Bitcoin Finance Tracker <p> Mint and Coinbase : Your New Bitcoin Finance Tracker <p> Bitcoin , the electronic currency system , allows direct payments from one party to another without the necessity of a financial institution . It is self-governing , and the value of Bitcoin varies , sometimes with substantial volatility . People can use Bitcoin for almost any type of transaction , including online shopping , and paying for goods or services from businesses that accept it as a payment form . You can now find Bitcoin ATMs in a handful of cities in the United States . <p> As with any other form of currency , keeping track of Bitcoin is essential to smart spending and saving . Fortunately , tracking Bitcoin is becoming easier , and the biggest Bitcoin exchange , Coinbase , has recently teamed up with Mint.com to include Bitcoin tracking in a popular personal finance app . <p> Mint is currently the only personal finance app that allows consumers to track their Bitcoin holdings . Now , in addition to having a reliable finance tracker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitcoin value any time on their computer or mobile device . <p> What Is Coinbase ? <p> Coinbase is what 's known as a Bitcoin " wallet , " which is a platform with which consumers and businesses can make transactions using bitcoin rather than traditional currency . Coinbase is currently the largest Bitcoin wallet service , hosting over 1 million consumer Bitcoin wallets . Coinbase also provides Bitcoin wallets for 25,000 merchants , and that number is rapidly growing . <p> Coinbase wallets are stored using AES-256 encryption , and the company stores up to 97% of its customer funds offline in bank vaults to prevent theft . Coinbase 's sensitive user data is disconnected from the internet , and its drives and paper backups are stored redundantly in several safety deposit boxes and vaults worldwide for safety and security . <p> Why Is Tracking Bitcoin Complicated ? <p> Instead of having one entity tracking Bitcoin transactions , the entire Bitcoin network tracks them , in order to make theft or double-spending practically impossible . Though the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) has n't yet said much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bitcoin are subject to taxation . <p> Some people are paid their salaries in Bitcoin , and reporting can be complex . For example , if someone is paid in Bitcoin , it is worth a certain amount of US dollars at that time . But if the employee then decides to sell his Bitcoin for a profit , that profit is considered capital gain . Therefore careful tracking of Bitcoin is critical in order to accurately report gains or losses at tax time . Having a reliable finance tracker is essential to accounting for Bitcoin as it intersects with traditional currency . <p> Treating Your Bitcoin as an Investment <p> Because Bitcoin trading can produce large swings in the dollar equivalent of one Bitcoin , you should never convert money you ca n't afford to lose into Bitcoin . While some people have profited handsomely by holding onto Bitcoin and watching its value go up , others have lost substantial sums . People who used a Bitcoin exchange called Mt . Gox recently watched the value of their bitcoin essentially disappear overnight when a software glitch allowed criminals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of it back is not yet known . <p> Choosing your Bitcoin wallet provider carefully can help you be confident that your investment will only be subject to the inherent volatility of Bitcoin , and wo n't become the object of fraud . Coinbase has a strong reputation as a solid exchange for people who want to buy or sell Bitcoin . <p> Now that Mint allows bitcoin users to track their Coinbase transactions , consumers can easily view their Bitcoin wallet balance alongside their regular banking , investment , and credit card accounts . The app automatically converts the Bitcoin account balance to its current equivalent in US dollars so that Bitcoin owners know how much their wallet is worth at any time . <p> Bitcoin is far enough into the mainstream that everyday consumers are starting to use it in an increasing number of transactions . Keeping track of Bitcoin transactions is just as important as keeping track of traditional money transactions . People who use a sound , proven finance tracker like Mint.com and a respected Bitcoin platform like Coinbase can now do that conveniently and easily . 
@@11804748 @404748/ <p> In light of the economic insecurity of the past few years , entrepreneurship is becoming more and more an accepted part of our society and our economy . <p> While that 's good news for the self-employed , no matter how good of an idea you have , you need money to get it off the ground . <p> Angel investors step in to help the burgeoning business or entrepreneur . This is not pure philanthropy , however ; startups can be a solid investment . So angel investors can reap yield high returns while being helpful at the same time . But how can you find a good startup to invest in ? Where should you look , and how can you tell if it will be a good investment ? <p> Angel Capital Association was founded in 2004 to fill that need . ACA 's Marianne Hudson took a moment to tell us about the company , angel investment , and some things to look for when looking for angel investment opportunities . <h> Can you tell us a little bit about Angel Capital Association ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start ACA initially ? <p> ACA was founded in 2004 as a non-profit professional association to build a community of professional/educated angel investors who support entrepreneurs very well . The founding premise was that if more angels learned angel investing best practices , they would increase their chances for better financial returns - and the companies invested in would be more successful as well . ACA also represents angels in Washington , DC ; connects angels to develop the relationships needed for co-investing in deals ; and provides a series of programs , discounts and other benefits to member angels ( and often their portfolio companies ) . Today , ACA has 12,000 member angel investors across North America who invest on their own and/or through angel groups , family offices and accredited funding platforms . <p> I helped start ACA while working at the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation , which studies and promotes entrepreneurship in the U.S. I saw how important angels were to innovative startup companies and wanted to grow the pool of smart angel investors who fund the companies that create jobs and innovation in our country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are angel investors , and why are they such a valuable demographic ? <p> Angel investors are individuals who invest directly in startups in return for equity ownership . Angel investments generally come before venture capital . Top angels provide both financial and intellectual capital , using their entrepreneurial and corporate leadership expertise to advise startups as they grow . <p> Angels are important for many reasons : <p> They invest significant money and expertise . In 2013 , the most recent year estimates are available , nearly 300,000 angels invested $24.8 billion in more than 70,000 companies . <p> They are the largest source of equity for startups after friends and family . We estimate that angels provide 90% of the outside equity for startups every year . <p> The kinds of companies that angels fund create jobs and life-changing innovations . Companies five years or younger create all of the net new jobs in the U.S. , and high-growth startups create the largest portion of these jobs . <p> Angels are " Main Street " investors , located in every American state . <p> Angels put their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of angel-backed startups will fail , but that does n't dissuade angels . Additionally , when angels realize a great financial return , they often reinvest that money into other startups . <h> What are some reasons someone might want to BECOME an angel investor , either practical or intangible ? <p> One of my favorite angels says it best : angel investing is a great opportunity for accredited investors to " do good , have fun , and make a little money - not necessarily in that order . " With a good portfolio , angels can get a strong financial return , while reaping other rewards such as helping create great new companies in their communities , meeting interesting entrepreneurs , and working with friends while evaluating investment opportunities . <h> You break down the ways ACA helps professional angels into three steps . Could you recap those steps ? You also talk about knowledge sharing , best practices and insights from top angels , in one of those steps . What are a few best practices and useful insights , for the prospective angel ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best practices and insights from top angels to ensure smarter investment decisions <p> Vetted connections to support deal flow and syndication processes <p> Representation to public policy makers to safeguard angel investment rights <p> I think the knowledge sharing and insights are key to having a good return over time . For instance , angels need to know that returns improve when they invest in what they know , do due diligence , and make multiple investments to reduce risk and increase their chances for stellar returns . It is amazing how much newer angels learn from experienced ACA members ; sharing insights from past mistakes makes a huge difference , as do connections to people who can help their portfolio companies expand because they know the decision-makers who can drive purchases of new products . <h> There is a section of your bio about " Angels and the Entrepreneurial Ecosystem , " where you state , " Angels and entrepreneurs need each other . " Why is that ? <p> Without strong entrepreneurs , angels have no one to make angel investments in . Likewise , entrepreneurs need angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outside equity for startups comes from angels , how would entrepreneurs get capital if angels were n't there ? The mentoring and coaching entrepreneurs receive from angels , whether or not they invest , is often the difference between success and failure ; and by sharing what they know , angels have a direct , highly rewarding hand in the startups ' success . <h> For many years , there seemed to be a disdain towards starting your own business ; but this seems to be shifting with the economic uncertainty of recent times . Do you feel that entrepreneurship is on the rise ? What good can come of that ? <p> I do n't recall a time of disdain toward entrepreneurship in this country . Perhaps some people worry about the financial risks involved in starting a business and view employment in big businesses or government as less risky . <p> The real rise is in interest in starting businesses , particularly in younger generations . There is an explosion of entrepreneurial courses and degrees in hundreds of universities and new programs to help entrepreneurs - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To my surprise , however , there is actually a downturn in entrepreneurial activity right now . Experts from the Brookings Institution recently found that business deaths exceeded births in 2011 for the first time in 30 years . I 'm not sure what this means , but it needs to be understood soon . <h> For people starting their own businesses , do you have any advice on finding angel investors that may be interested in their company ? Also , do you have any thoughts on how to pitch a proposal and what kind of preparation to do ahead of time to have the most solid pitch ? <p> Entrepreneurs should first figure out what kind of capital fits their company and vision . Equity capital from angels is " right " for a small percentage of companies - those that plan to grow fast , sell their business within five years , and whose founders are OK with having other people involved in important decisions . A startup business plan should show how the company is going to grow and " exit " at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all make a return . <p> There are many books and articles detailing preparation and presentation tips for entrepreneurs , and some of the best are from angel investors themselves . For example , ACA Vice Chair Christopher Mirabile writes a bi-monthly Inc. column covering these topics . <h> For angel investors , what are some things they can look at to decide if a business is a viable investment or not ? What are some important metrics to evaluate ? <p> Most angels weigh the criteria differently , but here are some of my top metrics : <p> Does the CEO and entrepreneurial team have the ability to turn the innovation into a $5 to $10 million company in five years ? <p> Does the product solve real customer problems - and related to this , does the company have customers who will buy the product ? <p> Is the market large enough for good growth ? <p> Who are the company 's competitors and does the company have enough of an advantage to outsell their competitors ? ( And does the company understand it has competitors ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product ? <p> Is the valuation of the company reasonable ? <p> Notice that the product was the fourth item on the list . Angels invest in entrepreneurs first . It is surprising how many inventors approach angels for investment with information about their idea and have no company or sell plan behind the invention . <h> Finally , what are some reasons someone should consider joining Angel Capital Association ? <p> Angel investing is not a solo sport . The Angel Capital Association is a great way for new and long-time angels to connect with some of the best angels on the planet to learn great ideas , hear about interesting deals , and get answers to burning questions . ACA offers many ways to connect to fit differing personalities and needs . These include in-person large national meetings and local events to twice-monthly online webinars and resources on the ACA website and regular columns in Forbes and Inc . We 've actually heard some very experienced angels say they wish they had connected with ACA sooner , because they would have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discounts for products and services they and their investment companies need to do their work . Others enjoy the chance to provide input on public policy issues or get early reports about key regulatory or legislative issues that impact them .

If you just get up one day and quit your job , you are going to make life difficult . Before you quit your job , start planning . What do you want to do after you quit ? Where are you going to go ?

Are you on track for retirement ? Are you saving any money each month ? How much debt do you owe ? These basic questions will help you understand where you land financially . <p> Pay Off Your Debt <p> Most people have some form of debt , whether it 's from credit cards , personal loans , mortgage , car loans , student loans , medical debt , or anything else .

I was the matron-of-honor at my best friends wedding and she was the maid-of-honor at my wedding . <p> Its a great way to honor your close friends , but the cost of being a bridesmaid is also a great way to completely wreck your budget . My recommendation , unless you 're completely made of money , is to choose whose bridal party you 're in carefully . <p> Stick with ( being a bridesmaid ) at the weddings of your besties . Itll mean more to you and the brides , and you wont go broke in the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bridesmaids is the cost of the dress and all the accessories to go along with it . The average cost of a bridesmaid dress is $150 , and that 's before alterations . $150 is a lot to spend on a dress that will only be worn once . <p> If you 're lucky , the bride will give you some say in the dress or you 'll end up with a dress that does n't  scream " BRIDESMAID ! " and that you can wear again . <p> Along with paying for the dress , you 'll need to worry about getting shoes to match , some type of purse , and jewelry . Some brides do pay for the jewelry for their bridesmaids , which is nice , especially if the bride has great taste and you can wear the necklace or bracelet again . <p> There 's also the cost of getting your hair and makeup done for the big day .

@@11804757 @404757/ <h> Answers to 7 Money Management Questions You 've Been Asking <p> Answers to 7 Money Management Questions You 've Been Asking <p> Manage your money and boost your retirement fund . <p> Money management takes time , patience and some knowledge . While you do n't need to be an expert , you need to understand a few things to make the best decisions and plans . Here are the answers to the seven most common questions to help manage your money more effectively . <p> 1 . When Should I Start Saving for Retirement ? <p> When you 're young , retirement is that thing that old people do and you believe there 's plenty of time to plan for it . However , you 'll soon find that having the income you want in retirement takes time to save , so when should you start ? The real answer is as soon as possible . You need to give yourself as much time as possible to make it easier on your current financial budget . <p> 2 . How Much Should Go Into My Retirement Pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the percentage of your salary that you will put into your retirement plan based on your current budget . As your budget changes , the amount you save can change . Save as much as you can in your retirement pot to make it easier later in life . <p> 3 . Can We Really Afford a Baby ? <p> It 's a big question for those starting a family . You 'll hear people telling you that you 'll never be financially stable enough for a baby , but that does n't mean you should stop your money management plan . It 's worth considering the fact that a child costs around $200,000 for the first 18 years of his or her life . Remember that is spread over the course of 18 years ; you do n't need it all right now ! <p> 4 . Do I Really Need the Emergency Savings Fund ? <p> You should have a fund just for emergencies . You never know when something happens and you do n't want to get yourself into debt for the sake of your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll also need something in case one of you loses your job . <p> Split your finances up in different pots to make managing it easier . <p> 5 . How Much Emergency Money Is Needed ? <p> It can take up to a year to find a new job , especially in the current climate . You realistically want an emergency fund that will cover at least six months of your outgoings . Build that up gradually right now by setting a budget and creating a plan for your emergency fund . <p> 6 . Should I Save or Clear Debts ? <p> You want to try and do both at the same time , but clearing off debts is better if you have to choose . Debts rack up higher amounts of interest than you could even save . Work on one debt at a time and then move onto the next to help with money management . If you can , at least save up your emergency fund while clearing debts . <p> 7 . What 's the Different between Traditional and Roth IRAs ? <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difference is when you end up paying tax on the money you save . In a traditional IRA , you pay the tax when you withdraw the money for use in retirement . With a Roth IRA , you pay the taxes when you pay the money in . <p> Those are the answers to the seven most common money management questions . Budgeting is the main factor in all of this , which is something Mint.com can help with . With the free software , you can track your expenses and see how close you are to your savings goals at a glance . <p> Alexandria Ingham is a freelance writer with experience in technology , personal finance and budgeting .

@@11804761 @404761/ <p> The role of corporate banking in causing the recent recession has made many people wary of large scale banks . With a shortage of government oversight , it seems that many of the major banks have their shareholders in mind more so than the customers they should be serving . <p> The public 's skepticism has made more savvy investors turn to public banks to ensure that their money 's in good hands and going where it 's supposed to go . <h> The Public Banking Institute was formed in the wake of questionable bank practices which helped lead to a recession . For those that are n't familiar with that story , what were some of these practices ? <p> PBI was actually formally organized in January of 2011 after a couple years of group development following the publication of Ellen Brown 's best-selling book Web of Debt , in which she traced the long history of money creation , issuance and brokerage by private parties . She documents the powerful control that private money issuers created through the issuance of money as a debt , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health of any economy . <p> The demonstrably criminal practices of the largest banking interests , such as sale of compromised securities , mail fraud , mortgage scams and other unsound investments created a heated market for money speculators - particularly in the housing and real estate industries , which later collapsed . These same banking institutions , the " Too Big to Fail ( or Jail ) " giants such as Goldman Sachs , Wells Fargo , JP Morgan , Bank of America , HSBC , Citicorp and others , have returned to many of their old practices and are now bigger than ever , having grown over 30% since the collapse in 2008. - <h> Another inspiration for the Public Banking Institute was when you discovered the Bank Of North Dakota . Can you share a bit of what makes the BND different from big business corporate banks , and why they might be better for individuals or a community ? <p> While public banks are common the world over , there is only one in the United States : the Bank of North Dakota , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in 1919 . At 95 years old , BND is still owned by the people ( the State of ND ) and is the depository of all the state 's revenues including tax money , fees and other such receivables . Instead of sending their money to Wall Street for investment , BND keeps its money in the state and invests in a wide variety of needs and projects that help the state build internal strength and financial health . <p> It has an almost unbelievable track record of establishing economic stability in the state through this independence from the global banker realm , as evidenced by the fact that the collapse of the Western central banks in 2008 had very little effect on the North Dakota or the BND . North Dakota was also the only state with a budget surplus while the other 49 struggled with red ink . <p> It is this inherent ability to build internal financial strength through investing local money in local economies that the Public Banking Institute is promulgating around the U.S. , now in about 36 different markets . The Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outperforms Wall Street banks by about 2:1 and is one of the most efficient and profitable banks anywhere in the US. - <h> As recently as 2010 , it has been reported that states can send out over a billion dollars annually that get invested elsewhere . Is this still the case ? Have things improved at all ? <p> This very logical observation is as true today as it was then , and perhaps even more so in that the instability of the global banking cartel is evident in the countries where they operate . One need only ask whether they would prefer to give their money to Wall Street for speculation in unpredictable and frequently bank-manipulated commodities or foreign currencies with questionable returns , higher risk and more expense ; or whether they would want to keep their money closer to home where it can make a difference in the lives and assets of the people whose money it is in the first place while spinning off new non-tax generated revenues for government operations . - <h> One advantage of public banks is their ability to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a real world example where that could be important and how a traditional loan might not meet those needs ? <p> This refers to the fact that the public Bank of North Dakota helps strengthen local financial institutions by enabling them to make larger loans by partnering with them on particular projects and loan programs . One benefit is that local community banks and credit unions are able to better compete in the marketplace by writing more and larger business loans , thereby protecting themselves from the unfortunate national trend of getting bought out by the mega-banks and leaving fewer financing choices for local borrowers . <p> These community banks are key members of every community and are on the front lines of local economies because they know the people and they know the markets . The global Wall Street giants are not interested in taking chances on local outcomes or people , and hence the credit available to local economies was severely curtailed after the 2008 crash , causing damage to all types of businesses that need to have access to credit for continuing and expanding business or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ability to provide better interest rates on personal loans . First of all , how do public banks achieve this ? And secondly , can you illustrate what that difference might look like over the lifespan of a loan ? <p> A public bank is n't driven by the need to maximize profits , though it is a profitable enterprise . In fact , the Bank of North Dakota has been so profitable that it has created hundreds of millions of non-tax revenues for the state in the last 10 years alone . And because BND does n't want to compete with local bankers by offering retail bank products like ATMs , multiple branches , etc. , they have low overhead and fewer physical and personnel assets to support . <p> Consequently , if a student wants a loan to go to school , BND will give them one for 1.5%/annum ; or if a businessperson wants to start a business , BND has a program that will provide $50,000 for 5 years at 1% .

What are some topics you discuss in the New Economy Academy ? <p> While part of our work at the Public Banking Institute is to educate people about public banking , there is also the need to learn about how money , banking , economy and the trends that are underway in the midst of big changes . <p> The New Economy is a broad term that is defined differently by monetary and economic reformers . Generally speaking , it refers to movements that are dedicated to bringing about a new quality of life in which monetary scarcity and instability is replaced by the natural abundance of our common wealth , to rediscover and celebrate the " commons " which we all share and enjoy , and to move past the typical pursuits of constant consumption and accumulation . <p> The " New Economy " is a stand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shift from " sacred money/sacred markets " to " sacred life/sacred earth ; " in other words , a sea change in our personal and societal objectives that refocuses our systems and public policies on the mechanics of healthy , secure , prosperous lives in which money is a utility rather than a goal .

Sadly , few teens understand basic financial terms or are saving for long term goals , like college .

Your teen should learn that bank accounts are the key to being able to afford bigger ticket items later and cope with financial emergencies like replacing a pair of basketball shoes left behind after an away game . A bank account can also be a route to a secured credit card once a large enough balance can be maintained . <p> How Credit Cards Work <p> Even if a teen does n't obtain a credit card until after college , knowing how they work can help keep temptation in check once that day arrives . Teens should understand how much credit cards charge in interest and how interest can make the true price of an item go up drastically . The basics of credit card rewards programs , and how they are only beneficial to those who do n't carry a balance are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their first credit card . <p> The Importance of Credit Scores <p> Teens are used to being graded . From report cards to SATs , teens are well aware of how numbers are used to represent accomplishments and responsibility . The concept of the credit score is not lost on the average teen , and though most ca n't do much about their credit score during high school , they can lay the foundation for building one in adulthood . By learning the concepts listed above and putting them into practice , teens will be much better prepared when they begin building their own credit history . <p> People with low financial literacy are more likely to have problems with debt , are less likely to invest , and are less likely to plan for retirement . Young adults are hungry for understanding of personal finance topics , with 84% of college students saying they needed more education on financial management . Sixty-four percent of college students say they would like to have received this information while still in high school , according to the NBER study . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably is n't receiving personal finance instruction in school . Whether or not she is , it 's important that you emphasize the value of developing good personal finance habits at a young age and do your best to set a good example .

@@11804766 @404766/ <p> Boston , Massachusetts is consistently rated as one of the most expensive cities in the United States . Yet despite harsh winters and prohibitively high rents , Boston is also commonly ranked as one of the top cities to live in the United States . It 's even been called one of the 10 ten cities for millenials , according to the website Bostinno . <p> There must be something to this classic American city , which was founded 146 years before the United States was even a country . <p> If you are one of the curious who want to see what this great city has to offer and try your hand at finding a place , an insider 's perspective is beyond mandatory . It is essential . <p> Boston 's Charlesgate Realty prides themselves on being not only experts in real estate , but also having " local knowledge . " They know Boston like the back of their hands , and they know how to get you in and find the best possible deal . <p> We talked with one of Charlesgates Realty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some sights to see , some places to look for a deal , and how best to prepare if you 're planning on moving to the capital of Massachusetts . <p> One of Charlesgate Realty 's philosophical business goals is to be an expert in both real estate and " local knowledge . " How does your agents ' knowledge of Boston help you to find the best housing for your clients ? <p> Due to the constantly changing and competitive market , it is necessary for a real estate agent in Boston to keep up with what is happening in the market and neighborhoods they specialize in . This helps agents inform buyers of what 's going on so they can make informed decisions about their purchase . We analyze and go over monthly market stats with our clients to make sure they fully understand the market they are thinking about purchasing a home in . <p> Charlesgate Realty offers a lot of different resources for Bostonian real estate , which include home buyer , seller , and renter class webinars . First of all , what are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And are there any that have been particularly popular ? <p> I 'd have to say the most popular is the home buyer seminar , as some people really have no idea where to start when it comes to buying a home . To put it simply , we go through the step-by-step process of how to buy a home , bring in a mortgage lender to talk about different loan options and discuss what 's happening currently in the Boston real estate market . I give many of these classes and work with buyers from them to help them completely understand the process and how to move forward with their home purchase . <p> Rent is notoriously expensive in Boston . What are some methods that you use to find the best deals ? Where are some places that you look for this information ? <p> Unfortunately , there are n't really " deals " in the rental market in Boston . Boston is consistently in the top 5 of most expensive cities to live in the US . Instead , renters should be looking for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to weigh the pros and cons of what they are getting for their money in different neighborhoods and different amenities . One of the reasons they should consult with a realtor is to help them sort out what factors are the most important . <p> You also had a post recently about whether or not someone was ready for home ownership . Again , what were some of your findings ? What should renters keep in mind to try and decide if they are ready to own ? <p> Every situation is different . The best tip I can give is to talk about your personal situation with a real estate agent and mortgage lender . Then make an educated decision of what makes sense for you . My biggest tip if someone is getting ready to buy is not to make any other big purchases . : ) <p> Regarding local knowledge , you posted a link to a Facebook Page called " 365 Things To Do In Boston . " What are a few of your favorite things to do in your city ? Are there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? <p> It 's so hard to pick , but some of my personal favorites are going to a Red Sox game , attending a Paint Nite with my friends or simply taking a walk along the Charles River . In my eyes , Boston is the smallest BIG city out there because if you live anywhere in the Metro Boston area , you 're going to be within walking distance of something fun to do . <p> Boston 's home prices are up 4.7% in January of 2015 as compared to a year prior , but home sales are still on the rise - 3.1% in February , marking the highest level in 20 months . For one , do you predict the housing prices to continue to rise ? Secondly , what continues to attract people towards Boston despite rising prices ? <p> I expect the prices to continue to grow some over the next couple of quarters but do n't feel that the market will continue to grow this substantially for years on end . Boston has had a consistently strong market in comparison to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of housing can continue to grow and will start to level out - or people wo n't be able to afford to live here . Boston is a great city and people are willing to pay to be here , but enough people have to be able to afford it to keep it thriving ! <p> For people who are looking at moving to Boston for the first time and have some time to prepare , do you have any recommendations as far as setting up a budget , how to save money or find good deals - like picking up furniture locally or buying certain things ahead of time out of state ? <p> People that have time to prepare should be looking at properties in different neighborhoods so they can get a feel for how much properties are renting and selling for in the area . As far as setting up a budget , it depends if they are going to rent or buy . If they are planning to buy , they should talk to a mortgage lender to see what their spending power is and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most sense to stay within their means . Just because you can afford something does n't mean you should spend that much . A renter can expect to spend around 25-30% of their annual income on rent ( this obviously varies but as a rule of thumb ) . <p> How much do you enjoy living in Boston ? Would you recommend it for people who are thinking of moving there ? <p> I love living in Boston - even with all the snow ! Despite its really harsh winters , Boston has so much to offer . Being a Boston transplant myself , I appreciate the culture , the overall beauty of the city , and even the crazy sports fanatics . Boston truly has something for everyone : it 's just a matter of getting out here and experiencing it yourself .

Jonny spoke with us about getting your finances in order now , and how that will look in the future . <p> What are some common misconceptions you see about personal finance ? <p> Well , when it comes to personal finance or money management , there is no dearth of misconceptions , especially amongst common folk with medium income . Let 's have a look at some of them . <p> More money means more happiness - Being so , every celebrity would be happy while the reality says something else . Money , fame , fortune - these ca n't really make one happy . Happiness is something that comes from within . It 's something which is completely unrelated to money . When someone is on his death bed , he does n't think about money . <p> Big income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconception . Is there any difference between one who makes $50,000 per year with a $100,000 mortgage and one who makes $500,000 per year with $1 million in mortgage debt ? In reality , debt rises with income . Your positive thought and mentality to repay on time can only keep you out of debt . <p> Money ensures security - This is true to some extent . Money can make your life partially predictable , but you ca n't control your destiny . We all are bobbing in the sea of uncertainty ; no matter how rich you are . <p> Money can buy friends - This is just opposite to what your money can do . Money can attract ample of hangers-on , but it ca n't buy friends . <p> How should we prioritize our debt ? What 's most important to look at ? <p> It may be overwhelming for you when you have so many different types of debt like secured and unsecured debts , loans and credit card debt . Choosing to pay the wrong debt first can be costly , and you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order in which you can follow to make your debt payment without breaking your bank . <p> Now pay unsecured debts like credit card debt and others in an order from highest interest rate to lowest interest rate . <p> If you 're in a lot of debt , what are some good strategies for getting out ? <p> Getting out of debt is not very difficult ; all you need to be a bit strategic . Here are some good strategies to follow which you can get out of existing and delinquent debts without putting in much effort . <p> Increasing monthly minimum payment amount on debts . <p> Create an emergency fund . <p> Make a big payment to just one of existing debt accounts every month until it is paid off completely . <p> Negotiate with the creditor for a lower interest rate . <p> Try to find out ways to put more money on your debt payment . <p> Opt for a debt settlement . <p> Go for credit counseling . <p> More and more of us have substantial student debt . What would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> With President Barack Obama 's latest student loan scheme , " Pay as you can , " about five million borrowers can be affected . Many students are happy with this update , as the new plan allows borrowers both old and new to pay off with a convenient portion of their income , and get exemption from payment further . And thus , it is taking a step towards a much essential direction of relief . <p> On the other hand , a large portion of the student population is not happy with this owing to the loopholes plugging measures because the program has left many big issues unaddressed . It shuts out those students who are earning suitably high but are also carrying a much higher debt than the average lot . Another big issue where the new scheme wo n't work is addressing the question of the tuition fees itself . Unless a plan is evolved to tackle that issue and lessen the tuition charges , the problem with student loan debts will only grow . <p> What are your personal criteria for an investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on ? <p> Investment is one of the most important parts of personal finance or money management . Here is my personal opinion about investment . <p> Set up your investment goals . <p> Understand different investment instruments . <p> Choose a reputed investment broker . <p> Learn different investment strategies . <p> Create your portfolio . <p> Be loyal to your investment strategy . <p> However , above-mentioned criteria are applicable for stock market or mutual fund investments . For general investment , you may follow the below-mentioned strategy . <p> You can enroll in your employer 's 401(k) plan . <p> You must build an emergency fund . <p> f you 're eligible for Roth IRA , you must max it out . This is also applicable for Traditional IRA . 
@@11804769 @404769/ <p> Once someone is already in debt , it 's all too easy to fall into a fiscally unhealthy cycle of crushing interest rates and falling behind on payments , which increases those interest rates and damages their credit score in the process . <p> Debt consolidation can be a godsend once someone has fallen into this cycle by bringing down interest rates to a manageable level and reducing stress in the process . <p> We talked to Ariel Pryor from the financial rehabilitation company **25;150;TOOLONG about debt consolidation and what to look for . - <h> Can you talk a bit about how debt consolidation can help someone improve their credit score and why it 's a good idea ? <p> In our perspective , consolidating one 's debt is less about credit score and more about restructuring to buy time and breathing room to address the fundamental financial health . A family being crushed by high interest payments - most commonly from maxed out credit cards - is often scrambling and doing everything they can conceive to do throughout the month ; only to see themselves fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to month . One 's credit score is known to be impacted by high credit-to-debt ratios , but when people find themselves in such situations , their credit score is typically the least of their concerns . <p> Restructuring your debt through consolidation , as a strategy , can reduce a family 's debt service burden overnight , giving them the breathing room to roll the extra savings into reducing what they owe and freeing up money in their budget to make sure they can pay their bills on time . <p> When someone is living paycheck to paycheck , barely making it with a maxed out budget , it 's an incredibly risky position to be in , where any financial surprises can result in missed payments and shortfalls . Credit scores suffer when this happens . Responsible consolidating to reduce costs is a powerful tool to help people change the trajectory of their finances . - <h> Can you give a rough example of what a high interest rate might be , as opposed to those seen as part of a debt consolidation plan ? <p> From my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest more than you have to , it should be considered high . <p> According to Bankrate , average variable interest rates are presently hovering at roughly 16% . Folks recovering from a bad credit history can commonly see rates on cards in ranges of 23% up to 29.99% APR . If balances get out of hand with rates like that , it is easy to see how the debt service could reach " crushing " levels . <p> In my opinion , there seems to be a need in this industry to over-complicate matters , when all that is really needed is a healthy dose of common sense . <p> Whatever your interest rate is on your current loans and credit lines , if you have a cheaper alternative to hold the debt , it should be considered . If your current credit card charges you 18% , and you have access to another at 14% , what are you waiting for ? Transfer that balance and start paying less . My advice is to seek out and find the lowest cost alternative you can find , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty flexible , as they offer rates from 9%-20% , which can provide a powerful savings opportunity in many cases . Secured loan options can be even more powerful . A home equity line of credit is an incredibly powerful means for families who have the equity in their home to reduce higher cost debts . Ultimately , if setup fees plus interest rate equal savings , then it 's worth considering consolidating what you owe into cheaper credit lines . - <h> Are all debt consolidation plans the same ? <p> Ever heard the expression , " If you have a hammer , everything looks like a nail ? " The goal may be the same for most people who work with a debt consolidation agency , but someone 's financial situation and needs can be as unique as a fingerprint in my opinion . <p> Yes , debt consolidation services usually approach the situation in a similar manner , i.e. counseling , negotiations with creditors , option assessments , etc. ; but how skillfully and aggressively they pursue their clients ' interests can certainly vary dramatically . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than not , there ARE better options than the average debt consolidation agency available to fix your financial problems .

Hard working , good people can fall into a state of what I call " asset blindness . " They can easily lose sight of all the personal and financial assets they possess . <p> In other words , some folks need only to be reminded of better options which may be available , like personal loans to reduce costs , property they could leverage , or other financial programs they may qualify for .

Some people may not be aware of the unresourceful decision-making strategies and approaches to their money matters . In such cases , counseling may be helpful to increase awareness of what they may be doing to sabotage their success . As mentioned above , other people can be so immersed in the struggle they face , it can be helpful to get an outside perspective . However , it 's my opinion most people are more than smart enough to know what 's in their interest . <p> The common assumption is that someone who finds themselves facing debt problems is financially unsophisticated . <p> It 's incredibly condescending to assume someone needs a lesson on basic financial principles or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , hard-working people can often find themselves struggling financially even if they made all the " right " and " responsible " choices .

@@11804775 @404775/ <p> With a shaky economy and the cost of child care on the rise , parents may find themselves with an overstretched dollar . Whether your child attends a daycare center , or you 've opted for in-home care instead , the cost can be overwhelming for many families . <p> So what 's a parent to do ? The following steps can help you streamline your finances and help ensure there 's enough money for all areas of your life , including daycare : <p> 1 . Consider Financial Aid <p> Check to see if your employer offers a- flexible spending account ( FST ) program . This type of plan can help parents set some pre-taxed money aside for daycare costs . Although there is a cap to how much of this money you can contribute to an FST , whatever money you do accumulate can be used for all sorts of child care expenses , including daycare centers , babysitters , live-at-home nannies , and even camp programs . <p> Certain employers will offer dependent care programs , which is essentially the same idea as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you effectively save for daycare costs . <p> 2 .

These- tax credits are subject to income eligibility requirements , and are paid using after-tax income . <p> It 's important to note that if you are already tapping into an FST program with your employer , you can not claim these same expenditures for both an FST and for the child care tax credit .

You should think of your bank as a business partner. <p> - <h> What are some ways that small businesses can benefit from the financial services you offer ? <p> Local businesses are the key to every community .

Banks , including First Bank &amp; Trust , are audited by independent banking analysis firms that rate the strengths of institutions . First Bank &amp; Trust continues to prove its financial strength by consistently being awarded top marks by these independent firms ( including Veribanc and Bauer ) , and the bank 's net income for the first half of 2014 was up 20 percent compared to the same period last year .

Following the collapse , these banks then used the federal government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) to help them regain financial strength . First Bank &amp; Trust never participated in any risky mortgage loans that caused the crisis , they never took TARP money and remained financially strong , safe and trustworthy before , during and after the financial crisis . <p> Making customer service and community sponsorship a number one priority has been the key factor in First Bank &amp; Trust 's success .

@@11804778 @404778/ <h> Planning for Utility Costs in Your Monthly Budget <p> Unless you live in an apartment where utilities are included , you probably groan slightly every month when your utility bill arrives , and you may wonder how you can account for utilities in your monthly budget . <p> It 's difficult to define an " average " utility bill in the United States , because the needs of a house in Orlando are completely different from the needs of a house in Minneapolis . The size of your utility bill depends on the size of your home , how well insulated it is , how many people live there , energy rates in your region , and how careful everyone in the household is with energy usage . <p> A 2013 survey of utilities in US cities found that Memphis , Springfield , MO , Reno , Omaha , and Columbus , OH had the lowest average utility bills , with average monthly bills ranging from $234.40 to $293.95 . But utilities are metered , so how do you plan for them in your monthly budget ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill stubs , you can get an idea how much you spend in a typical month . Your utility company can provide you with a record of your utility bills if you do n't save your stubs , or you can look back over bank statements to find how much you 've been paying . Keep an eye out for anomalies like record heat waves or cold snaps . Note the trends in your utility bills so you 'll have an idea which months make the highest demands on your utility budget . Being prepared can help you fine tune your monthly budget based on typical utility costs . <p> Learn if Your Local Utility Does Budget Billing <p> Many local utilities offer what they term " budget billing " or some variation of that term . What they do is average a couple of years ' worth of utility bills for your home and bill you the same amount each month . Before you sign up , ask if there are any administrative fees associated with the service , and also find out how shortfalls or overages are handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should get a credit on your bill if you 've used less energy than budgeted ( or you may have to make up a shortfall if you use more than budgeted ) . But not all utilities do this , so ask up front . While budget billing does n't give you the satisfaction of low bills during those mild spring or autumn months , it does give you predictability , helping you plan a more accurate monthly budget . <p> Read the Mail Your Utility Companies Send You <p> Electricity and gas providers generally alert customers to trends in utility prices each year . If natural gas prices increase , for example , your gas company may include this information in their periodic newsletters , or it may be covered in a local news story . And you can always call your utility and ask where rates are headed . <p> Be Smart With Energy Usage <p> Lax energy habits cost your family money , but habits can change . The next time you run out of energy-hungry incandescent light bulbs , go ahead and spring for LEDs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use far less energy , and today 's compact fluorescent bulbs come in more eye-friendly colors , so your home does n't have to be cast in a dull , unflattering light . <p> You can have an energy audit done by your local utility company , and it may be free of charge . These are great for pointing out hidden leaks and drafts , which can account for 25 to 30% of an average energy bill . Your home may have obviously drafty places , and you should address these with weather stripping or caulk . <p> Set your water heater at 120 degrees Fahrenheit rather than 140 degrees . This can save you $36 to $61 per year , and reduces the danger of scalding , particularly in households with small children . Replace your furnace or heating / AC system filters every six weeks or so to keep dust from impeding air flow into your system and to help it run more efficiently . Finally , every night before bed , do a walk-through and turn off unused lights and appliances . Over a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly budget is one of the smartest ways to manage money both short term and long term . Energy costs can be tricky to budget for because they fluctuate , but you can do quite a bit to reduce utility costs , and your utility provider may offer monthly average billing so you can avoid billing surprises . Online budgeting tools are great if you are starting a monthly budget , because they help you remember all the things you have to budget for and let you track your progress . Learning to plan for utility costs is a powerful way to make monthly budgeting easier and more effective .

What does it take to be financially literate ? How illiterate are most people ? <p> Financial literacy is a process that most people need to engage in , but a process for which there are too few guides . Most of our parents do n't know how to help . Certainly our teachers and professors are mostly unhelpful guides . Most of the ' experts ' in the media are in fact salespeople in one form or another , so while they can tell you the positive features of what they sell , most are unhelpful in helping us sort out our different options in a suitably skeptical way . <p> Most extremely well-educated people that I know are very uncertain what to do when it comes to financial decisions . Or worse , they have high certainty , but wrong ideas . Both versions of financial illiteracy can be very costly . <p> Financial literacy obtained in one 's early twenties , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million richer at the end of their life .

What are some of the best practices one can employ to become better at investing ? <p> The four biggest determinant of investment results are : <p> Time ( longer is better ) <p> Asset allocation ( risky is better , and for non-experts/non-insiders , diversified is better ) <p> Costs ( lower is better ) <p> Tax advantages ( zero , low , or deferred taxes are better ) <p> A powerful way to combine those four advantages - one that anyone can do but not enough of us do - would be to fund your ( tax advantaged ) retirement accounts ( like an IRA or 401(k) ) , and purchase risky ( 100% equity ) low-cost ( probably index ) mutual funds while still in your twenties . <p> A 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed wealth in his or her old age . In fact , it is impossible not to end up wealthy if a 22 year-old does that for ten years in a row . <p> If you 're not 22 right now , you wo n't have as much time - which is a shame - but it 's probably still worth doing all the steps that I described above at any age . <p> The absence of 50 years of investment growth makes a wealthy old age still likely , but just less guaranteed . <p> Another important best practice is to employ automatic deduction as your main weapon to fund retirement and investment accounts . By that I mean you have to set up a system with your brokerage firm that automatically transfers money from your paycheck or your checking account every month ( or every two weeks , or whatever ) into your retirement and investment accounts . <p> The weird secret is that basically nobody has enough money left over at the end of the month or year for investing . But if we take that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find we do have the money . This is one of those weird psychological tricks that make the difference between being wealthy or not being wealthy in our old age . <p> - <h> There seems to be a battle among many individuals who struggle with paying down debt and trying to save . What kind of advice can you give them ? <p> If we have trouble paying down debt and saving , then we have to employ a series of Jedi mind tricks to get it done . Those Jedi mind tricks could involve three methods : a ) automatic deduction b ) budgeting , and c ) radical transparency . <p> a ) Automatic deduction , which I mentioned above , is probably the most powerful of these . You have to figure out a way to get your money out-of-sight , out-of-mind before you spend it . If you 're in debt , that means setting up automatic payments toward your high interest debt . If you 're trying to save or invest , that means setting up automatic payments out of your checking account and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) Budgeting , which I hate to do - along with 99% of the rest of the planet - is not for me a long-term sustainable solution in itself . But over the short-term , it can actually help you alter your behavior when you start to write down every single freaking , nitpicky little transaction . The act of recording all transactions - even just for a couple of weeks or a month - I believe could change your behavior . That 's because you realize just how many non-essentials you purchase . It gets annoying writing down that packet of tic-tacs , and the latte , and the iTunes download , but then you realize you made $173.52 in non-essential purchases last month . And if you could dedicate the $173 extra to debt payments per month , you might actually be able to get rid your debt in this lifetime . <p> c ) Radical transparency means announcing to your group of friends , or a single friend , or a debt-counseling group , your intention to get debt free in a set amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ updates to your support person . The publically-stated intention , along with the support you will get from the group , may be the Jedi mind trick you need to actually kill your debt . There 's something powerful that AA members have figured out , which is that if you admit your powerlessness , and then you ask for help from an understanding group , you may be able to achieve the previously impossible-seeming task . <p> - <h> What do you think are some of the biggest challenges regarding debt ( getting out of it , staying out of it , paying it off , etc ) ? <p> Debt exists in that psychological area of shame in which , like a cat with a broken leg , we want to hide our injury from others . We do n't want to admit our debts to others , and we do n't want to ask for help . We may even engage in self-destructive behavior - " Hey , let me buy this lunch for everyone ! " - in order to hide our shame . <p> People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they may believe that it 's not possible to reduce or manage their debt , so why even try ? For people for whom this sounds familiar , I 'd recommend a classic from the 1930s called The Richest Man in Babylon . <p> It may seem cheesy at first to the modern reader , but I think it effectively captures the psychology of a debtor 's resistance to getting out of debt . The book also has extremely practical steps toward becoming debt-free and then building wealth . <p> - <h> You say on your site that politicians are able to take advantage of citizens because those citizens are not as aware of financial matters as they should be . Please provide an example of this and how financial literacy can help fix this problem . <p> ' Taking advantage of ' is too strong a phrase . But I think citizens can not properly police their officials if they do n't understand concepts like compound interest , which affects the future growth of government debt , public pension obligations , and Medicare and Social Security obligations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into adulthood with debt from student loans . What advice would you offer to these individuals ? <p> The best situation would be to minimize student loan debt up front , but I suppose that line of thinking would get us talking about unlocked barn doors and horses that have already left the premises . It 's at least worth mentioning , however , that borrowing big sums of money to get a name-brand educational degree may not make as much financial sense as loading up on credits on the cheaper side ( e.g. two years of community college , then transfer ) before purchasing an expensive educational certificate . <p> Once you have a student loan debt , I think the situation has to be tackled with optimism ( student debt can be paid off ) but realism ( you may not be able to pursue your artist 's dream right now ) . <p> Stealing a page from the aforementioned The Richest Man in Babylon , I would suggest students do NOT forget to start an investment account . The author of that book has an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least has the virtue of simplicity . <p> It goes like this : <p> 1 . Arrange your lifestyle such that you can live off of 70% of your take-home pay on a monthly basis . ( I know , I know , this seems impossible . But still , it 's probably your only chance ever of making it all work out in the long run . Basically , yes , we 're talking about rice &amp; beans , a subpar vehicle , and an apartment in a rougher neighborhood than you would prefer . ) <p> 2 . Dedicate the next 20% of your take-home pay to paying off your debts . <p> 3 . Dedicate the final 10% of your take home pay to investments . In the beginning , this should to be channeled to an Individual IRA or 401(k) . <p> When indebted , it seems like step #3 is an impossible kick-in-the-pants suggestion , because there 's no extra money to make this happen . The problem with skipping step #3 , however , is that a student-loan burdened individual may never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By then , it 's twenty years too late to get started . <p> So as impossible as it may seem , my advice for the student loan-indebted recent graduate is to follow all three of the steps above . 70% for living expenses , 20% for debts , 10% for investments . Wash , rinse , repeat , every month . Rice and beans will suck for a while . But wealth will follow . <p> - <h> What are your thoughts on retirement and preparing for retirement ? What about those who have already retired and are scared of outliving their money ? <p> For people who are already putting away money in their tax-advantaged retirement accounts ( IRAs and 401(k)s ) , the most important decision is probably their allocation to risky assets ( like stocks ) vs. non-risky assets ( like bonds ) . The mistake most people make , in my opinion , is to dedicate too much money to the non-risky category . <p> This mistake is exacerbated by 98.75% of all investment advisors who tell their clients to invest in a mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice - which I strongly disagree with - serves the investment advisor well because you will not panic when the market crashes , and therefore you are less likely to fire your investment advisor for losing you money . <p> I think this advice serves the individual less well , since most people would end up far wealthier in the long run if they invested a higher percentage of their assets in the risky category . <p> My further thought process , which owes a heavy debt to the amazing book Simple Wealth , Inevitable Wealth by Nick Murray , goes like this : <p> a ) Retirement accounts , by definition , are long-term investments . Even if you 're already retired , you need retirement money to last many years - often a few decades . <p> c ) Using the historical experience of the last 100 years , we can say the following : with a five-year horizon , stocks beat bonds 70% of the time . With a 10-year horizon , stocks beat bonds 80% of the time . With a 15-year horizon , stocks beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stocks beat bonds 99+% of the time . <p> d ) Because most retirement money is invested for the longest time period , by allocating your retirement money to bonds you are basically saying that you believe that history is no guide at all , " it 's different this time , " and that odds-be-damned , you want to make a very low probability bet . That 's fine , and that 's what 98.75% of investment advisors tell you to do , but personally I think that 's a crying shame and a terrible choice , as well as a way to reduce your wealth in your retirement . <p> e ) Although risky assets ( like stocks ) are extremely volatile in the short and medium run , a longer investment time horizon ( plus automatic deduction dollar-cost averaging ! ) makes equity volatility less of a risk and more of an opportunity . <p> f ) The real risk of investing your retirement money is actually with bonds , an allocation to which - for many people - will cause them to outlive their retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . I understand this is contrary to conventional wisdom and contrary to what 98.75% of all investment advisors say , but that does n't make it any less true . Again , for a more articulate presentation of these ideas a ) through f ) , I highly recommend Nick Murray 's Simple Wealth , Inevitable Wealth . <p> By the way , I 'm not an investment advisor , so I suffer exactly zero consequences for people taking my advice on this topic or not . And that 's precisely why I have credibility on the issue . I 'm not worried about being fired as somebody 's investment advisor when the market crashes . <p> And by the way , the market will definitely crash . I do n't know when , or by how much , but it will crash multiple times over the course of your investing lifetime . The key , however , is to not panic , and instead keep on doing what you were doing . Ideally , this means automatic deduction investing , so that you can dollar-cost average your stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - <h> Please share anything additional that you would like individuals to know about Bankers Anonymous . <p> Oh , and by the way , my book does n't exist yet except on my laptop and in my head . <p> Who wants to pre-order it ? Should I do a Kickstarter campaign ? Or just make it available as an e-book downloadable from my site when I get it all written ? Should I perhaps charge 99 cents per chapter , or $14.99 for the whole thing ? 
@@11804780 @404780/ <h> 5 Types of Businesses That Care About Your Credit Score <p> It 's no secret that a low credit score can have a negative impact on your finances . From getting a sky-high rate on your car loan or being denied a credit card , bad credit can hurt you . Here are some of the types of businesses that care about your credit score , from the obvious , to the lesser known . <p> Why do certain types of businesses care about your credit score ? <p> 1 . Banks <p> Banks and other major lenders use a variety of different information to determine whether or not they will lend you money for a variety of reasons , most notably for mortgages and small business loans . Your credit score is among the most pertinent pieces of information that banks will use to gauge your creditworthiness is your credit score . If you fall below what the bank sees as the standard , the chances of your loan application being denied are great . <p> If you do happen to get approved , you 'll most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan as a means of protecting the bank from engaging in what they consider to be ' risky ' business . Consumers with lower credit scores are believed to be more likely to be delinquent on payments , which is why lenders will slap a high interest rate against the loan , or flat out refuse to loan money in the first place . <p> 2 . Car Dealers <p> Back in the days before the financial crisis hit the US in 2008 , even consumers with terrible credit were still easily able to get financed for a vehicle . Shortly after the crisis , however , it became much more difficult to get financed . Your credit score could be standing in the way of you getting an affordable car loan . Your credit score could even determine whether you can take out a loan at all . With a credit score under 500 , an auto loan may be entirely out of the picture . <p> Just like any other type of loan , a good credit score will help ensure that you qualify for a loan at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto loan , this could mean getting an interest rate as low as 3% . On the other hand , if your credit score is poor , you could wind up with a sky-high interest rate as much as 20% , which will inevitably cost you thousands of dollars more over the life of your car loan . <p> 3 . Insurance Companies <p> Insurance providers often access your credit score reports before underwriting an insurance policy . They use financial history to accurately classify you according to your potential risk . There is a strong link between a consumer 's financial history and his or her potential for future insurance loss . Insurance companies therefore believe the use of a credit score helps them provide an applicant with a policy and premium at a fee that properly reflects the applicant 's specific risk . <p> Various types of companies often look at your credit history to determine whether or not you 'll be approved for their services . <p> Having a healthy credit score can often result in a much cheaper insurance premium compared to a consumer with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your credit score is a potential indicator of how you might act , including how likely you are to be delinquent on insurance premium payments .

Utility Companies <p> Believe it or not , but utility companies also have a vested interest in your credit score . These firms may require you to put down a hefty cash deposit or supply a letter of guarantee in order to be eligible for their services if your credit score is low . These items basically act as a promise that the utility company will be compensated in some way should you not pay your bills . <p> 5 . Cell Phone Service Providers <p> In much the same way that utility companies care about your credit , so do cell phone service providers .

Were not supposed to discuss openly how much we make , how much we owe , or what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tends to cloak money in a way that makes it seem mysterious and a little frightening . <p> While I 'm not encouraging you to brag about your income level , I am encouraging you to be more open when it comes to money . Do n't  be afraid to look at what you make or what you owe dead on . <p> Take the time to compare the two so that you can clearly see if something is amiss . If your debt is so substantial that you feel you 'll have to work two lifetimes to pay it off , something needs to change . <p> Getting over a fear of money might mean you need to find someone to talk to about your concerns . A financial counselor or advisor who can give you worthwhile advice is a good place to start . <p> You can also discuss your concerns with your partner or with a family member you trust , though I 'd advise you to take care in that case . Sometimes the money advice of loved ones is more harmful than helpful . <h> You Work Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending money because they feel they worked very hard to get it . While saving money is always a good idea , you also need to spend it from time to time . <p> For example , you cant continue to wear a suit that 's easily two sizes too small . When your shoes wear out , you 'll need to shell out to get a new pair . <p> One way to overcome a fear of spending money that 's linked to your hard work is to think of spending wisely as a way of celebrating your hard work . <p> You spend 40 hours a week , if not more , at your job . You deserve the opportunity to celebrate from time to time , or at the very least , the opportunity to wear a suit that fits and to own a pair of shoes that keep out dirt and water . <h> Concern About Overspending <p> Another reason why people worry about spending their money is that they fear they will spend so much , they wo n't have any money to pay for the things they really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want to blow the money you need to pay for a car repair on a new pair of shoes you do n't  need . It is preferable to be cautious about spending your money than to throw all caution to the wind . But , your fear of overspending can get in the way of the rest of your life . <p> If worrying about a major catastrophe keeps you from purchasing items you do need to live comfortably , think about setting up an emergency fund . Your fund should ideally cover six to eight months of living expenses . <p> If your car breaks down , the fund should have enough money to cover repairs . Think of your emergency fund as your grown-up security blanket . Anytime you feel an attack of your money phobia coming on , just think of your emergency savings and you should start to calm down . <h> Moneys Complicated <p> One final reason why people have a fear of money : they do n't  understand it . A lot of money terms can make financial matters seem more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds can be downright confusing for absolute beginners . <p> When engaging in any sort of complicated financial transactions , such as taking out a mortgage , read the paperwork carefully . Then , feel free to ask questions about any terms or conditions you do n't  understand . <p> Jargon and wording can make money matters seem more inaccessible that they really are . Working with people who know their stuff when it comes to money matters and being willing to ask questions will help you get over your fear of the " M word . " <p> Of course , while you do n't  want a fear of spending money to rule your life , you also do n't  want to completely throw caution to the wind when it comes to money matters . Do n't  fear money so much that you cant enjoy life , but also , do n't  be so carefree with your money that you spend yourself out of house and home . <p> Kelly Anderson is a financial planner who blogs about financial advice you can use in your everyday life .

They spoke with us about personal finance and working on your finances as a team . <p> How did you start your conversation about finances as a couple ? <p> Jacob has been obsessed with personal finance since college , which is when we met . We knew each other for a few years before we were married , so we knew we were compatible when it came to our financial goals and desired lifestyle . However , when we got married we had about $20,000 worth of student loan debt combined . When we realized this , we knew that all the ideals we espoused about a frugal and debt-free marriage would have to become a reality . Coincidentally , that was when we started Cash Cow Couple and began our journey into debt freedom , which was accomplished , and continues on into financial independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Technically , no , we had no problems . However , relationally it was a challenge , as is expected with most new couples . Vanessa was used to shopping , going out to eat and buying gifts for her family , even if they were n't on sale . Once we were married , we decided to almost completely cease going out to eat , shop only at clearance racks and cut the amount spent on gifts by over 65% . It was difficult at first to cut back , but now that she has developed new habits , it 's easy to spend less . <p> What would you say to couples who feel they argue too much about money ? <p> You have to be on the same page financially . Couples who fight about money often have differing opinions , money habits and financial goals , and this will never work . As long as you are holding hands and walking in different directions , neither of you will get where you want to go , and the fighting will continue . Sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financially . This will require you to make some sacrifices and compromises , but having joint goals and a plan to obtain those goals , along with being resolved to work together , is the only way to eliminate arguing about money and to progress your marriage instead of self destruct . <p> How do you balance having fun with fiscal responsibility ? <p> This is easy . Being financially responsible has never meant that you ca n't do anything fun . We are not financially responsible because we hate fun , but because we hate waste . If there is something we 'd really like to do , that 's great . We do it . But before we do , we research and make sure we are getting the best deal available . We 'd hate to run to the first available option only to realize that we could have gotten the exact same thing for half price . <p> For instance , we are going on a vacation in August . Unlike normal travelers who buy their plane tickets , hotels , meals and entertainment at full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodging , Groupons for food and entertainment , and taking advantage of fun and free things to do in the area . It 's all the same fun at less than half the price . We 'd feel foolish if we did n't take advantage of these deals because we think doing a little research and keeping an eye out for frugal fun is easy and at the same time fiscally responsible . <p> What advice do you have for couples planning a wedding on a budget ? <p> There are hundreds of tips and tricks for planning a wedding on a budget . However , my three favorite pieces of advice are : <p> Keep it small : It 's easy to get carried away with the invite list . I know you do n't want to exclude anyone , but you 've got to draw the line somewhere . By keeping the guest list small , you eliminate excess from every part of your budget and can instead focus on the things that really matter to you on your special day . <p> Do n't even peek at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go visit that swanky reception hall , do n't try on that gorgeous dress that 's $500 over budget and do n't even consider that honeymoon that you 'll still be paying for on your one-year anniversary . Comparison to something better than what you have is a one-way ticket to unhappiness , so just do n't do it . Not only will you be less satisfied with your budgeted wedding , but you 'll be more likely to overspend . <p> Shop around and do n't be afraid to negotiate prices : Do n't be afraid to talk to several vendors in each category of your budget . The wedding industry is highly competitive , so , for instance , if your top three florists know that you have been talking to the other ones , they will be more likely to offer discounts or add-ons because they want to keep your business . They would rather cut their profit margin than lose the sale to a competitor . <p> What do you see as the future of personal finance ? <p> It 's our goal that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of spending less than is earned . That 's the only way to build wealth and find freedom from the heavy burden of debt . So many lives could be transformed by the simple act of eliminating consumer debt and then building a year 's worth of living expenses . Individuals would worry less about work , and they would fight less with their spouse at home . These ideas sound radical at the moment , but I 'm hoping for a more frugal future .

@@11804785 @404785/ <h> An Introduction to the 401(k) <p> Before investing in a retirement plan it will be highly beneficial for employees to understand what 's a 401k and how it works for them . The traditional 401k is one which employers provide to their workers by taking some money out of each paycheck to contribute to their personal account . In addition , many participating employers also contribute money to the worker 's 401k plan , often matching the employee 's contribution . When employers match their employees ' contributions , this is called a matching 401k . The traditional 401k is a stock investment plan , which means the money invested in a 401k is used to buy a set of stocks for an investment portfolio . When an employee invests in a pre-tax 401k plan , they incur some tax benefits , which include not owing any Federal income taxes on income that is invested in the 401k . In addition , money is automatically added to the employee 's 401k account from each paycheck , so they are n't required to take action to ensure contributions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is a pension plan , which means that it is income that workers set aside for their retirement years .

It is named after a section in the IRS tax code which came into existence through the Revenue Act of 1978 . Even though financial planners were aware of the new Revenue Code 401(k) , it was n't until 1981 that the IRS explained the rules for taking advantage of the new system . In the beginning , few companies offered this benefit to their employees , but by 2005 , the 401k defined contribution pension plan became the most common private-market retirement plan offered by employers in the United States .

There are limits to how much employees and employers can contribute to a person 's 401k , however . According to IRS law , an employer can only contribute twenty-five percent of the employee 's yearly income . The individual , on the other hand , can contribute up to $50,000 of their annual income to their 401k as of 2012 , or the equivalent of their yearly salary , if it is under $50,000 . <p> While 401k account holders do not get assessed taxes for the income that they put into their 401k at the time of contribution , there are restrictions that apply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retirement incurs a tax penalty of ten percent .

So they created Payment Evolution , an online payroll app specifically tailored for small businesses . <p> Small businesses need every advantage at their disposal to go head-to-head with the majors . Sam took a moment to tell us about Payment Evolution , and why saving time and money on payroll is mandatory . <p> - <h> How did Payment Evolution get started ? What differentiates you from other payment services that are out there ? <p> We started a bit more than 5 years ago .

Small businesses could never afford the capital cost of an SAP implementation , but it did n't mean that their needs were any simpler .

When looking back at the tax history of the United States , there have been numerous changes leading to the current state of taxes . This has often coincided with changes in the government as well as changes in the overall state of the country .

Its purpose was to help the Union pay for the Civil War . The tax bill , which was called the Revenue Act of 1861 , called for a three percent tax on incomes of over $800 ; however , it never went into affect . Another income tax bill was passed by the Union in 1862 , which also played a part in the history of estate tax in this country by reinstating the estate tax in efforts to fund the Civil War . It would , ten years later , be declared unconstitutional . This tax bill was signed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on incomes no lower than $600 and no higher than $10,000 .

In 1863 , the Confederacy authorized income taxes on incomes that were over $1,000 . The history of U.S. income tax that is most often considered the first income tax occurred with the passing of the 16th Amendment . The 16th Amendment was passed in 1909 by Congress and was ratified in 1913 . It allows the collection of Federal income taxes without distributing the money with the states . <p> President Franklin D. Roosevelt was the source of other major changes in tax history .

" Rather than seeing wealth as something looted or distributed , Rand conceived of it as being earned and produced . In America , the embodiment of financial wealth is the US dollar , also known as the buck and the greenback . It seems fitting , then , to reflect on the origins of the dollar both where it came from and how it evolved into the fiat currency that it is today . <h> Early Origins <p> Contrary to general assumptions , the dollar existed before the United States was an independent and unified nation . Prior to the Declaration of Independence , the Continental Congress had authorized the government to issue dollars and coins for use as widely accepted tender amongst the thirteen British colonies . The term " dollar " itself actually owes to Spanish currency of the time , specifically the eight-real coin ( also known as the Spanish dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their Spanish counterparts which were accepted as legal tender until 1857 during colonial times . In fact , the dollar wasnt the only monetary system vying for widespread use in colonial America . In the Dutch New Netherland ( New York ) colony , for example , the lion dollar was the currency of choice . However , the U.S. dollar began separating itself from the pack following a Congressional resolution on August 8 , 1786 . <p> It was Alexander Hamiltons leadership at the treasury department , however , which truly cemented the dollars status as the basic unit of account in the U.S. with the passage of the Coinage Act of 1792 . The act mandated that a " dollar " be between 371 and 416 grains of silver and an " eagle " be between 247 and 270 grains of gold . ( An eagle was said to be with 10 dollars , and a dollar worth one-tenth of an eagle . ) Here , again , we see the influence of Spanish dollars on the fledgling American currency , as Hamilton based these silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This act also commissioned the opening of a mint in Philadelphia , then the capital of the nascent country . Incidentally , the mint was the first federal building opened with authority from the United States Constitution . <p> Interestingly , the practice of putting presidents on the front of U.S. dollars is a rather modern tradition , beginning only in the early 1900s . George Washington , the president most readily identified with the dollar , scoffed at the idea of using his face on money . To Washington , the very notion smacked of European monarchical tradition . As for the ubiquitous dollar sign ( $ ) , various theories have been proposed to explain its emergence . Rand , for instance , claimed that the dollar sign represented " U " and " S " superimposed , although this theory is questionable because the dollar sign predates the formation of the U.S. as an independent nation . Other theories reference the coat of arms found on Spanish colonial currency or suggest that it is nothing but an evolved scribal abbreviation for Spanish and Mexican pesos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians remain divided on the exact origin . <h> The Gold Standard <p> Realizing that pieces of paper had no intrinsic value ( and the inflationary dangers this posed ) the U.S. government eventually put the dollar on what is known as a gold standard . Essentially , this meant that every dollar in circulation was " backed " by a certain amount of gold that citizens could demand in exchange for their dollars . The gold standard became law in 1900 with the passage of the Gold Standard Act , which aimed to , " define and fix the standard of value , to maintain the parity of all forms of money issued or coined by the United States , to refund the public debt , and for other purposes " , according to HistoryCentral.com . Specifically , the Act mandated that each dollar in circulation be valued at $20.67 per ounce of gold . Under such a system , the treasury could not simply print money on whim , but only when and if there were sufficient gold reserves . While the gold standard did indeed restrain inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting to changing circumstances like wars and recessions . The standard was suspended twice during World War 1 , for example , because European entities began owing by U.S. corporations in the form of gold . Thus began a massive gold outflow that continued unabated until the New York Stock Exchanged closed in 1914 and the gold standard was put on hold . To its credit , the U.S. restored the gold standard when the NYSE re-opened in December of that year , making the U.S. the only nation in the world to maintain its gold standard by that time . <p> It was not to last , however . When the Great Depression set in , currency speculators began demanding gold in exchange for their dollars en masse . While the Federal Reserve raised interest rates in an attempt to protect the gold standard , bank runs persisted throughout the early 1930s . Finally , in 1933 , President Franklin Delano Roosevelt suspended the standard and revoked gold as universal legal tender for debts . Interestingly , even this suspension was considered to be temporary at the time it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restoration of the gold standard permanently on the back burner in terms of political importance . Nevertheless , the U.S. dollars relationship to gold grew more and more tenuous over the years . <p> The dollars we all use today operate independently of gold prices or any precious metals of intrinsic value . This is known as " fiat currency " that is , the dollars value is only that which we collectively ascribe to it . Insofar as we value , accept and seek dollars as compensation , they have and will continue to have value . Transformation of the U.S. dollar into a fiat currency began in earnest in 1963 , when the words " payable to bearer on demand " were left out of all newly printed Federal Reserve notes . Holders of pre-1963 currency could still redeem it for gold until 1968 , when redemption was discontinued . Additionally , 1965s Coinage Act stopped the practice of using silver in quarters and dimes , which were composed 90% of silver prior . In sum , this means that all of the roughly $829 billion worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 is redeemable for and intrinsically worth precisely nothing . The " real " value of U.S. currency begins and ends with the value of the paper it is printed on . <p> Despite being a fiat currency , the U.S. dollar serves as a sort of barometer for the health of the worlds financial system . Today , entire countries ( such as Panama , the British Virgin Islands and El Salvador ) peg their currency to the dollar just as the U.S. once pegged the dollar to gold ; others go so far as using dollars in lieu of or alongside their own currencies . Evidently , the fact that the the dollar is backed by nothing but " the full faith and credit of the United States government " is convincing enough for our citizens and the rest of the world . Whether faith in the dollar will withstand unprecedented debt spending and a shaky world economy , however , is a question yet to be answered . 
@@11804792 @404792/ @qwx171675 <h> The Dangers of Leverage and Some Solutions <p> Most investors and traders have heard of leverage , and can fall into two camps on the subject . Some believe that it is smart or sophisticated to invest using OPM ( other people 's money ) , which just means borrowing to invest . Others see leverage as higher risk . <p> When you use leverage , the numbers seem compelling . The most popular form of leverage is to trade on margin . You borrow money from the brokerage house and double your potential investments . Brokerages are required to maintain 50 percent equity in margin accounts , so if you have $5,000 in cash , you can invest up to $10,000 . Half of it is margin funds ( borrowed money ) . <h> The power of leverage <p> So in support of leverage , here is the argument : If a stock is worth $50 per share , just buying 100 shares and using all of your cash , - you make $300 if the stock price goes up three points . But if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise brings in $600 , or twice as much . <p> That sounds great . Where do I sign up ? <h> But there 's a dark side <p> But wait a minute . Now look at the other side of the leverage equation . If your $50 stock loses three points , you are down $300 and shares are only worth $47 . If you used margin and bought 200 shares , the three-point drop takes your value down $600 . <p> Something else also happens here . Your $10,000 investment fell to $9,400 , but half of the original , or $5,000 , was borrowed and you still have to pay that back . But based on current value of $9,400 , you are only allowed to borrow half , or $4,700 . So you will get a margin call , a demand for you to deposit $300 more in your account to maintain that 50% ratio between your money and your leveraged money . <h> Some safety measures <p> The truth is , leverage through a margin account increases your risk and can rapidly destroy your capital 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solutions to help mitigate that risk : <p> 1 . Buy safe value investments if you must use margin . <p> 2 . In volatile times , if you are allowed to trade options in your account , buy a put to protect your stock 's value ( a put increases in value point for point with losses in stock that has fallen below the put 's strike price ) . This creates a form of insurance until the put expires . <p> 3 . Use call and put options to control 100 shares of stock but without having to buy 100 shares . Options can be bought for a very small price , about 5% of the value of stock , but their prices change in the same manner as 100 shares . You have to be knowledgeable in the options market before your broker will allow you to trade , but if you gain that knowledge , options can address the risk of leverage . <p> The bottom line of leverage is this : Leveraged positions grow faster than all-cash , but they also lose value faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not accept leverage risk , you should avoid it completely .

Rare are those instances in which entire economies are disrupted to the point typically as a result of rampant inflation , or hyper inflation that an entire form of currency is discarded , reformed or replaced . But it does happen . There are invariably external issues ( military , political , etc ) at play , - which result in what can generally be referred to the failure of a currency , and each situation is unique . The following is a list of nine notable examples in which currencies became so devalued that they were eventually replaced : <p> By the end of 1922 Germany found it was no longer able to pay the war reparations set forth by the Treaty of Versailles . French and Belgian armies responded by occupying Germanys most productive , and industrial regions . German industrialists then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already frail economy . The German government countered this situation by printing unbacked currency with which it meant to pay both workers benefits , as well as its delinquent international debt . Supply and demand followed : too much money was circulated , and the money was soon considered worthless . In 1922 , the largest denomination of the Papiermark was 50,000 . A year later it was 100 Trillion . This means that by December 1923 , the exchange rate with the US Dollar was 4.2 Trillion to 1 . It is estimated that by November 1923 , the yearly inflation rate was considered 325,000,000% . This means that the cost of goods were increasing about every two days . As a result , the Rentenmark was introduced at a rate of 1 to 1 Trillion of the Papiermark . Reparation payments eventually continued , and France and Belgium agreed to leave the country . <p> The Great Depression put an initial strain on the Austrian Pengo , originally introduced with great strength as a replacement to the Austrian-Hungarian Korona in 1926 , per the Treaty of Versailles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run their course . In 1944 , the Hungarian Pengos highest denomination was the 1,000 note . A year later it was 10,000,000 . And by mid-1946 , it was **27;177;TOOLONG . Realizing that this type of hyperinflation and denomination increase was not sustainable and after 20 short years the Pengo was replaced by the Forint . There are famous pictures of this event , which include street sweepers cleaning the sea of Pengo notes that Hungarians so eagerly discarded . At the time of this replacement , the Pengo to Forint exchange , was Four Hundred Octillion ( Thats 29 Zeros ) to one . That same Forint would exchange for 11.74 to $1USD . Inflation has since continued at a much more subdued rate , and the current exchange is valued at approximately 195.2 Forint to 1 $USD . It is estimated that at the time of replacement , the value of all Hungarian currency in circulation equaled less than one-thousandth of one US dollar ! <p> After unprecedented annual growth rates and record trade surpluses , panic and political unrest broke out between Argentine Trotskyists and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis . Conflict came to a head in 1975 , when a sharp recession looked inevitable . The Argentine government then exacerbated the situation by refusing to borrow in order to cover its budget and trade deficits . In 1975 , the largest Argentine Peso denomination was 1,000 . A year later the 5,000 note was introduced . In March 1976 , a violent coup was staged by the countrys military leaders , who promised to bring stability to the region . By 79 , there was a 10,000 Peso banknote and by 1981 , the Argentine Central Bank had introduced a 1,000,000 Peso note . The countrys economy declined , further worsening the situation in between 1981 and 1982 , Argentinas GDP fell 12% , the worst single year decline since The Great Depression . When the currency was reformed in 1983 , 1 Peso Argentino was exchanged for 10,000 of the " old " Peso . Then in 1985 , the Austral was introduced , which replaced the Peso Argentino at a rate of 1-to-1,0000 Then yet again , in 1992 , the New Peso replaced the Austral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience in many circles referred to as , " The March of Zeros " equated to a 1 New Peso equal to 100,000,000,000 Pre-83 Pesos . <p> During the 1980s , Peru , like many Latin American countries introduced a number of trade liberalization polices . At the same time , government increased public spending , privatized enterprise , and neglected to service the nations external debt . As a result , by the end of the 1990s , Perus already small economy which once had been enticing avenue for foreign direct investment was experiencing not only negative economic growth , but also deficits of all types , as well as hyperinflation . While hyperinflation became apparent , the Peruvian government replaced the Peru " Old " Sol with the Inti , in 1985 , at a rate of 1,000 to 1 . The largest denomination of this new currency , was a 1,000 note . In two years , monthly inflation would increase by a rate of 132% in September 1988 , and later 400% by September 1990 .

In answer to this sharp increase inflation , the government simply removed six zeros , meaning that the " Newer " Dinar replaced the " Old Dinar " at a rate of 1 to 1,000,000 . In the next year the currency was replaced yet again , this time at the rate of 1 to 1,000,000,000 ! By January 1995 , prices had increased a quadrillion percent in two years , and as a result the German Mark became the countrys Fiat currency . It is estimated that during the height of hyperinflation ( December 1994 ) , inflation was increasing by a rate of 100% per day .

We ca n't simply go on with " business as usual . " We need a better way of doing business ; one that benefits society not destroys it . <p> How do we keep our integrity in our businesses ? <p> Never lose sight of the big picture .

Free tools like Mint.com can help them track finances , plan a budget and manage their money effectively , at zero cost . That means more money is directed toward their social mission . <p> Can anyone be an entrepreneur ? <p> Anyone can be an entrepreneur , but not everyone is going to be a successful one . To start with , you need to have a good idea ; preferably something that has n't been done before . You also have to be wiling to take " no " for an answer a lot . Be nimble . Be resourceful . Be brave . And ultimately , be ready to fail before you succeed . 
@@11804798 @404798/ <h> Money Management Dos and Don'ts for Investing in CDs <p> Even the simplest money management strategy should include diversification . Nodiv should have all their wealth tied up in one type of asset , where a financial disaster affecting that asset could do major damage . Money management should involve choosing ways to save and invest that balance out your personal tolerance for risk and reward . One investment you probably have n't heard about much in recent years is the certificate of deposit , or CD . <p> What Are CDs ? <p> A CD is a type of savings account that holds a pre-set amount of money for a fixed time period , typically six months , one year , or five years . The issuing bank pays interest over the term of the CD . When the term is up , you cash in your CD and receive your original investment plus interest . If you buy your CD through a federally insured bank , your CD and other accounts in that bank are insured up to $250,000 total . ( In other words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a " per account " basis . ) <p> Risks and Benefits of CDs <p> CDs are simple and safe , but they do n't get a lot of press . People shy away from CDs when they expect interest rates to go up . Who wants to lock a bunch of money away for five years at 2% when interest rates are expected to increase to 3% ? When interest rates are low , rates on CDs do n't look that great . They may be only a little higher than what 's offered on regular savings accounts , and unlike your regular savings account , you ca n't take money out of a CD that has n't matured without paying a penalty . <p> Other than interest rates increasing once you 've locked money into a five-year CD , the biggest risk with CDs is what happens if you need to get that money out early . On average , the penalty for taking money out of a long term CD early is about six months ' worth of interest . But- Bankrate found that penalties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount withdrawn , and that 's enough to hurt . <p> CDs are n't right for every money management strategy , however . CDs can be- especially beneficial for people who are well-off already , people without children , and retirees . Wealthy people like CDs because they reward larger , longer term investments with higher interest rates , and wealthy people can afford to lock up more money for longer terms . Child-free people , who do n't have to worry about the costs of raising kids , tend to have the financial freedom that makes CDs a smart part of their money management strategy . And retirees like CDs because they 're safe at a time in life when taking big financial risks is n't wise . These are n't the only groups that can benefit from CDs . Depending on your money management position , they could be a good idea for you , even if you have kids or do n't have a lot to invest . <p> You already have a healthy emergency fund .

No matter what the financial goal may be , Spencer offers advice on how to achieve it . Though his site is geared towards those in the military , civilians can gain a great deal from it as well . Spencer took the time to talk with us about saving , spending and looking towards the future . <p> It sounds as if you 've been on top of finances since high school . Did your parents influence you to do this , or did you decide on your own ? <p> My parents had a big influence on my early financial decisions , but they let me make my own decisions . Growing up , my dad and I frequently discussed stocks , real estate , and investing . My dad subscribed to- The Wall Street Journal and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they came in . As a child , I collected a dollar or two in allowance every week , and I always saved at least a quarter of it , if not all of it . I was always doing the math to see when I would have $100 and could buy a new video game , Lego , or bike . My parents always encouraged me to save for large purchases , sometimes by offering to match whatever I saved . <p> I worked a few part-time jobs as soon as I turned 16 and had my first real summer internship at age 18 . That was the first year I maxed out my Roth IRA . I had done the math on compounding interest and knew that the earlier I started , the more money I would have sooner . I did n't really know what the goal was . I just knew that having more money gave me more choices . It was only later in my 20s that I started seriously studying personal finance and financial independence . <p> My parents are great role models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their income , and do n't spend frivolously . The 2008 crash was tough on my dad 's business , but he worked hard and persevered through it . My mom always cooked homemade meals for us , which kept our food budget under control . Once we kids were all in high school , she went back to work to help us get through college . The example they set for me significantly influenced my decisions as a young adult . <p> How do you see other 20-somethings around you spending ? <p> The usual things 20-somethings buy . Cars , houses , skis , cellphones . These are n't necessarily bad things . In fact , who cares what they 're spending their hard-earned money on ? What 's more important is if they are investing and letting compounding interest go to work for themselves early . Whenever you receive money , whether it 's a paycheck or a windfall , you can decide to spend that money on a depreciating asset ( car , cellphone , clothes , video games ) or you can invest that money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to buy something ! But when you really analyze your budget , I think you 'll be shocked at how much fluff you can cut out and begin investing . <p> You can use your 20s to set yourself up for financial independence , or you can take on loads of debt and barely invest any of your paycheck . Either choice may make you happy , but I think setting yourself up with choices later in life is worth not blowing your entire paycheck every month . For me and my wife , we 've been steadily increasing our investing rate to the 50% mark since we got married . As my military pay increases and we pay off my student loan debt , this gets easier every year . <p> I think a lot of people see their paycheck as 90% spending money , instead of an opportunity to begin investing and growing their assets and net worth . I think if you see the charts of how quickly you can achieve financial independence with a substantial savings rate , you would make investing a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years if you save 50% of your income , which is just a few years shy of a 20-year military retirement . With a moderate savings rate ( 15-25% of income ) and the military pension , there 's are n't many reasons you should n't be able to be financially independent in your 40s as a veteran . <p> You set up a priority list which you 've seen change over the years . What advice can you give on setting a priority list of spending/saving ? <p> If you want to grow your wealth , you have to make it easy to save and hard to spend . Set up your paycheck to auto-deposit into your 401(k) or TSP . Have your Roth IRA contributions automatically pulled from your checking account . Do n't get a credit card until you know how to pay it off every month and you can manage your spending with it online with a site like Mint.com . Debit cards are an excellent way to have the convenience of a credit card without the danger of spending more than you can afford . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage that we would minimize our biggest expenses : housing and transportation . Our mortgage is well below our BAH ( Basic Allowance for Housing ) , allowing us to pocket the difference in my housing stipend . We also only have one car , but we live in a city where everything is only a short walk away . It 's these kinds of choices that can make the difference between struggling to save 10% of your pay and easily saving 50% of your income . <p> I recommend that everyone look at your expenses and compare dollars spent for happiness gained . For us , we love our mobile phones and get the latest and greatest Android every two years . It 's worth it to us to drop $600 every two years . But we do n't have time to watch TV , so we do n't pay for cable and instead watch Netflix or other free online sites . That saves us much more than $600 per year . It 's these small choices that add up to a massive difference over the months and years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying life now . How do you find that happy medium ? <p> In my experience , most people ( myself included ) adjust their spending to whatever their current income is . Whether they are making $24,000/year or $100,000/year , it 's easy to get to the end of the month and ask : " where did it all go ? " This is why tracking your expenses as well as automating your investments is so crucial . When your 401(k)/TSP , Roth IRA , and other investment accounts have already been topped off before you begin spending your paycheck , you 'll automatically adjust your spending . It 's incredible how it works , but it really does work . <p> When you automate your investments and just live on the remainder , you quickly discover what really makes you happy . I think a lot of people do n't realize what makes them actually happy . For me , family , friends , good food , and a good book are all it takes to keep me happy . Notice that none of these things cost very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiing , flying a private aircraft , or other expensive hobbies . I can enjoy those hobbies knowing that half my paycheck is getting invested , automatically , every month , without any input from me . It 's very liberating ! <p> How can someone who is already deep in debt work themselves out ? Or maybe an easier question is , how do they get started working out of it ? <p> Commit yourself to the goal , cut expenses , increase your income , and be consistent . The actual process to get of debt is easy , it 's the follow-through that is hard . Just like making saving easy and spending hard , you need to make your debt repayment easy and adding additional debt or spending your extra payments hard . Make your loan payments automatic and substantial . <p> Do n't just make the minimum payments . Be aggressive with your payments and destroy that debt ! Whatever amount you think you can afford to make extra payments , add 10% and round up to the nearest hundred . Paying down debt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar of your paycheck goes makes it worth it . And that 's the ultimate goal with casting off your debt . Deciding where you 'll spend or invest every dollar you earn . <p> Three years ago , my wife and I had $100,000 of student loans when we married . She worked for a year and saved every penny until we paid off her entire $40,000 loan in one payment . That felt great ! My loan today sits around $26,000 , so we paid off around $74,000 in the last three years . We would have it completely paid off , but the interest rate is now less than 3% , so we 've decided to prioritize investing instead . <p> One of my biggest financial regrets is taking out so many loans for college . I think our nation does a disservice to our youth by saddling them with substantial debt obligations before they even make their first paycheck . Other nations have figured out much better ways to manage student loans than we have in the States . However , now that I 've accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it 's paid off . It should be about two years from now ! <p> My best advice for debt is : never , except for a home mortgage . <p> What are some easy to remedy mistakes you see young adults doing in their financial lives ? <p> Start investing now ! Not tomorrow , not next month , but now ! The longer you wait , the more opportunities you miss for compounding interest to go to work for you . There 's a chart that shows if you invest $2,000/month throughout your 20s and then stop investing versus $2,000/month throughout your 30s , 40s , and 50s - guess who has more by age 60 ? The one who invested in their 20s . There are a lot of competing interests for your dollars . If you make investing a priority , you will reap the benefits later in life . <p> I think a lot of young people overextend themselves as well . When you take on car loans , a mortgage , and you 're still paying off your student loan debt , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your monthly paycheck and does n't give you options . Before you sign up for any recurring monthly bill , just think of the future earnings you are foregoing because you 're not investing that amount monthly . When you start to think of every dollar that you receive as either a dollar to spend or a dollar to invest , it changes your perspective . Investing becomes the obvious choice because without building your assets , you 'll never free yourself from having to trade your time for money . <p> As an officer in the US Air Force , your site is primarily geared to those in the military . Can civilians benefit from your advice , too ? <p> I hope so ! I write to a military audience because that 's what I know . The military financial world is different from civilians in many respects including taxes , pay raises , retirement options , and investment options . We receive un-taxed allowances , serve in un-taxed combat zones , and collect special hazardous duty pays depending on our job and location . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilian world . <p> With my site , I hope to demonstrate that even on a fixed salary set by Congress , it 's possible to achieve the dream of financial independence .

I 'm on my way to my financial goals , and I want to share what I learn along the way with military service members and civilians both .

However , corporations must allocate income and loss based on ownership percentages , while an LLC 's operating agreement controls that allocation . <p> A recent addition to our incorporation offerings is the option to operate as a benefit corporation . This structure allows entrepreneurs to pursue social goals as well as profits , while offering the tax benefits and personal liability protection of traditional corporations . <p> Business owners should consider the characteristics of different types of formations , to determine what business structure is best for their company between LLC , C Corp , S Corp , non-profit and other entity types .

Good standing is critical , as losing this status can result in lost business and even a company being dissolved . Partnering with an expert for compliance services , including business licenses and ensuring all state filing and fee deadlines are met , will ensure a business owner does n't have to face the negative consequences of falling out of compliance . This becomes especially important as businesses grow and expand into new states , as filing deadlines will vary by state and small businesses must meet the requirements for each state in which they do business . <p> In your post " 10 Steps to Starting a Small Business , " you recommend preparing a business plan as an important first step .

Hell , that amount sounds downright payable given the right amount of time . <p> Except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Instead , you should likely pay attention to the average credit card debt held by indebted households ( the ones with unpaid credit card balances stretching out over several months or longer ) . <p> After all , there 's a good chance you ARE one of those households . When solely focused on the indebted , the average American credit card debt shoots up to $15,252 . <p> And the worst part is , these averages have stayed roughly the same for over three years , meaning we as a people are no closer to telling credit card debt to go screw than we were in 2010 . <p> More than likely , we will still owe roughly this much in 2017 and beyond . <p> How do we know this ? <p> Because our average debt has n't  been much lower than this in a long , long time , and the only time it changed was to go up . <p> Around January 2009 , a few months after the market crashed and it became clear as day we were recessing and recessing hard , our average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that year , there began a sharp , sharp drop in debt that spiraled downward until October of 2010 , when it hit the 15K mark .

And if so , whyd we stop at $15,000 ? <p> The answers are simple : no , and we did n't  . <p> That drop from late 2009 to late 2010 was largely due to banks writing off massive amounts of debt they knew was noncollectable . <p> Off the books , off the charts , and down go the numbers .

Much of what constitutes sound money management has to do with common sense , and many good money management practices can be adopted with relative ease . Here are 10 money management mistakes that can hurt you , and how to avoid them . <p> 1 . Lifestyle Inflation <p> Say you get a 10% raise . Your may unthinkingly " improve " your lifestyle by 10% , whatever that means to you . Maybe you start eating 10% more meals out , or buy 10% more console games . Resisting this urge is one of the smartest things you can do , particularly if you have big goals like buying a house , paying off a car loan , or putting kids through college . <p> 2 . Stopping Retirement Contributions When Times Are Tough <p> When a partner loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , it can be very tempting to stop retirement contributions to cope with increased financial demands . But this should be a last resort , after trying to reallocate resources in other ways , like by taking on extra work shifts , cutting expenses , or parking the nice car in favor of the cheaper-to-run " beater " car . <p> 3 . Paying Bills Late <p> There are all sorts of ways to avoid paying bills late . Automatic bill payment is an option , as is " budget billing " for utilities . You can also have your phone 's calendar alert you a few days before bills are due . Easy-to-use budget apps like Mint can send text alerts for bills and also make tracking bill payments a snap . <p> 4 . Paying Unnecessary Bank Fees <p> Avoiding out-of-network ATMs and paying credit card bills on time helps you avoid paying unnecessary fees . And if you use a fee-happy bank , reconsider your options . Often , local banks and credit unions offer much better terms for checking and savings , and some even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good person is important , but it should n't compromise your long term financial health . Neglecting to save for retirement in order to help out adult children , putting off important , non-emergency health expenditures ( like replacing a lost filling ) , or only putting money into savings after you 've taken care of everyone else can eventually put your financial standing in jeopardy . <p> 6 . Not Taking Advantage of 401K Matching <p> Does your employer match some of your 401K contributions ? That 's free money , and not taking advantage of it is a big mistake . Say your company gives a 50% match up to a 6% contribution . That means if you commit to putting 6% of your salary in your 401K , your company will throw in 3% of your salary . Do n't walk away from an opportunity like that . <p> 7 . Choosing a Non-Ideal Student Loan Repayment Program <p> Think twice before choosing a graduated repayment program , where payments start small and increase every other year . With this type of repayment , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal of the loans . It 's not easy to make standard student loan payments early in your career , but by not choosing graduated repayment , you 'll make it easier to achieve major financial goals like buying a house . <p> 8 . Having the Wrong Life Insurance <p> When you have dependents , having life insurance is important , but it should be the right type of policy . A term insurance policy for seven to 10 times your salary is a cost-effective way to provide coverage for children for as long as they are dependent on you . Insurance agents may try to sell you a more expensive whole life policy , but these are not always best for young parents with lots of expenses . <p> 9 . Not Having an Emergency Fund <p> It may not be fun to skim part of every paycheck right off the top for emergency savings . And it 's not fun to put little windfalls into an emergency account either . But it 's definitely not fun to cope with a major car repair , a medical expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from friends and family , or taking out an ill-advised high interest loan . <p> 10 . Not Having a Budget <p> If you do n't have a budget , you do n't know what 's coming in and what 's going out , and you ca n't see where you 're overspending . Today 's budget apps like Mint are incredibly easy to use and link your accounts with your personal computer and smartphone , so your budget is portable and always available . And when budget apps are this easy to use and offer so much , not having one can be a serious money management misstep. 
@@11804806 @404806/ @qwx171675 <h> The History of the Diamond Trade <p> Diamonds are one of the worlds most sought-after natural resources . Used to signify wedding vows , fuel guerrilla revolutions and awe all in their presence , diamonds have been cherished and esteemed by mankind for centuries . Its not surprising then to learn that diamonds have been competitively traded on the world market for centuries . How then did this most lucrative of businesss actually begin ? <h> Early Diamond Trade <p> Most historians now believe organized trade of diamonds dates back about 1,000 years , to India , which possessed the entire worlds known supply until early in the eighteenth century . Traditionally , diamonds would be transported across Arabia and traded to Jewish merchants , who , in turn , resold the diamonds in major European cities of the time such as Frankfurt and Venice . As the amount of diamonds in circulation increased , these precious gems came to be used as collateral for loans and payment for high-value items . <p> Indias diamond supply was largely exhausted by the early eighteenth century , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then later to Southern Africa in the early nineteenth century . Early diamond trading followed the same general course ; with sellers inhabiting a given area until supplies ran out , causing miners and speculators to move on to greener pastures . All the while , the demand for and value of diamonds continually increased . <h> The Prominence of Jewish Families in Diamond Trading <p> The diamond market was never truly decentralized in the way a typical commodity market is ( and in fact , the significant variations in diamond grade and quality mean that they are not , technically , a commodity . ) Rather , the prominence of Jewish merchants in the sale and transportation of diamonds placed the market under control of an informal network of Jewish families that sprung up during the 1800s . The numerous jewelers and diamond trading firms were typically linked by family relation , forming a bond so tight that for centuries , diamonds were almost entirely a Jewish business . Presently , the city of Antwerp , Belgium is known as the Worlds Diamond Capital , and the diamond trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it has been since around World War II . <h> The Rise of De Beers <p> The diamond industry witnessed a marked change in the later part of the nineteenth century , when entrepreneur ( and southern African politician ) Cecil Rhodes started De Beers . Rhodes was the mastermind of what became a monopoly of diamond mining and sales . He first laid the groundwork for De Beers dominance during the southern African diamond rush of 1871 , by renting out water pumps to the influx of miners in South Africa . Rather than simply harvesting the profits from this lucrative venture , Rhodes systematically plowed them into shrewd acquisitions of small mining operations in the area , consolidating them under De Beers Consolidated Mines in 1888 according to New York University . A short year later , Rhodes owned and controlled all mining operations in South Africa , placing him in firm command of the market . This enabled De Beers to cut a lucrative deal with Londons Diamond Syndicate obligating the latter to buy fixed quantities of diamonds at set prices , according to Edward Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several trade slumps and competitive threats , De Beers continued expanding its cartel under Rhodes leadership , culminating in its biggest competitor ( Cullinan Mines ) folding into De Beers control during World War 1 . De Beers was estimated to have controlled a staggering 90% of the worlds diamond production by the time of Rhodes 1902 death . While De Beers only controls about 40%-50% of that market today , they still , in effect , control the prices of rough diamond paid by world consumers . <h> Diamond Production and Marketing Today <p> The largest producer of diamonds today is the South African nation of Botswana , where De Beers harvests and markets diamonds as part of a joint venture with the government of that country . Operating under the name Debswana , the company was formed in 1969 and unearths diamonds from four mines : Orapa ( opened in 1971 ) , Letlhakane ( opened in 1975 ) , Jwaneng ( opened in 1982 ) , and Damtshaa ( opened in 2002 . ) All mining activity takes place through the Debswana joint venture , as no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrats , or 6,000 kg , are exported from Botswana each year , representing a quarter of the worlds total annual diamond production . <p> Todays diamond market is also divided into two main segments . One is the gemstone segment , encompassing diamond rings , necklaces , stones , and other precious jewelery . Roughly 80% of these diamonds are cut in Antwerp . The other major aspect of todays diamond market is the industrial grade sub-industry consisting of diamonds cut for heat conduction , electricity insulation , semiconductors , drill tips , saw blades , and similar uses . It has been estimated that 80% of mined diamonds , being unsuited for use as gemstones , eventually become used in industrial applications such as these , according to USGSs " Industrial Diamonds Statistics &amp; Information " report . <h> Biggest Diamond Consumers <p> The worlds largest diamond consumer is the United States , accounting for 35% of world diamond sales . Following the US is Hong Kong with 26% . Belgium clocks in at 15% , while Japan buys 6% of all diamonds and Israel 4% . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentages for Antwerp and Israel are misleading in that they fail to reflect diamonds that pass through those countries in worldwide trade . Todays diamond market remains concentrated in the hands of a few major players , and looks to remain so for the foreseeable future . <h> Controversy <p> The diamond industry is not without its share of controversy , however . The most severe issue is that of blood diamonds . As the name suggests , blood diamonds are those harvested ( often by forced labor ) amongst conflict , and used to finance further conflict including , civil warring , and insurgencies . In most situations , violence enacted on those harvesting diamonds and surrounding civilian populations is particularly violent as conflicting groups attack the civilian base of its opposition this was especially the case during the Sierra Leone Civil War , during which this phenomenon first came to the attention of Western , diamond-importing countries . As such , the name is a derivation of the old phrase , " there 's blood on ones hands " .

These cover damage to others and their property .

Most people would rather pay a little bit of money every month rather than worry about coming up with a larger amount of money during a time of crisis . <p> On the flip side , some people might think that they have nothing to worry about . The five types of insurance identified in this article are general policies most everyone should have . <p> The five unnecessary types of insurance mentioned are policies that are uncommon and are most likely a waste of money . <p> Everything else falls somewhere in between : Some people definitely need certain policies ( such as malpractice insurance ) , while some will never need others ( flood insurance for a home on a hill in the Arizona desert ) .

Know how much you have coming in each month , and record what you spend . If you 're drawing on investments , make systematic withdrawals rather than as-needed withdrawals , which can encourage overspending . Systematic withdrawals function much like your paycheck did , and can help you develop the money management skills you need that are specific to retirement . <p> Take Advantage of Benefits for Seniors and Retirees <p> Many businesses offer discounts for seniors , so why not take them ?

Taking on a roommate is n't something that should be done on impulse , but if you learn the risks and rewards , it can be an option that helps with money management . <p> With retirement , some financial obligations go away , and others arrive , so it 's important for retirees to practice sound money management principles during this life transition .

With interest rates as low as 7.8% at some social lending sites , 10% to 15% less than credit card companies and banks , consumers are giving this option a hard look . <p> One reason lending communities can offer such low interest rates , is because they operate only online .

A loan grade based on credit history information provided by a consumer-reporting agency is applied to each borrower .

Some borrowers might not be completely forthright , holding back certain facts about their credit history if this will diminish their chances of obtaining a loan . Lending sites try to obtain as much background financial information possible but there is no check system in place to completely prove the validity of information provided by borrowers . However , interested lenders can directly ask borrowers questions through the site . Some questions might be about their background , employer , why they are requesting a loan and with what income they plan to pay the loan back . <p> Investors can also spread the risk by obtaining a variety of loan notes rather than focusing on one loan from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note size is $25 for most sites , an investor can loan out $100 in $25 notes to 4 different borrowers as a way of increasing risk diversification . Funding several borrower accounts instead of one will enable a lender to considerably decrease their default exposure . <p> Lending sites might be the answer to those looking to borrow money or invest some funds . For investors , it 's important to look carefully at how each site determines the interest rates for the loans and what fees they will charge . Fees can cut into the yield of a loan 's return . Also , invest only funds you can do without if you lose all of it , remember this is a numbers game .

" Putting a simple plan into action can really help one to reach financial goals faster and more efficiently .

I picked up much of what I know from them , combined with a strong interest in personal finance theory . In 2007 I was approached to write a book- Navigating the Financial Blogosphere based on the financial planning blog that I created in 2005 to address common personal finance questions . I still operate the blog and regularly contribute to industry publications . <p> Why are you so passionate about wealth management ? <p> I 've always been interested in personal finance , but I really wanted to interact one-on-one with my clients rather than work a standard desk job . The wealth management business allows me to do that . It 's a rapidly evolving profession that includes many different specialty areas . Sometimes I think my decision to practice wealth management stemmed from having parents with two very different viewpoints about money . That created an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding spending , saving and investing their money . <p> What questions should you ask before hiring an advisor ? <p> I would suggest asking about the services offered by the firm and the experience of the advisor . I might then inquire about how the advisor is compensated ( fees vs. commissions ) . You may also want to ask about any disciplinary actions to ensure that you 're not dealing with an advisor who acts unethically . Disciplinary actions must be disclosed to potential clients . <p> What are some red flags that an advisor does n't have your best interest in mind and/or does n't have enough experience ? <p> When you meet with a financial advisor for the first time , you should be able to feel out whether you mesh well with that person . If you get the wrong vibe , just move on - it 's too important of a relationship to work with someone you do n't like . That first meeting should be the start of the discovery process including information gathering and getting to know one 's attitudes and beliefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and try to get a good sense of the tangibles and intangibles . <p> If you find that advisor is pushing financial products ( perhaps complex insurance or annuity products ) , that may be ( but is n't necessarily ) a red flag . Other red flags would include excessive lawsuits disclosed on the adviser 's public record . You can usually read a summary of what the violations are for and determine on your own if the issues look serious or not . <p> On the experience front , a young advisor does n't necessarily mean a less talented advisor . I 'm 31 but have 10 years of solid planning experience . I often find advisors in their 30s and 40s may even work out better because they are more on the cutting edge of information and technology . Plus , they wo n't retire on you so fast ! <p> What are the most common questions or concerns your clients come to you with ? <p> I get a lot of questions about investing . It 's a complex area and is highly subjective . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping in mind who is doing the asking . I also get a lot of questions about real estate because people love to buy property , both as a primary residence and for investment . It 's another complex and highly subjective area . Finally , I 'd say life insurance . I get a lot of questions about term vs. something more permanent and buying for need vs. buying for investment . <p> How do you advise them about these ? <p> Financial issues are highly subjective . When it comes to stock and bond investing , what 's good for one person may be wrong for the next . In general , the more risk one takes on , the higher the potential reward will be , and vice versa . I really emphasize that when people express that they want to make money without taking on too much risk . If only it were that simple , we would all do it ! <p> When it comes to real estate , we do a full analysis of that client 's total portfolio to determine if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to place the investment . We also go over as many what-if scenarios as possible because real estate investments are often illiquid and it 's good to understand the consequences of that . <p> On life insurance , we use financial planning ratios to determine what a person 's risk exposures are and back that into how much life insurance they may need . One type of insurance is n't better than another - some people love the low cost of term and some people enjoy the permanence of whole life . Others like a hybrid product which blends the benefits of term and whole . It 's all about getting to know that person 's full financial situation and making the best recommendations possible . <p> How often should we be assessing our finances ? What should we be looking at ? <p> We do financial planning meetings with our clients either two or four times per year . <p> Most people start out doing quarterly meetings but find that twice a year is sufficient to track progress . We always update the net worth statement to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is wrong . We also go over the investment portfolio to make sure the investments still work within the context of the client 's time horizon and risk tolerance . <p> It also helps to look at some financial planning ratios and rules of thumb to see if you have a healthy financial life . Start with your Emergency Fund , which should equal three to six months of your household income . Also , take your current ratio , which is your total assets divided by your total liabilities . One to two is average and three to five is excellent . If you 're under one , you 're probably operating with too much debt . You can also look at your monthly housing costs to see if they are one-third or less of your total income . Closer to 25 percent is healthy and over 40 percent is usually too much money being allocated to one spending category . <p> What are the smartest things everyone should be doing to manage their money better ? <p> The old expression " pay yourself first " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . That might include having a few hundred ( or a few thousand ) dollars automatically moved each month from your checking to savings or from your checking to an investment account which you do n't touch . <p> The financial practices that I think everydiv should be utilizing include maintaining a net worth worksheet which is updated quarterly . I also think having an accurate budget really helps to track spending , even if you earn a few hundred thousand dollars and think you do n't need one . You will learn a lot about your spending habits from your budget . <p> Finally , save more at a younger age . I ca n't emphasize enough the importance of the time value of money . Open an IRA when you 're 21 and put some money in there every month , even if only $50 or $100 . Making savings a habit will really reduce your stress down the road . <p> What are the biggest financial/economy headlines we should all be paying attention to right now ? <p> First , I should say that most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The financial media thrives when we worry , so they often convey many different risks which most people do n't need to concern themselves with . That includes my biggest economic concern right now , which is whether or not our economy can grow at a healthy enough pace to handle the debt load which our country has taken on to get through the financial obstacles of the past few years . <p> Cheap money is great for inflating asset prices including stocks and real estate , but if we eventually experience inflation and are forced to raise interest rates , our markets will be put to a tough test . Related to that , I worry long term about the government 's debt load and how important government programs like Social Security and Medicare will remain solvent for my generation .

People are catching on , and I think slowing down is starting to pick up speed . <p> What do you think is the most common mistake people make when planning a trip to Ireland ? <p> We find a lot of first-time visitors to Ireland plan to visit attractions that are actually very far apart from each other . While Ireland looks like a small country , it can take several hours to drive from one end to another . Not all the roads are two-lane highways . In fact , most of them are tiny winding roads that take much more time to negotiate than you would expect . I suggest picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland is chock full of amazing things to do , so you do n't need to go far to see a great view or a cool historical site . Plus , spending less time in a car means more time for adventures ! <p> How expensive is it to visit Ireland in comparison to other European countries ? <p> Ireland can be as expensive or cheap as you want to make it . The biggest expenses of our trips are the accommodations and transportation . There are amazing luxury hotels with seaside views and cozy bathrobes , but the majority of the hospitality sector leans on family-run B&amp;Bs , offering a warm bed and a very hearty breakfast at a reasonable price . Stick with the B&amp;B if you looking for an affordable getaway . <p> When looking for airfare , think fall and spring ! These are the best times to go because of great deals and surprisingly mild weather . <p> Dublin is a typical European capital with expensive pints and even more expensive accommodations . But , if you do your research , there are deals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shelbourne Hotel in Dublin via Priceline for 40 percent off . We got such a great deal that we even ordered room service one morning as a yummy treat ! <p> How should we go about budgeting for a trip there ? What will we plan to spend more money on ? Where can we pinch pennies ? <p> First , take a- look at the expenses from one of our recent trips to Ireland . We tracked every penny so that readers could get a realistic sense of how much it might cost . Then , adjust for personal preferences - you can spend much less if you stay in hostels or use public transportation . You can also spend much more for castle stays and fancy dinners . <p> For a more personalized estimate , start with transportation costs including air and car rental . This is easily done by using an aggregate site like- Kayak to compare airfares or- Dan Dooley for car rentals . <p> Next , G70-80 for two people is a good estimate for one night in a B&amp;B - just multiply by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , attractions , souvenirs and miscellaneous can run from G50-100 a day , depending on your budget and lifestyle . <p> I think most visitors are really surprised at how much a car rental costs in Ireland . Expect to pay much more than you would in the U.S. , especially if you plan to opt for the extra insurance that covers your liability to zero ( which we recommend ) . However , visitors can save a little bit by staying in a B&amp;B and taking advantage of the huge Irish breakfast , which lasts us well into the afternoon . Many days we will get by until dinner with snacks or impromptu picnics with Irish cheese and crackers . Plus , many restaurants offer early-bird specials with great deals on three-course menus . <p> What tips do you have on finding lodging ? What tends to be the most authentic and affordable ? <p> I 've already mentioned the Irish B&amp;B a couple times , but it 's only because they are that good ! I am convinced the hospitality industry in Ireland is second to none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wag ( chat ) , they provide a great value for the cost . <p> I start our hunt for lodging with a good ol ' Google search . Typing the name of the town and " B&amp;B " usually gives ample results . I always look for sites with excellent pictures of the rooms and details about the accommodation ( what do they provide - hair-dryers , wash cloths , activities in the area ) . Then , I look at sites like Trip Advisor and B&amp;B Ireland for reviews and ratings . You will find most B&amp;B 's to be more than adequate and some to be exceptional . <p> Travelers stretching every penny can stay in private room hostels , which are typically G20-25 per night with , at most , a simple continental breakfast . <p> What 's the best way to get around Ireland transportation-wise ? What 's the most affordable method ? What would you recommend for a first-time visitor ( budget aside ) ? <p> Hands-down the best way to visit Ireland is by rental car , but it 's definitely not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out- Bus Eireann , the national bus service , which has decent routes to even rural parts of Ireland . Another option is to travel by coach bus on an organized tour . These tours are n't always cheaper than renting a car and booking B&amp;Bs on your own , but some operators run sales when tours are n't full . The primary down-side to a tour package is losing most of your independence for spending time visiting things you are most interested in . <p> If money is no object , rent a car . The freedom to visit sites for as little or as long as you like , stay in places you hand-pick and eat when it suits you is worth every penny . <p> What destinations do you think every first-time visitor should make sure to check out ? Any places you think are overrated ? <p> For the very first trip to Ireland , I really do n't think you can beat the southwest . It is jammed packed with amazing views , first-rate accommodations and a five-star food scene . It has the infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Killarney and Kenmare , but visitors can easily go off the beaten path to places like the Blasket Islands , Healy Pass and Bantry . <p> While there are several areas in Ireland that I could visit over and over again , there are very few that I think are overrated . Oversaturated may be more appropriate . For example , the Ring of Kerry is a gorgeous peninsula with sprawling views of the Atlantic . It is also covered in tour buses from end to end . I would opt for the Beara or Dingle peninsulas with just as spectacular scenery , but with exquisitely less traffic . <p> What Irish experiences/destinations do you think offer the most value for your money ? <p> Immediately , hill-walking in the Irish countryside comes to mind . Joe and I have climbed a few mountains , walked along sea sides and visited historical sites via well-worn walking paths . Nothing beats the views from Slieve League in Donegal , the top of Mount Brandon in Kerry and the Ardmore Round Tower in Waterford , especially because it did n't cost us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill-walking is a great way to see the country and requires nothing more than a little research. - Mountain Views has been really helpful for us . <p> Another amazing value is the UNESCO World Heritage site , Skellig Michael , which lies eight miles off the coast of Ireland . It is one of the most well-preserved monastic sites in Ireland . Built in the sixth century , the monastic ruins are essentially on top of a huge rock in the ocean . This day trip requires a sense of adventure - with a 45-minute boat ride , 670 steps to the top and no hand rails . Skellig Michael is not only worth the G50 boat ride , but also spending an extra day in the area just in case the weather does n't cooperate !

While some generate income , such as rental property revenue , many assets do n't . But they do help determine your net worth . Each time you add an asset , such as monthly disbursements into savings or retirement , your assets and net worth grow . <p> Goals <p> Every budget needs a goal . Maybe you want to pay off a vehicle loan early , get out of credit card debt , start a college fund , or just learn to live within your means .

Currently , he 's a Senior Resident Financial Planner with- Financial Finesse- and also works on their social media team . Erik spoke with us about his company and the troubling lack of financial education among Americans. - <p> How did you become involved with Financial Finesse ? <p> After about 10 years in the financial services industry , I decided to start a new career as a financial educator at Financial Finesse because I was tired of the traditional focus on selling financial services or gathering assets to manage . Instead , I really wanted to help people who might not be able to afford the help but needed it the most . <p> Why are financial education programs so necessary ? <p> There are a couple of reasons . One is a longer term trend of increased availability of consumer credit , which can get a lot of people in trouble . The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial well-being from employers to employees .

That 's a huge burden on someone who has never been educated on how to make those decisions . These trends can contribute to higher levels of financial stress and lower levels of retirement preparedness , both of which can be costly for the employee and the employer alike . <p> What are some common topics many of us need education about when it comes to financial matters ? <p> The two most common topics where people need more financial education are around day-to-day money management and retirement planning . <p> Why should employers take an active interest in their employee 's financial education ? <p> When employees are under a lot of financial stress , they are n't going to be as productive .

This does n't include the lower morale and productivity of someone who does n't really want to be there . <p> What 's the one misconception you wish everyone would let go of when it comes to finances ? <p> The biggest misconception is that managing your finances has to be complicated . What we find is that the biggest impact comes from simple steps taken consistently over time . The key is maintaining that consistency , which comes from training yourself to derive pleasure from behaviors that improve your financial situation rather than that of the people marketing to you every day . <p> What are some of the financial topics we 'll need to know more about in the future ? <p> One topic we 'll need to know more about in the future is health care as we see the rise in self-directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new exchanges rather than through their employer , and in the possibility of Medicare converting to a premium support model .

In ancient Egypt , where silver was much less expensive and had to be imported , gold received an important role in myth and faith . Not the value , but the beauty and symbolism of gold made the hallmark of kings and gods . All jewelry items that kings and priests needed , were of gold . In the 15th Century BC , Pharaoh Thutmose III had a golden chariot made in Babylon . He brought a lot of gold to Egypt , which had been steadily gained through assistance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula . The Egyptians were the first to step into professional mining , in which thousands of slaves worked in deplorable conditions . Gold was a symbol of power , prestige and immortality . <p> The New World and Gold <p> In 1886 , when the United States of America declared their independence from the British Crown , the young state did not own any gold or silver stocks . It issued paper money , which had no coverage and led to inflation . The only significant gold deposits were discovered in North Carolina . The United States ended their struggles with Mexico and gold in 1848 , by paying $15 million for a large area ( Texas to California ) . No one knew at that point that days earlier gold had been found near a Californian sawmill . The discovery led to the first and biggest gold rush in U.S. history .

Again , the gold deposits and the increasing population quickly resulted in the declaration of the state of Colorado . The last great gold rush in U.S. history took place in the Alaskan Klondike . No significant gold discoveries were found from 1896-1898 , but the Klondike gold rush found its way into many works of literature and film history , becoming the most constant gold deposit . <p> Gold reserves are now stowed away at Fort Knox , Kentucky . Around 500 rail cars were needed in 1936 to gather gradually all the gold bars across the country .

The return to the worldwide gold standard was intended , but it failed in the Genoa Conference during 1922 .

The result was a massive economic crisis , including strikes and nearly an uprising . At that point , the United States owned 70% of the world 's gold reserves . The return to the gold standard in the 1920s proved to be one of the biggest flops in the history of economics . The main reason and cause was because of the U.S. , which was caused by its policy of neutralizing the inflow of gold .

@@11804833 @404833/ <h> Be a Smart Money Manager : Keep Away from Your 401k <p> In the United States , there are more than a dozen types of tax-advantaged retirement savings accounts . Each has its own set of ( often complex ) rules about contributions , withdrawals , loans , and penalties on early distributions . Being a smart money manager means keeping your hands off your 401k until you actually retire . However , sometimes life delivers financial catastrophes , from unemployment to emergency car repairs to housing bubbles . <p> Because of financial disasters , many Americans have been forced to make early withdrawals from retirement accounts , but the cost is huge . In 2010 alone , Americans paid nearly $6 billion in penalties on distributions from retirement accounts , and that 's on top of the regular income taxes owed on those distributions . <p> The Risks of Tapping Your 401K <p> Money managers note major risks involved in taking money out of your 401k . First , the money withdrawn is subject to income taxes , and depending on your tax bracket , this can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in the 25% tax bracket and withdraw $10,000 , your tax liability is $2,500 . Therefore , to net $10,000 , you would have to withdraw $13,333 to have enough for taxes . And this is before any penalties are assessed on the early withdrawal . Second , you put yourself behind in your retirement savings . Retirement may seem far off , but an early withdrawal can have effects for decades . <p> Penalties for Tapping Your 401K <p> The IRS has a few , clearly delineated situations in which you can take an early distribution from your 401k without paying a penalty on top of income taxes . But there are very strict rules on what financial disasters qualify , as any experienced money manager will attest . Assuming you 're not in one of those rare " non-penalty " situations , you will pay a 10% penalty on top of the income taxes you 'll owe on your distribution . Take $10,000 out of your 401k before you 're eligible , and you 'll fork over $1,000 of it in penalties , plus pay $2,500 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your $10,000 withdrawal ends up only being $6,500 ultimately . <p> 401k Distributions for Medical Hardships <p> The IRS allows you to take an early distribution from a 401k without penalty to pay for unreimbursed medical expenses . However , beginning in 2013 , only medical expenses exceeding 10% of your adjusted gross income are eligible . Furthermore , you have to pay those expenses in the same year that you take the distribution . So if you withdraw the money in 2013 , you have to pay the bills in 2013 too . Additionally , you can not avoid the penalty on a 401k distribution for covering medical expenses if other financial resources are available . Speak with a qualified money manager about your options for addressing medical hardships . <p> What About Taking a Loan from a 401K ? <p> You may have heard of people borrowing money from their 401k . Your employer does not have to allow these loans . While you wo n't owe taxes or penalties if you loan yourself money from your 401k , and are repaying the money ( plus interest ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Should you leave your job for whatever reason , your former employer will most likely demand immediate repayment . If you 're unable to repay at that time , the balance of the loan will be treated as an early distribution , with the financial penalties that go along with it . <p> The Better Alternative : Emergency Savings <p> Most people are less inclined to start an emergency savings account than a 401k . After all , 401k contributions come out of your paycheck before taxes , and many employers match a percentage of contributions . With an emergency account , you 're your own money manager and nodiv matches contributions . But the tax and penalty liabilities you incur with early 401k distributions make the emergency savings account far better for meeting emergency expenses . Furthermore , if you suddenly need a big car repair or a new refrigerator , you can simply go to the bank and get the money . <p> Smart money managers have three to six months ' living expenses put away in emergency savings , but any emergency account is better than none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $300 you wo n't have to put on a credit card . <p> It 's hard to look at that hole in your roof and think of all the money sitting in your 401k . But a sharp money manager will tell you your other options are preferable to raiding your 401k . With credit cards , you can try to pay down the balance quickly . Lines of credit from your bank or credit union often have low interest rates . And if you have an emergency savings account , you have your best option for meeting unexpected expenses . The bottom line is that you should have a hands-off policy for your 401k and put money into an emergency account to minimize harm to your long term finances and maximize options for paying for unexpected expenses .

He has valuable insight to offer on the trends of banking and spending and where it is going . Brett took some time to talk with us about Baking 4 Tomorrow , the future of banking and how to decrease debt . <p> You talk about how smartphones will soon be the center of banking . Do you think a part of the population will fight it ? <p> There are always people that say , I 'll never use a smartphone or mobile phone , I 'll never join Facebook , I 'll never use the Internet , I 'll never use an ATM , etc . Invariably these late adopters come on board later in the cycle , but those that truly fight these trends end up being a very small part of the population , maybe 10-15% . I get asked this question all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if some customers do n't WANT a smartphone to be the center of banking ? " This question tells me that a business does n't have a strategy for mobile and is hoping that they 'll simply be able to stick with their current strategy . Hope is not a viable business strategy . The reality is that 80% of people in the US will be smartphone enabled within three years ; in the UAE , Singapore , Hong Kong , etc. , it 's already above 100% adoption . So the only question is , will smartphones be at the center of banking ... <p> The key to answering this question is understanding the relationship of the branch versus smartphone to the customer experience . The issue is that the branch increasingly equals FRICTION , whereas the smartphone represents reduced friction and ease of use . There are literally maybe two or three scenarios where the branch is actually not just about friction but value added - the key for value creation in the future is simplicity , and the smartphone makes that happen . <p> People are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the credit card and the debit card going ? <p> Credit cards are bad for debt - the core purpose of a credit card for a bank is to ENABLE YOU TO SPEND . This is counter to the mission of reducing debt or helping you to save . Our view is that credit will become a use case such as an in-store purchase , or emergency cash at a grocery store , and that the use of a credit card predicated on " airline miles " for spending will take a severe hit . <p> Do you think we will soon be paying for everything via our phones ? <p> Apple thinks so , and so do we . Plastic is dumb - it gives you zero feedback , with the exception of approving or declining a transaction at the POS . That 's not enough in today 's world . The advantage a smartphone holds is that it can tell you what your balance is before a transaction , if there is a better deal nearby , if you can afford the purchase , and then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significantly more secure than cash , plastic or other physical payment forms . There is almost no downside to using the phone , and a plastic card ca n't compete either based on security or informational context . <p> How important is social media in banking ? <p> Social media has quickly become part of the service and brand dynamic of banking . Probably the greatest benefit social media has to banks is that they can really plug into customers and get a feel for their perception of brand performance , new product experience , etc . <p> Your site , Banking 4 Tomorrow , has a realistic , current voice on banking . Where will banks be in the future , and what big changes do you think we 'll see ? <p> That 's a huge question . I would recommend that people read my blogs and my last two books , BANK 3.0 and BREAKING BANKS , for an answer to that . <p> Let 's just say there will be more changes in the next 10 years in banking than in the last 100 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , then start looking for a new job . The good news - banking is about to become one of the most dynamic industries on the planet , but not because of bankers . <p> What advice can you give someone on saving more and spending less ? <p> Moven attacks this issue , and we think it is pretty simple . Help you understand how you are spending everyday with the simple goal of reducing your daily or monthly spend on discretionary expenses . The only real way to help someone save on a systemic basis is to get them to spend less money - banks today are more focused on getting you to spend money as easily as possible , rather than helping you really save . <p> What do customers want from their banks ? <p> First and foremost , safety of their money ; secondly , utility of their money ( being able to pay , move funds , pay bills , etc. ) ; and thirdly , solving financial problems as they arise . The first two are basic housekeeping issues and do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness of a bank on a day-to-day basis . Google calls this the " Toothbrush Test " - can you build something that a customer will use more than once a day . That 's what we 're trying to do with Moven . <p> Lastly , does anyone pay in cash anymore ? <p> A few holdouts , maybe . : ) <p> With the exception of Japan ( where increased cash use is linked to pay-on-delivery eCommerce growth ) , most developed economies are seeing dramatic reductions in the use of cash today . The remaining areas where cash is being used is typically for smaller transactions under $20 . Once mobile payments are more ubiquitous and it is easier to pull out your phone rather than deal with trying to navigate change and notes , then I think we 'll see an acceleration of the decline in cash . There are two other drivers for decking in cash use - Firstly , governments hate it because it is untraceable and is core to criminal activity around drugs , etc . Secondly , it has the same feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your financial health . That 's ultimately why pressure will continue on the system to further reduce the use of cash . <p> Having said that , I do n't think we 'll see cash completely disappear for another couple of decades . Sure , it will be increasingly rare and only used for off-the-grid transactions , but it will have a long , slowly declining tail .

Borrow a page from the advertisers and make your " share , save and spend smart " message just as engaging . <p> " We know that exposing our kids to reading and writing at an early age is essential , because we now know it helps build a strong foundation for later learning .

One of the first things we knew we wanted to teach her was to be money smart . I researched what was out there and found virtually nothing that made the topic fun for kids . I had previous experience in developing children 's entertainment , so I knew it would be much more effective to make learning about money engaging rather than too precious or preachy . <p> Interestingly , as I looked further into the subject ( and despite the lack of entertaining materials ) , the more it became clear that starting the conversation with kids early was the key .

In fact , this recent Cambridge study finds that money habits are formed by age 7 . <p> - <h> What strategy have you found works best for talking to kids about money ? <p> Parents need to get kids excited about money learning with engaging materials so the kids are primed for a workable system to put the principles into practice . That 's why we do what we do with our DVD , books and online materials . Then , parents need to give kids autonomy over their money early , letting them learn to make choices and even to make mistakes . We started with an allowance at age 5 for both of our kids , and we advocate that for all children . Our kids make choices by putting some of each weekly allowance in their Share , Save and Spend Smart jars .

What lessons are appropriate for ... <p> - <h> ... Preschoolers ? <p> Exposing preschoolers to money is easy . You can give them a dollar or two to purchase something on a store trip . Have them hand the money to the clerk and receive the change . This can help them get " money comfortable . " In fact , it 's not a bad idea to use cash on your trips so they see money exchanged rather than just a card being swiped , which is essentially magic to them .

My grade-school-age daughter bought a collectible set from a popular brand ( we 'll leave the name out ) . Within a few weeks , it was more junk on the floor to her . She was n't playing with it . She bought it because a friend of hers had the same set . This led to a conversation and a realization about money wastefulness . Of course , this was by no means her last mistake , but it was a relatively inexpensive way to learn that it might have been better to wait a week to see if she really wanted that item . It was certainly better than learning the lesson more expensively as a teen or adult with more disposable income . <p> Next , as soon as possible , start kids saving for a goal . By way of example , our daughter saved for a $20 scooter over an eight-week period as one of her first goals . We 've likely all seen the marshmallow study by Walter Mischel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Where can parents learn the basics ? <p> One of the biggest discoveries on my journey with The Money Mammals is that by distilling the message down to the basics like we do - Needs vs . Wants , making smart money choices , and learning about delayed gratification - we make it SO much easier for parents to deal with the subject .

How can they get their kids involved more ? <p> There are teaching moments available everywhere . For example , when you 're at the store , show kids the choices you make as you comparison shop . It 's so easy to do this now since most stores display the unit price . Unless you show them what you 're thinking or doing , they wo n't see the smart choices you make . Although I advocate for giving your kids money autonomy , that does n't mean you should n't step in and advise . For example , if they are begging to buy something you 're almost certain will end up in the trash next week , make a rule that they have to wait a week before making the purchase .

Here 's what he had to say : - <h> Tell us about Floify . What services do you offer ? Who should be using them ? <p> The typical loan officer receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrower bank statements , tax returns and pay stubs . The other emails are typically from realtors and borrowers asking for status updates on their mortgage loan processes . <p> Floify gets mortgage loan originators out of email hell and into a secure , well-organized portal and dashboard , where borrowers know exactly what documentation to provide and where they stand in their loan process . <p> Realtors , who refer the most business to mortgage loan officers and are revered beyond belief , love receiving Floify milestone status updates ! Real estate agents always know where their clients stand in the mortgage process . <p> The keys to making a realtor happy are an on-time closing and timely status updates throughout the loan process . - <h> How does Floify make the mortgage process easier ? <p> Floify gets mortgage origination teams and their borrowers out of email hell . <p> All the back-and-forth emails , including : <p> requesting documentation <p> re-requesting docs when there 's something wrong with the doc , and <p> status update requests from borrowers , realtors and third parties <p> are dramatically reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work lives , and allows them to go home an hour earlier than usual . - <h> What do you think are the most common mistakes mortgage brokers make when managing paperwork ? <p> One area that all mortgage originators could benefit from is keeping our promises . We all make several promises during the course of a business day , but not all of us actually follow through and keep those promises .

Would n't people with the best money management habits have the best credit scores ? Your credit score does n't have to do with how much you have saved for emergencies or retirement . Rather , it has to do with how much debt you have , how long you 've had it , what kind of debt it is , and how dependable you are about paying it off . <p> In other words , your credit score is about how good you are at making payments on your debts , whether you have a reasonable amount of credit based on your income , and how much of the credit available to you is in use on average . You can have a so-so credit score despite having a healthy emergency account , and there are good money management practices that can temporarily lower your credit score . Here 's why . <p> Will Closing a Credit Account Hurt Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit score , but usually the hit is temporary . Credit scoring algorithms look at how much credit is available to you and how much of that credit you 're using . The more of your available credit you 're using , the more it can hurt your credit score . If you close a credit card with a $4,000 limit , you immediately cut your " available " credit , and if your other credit cards or credit accounts have balances , your utilization ratio shows you 're using a higher percentage of your available credit . For minimal impact on your credit score , it 's best not to close any credit cards until they 're all paid off . <p> Should You Close Credit Cards You Never Use ? <p> It only makes sense to want to close credit cards you never use .

If you close a credit account you 've had in good standing for 15 years , and your other credit cards are relatively new , closing that old account brings down the average length of time you 've maintained accounts in good standing and can hurt your score . <p> Balance transfer options can be tempting with new cards offering introductory 0% rates . However , consolidating all your credit card debt onto one card can hurt your credit rating . When you open a new credit card , a " hard " credit check is done , causing a temporary hit to your credit score . Also , putting multiple debts on one account causes a high utilization rate for that card , which can also hurt your score . Consolidating balances and closing other credit cards hurts your utilization rate more . Consolidating balances can hurt your credit score more than having low balances on several credit cards .

If business is lagging or your company recently announced that it will be laying people off , it wont be the best day to ask for a raise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company before you ask for a raise . Learn about its financial condition by checking earnings reports and other financial documents . These should be easy to find if the company is publicly traded . <p> If the business is losing money , your boss wont be inclined to bump up your pay . <h> Ways to Ask <p> Along with getting the timing right , the way you go about asking for a raise is critical . Any discussion you have about your salary should take place in person . Do n't  ask for a raise over email or leave a voice message for your boss requesting a raise . <p> Do some research into the typical salary for your job before you approach your boss . <p> If you 've been in the position for over a year , you want to make more than the typical entry-level salary for the job . You can find average salary information online or by checking with a professional organization . <p> Highlight the reasons you believe you should receive a raise . Make your reasons legitimate and do n't  ever threaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , its never a good idea to argue that you do as much work or more than your boss and deserve a better salary . What you can state is that you 've taken on more assignments or assumed a greater level of responsibility since you started . <p> Be ready to provide concrete examples to your boss . <h> Getting the Details Right <p> Asking for a raise is in many ways about getting the tiny details right . For example , you want to make sure you talk to the proper person about your raise . Make an appointment with your immediate supervisor , not with the CEO of the company . <p> You also want to be sure not to ask for too much . A good rule of thumb to follow is to ask for a 3 percent increase in your salary , as that is the typical cost-of-living increase . <p> Any more than that and you risk coming across as overly eager , greedy , or completely clueless . <p> Remember that nothing in business is personal . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends meet , do n't  bring that information into the meeting . <p> Your boss will be willing to pay you more if he thinks you 're a great asset to the company . Your raise will have nothing to do with whether or not you can pay your bills . <p> Kelly Anderson is a financial planner who blogs about financial advice you can use in your everyday life .

They are determined by how well you manage your debt . Lenders and anyone else who might extend credit to you want to know that they will be repaid on time . Your scores reveal how you have paid in the past , which helps determine how you will most likely pay in the future . <p> If your credit scores are n't what they ought to be , or if you do n't even know what yours is , there is plenty of hope and plenty of room for improvement . Raising a low score is n't easy , but the effort will make the rest of your life a lot easier . <p> Step One : Get a Copy of Your Credit Reports <p> The only way to know your credit score is to obtain copies of your credit report from all three agencies : Equifax , Trans Union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their credit report every year , so there 's no excuse for putting it off . If you 're afraid of what your scores might be , that 's the best reason of all to get a copy . <p> Go to Annualcreditreport.com to request your credit report from each agency . No company should ever charge to provide a copy of your credit report once per year . Use Annualcreditreport.com , and you wo n't have to worry about whether the organization is legitimate . <p> How Credit Scores are Calculated <p> Fair Isaac Corporation determines what is known as the FICO score , and it ranges from 300 to 850 . The higher the score , the better your credit . The information used to determine your score is taken from your credit reports . At Trans Union and Experian , the FICO score is known as the FICO Risk Score Classic .

The good news is that every responsible choice that you make from here on out is a step toward improving your credit . My FICO suggests that one of the best ways to improve your score is by reducing the amount of debt that you owe . The Amounts Owed portion of your credit reports carries a lot of weight , so pay down debt and keep it down . <p> Look for new credit at one time , not all the time .

As obvious as this sounds , many programs offer " discounts " in only the most technical definitions of the term . Most of the deals should be at least 10% off , with a decent amount of 50% off mixed in .

They 're your tool for managing money in a way that builds wealth . Wealth might seem like a far-off concept , but almost everyone has to start somewhere .

For people who earn a regular , dependable paycheck , this part might be simple . For freelancers and those with more sporadic income , it 's not so easy . <p> One recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determine a monthly average income based on the lowest amount earned in one month .

Insurance , taxes , and other deductions make your hourly wage or yearly salary a bit smaller . If your income is less than you need , there 's only a couple of things to do about it - earn more , perhaps with a part-time job or by seeking different employment , or spend less . <p> Keep an eye on spending , and help your money work for you . <p> Budgets Expose Excessive Spending , Which Let 's You Stop It <p> Everyone spends , but building wealth depends on spending less than you earn .

Impulse buys at the checkout , new gadgets at every release , and even grocery items that are n't on your shopping list take money from where you want it . And where you want it is in the position of earning more . <p> Think of it this way . When you spend on something you do n't need , you gain an object that 's worth less ( or even worth nothing ) the day after you buy it . Instead of your money earning interest or dividends for you , it 's lining someone else 's pocket . <p> Budgets Help You Make Investments and Track Them <p> Investing is n't just for the rich .

You can even find Bitcoin ATMs in some places . <p> Coinbase is the largest Bitcoin exchange , where people trade Bitcoin . While some consider Bitcoin as a sort of currency , others consider it as more of a financial asset . Either way , it 's important to keep track of it using budget tools . Mint.com is now working with Coinbase to allow people to use Mint budget tools to keep track of whatever Bitcoin they trade on Coinbase . This feature is likely to become increasingly popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you should know about how that is happening . <p> What Is the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ? <p> Brothers Cameron and Tyler Winkelvoss are trying to get approval for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust , an exchange traded fund ( ETF ) . An ETF is essentially a mutual fund traded on a stock exchange . A person could , if the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust gains approval , invest in it , just as she would any other mutual fund . If this happens , personal budget tools like Mint.com will be able to track it alongside other investments . <p> The Winklevosses are also planning to launch an index that tracks the price of Bitcoin . The index , dubbed the " Winkdex " will be used to price the value of the assets held by the brothers ' ETF , assuming it gains approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . Said Cameron Winklevoss , " The creation of an index that better reflects accurate pricing is the next step in wider acceptance of Bitcoin as an asset class . " <p> SEC Review of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filing with the SEC last year for approval of their new ETF , and that process is ongoing . Right now , it looks good , because the SEC has " not gotten any show stoppers , " according to the Trust 's lawyer Evan Greebel , speaking with The Wall Street Journal . If the SEC grants approval , the move is widely seen as a way to bring more stability to Bitcoin . <p> An increasing number of businesses are accepting Bitcoin , but the volatility Bitcoin trading has exhibited may be holding back more widespread acceptance . Until recently , the lack of budget tools for tracking Bitcoin has made trading them less convenient . The approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust could convince more businesses to start accepting Bitcoin and increase the desire of ordinary consumers for budget tools for tracking it . <p> If the new ETF is approved , it will allow the ability to buy an interest in Bitcoin without having to actually buy the underlying Bitcoin . This would remove barriers for investors who want to participate in the Bitcoin market without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to full arbitrage opportunities , which would probably dampen some of the current volatility in the Bitcoin market . This could make banks less reluctant to provide accounts to businesses that operate in Bitcoin . <p> Using Mint to Track Bitcoin <p> If you have n't used Bitcoin before , to get started , you need to create a Bitcoin virtual wallet . Coinbase is the largest provider of Bitcoin wallets , and has a good track record for this service . Your Bitcoin wallet may be virtual , but you should protect it just as you would your regular wallet or any of your bank or credit card information . <p> At any given time , the Bitcoin in your wallet will be worth a certain amount of US currency in dollars and cents . Now Coinbase has teamed up with Mint.com , giving you budget tools to track the dollar value of your Bitcoin at any time , just as you track your other accounts using Mint . It 's the most convenient way to integrate your Coinbase use into your suite of financial planning and budget tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similar to investment assets in some ways . Bitcoin is subject to more volatility than your other assets , though hopefully some of that volatility will settle down if and when the SEC approves the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust . But the bottom line is that Bitcoin has a place in mainstream personal finance , and if you use Coinbase and Mint.com , you can easily track it right along with all your other financial transactions .

But , there are so many things that want you to part ways with your money sooner and not later . <p> Money mistakes such as a $4 coffee every work day or a $1 lottery ticket here and there might not seem like a big deal . Its when you add up the cost of all those purchases that you realize they are all a waste of money . <p> If your goal is to inflate your savings account or put money aside for a specific goal , such as buying your first home , stop wasting your money on these items : <h> Coffee You Do n't  Make at Home <p> Coffee is expensive no matter whether you prepare it at home or buy it from a cafe . Although a pound of coffee can cost around $10 , depending on how fancy you like your beans and where in the country you live , buying a coffee drink from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latte from a chain or privately owned coffee shop can cost between $4 and $5 per cup . If you buy just one latte a day , five days a week , you 'll end up spending more than $1,000 per year , just on beverages . <h> Dry Cleaning <p> I 've got a secret for you : your work clothes probably do n't  have to be dry cleaned . <p> Unless the label says " dry clean only , " you can more often than not get away from washing your dress pants , button-up shirts and dresses in cold water . Skip the dryer and hang or lay flat to dry to extend the life of your clothing . <p> Dry cleaning might not seem like it costs a lot of money , but it does add up . If you dry clean a $50 skirt four times a year at a cost of $5 per clean , you 'll end up spending an extra $20 each year on the skirt . <p> To avoid dry cleaning bills , check the garments tag before purchase . If it says " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Bank Fees <p> Bank fees can really eat into your budget and there 's no reason they should. - Your bank might charge you a fee just to keep your account open or it might charge you a fee if you use another banks ATM . <p> If your bank does charge fees , consider switching to one that does n't  or switching to a credit union . <h> Penalties and Late Fees <p> Late payment penalties are a complete waste of money . You are paying for your own forgetfulness . <p> You gain nothing from paying the late fee except maybe a feeling of annoyance at having to pay it . The best way to avoid paying penalties is to set up automatic payments or bill pay reminders , so that you are never late again . <h> Fancy Cable Channels <p> The premium cable channels seem to offer a lot .

With odds like that , the chances of you recouping what you spent on those tickets are slim to none . <p> The next time you feel tempted to take a chance on lottery tickets , put the money you would have spent on those tickets in a savings account instead . You wont have the chance to win a million dollars , but you also wont be throwing your money away . <h> A Too-Good-to-be-True Offer <p> My husband and I were recently approached by a saleswoman who had an " amazing " deal for us. - For just $100 , we could stay in a deluxe hotel on the beach in Virginia during the off-season . <p> The catch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation about a condo timeshare . <p> The deal was tempting $100 for a three night trip but we turned it down , since we had n't  budgeted for an extra trip .

Odds are pretty high that the deal will benefit the salespeople more than it does you . <h> The Extended Warranty <p> Do you need to purchase an extended warranty ? No , but the stores selling you the product do n't  want you to know that . <p> When you purchase the warranty , you usually end up paying half of the product price again . The store you buy the warranty from lucks out , as most people never need to use it . <p> Most products will last for years and not break down .

That 's so far from the truth . I lived out of a backpack for nearly two years with as little as I could and it taught me just the opposite . <p> In most cases , it 's a matter of needs and wants .

In the end , we all want to generate wealth . Wealth is created by increasing savings over time . Savings are created by spending less than we make . <p> Income - Spending = Savings Savings + Time to grow = Wealth <p> What is the one factor in this equation that you can have the most immediate control of ? Spending . Maybe it 's your rent , car payments , insurance , phone bills , entertainment , etc . Whatever you are spending your income on , monitor it , and reduce spending in areas you can , and you 've just taken your first step to generating wealth in the long term . <p> How do tools like Mint.com help people to do this ? <p> Mint is awesome .

The most important one is the first one , so go do it now ! <p> I also encourage guys to check out the personal finance community online . It really is amazing . There are hundreds of awesome blogs with firsthand stories about saving and investing , credit card and bank account comparisons , reviews , etc . If you 're willing to put in just a little bit of time , you can find tools and resources online to help you make the best decisions possible .

I heard someone mention to their child when shopping the other day , " Do n't spend money on things you do n't need because you wo n't have money for things you do need . " I think it is extremely important for parents and teachers to educate our youth on spending within our means . Everything is at our fingertips these days and spending money can be as easy as a click . <p> If you do n't want to get into unnecessary debt , take a long hard look at your spending habits and ask yourself which ones you regret or could have gone without . Next time something like that comes up , make the smart choice . <p> How do you know you 've " found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge stickler for value . I do n't concern myself so much with the price of a product or service , but rather whether I feel satisfied or excited for what I 'm receiving in relation to what I 'm spending . When I do splurge or spend money ( within my means , of course ) , I try to do so on things I 'm passionate about and always research to make sure I am paying the best possible price . I love price comparison websites and I always spend a few minutes to see if I can find some sort of discount online . I absolutely love bartering-friendly markets ; it 's a thrill trying to get the best bang for your buck .

@@11804870 @404870/ <h> Expert Interview with Bobby Ong on Cryptocurrency <p> If you want to know about cryptocurrency , it 's best to chat with someone like Bobby Ong , whose interest in trading it online for a profit inspired him and his partner TM Lee to create CoinGecko , a website that ranks different forms of altcoins . <p> We recently checked in with Bobby to learn some altcoin basics and get his predictions for the future of cryptocurrency . Here 's what he had to say : <h> What is cryptocurrency ? <p> I will first briefly explain what is Bitcoin and then extend the concept further to cover cryptocurrencies in general . <p> Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography to manage the security of each transaction and to control the creation of new units . There is no central bank managing the monetary supply of the currency , but its monetary rules instead have already been coded into the network by its anonymous founder(s) , Satoshi Nakomoto . The integrity of the network is then maintained by a network of decentralized miners who solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency , as it uses cryptography in maintaining the integrity of the network . Bitcoin is the first decentralized cryptocurrency . Many other cryptocurrencies have since been created , some based on Bitcoin 's source code and others being coded from scratch . These alternative cryptocurrencies are also known as altcoins . <h> Who uses cryptocurrency ? Where can it be used ? <p> At this point in time , cryptocurrencies are used by a group of tech-savvy individuals who value privacy , especially in light of recent massive data breaches like Target 's credit card information breach . <p> Bitcoin can be used to purchase many items , with Coinbase and Bitpay providing merchant processing services . Nearly 90,000 businesses are using Coinbase or Bitpay to accept Bitcoin . Expedia , Dell , Overstock and Microsoft are some of the major companies accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment . Users interested in using altcoins to pay for their purchases can make use of ShapeShift Lens that will pay a Bitcoin address using the user 's altcoin of choice . <p> However , it should also be noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes like drug purchases on Silk Road and for online gambling . <h> Can you tell us the story behind CoinGecko ? <p> One evening , my partner TM and I were discussing some strategies on how we can profitably trade alternative cryptocurrencies in the market . We were both looking for a more effective way to spot early price trends after missing out on the huge spike in Dogecoin prices , thereby forgoing a profit opportunity for a coin that we both initially thought was a joke . <p> We researched methods to help give us a competitive advantage and found people sharing various methods of evaluating cryptocurrencies by looking at community engagement and developer activity . We found that those sharing these ideas were making many qualitative claims without having much data to back up their claims . Some people made a time-consuming attempt to manually collect some of these data to evaluate altcoins . <p> We reckoned that there must be a better way for data to be automatically collected and altcoins to be ranked in a fair way . We decided to give this a go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview of the altcoin market , and that 's when we started our first steps in creating CoinGecko . <h> Who should be visiting CoinGecko ? What will they find ? <p> CoinGecko is a cryptocurrency ranking website that aims to give a 360-degree overview of the cryptocurrency market . There are now over 500 altcoins in the market , and evaluating each of these coins is time consuming . At the time of writing , CoinGecko collects data for over 200 of the most important cryptocurrencies and benchmarks them against a set of standardized metrics to rank them . In determining the health of a cryptocurrency , we look at developer activity on the open-source repository , community engagement on social media channels , trading volume on exchanges , public interest and market capitalization . <p> Our efforts in collecting all these data have generated a lot of interest among cryptocurrency traders , coin community members and also university researchers . Traders find our price pages such as the following Dash price page beneficial in looking at historical price charts . Coin community members find the wealth of data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite cryptocurrencies . University researchers , meanwhile , find the data on our individual coin pages very useful in observing the state of cryptocurrency markets . <h> How did you become interested in cryptocurrency ? <p> I became really interested in cryptocurrency during the Cypriot financial crisis in 2013 . The threat of bank deposit seizures by the Cypriot government for deposits supposed to be protected under the federal deposit insurance scheme brought me to ask if federal deposit insurance schemes can really be trusted . <p> A statement by the government can remove the trust almost immediately , and when reports of Cypriots attempting to use Bitcoin to protect their assets began surfacing , I was really intrigued in finding out how Bitcoin can be used to protect assets against unwarranted seizures . <p> Bitcoin 's proposition of " being your own bank " - whereby users can control their own private keys containing the " password " to spend funds and thereby trusting no one except themselves to hold the funds - struck me as a very innovative way for users to prevent seizures of assets . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their assets without trusting anyone through this decentralized network . <h> What are the advantages of cryptocurrency ? <p> Cryptocurrencies provide a low-cost way to transfer value from one user to another 24/7 , 365 days a year . It also has a very low minimum transfer amount . As a result , many companies are finding Bitcoin a good use case for remittance , payments and microtransactions . <p> Traditional remittance providers like Western Union charge high rates for remittance , which Bitcoin companies are trying to reduce . Payments using Bitcoin can also save merchants the usual fees or merchant discount rate of 1-3 percent . Also , because Bitcoin transactions are pushed by consumers instead of being pulled by merchants , this will significantly reduce the occurrences of fraud . Bitcoin transactions are irreversible ; and because of that , merchants can be assured that payments received will not be charged back by banks because of fraud . <p> Using cryptocurrency , it is also now possible to send small amounts of money across the Internet . For example , using ChangeTip , it is now possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to tip a Youtube video creator $0.40 for a video that is entertaining . Traditional payment rails using credit cards have a minimum payment amount of $0.50 . Dogecoin made its name as the first cryptocurrency that popularizes the idea of tipping . <p> Another advantage of cryptocurrency is the pseudonymous nature of the currency . Because there are no names associated with each payment address , it will require more effort to associate a particular transaction or address to any particular user , and some users like the privacy that is offered . <h> What are the most popular forms of cryptocurrency ? What are the most valuable ? <p> Bitcoin is the most popular and valuable form of cryptocurrency now . It is the first decentralized cryptocurrency and has the largest network effect . All other cryptocurrencies pale in comparison to Bitcoin as can be seen by metrics shown on CoinGecko . <p> The first altcoin , Ripple , was only launched two years after Bitcoin was created ; and this is one of the many reasons explaining why all other cryptocurrencies are not as popular or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the de facto reserve currency for all cryptocurrencies , thus further boosting its value . <h> What headlines surrounding cryptocurrency are you following closely today ? <p> I follow the legal and regulatory aspects of cryptocurrency very closely . Because cryptocurrencies involve cross-border value transfer , a lot of existing financial regulations apply to operators in this ecosystem . Different countries are taking different approaches in regulating cryptocurrencies , and development of the ecosystem will flourish in geographic boundaries which take a more light-handed approach like the U.K. - compared to more stringent states like the BitLicense in New York . <p> I also follow cryptocurrency innovation and new coin launches very closely because we track and rank these coins . I also pay close attention to headlines of scams because bad actors hurt all players in the industry and the industry needs to do a better job at self-regulation . <p> I look out for all these headlines , and at the end of each week , I send out a weekly cryptocurrency newsletter called AltcoinWeekly containing the top news stories of the week . <h> What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still at the infancy of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology development . There is a lot of experimentation in general because of the permissionless innovation nature of cryptocurrencies , and there will be many trials and errors before a good use case is found . <p> I think in the long run , cryptocurrencies will most likely play a large role in machine-to-machine interactions in the Internet of Things future . Distributed Autonomous Organizations will also play a large role , with smart contracts executing automatically based on events . In general , I think cryptocurrency and blockchain technology hold some key ideas that will make the traditional financial systems more efficient through lower cost structures . <p> In the medium term , I see a very strong use of cryptocurrencies in the remittance and microtransaction industry . A lot of venture capital are flowing into Bitcoin companies that aim to reduce the cost of cross-border payments and also enable small value transfers over the Internet . Online tipping might become a norm of the future , and new business models might develop such as content creators charging small fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisements . 
@@11804871 @404871/ <h> More stories from Joshua Ritchie @qwx171675 <h> Why a Strong Dollar Matters to You <p> A statement we frequently hear from economic analysts is that America needs a " strong dollar . " And most of the time , the non-economically savvy segment of the population blankly nods in agreement . Lacking a deep understanding of why a strong dollar is beneficial ( or even what a strong dollar means ) , most people nevertheless prefer a strong dollar to a weak one . However , the words " strong " and " weak " are the source of much confusion on this issue . In virtually every other area of life , strength is categorically , universally preferred to weakness . Using such language to describe fluctuations in the value of a currency invests emotional meaning into the situation , implying that a strong dollar is always preferable . In fact , the strong dollar/weak dollar debate is more complicated than it initially seems to be . Most experts , for instance , agree that a strong dollar ( as commonly defined ) is better in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with data and convincing arguments contend that a " weak " dollar can actually accelerate recovery from a recession , such as the one we find ourselves in today . Naturally , both of these positions require a firm grasp of both what a strong and weak dollar actually means , and why each of them lead to different outcomes depending on the state of the economy . <p> Today , well address the strong dollar/weak dollar debate into perspective and explain what each of them means for you . <h> Strong &amp; Weak Dollars Defined <p> For those who are not already aware , let 's define what a strong dollar actually means . Very simply , a strong dollar is one that , " can be increased for a large or growing amount of foreign currency " , according to InvestorWords.com . Typically , a strong dollar is seen as a good thing because it means American citizens and businesses can get more foreign goods and services for the same amount of money . An American citizen could bring $1,000 to France , for example , and buy more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually paid for in the currency of the country doing the importing . Consequently , America as a whole tends to import far more goods and services than it exports for however long the dollar is stronger than the currencies of the nations we trade with . <p> A weak dollar , as you may have gathered , is one that , " can be exchanged for only a small or decreasing amount of foreign currency . " A weak dollar is usually seen as a bad thing because it does not stretch as far internationally as it once did . Indeed , the opposite is true : foreign currencies buy more of our goods and services than we can buy of theirs . But while imports are usually purchased using the importing nations currency , exports are paid for in the currencies of the exporting country . Therefore , a weak dollar has the ability to change the entire flow of trade that occurs when the dollar is strong . When the dollar is weak , America as a whole tends to export more goods and services than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the above discussion , it may look like a strong dollar is always most desirable . But as we alluded to earlier , many experts disagree with that conclusion . A case in point is Bob McTeer of DailyMarkets.com . " If I had to choose with no qualifications " , McTeer writes , " I 'd choose the strong dollar . " Among his reasons are the fact that a strong dollar " benefits consumers by holding down the price of imports and keeps the pressure on producers and exporters to keep costs down and productivity up . " McTeer also wisely points out that a strong dollar attracts foreign investment more readily . In the long term , he concludes , " a strong dollar is good for our standard of living . " During a recession , however , McTeers analysis changes . <p> While a naturally stronger dollar ( that is , a dollar whose value rises because demand for American imports rises ) is still beneficial , a dollar made stronger by political fiat and interference can actually slow an economic recovery by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for imports . " The consequences are potentially disastrous as far as recovery is concerned . The deficit of trade that results from our artificially strong dollar can " divert demand to our trading partners " , thereby diminishing demand for American products and services at a time when that is , by definition , the very thing we need for a true recovery . Of course , McTeer concedes that being in favor of a " weak " dollar ( even within certain tightly circumscribed conditions and circumstances ) , " still does n't  seem right " to many observers . To think about the issue and the forces at work more clearly , he suggests substituting the word " competitive " for " weak " , which eliminates the negative emotional connotation . <p> MSNBC also reported in February 2010 that a resurgent US dollar could be , " the latest threat to recovery " from the current recession . While the dollar , " surged to an 8-month high against the euro , and is also rising against other major currencies " , that could actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US economy right now . " As a direct result , American businesses will pay more to sell their products overseas while , " imports here will be cheaper good for consumers , but bad for businesses . " The Peterson Institute for International Economics ( a nonpartisan research group ) breaks it down even more specifically . For every 1% increase in the value of the dollar averaged against major foreign currencies US exports are reduced by , " about $20 billion annually " , which , " destroys some 150,000 jobs . " Like Bob Mcteer , MSNBC agrees that supporting a weak ( or competitive ) dollar may not intuitively feel right , but that during a recession , stronger does not necessarily mean better . <h> The Takeaway <p> To recap , we have learned that " strong " and " weak " dollars are not categorically good or bad for America as a whole . Certain segments of the economy are hurt or helped by either , depending on whether we are in a recession or not . Furthermore , during recessions , a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a needed boost to the sagging economy by promoting increased exports of our goods to other countries .

But , as the Bargain Babe , I 'm not convinced that brewing my own beer is any cheaper than buying it from the store . Of course , this is assuming my homemade beer would taste as good as a pint of my favorite store-bought brand . <p> Well , I finally decided to settle the debate once and for all . Here is my breakdown of home brew vs. store-bought beer . <h> Does brewing your own beer save money ? <p> First , let 's compare the cost of home brew to the cost of store-bought for an entire year . For the sake of the experiment , let 's also assume that you consume one six-pack a week .

Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week on a middle-of-the-road six-pack , which amounts to- $364 ( plus tax ) a year . <h> The True Cost of Home Brewing <p> For home brew , you have to invest in supplies , plus ingredients for each batch . <p> A basic home brewing kit at MoreBeer.com costs $109 . Shipping is free . An ingredient kit , called extract , for mild brown beer costs $25 and makes 5 gallons , or about 50 beers ( equivalent to 8.3 six-packs ) . A tube of liquid yeast costs $5.75 and bottle caps ( I 'm going to assume you saved empty beer bottles to avoid the cost of buying new ones ) will run you $1.50 . That brings the cost of your first batch of home brewed beer to $141.25 . <p> That 's $16.95 per six-pack ! <p> However , each additional batch of home brew only costs $32.25 ( extract + yeast + caps ) .

With that kind of savings , - brewing your own beer might not be the kind of money-saving endeavor that would help fund your next vacation or amount to a significant contribution to your emergency fund . <p> Also , if time is money , that figure does n't take into account the hours spent making beer , either . But . on the flip side , how could I ever put a price on the street cred I would earn for making my own beer ? ! ! Plus , in my opinion , brewing beer sure beats watching TV as a hobby . <h> The Bottom Line <p> I 've made plenty of things myself , like granola bars , bagels , and hummus .

@@11804907 @404907/ <h> Expert Interview with a Goncalo Moreira of FXStreet On Foreign Exchange For Entrepreneurs <p> The principles behind foreign exchange are simple : every country on earth has its own currency , and those currencies have different values . These rates are changing constantly , creating a speculatory market similar to trading futures in the US stock market . <p> With the speed and hyper-connectivity of the Information Age , foreign exchange has gotten a lot more complicated while also yielding copious opportunities for small businesses . Foreign exchange for entrepreneurs can be just the thing to help them get their business off the ground or take their business to the next level . <p> We talked to Gon+alo Moreira , research expert for the company FXStreet , to learn the ins and outs of foreign exchange - how to get started , what the risks are , and what the potential of foreign exchange is for entrepreneurs . - <h> First of all , can you talk a bit about what foreign exchange is and why it 's important to understand in today 's globalized climate ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a cash-bank market when the US Dollar went off the gold standard and began to float against other currencies . Unlike other asset classes , the foreign exchange market is made up of a network of players clustered in various hubs around the globe , rather than organized in centralized exchanges . <p> Among its several functions , money serves as a unit of measure . In domestic economic terms , this is relatively easy to understand . But in today 's globalized world , with its fast communication channels , it becomes increasingly complex . People can perceive the price of many things being bought and sold around the planet , and immediately evaluate those prices in terms of the money they are using domestically . <p> People then transact upon this perception of imbalances among relative prices , and the resulting money flows as a reflection of their thinking ( with all their fears , expectations , desires , etc. ) and clashes against the maneuvering of central banks . These institutions seem fixated to do " whatever it takes " to manufacture their own course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controls , and ever more debt . <p> This will most inevitably lead to a global sovereign debt crisis that sends massive shock waves across the global economy . In such an environment , the currency world turns out to be " the " asset class to better perceive the fair value of all other assets , and to follow the capital trends which will try to survive the passage from an old inefficient system to a new , hopefully , equitable one . - <h> Where are the most common places to trade currencies ? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each ? <p> Currencies can be bought and sold , i.e. exchanged , through the use of different instruments . These can be traded in centralized or decentralized markets . The biggest amount of transactions is done over-the-counter in the form of cash , mainly between big financial institutions . A smaller amount is traded through derivative instruments such as future contracts or options on exchanges . Other instruments such as forwards are used mainly by financial institutions , while ETFs are gaining a lot of traction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created to fulfill a specific need , like covering the risk in a commercial deal , for instance . But from a pure speculative perspective , the choice of instrument has more to do with the style of trading , level of capitalization , and time horizon of the transaction . <p> On the retail front , there are many brokerages that enable the access to these instruments ; and in the spot market specifically , they also offer different intermediation models to choose from - from pure market making to agency models . No one is better than another , but careful study is needed to make a sound choice . - <h> It 's been suggested that foreign exchanges , such as OFEX , are easier and less expensive to get started in than the United States stock exchanges . How can entrepreneurs take advantage of foreign exchanges to take their business to the next level ? <p> As for trading costs , it 's true that the non-exchange traded currency market offers lower costs and margin requirements . But from an analytical and strategical point of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , even if many of the techniques used to perform price forecasts are the same , it 's quite a different world . Currencies are traded in pairs where one currency quote is more like a relative strength ratio rather than a " price . " But being a bidirectional market , this means also that profits can be obtained equally in up and down trending markets . <p> Concerning the advantages of foreign exchange trading for businesses which are in some way exposed to foreign exchange , it 's basically about understanding the currency risk and managing that risk to a sustainable level . Common techniques like hedging and instruments such as options , futures , and forwards can be used to mitigate this risk . - <h> For entrepreneurs operating overseas , it 's possible to work with a foreign exchange specialist and lock in an exchange rate in advance . How might someone go about doing that , and why would they want to ? <p> Yes , there are products to lock in a rate in advance which you can get by working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce . Recently , there have also been innovative companies such as Kantox that offer peer-to peer solutions at very affordable prices . In any case , working with a foreign exchange specialist is a must for most companies operating overseas , since you need someone capable not only of making logical price forecasts , but also to estimate and measure any changes in volatility conditions - besides knowing when to cover risks and which instruments and strategies to apply . At FXStreet , we collaborate with many companies that offer these kinds of services . <p> When you ask export-oriented companies what factors prevented them from increasing their export levels , fluctuations in exchange rates are the number one factor mentioned . Small and medium-sized companies , in particular , lack the basic knowledge to manage foreign exchange risk . <h> Have there been any particularly well-performing or reliable foreign exchange investments that you 've noticed - like pounds to dollars , for instance ? <p> The main trend we are observing right now is the US dollar appreciation against most of its peers , which was exhibited during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , constructive trends or even lateral moving prices in USD-denominated assets could be interesting to overseas investors as they would perceive positive relative returns in those assets should the trend resume , and we have strong reasons to believe it will based on the scenario mentioned in the first question . <p> A bull market in the USD would create massive havoc in many areas of the world where currencies are pegged to the USD and debt has been issued in USD . This may accelerate the trend enormously and create a lack of liquidity without precedent . In turn , a strong USD will ultimately cause many internal problems in the USA which will revert back and serve as an argument for depreciation . We have to understand that a strong currency is not inherently positive like a strong priced stock . It can hurt an export-oriented economy with all its consequences on growth and labor . <p> So , while the likelihood for a USD bull market to develop is high , profiting from it may be not so easy to master with a simple trend-following approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk upon any FX trading business , be it a market user or a market maker . - <h> What are some of the risks of getting into foreign exchange unprepared or having unrealistic expectations ? <p> The biggest risks I 've seen traders undergo while working in the retail sector for many years have to do with being undercapitalized , underestimating leverage , and overestimating their skills . With a too small account , it becomes realistically difficult to mitigate the effects of leverage . Besides , big investment firms get slaughtered with lower effective leverages than the ones seen in most retail accounts . These are dangers most aspiring traders ( and not so aspiring ) are rational enough to understand . But they still expect to rely on their skills to compensate for the lack of capital and the high gearing , falling prey to the human tendency to have overconfidence in one 's beliefs and skills . There are many behavioral theories which explain this phenomenon . - <h> What are a few steps you 'd recommend for entrepreneurs who are just getting started with foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading opportunities , so I would recommend to take your time and never rush into the market ; and once in , never rush into trades .

This will free you from the most difficult endeavor there is : to forecast the direction of a price trend and estimate the turning points accurately . Spending time in the market can prove much more lucrative than timing the market . <p> Finally , on the personal level , I would recommend to dissect your mind and personality to a point where you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment , and sincerely assess if your have the right profile to do it .

Items that are a pain to get replaced such as birth certificates and other family records definitely belong here . <p> Another important item to remember for insurance purposes is a videotape of your homes content for insurance purposes , and a copy of this video definitely belongs in your safe deposit box . Contracts , stocks , bonds , certificates of deposit , original deeds to property , collectibles and rare jewels are also commonly kept in safe deposit boxes .

Check the outlet stores and seasonal sales to get well-made , name-brand lightweight gear for less .

Incorporated in 2000 as a 501c3 organization and small by design , D2D aims to make the " mass market " viable and attractive to serve , designing appealing financial products that break down traditional barriers to access and participation . At the core of this approach is innovation , such as a reduction in the cost to serve working families , imaginative new products and delivery channels , changes in public policy , and new tools to help inform and incentivize consumers . <p> Now a decade into our work , D2D has had a record of success in driving innovation that achieves impact through cross-sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have helped change the financial services landscape and impacted hundreds of thousands of consumers ' lives . <p> Doorways To Dreams ' mission is to strengthen the financial opportunity and security of financially-vulnerable consumers . What are some reasons why it 's a good idea for everybody to empower this demographic ? <p> Almost all Americans have at some point in their lives experienced financial vulnerability due to the loss of a job , medical expenses , or the wrath of Mother Nature . Only 48% of respondents in a Federal Reserve study said that they could completely cover a hypothetical emergency expense costing $400 without selling something or borrowing money . <p> The link between household savings and family stability is increasingly accepted , backed both by decades of academic work and simple common sense . Families that have something in reserve are better able to handle financial crises and better positioned to pursue long-term financial goals , such as home ownership or a college education for their children . <p> Too many American households have inadequate savings , inadequate tools to help them manage their financial affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices in support of their goals ) ; this situation increases their vulnerability to short-term income and expense shocks , and limits their ability to build a more prosperous future . <p> We must find ways to support the financial aspirations of all Americans . This means creating easy , appealing and innovative products and opportunities that are accessible to all regardless of income status . <p> Would you mind giving a brief overview of how Doorways To Dreams works ? <p> Doorways to Dreams ( D2D ) Fund works to improve the economic well-being of millions of financially vulnerable American consumers through innovation . <p> D2D generates practical ideas for financial products , services and policies ; pilot tests its ideas , and pursues scale strategies to reach millions of households . D2D uses a four-stage innovation process to bring policies and products to market that increase the financial security and opportunity for financially-vulnerable consumers . <p> Given that the first step is ideation , how do you go about looking for this information ? Secondly , what are a few recent trends you 've noticed ? <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Research - We update our understanding of the financial innovation landscape through market scans , outreach to key stakeholders ( academics , entrepreneurs , investors , policymakers/regulators ) and literature reviews . Expert convenings - We foster dialog among experts from diverse backgrounds ( e.g. , technologists , behavioral economists , industrial designers , sociologists ) on financial innovation topics . This work is important because innovation often emerges from interactions among different ideas , disciplines and experiences . Original research - We conduct in-depth interviews and/or surveys of financially-vulnerable consumers to understand their aspirations , needs , resources and constraints . Crowdsourcing - We have used cash prizes paired with public competitions and hack-a-thons to crowdsource new ideas and insights . This approach taps the creative thinking and experience of a diverse set of stakeholders , and has powered two rounds of mobile technology innovation development . <p> The two areas that we think are ripe for innovation include gamified tools that promote positive financial behaviors , and products and policies that link savings and credit . The popularity of gamified health apps such as Fitbit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and competition to engage people in behavior change . We are applying these same principles to help consumers build savings and adopt new financial behaviors . We have developed SavingsQuest , an app that prompts users to earn badges , complete challenges , and track progress by saving money . Additionally , the app has a unique " Save Now " feature that provides instant gratification for saving small amounts of money . <p> The Savings-Credit area is also ripe for innovation , as the accumulation of " big data " ( including savings data ) promises a new input to underwrite lending , start-up firms explore ways to bundle savings and credit offers , and innovators recognize that saving behavior can be rewarded with sensible credit offers . <p> You 've talked about how an emphasis on asset building and wealth creation were two of the initial components that led to D2D 's inception . What are some methods that you 've discovered in your time ? Why is asset building important ? <p> Saving is a core financial function and central to economic security and opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are financially vulnerable . Yet savings is often viewed as atop a hierarchy of financial needs , a " nice to have " behavior undertaken only when other more essential functions ( transacting , borrowing ) are satisfied . D2D believes in a different model : one where saving facilitates and is integrated into other financial functions - and , as a result , is both more likely to occur and to deliver greater value to consumers . <p> It 's no secret that American families struggle to save . One reason is that we tend to view spending as inherently gratifying , but see saving as boring or self-denial . Yet evidence from around the world suggests that infusing saving with fun and suspense can dramatically increase its appeal . Against this backdrop , D2D and its partners created Save to Win ( STW ) in 2009 . This credit union product offers members a chance to win transformative prizes ( up to $100k ) and smaller monthly prizes for each $25 deposit . <p> Another example of adding fun to the savings mix are can be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted financial lessons and encourage related action-taking . D2D has developed a library of games that deliver immersive , fun learning experiences related to credit card debt &amp; spending , budgeting , compound interest , debt &amp; savings , saving &amp; investing for retirement , and college financial decision-making . <p> Another of your goals is to make the " mass market " viable and attractive to serve , designing appealing financial products that break down traditional barriers . First of all , what are some of these traditional barriers you 're talking about ? Secondly , could you give us an overview of some of the products that you offer ? Are there any that are particularly popular ? <p> Traditional barriers to savings are both structural and behavioral . As the FDIC and others have documented , nearly 1 in 13 US households have no connection to traditional depositories , and many have no savings account . High minimum deposit requirements and fees to open savings products are part of the explanation for these figures . But saving is also difficult , and many of us avoid getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something aside . <p> The D2D model attacks both causes by piloting and evaluating new products , and then advocating for private and public sector actors to offer the most promising solutions to the mass market . Some innovations that have proven successful include : <p> Prize-linked Savings : Save to Win ( STW ) has been changing lives of credit union members in many states since 2009 . This national award winning prize-linked savings product was created by Doorways to Dreams Fund , the Michigan Credit Union League , Filene Research Institute and eight Michigan credit unions . It was designed to help consumers , especially low-to-moderate income people , improve their financial lives and create better savings habits . Prize-linked savings ( PLS ) products link the fun and excitement of winning to the act of saving . It 's a win-win for consumers ; they set money aside , gain interest and earn chances to win . While many account holders win prizes , all those who open a Save to Win account win by walking away with the savings they set aside and any interest earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate that allows for unlimited deposits throughout the year . Only $25 is required to open the account , a low barrier to entry which makes the product accessible to all and attractive to more financially-vulnerable consumers . A saver earns chances to win monthly cash prizes and periodic grand prizes for every $25 deposited in the account . <p> Save to Win has helped over 50,000 account holders save more than $94 million , and served as a model for The American Savings Promotion Act ( H.R. 3374 ) , landmark bipartisan legislation that removes legal barriers to banks and thrifts offering PLS products . Signed into law in December , 2014 , this legislation allows financial institutions across the country to offer Prize Linked Savings products . <p> SaveYour Refund : Save Your Refund is a multi-year campaign to increase the number of tax filers who use tax time as an opportunity to save through U.S. Savings Bonds or another mechanism . The annual federal tax refund is the largest sum of cash many American households receive all year , amounting to as much as 20% of annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an average refund of $2,867 per filer in 2011 , with over $324 billion refunded . Each tax filer has a unique opportunity to set aside savings with an influx of cash at tax time . Tax time is also a moment when filers are primed to be thinking about financial decisions . Many Americans do not realize that the IRS has created a specific form built right into the tax filing process that enables all American tax filers to automatically save a portion of their tax refund with one simple step . D2D 's work informed the IRS and Treasury Department as it created Form 8888 , enabling a seamless and universal opportunity to save . SaveYourRefund capitalizes on this tax-time moment and this easy method of saving with an exciting incentive for filers to save : frequent chances to win significant prize money ( 100 weekly $100 prizes and a grand prize of $25,000 ) . In the current tax season , tax filers have already reported saving $1.7 million . <p> Staples Farm Blitz : Staples Farm Blitz , available at the App Store and Google Play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It utilizes Financial Entertainment to reduce the stress associated with financial education and maximizes engagement among employees . It also bypasses challenges to implementation and effectiveness that discourage employers from offering financial wellness programs by being cost effective and instantly scalable . Financial wellness at work programs are gaining popularity amid growing evidence that financial stress is a significant distraction in the workplace . D2D partnered with the office supply retailer Staples to develop a brand-specific mobile app and web-enabled casual video game that challenges players to manage their debt while harvesting crops on their own farm . As players purchase farm supplies on credit , they also accumulate " debt bunnies , " which represent compounding interest and fees . At the end of each round players must use their profits to pay off debt ( and get rid of their bunnies ) and add to their savings . <p> Additionally , Kyra , the resident farmer in the game , provides advice about the value of emergency savings and the risks of managing unexpected health , family , or work-related expenses with debt . Players watch their net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , building confidence and understanding as they seek to win the game round . As employers expand financial wellness programs for their workforces , D2D looks forward to continuing to innovate and expand access to financial wellness video games to employers , workers and workforce development programs across the country . <p> For lower to middle-income families and individuals looking to get into asset building and investment for the first time , what advice would you give ? <p> The steps to successful behavior change - whether it is eating healthier or saving more - build on some of the same principles . <p> Set a goal - Have a realistic goal and make it visible : In interviews with consumers , we have found that those who state a clear goal ( such as " saving for my child 's education " ) and make it visible by , for example , placing a picture of their child in their billfold or Tweeting it , are more successful . <p> Get support - Encouraging others in your group to save too : Research has shown that people are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those same behaviors .

Heres what you need to know about them . <p> Similar to their US cousins , GICs pay a set percentage of interest based on the period of time for which your money is locked in . Basically , a GIC is a loan to the bank , credit union or deposit broker . You can often choose to invest for a fixed period of time as little as 6 months to as long as 10 years . The longer the time frame , the higher the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) <p> You might want to consider going with a GIC term of 5 years or less , as that is the maximum term that the CDIC will insure , with a dollar value up to $100,000 . <p> And much like CDs in the United States , with a GIC you are required to keep your money in the account for the duration of the term. - If you need to pull the money out sooner , there may be a penalty or even no interest paid at all . While this defeats the point of investing in a GIC , its good to know that you can get at your money if you find yourself in a situation where you need it . <p> But there are ways around it . You can avoid early withdrawal penalties by investing in a redeemable GIC , which allows you to withdraw your money at any time and still receive the interest you 've earned up to that point . Of course , there 's a trade off with redeemable GICs , and in that they pay less interest than a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the GIC rate is based on current interest rates at the time you invest in the account . So a Guaranteed Investment Certificate may not be a great investment in low interest environments . This is the risk with a GIC : a low enough interest rate and a higher inflation rate will actually give you a negative real return . <p> So how can you reduce this interest rate risk ? The key is to invest each year as a previous GIC amount matures . This is know as a GIC ladder . Sound familiar ? If you live in the United States , you may have heard of a so-called " CD ladder " or " bond ladder " . The concepts work quite the same way in both countries . <p> For example , if you have $10,000 to invest , you would split out $2,000 amounts in a 1 year , 2 year , 3 year , 4 year and 5 year GIC . Then each year you 'll have one fifth of your investment mature , setting you up to reinvest that amount ( plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By using GICs this way , you get the interest rate benefits of a 5-year term , but a portion of your money is available each year . This allows you to benefit from better rates in certain years by reinvesting the money in another 5-year GIC . If interest rates are not so attractive that year , you might decide to put that money to better use in another investment vehicle . <p> The other risk to your return is that the interest on GICs is fully taxable at your marginal tax rate . You can avoid paying tax be keeping your Guaranteed Investment Certificates in either a TFST ( a Tax-Free Savings Account ) - or RRSP ( a Registered Retirement Savings Plan ) . While you 'll never pay tax if the GIC is held in a TFST , remember that you will be taxed when you withdraw for your RRSP . <p> Not having your interest taxed instantly improves your return after all , you wont be losing a third or more of it to the government . <p> GICs can be a great addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you look to increase your opportunity for higher interest rates and hold them in a tax sheltered account . <p> Tom Drake is the head writer for Canadian Finance Blog , writing about universal topics such as saving , frugality and earning extra income , as well as Canadian specific topics like RRSPs and TFSTs .

The Canadian landscape is rich in resources , the financial sector is fundamentally sound and our commodity-backed currency is one of the strongest among developed markets . <p> The Canadian stock market has been handily out-performing other indexes around the globe , with the TSX Composite Index averaging 15 percent growth per year over the past 20 years . <p> As safe and promising as the Canadian economy appears , there are also plenty of risks for investors .

The job has come to symbolize Wall Street itself and even those with little or no investing experience know what a stock broker does for a living . <p> Stock brokers are basically Wall Street middleman : buying and selling stocks on behalf of investors , collecting a commission for each transaction . <p> But stock brokers are slowly becoming a dying breed . Thanks to the Internet , passive investing and automation , investors are now capable of doing themselves what brokers have traditionally charged them to do . <h> The Rise of Discount Brokerage Firms <p> One of the biggest reasons for the decline of the stock broker profession has been the rise of discount brokerage firms . As far back as 2005 , BusinessWeek reported that discount outfits had eroded the profit margins of stock brokerages , such that only wealthy clients got much face-to-face attention and stock brokers were " an almost extinct breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no signs of stopping . Online-only firms like E*Trade theoretically eliminate the need to hire stock brokers at all by enabling knowledgeable investors to execute trades all on their own , using web technology . Discount brokerages , as the name implies , thrive by offering the same services as stock brokers for far less money , cutting their own commissions down to the bone to attract more business and make up the difference in volume . <h> Passive Investing <p> Another contributor to the diminishing role of stock brokers is the growing popularity of passive investing . In the late 1980s , investment author Burton G. Malkiel made waves in the financial community with his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street . The book was not so much an attack on stock brokers as it was an assault on the entire idea of actively managed investing . Using an impressive array of data and studies , Malkiel convincingly showed that most investors lack consistent skill at timing markets or picking winning stocks over the long-term . <p> His most controversial claim was that a monkey throwing wet paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert armed with statistics and stock picking formulas . Intrigued ( and no doubt annoyed ) by this statement , the Wall Street Journal took it as a challenge and ran a simulated experiment where people threw darts at stock charts while experts picked stocks deliberately . While the dart throwers did n't  win out ( the experts got it right 61 out of 100 tries ) , the experiment did show the investing public that completely random dart tosses beat the experts 39% of the time . <h> The Growing Role of " Financial Advisors " <p> In response to their shrinking margins , many stock brokers and brokerage firms have widened the scope of their services to include broad financial planning . The goal has been to " de-commoditize " and differentiate themselves from discount brokerages , and in large part , it has worked . While there were still l 661,000 " registered representatives " in 2005 ( down 2% from 2001 ) , the actual day-to-day job descriptions of those brokers has undergone a near-total overhaul . <p> Rather than cold-calling investors and pitching specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly known as " stock brokers " is now helping clients develop and put into motion long-term , comprehensive financial plans .

It involves more work , to be sure but also fatter commission checks for the top performers . <h> Downsizing on Wall Street <p> Wall Street in general has been the victim of substantial downsizing as a recent of recent financial meltdowns . In February 2009 , CNBC wrote of an " avalanche of Wall Street layoffs " that is " leaving many in the financial industry feeling more than a little desperate . " Consistent with the general trend of stock brokers fading away , CNBC also notes that " unlike previous downturns " many of the Wall Street jobs that are disappearing are n't  likely to come back .

The days of an individual or entire firm being built solely around stock recommendations and trades is more or less over . What has replaced them are full-service financial advisors and advisory firms who assist people in building comprehensive , over-arching financial plans for all aspects of their lives . <p> In other words : the role of the swashbuckling , charismatic , cold-calling trader Charlie Sheen immortalized in Wall Street is likely a relic of a bygone era.

And they did n't just feel incompetence when it comes to money - they 're scared about it , he says . <p> " But that fear of incompetence is a myth , " Charles says . " For those of you who think you are less competent in the area of money , consider that if you spent anywhere near the same amount of time learning about money as you have spent in the areas that you care about , you would be just as capable about money as you are in the rest of your life !

Goldman Sachs prior to the Volker Rule in 2010 was a minority shareholder . <p> October 5 , 2011 , we launched TrimTabs Float Shrink ETF , TTFS , listed on the NYSE . Over its first three years through October 5 , 2014 , TTFS was up 96 percent . Over that same time frame the S&amp;P 500 ETF rose 83 percent . <p> The key to our success at TrimTabs , in my opinion , is our emphasis on the supply and demand of shares of stock and money . <p> What we have discovered is that the best single number investors should follow is free cash flow , not earnings and not sales . <p> Free cash flow is , in reality , very simple . Free cash flow is the amount of cash a public company has left after paying all bills , including interest , taxes , capital expenditures , research and development . <p> Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to outperform the rest of the market . <p> What steps do you recommend everyone take when setting out to improve their finances ? <p> First , write down all of your assets and all of your obligations . <p> Second , determine your average monthly take-home pay . Then figure out how much , if anything , you will have left on a monthly basis - averaging in annual costs such as insurance , real estate taxes , etc . <p> Then , only after you have at least a three-month cash cushion in the bank , invest the extra money on a monthly dollar cost average basis . <p> What do you think we can take away from the biggest money mistakes ? <p> Most investors give their money away to be managed and as a result almost universally under-perform the overall market - and usually by more then the fees . In reality , if we spend the time required longingly to understand our investments , we have a much better chance of outperforming . <p> When should we enlist help to come up with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a DIY approach ? <p> I have a rule about money management . Never give your money to someone who asks for it . If you must work with a financial advisor , find those that are too busy and do n't want your money . Absolutely make sure you not only check references but also actual past performance . If an advisor will not give you verifiable past performance data , walk away - fast . <p> How should we determine what to invest in ? <p> All of us have some area we are more knowledgeable about . Whether video games , apps , fashion , biotech , whatever . We all care more about some area then another . <p> What I recommend to beginning investors is investigate those companies doing the best in the areas you are interested . I would not recommend investing in startups or pie-in-the-sky dreams . Almost all bust - at least the deals that you would be invited to participate in . Remember , the good deals never get down to your level . <p> What I do recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Follow via Google or Yahoo all the news about those companies doing the best in the area you are following . After you think you actually can understand what is going on in a company , invest in that company monthly going forward , until you discover you might have been wrong . <p> Key point : No one only invests in winners . We all have duds . The key is that our winners significantly outperform the losers . <p> What are your favorite types of investments right now ? Why do you like them ? <p> What worries me the most is the fact that the U.S. economy is barely growing , but the overall stock market continues to do well . Why ? Ever since 2012 , the number of shares in the entire U.S. stock market has been shrinking . Companies are giving shareholders cash in exchange for stock .

Each day the people we are interviewing are entering a brand-ew world , and they are shaping that world . <p> P2P is all about individuals regaining control . Leading up to and during the crisis , we heard many stories about rate fixing , too big to fail , toxic mortgages , and the spreading of risk . No one supposedly saw it coming because the entire system was predicated on the immediate . Make quick money and if things turn sour , move on and let someone else clean up the mess . No one felt any sense of responsibility or obligation to shareholders , the government , employees , or people underwater on their mortgages . Now you are lending $10,000 to Dave in Boise who is renovating the rec room . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . <p> We also see very little unbiased reporting in alt-finance and feel compelled to offer a voice of reason and education . <p> People are regaining the power over their finances through the democratization in crowdfunding , and we can be a part of the movement to bring this to critical mass acceptance , and that is thrilling to consider . <p> So what is alternative finance ? What 's the history behind it ? What are some examples of where we see it every day ? <p> The concept is really a throwback ; it just has new names and the benefit of technology . Crowdfunding , peer-to-peer lending , real estate equity crowdfunding are the new categories ... - Kickstarter , - Indiegogo , - Prosper , and- Lending Club are the marquee names , but there are hundreds of players and sub-genres with more emerging every week . <p> Kickstarter is likely the most-known of the players at this point . To show you how compressed the timeframe is for this industry , Kickstarter is only five years old . They 've already pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity is the mother of invention , and that is true in the alt-finance space . After 2008 , credit dried up . You could n't get a mortgage , you could n't get funding to expand growth in small business ; banks were calling in debt from small businesses because they suddenly felt the risk was too much to support , even when those businesses always made their payments . <p> Why is there so much interest surrounding the topic today ? <p> There are many reasons for the high level of interest in crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending . One is that America is slugging through its economic recovery . <p> Given the high percentage of jobs created by small businesses , everything should be done to create a climate conducive to expansion and hiring , as it will provide the biggest stimulus to the economy and consumer confidence . Yet many businesses are not eligible for a traditional commercial bank loan until they reach a $3 million annual sales mark . For most , this leaves a gap between sales levels they can realistically obtain with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Generally , the bigger the banks get , the less value they see in making these small loans . Something has to fill the gap , and it 's the regular people , ironically , the ones who were initially most impacted in the downturn . They have regained some sense of control over outcomes , which is a basic , healthy human need . <p> We also love the pioneering atmosphere in the industry right now . New achievements are happening every week . There 's this pervasive sense that we are looking out on a new world with many , many possibilities . We sense we are on the ground floor of a movement that will radically change the global economy . <p> There is also an incredible sense of collaboration within the industry . The smart ones know that the more companies that become successful , the better it is for industry entrenchment , so they are cheering for each other and sharing best practices in order for the industry as a whole to gain a wider acceptance in society . They know that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . <p> How is this industry affecting individual Americans ? What about business owners ? <p> Both have choices they did not have before . Individual Americans can identify with the underdog , the Mr. Smith trying to make it in business against the odds . They want Mr. Smith to succeed because they succeed with him . He 's not the big faceless multi-national ; he 's the guy down the street , with an idea and guts . <p> Individual Americans are also getting jobs out of it . <p> They regain control . For $50-$75 , which is close to the average support level for a crowdfunding campaign , the supporter gets the feeling of helping someone achieve their dreams . On the peer-to-peer lending side , Americans no longer have to be at the whim of banks and other traditional lending institutions . They know there is something inherently wrong with the credit card and loan interest rates they are paying , and this provides a way out . <p> Business owners also regain a sense of control , along with hope . The $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up floundering now has a realistic option . On the lending side , they have an option cheaper than credit cards and other forms of capital . <p> What sorts of questions should consumers and business owners ask when pursuing alternative forms of financing for their ventures ? What seem to be the most common pitfalls of these schemes ? <p> It 's important to review the success stories in each genre to compare their products , services , and goals with yours to know if you 're going down the right road . Do n't be afraid to reach out to companies for feedback and advice ... it 's a very collaborative space , and people who have made it through the process and succeeded seem to be compelled to help the next ones just starting out . <p> You also ca n't think it 's a shortcut to success . It takes a lot of work to complete a successful crowdfunding campaign . " We 'll launch our Kickstarter and everything will be fine . " It takes no less effort to secure funding through alternative means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it may be tougher than ever to stand out and clearly reach people with a meaningful differentiation strategy . <p> There 's also the fact that true equity crowdfunding has yet to mature in the U.S. The stalled JOBS Act has meant a delay in the real spirit of the movement . If the SEC ever gets it sorted , you will see an explosion in activity , and the associated explosion in fraud and scammers . <p> What are the biggest trends or headlines in the industry today ? <p> Real estate crowdfunding has been embraced by many and is poised to grow exponentially . There seems to be an innate need to own land , and this affords that opportunity . <p> Technology is also playing a significant role in the development of platforms and ideas . Investor screening and database management are becoming more refined every day .

If you 're lucky , you 'll have a very low deductible , or even none at all . <p> In many ways , the deductible is what stands in between you and your full health insurance benefits . It 's like the first hurdle you have to clear before your health plan starts to give back those premiums you paid . So , managing your deductible is key to understanding your plan and saving money . <p> If you 're one of the many people who find it difficult to keep track of where they are on their deductible , you might try one of the new online services , like Simplee or Cake Health , which are designed to make this much easier . <h> Essential Things to Know About Your Annual Deductible <p> - How much is your deductible ? <p> You should know this before you ever enroll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a good chance the deductible will be high .

Check your policy so you know where you get a free pass , and take advantage of it . <p> - Whether you have different deductibles <p> Some plans have separate deductibles for in-network care versus out-of-network care . This could cost you more money unnecessarily if you 've met one deductible and then see a doctor that counts towards the other. - So , find out the rules and always check whether providers are in-network before you go ( do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all take the same insurance ) . <p> If you have a family policy , check if there are separate or combined deductibles for each member that is covered . The rules can vary on this one , too . <p> - How often you actually meet your deductible <p> Odds are , if you purchased health insurance , you hope that it will pay for the health care you use .

@@11804942 @404942/ <h> Creating a Budget for Your Stomach <p> - <p> - <p> Creating a budget is easier when you can estimate variable expenses accurately . But food expenditures can change by 20% or more from one week to the next . And besides being necessary , food is a major part of the household budget . In January 2013 , a family of four with two adults and two children under 12 spent , on average , $128.10 to $291.00 per week on groceries , depending on factors like the age of the children and how carefully they controlled spending . There 's no " right " amount you should spend on food each week , but it 's important to include food when creating a budget . Here 's how . <p> First Step : Know Your Current Spending <p> Write it all down , no matter how painful . Count everything , including the bag of chips from the vending machine , the drive-thru breakfast , the canned goods you bought for the local food drive , and the box of Girl Scout Cookies you bought from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-time or unusual expenditure , write it down . Keep shopping receipts and write those totals down too . You need to do this for two weeks minimum , and average the weekly totals before creating a budget , since food expenditures vary . <p> Second Step : Identify Where You Overspend <p> The very act of writing down everything you spend on food usually makes it clear where you 're overspending . You may be shocked to learn that a Saturday fast food dinner for your family costs less than a sit-down dinner at your local Mexican place . And you may start to realize how expensive eating lunch out every day at work really is . <p> Consider the food you throw out as well . An August 2012 report by the National Resources Defense Council stated that the average American throws out around 25% of the food and beverages he or she buys . For a family of four , this could mean a couple thousand dollars per year spent on wasted food . Identifying waste is the first step to limiting it . <p> Third Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and it 's best to start by changing one habit before moving on to others . If you realize you 're overspending on lunches out , start packing a lunch two or three days per week . Soon this will become routine , and those lunches out will seem more special . Or , suppose you buy lots of fresh produce with the best of intentions , but a lot of it goes bad before it gets eaten . Cut back on how much you buy and you 'll spend less and waste less . Knowing where your non-optimal spending occurs let 's you identify a specific behavior to work on changing . <p> Fourth Step : Repeat Until Satisfied <p> Once you 've conquered one wasteful food spending habit , add another one . Maybe it 's using more store brand products instead of brand name products , or perhaps it 's clipping coupons . The point is , you can often find multiple ways to save after creating a budget . If you try to change everything at once , however , you may find all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep adding savings techniques until you have your weekly food spending at a level you can be happy with . <p> Fifth Step : Do n't Forget the Occasional Treat <p> Finally , it 's possible to take things too far . If you never take the family out for ice cream even though you can afford it , or if you never have dinner out with your partner even though both of you enjoy it , you may be taking austerity measures too far . Drastically tightening spending - like crash dieting - can eventually result in resentment and binges . Food is something to be enjoyed , and you do n't want to take all the enjoyment out of it by being overly restrictive . <p> Creating a budget for your stomach requires that you understand your current spending , and that you take into account the needs of your family , particularly if you have children . Often , simply cutting out wasteful spending gets your food budget under control , but if not , there are plenty of other good habits you can develop , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and improving your home cooking skills , something that the whole family can participate in and benefit from .

For example , if a company declares that next year 's dividend will be $1.00 per share , everyone holding 100 shares will receive $25.00 once per quarter . ( $1.00 x 100 shares = $100 ; and $100 ++ 4 quarters = $25 . ) <p> To find the dividend yield , you must divide the dollar value of the annual dividend by the current share price . For example , if today 's price per share is $40 per share , the $1.00 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5% . <p> So if you buy shares today at $40 per share , you will earn 2.5% per year from dividends . <p> A few points to make about this : <p> 1 . If you reinvest dividends , you get 2.5% compounded . Each quarter , instead of receiving $25 in cash , you buy additional partial shares . If the stock price next quarter is still $40 per share , the dividend buys you 62.5% of one share . That might not seem like a lot , but it adds up over time . <p> 2 . The higher the stock price goes , the lower the current yield . For example , if the stock prices rises to $55 per share , that $1 per share is reduced to 1.8% ( $1 ++ $55 = 1.8% ) . However , you should calculate your yield based on the price per share that you paid when you bought stock , and not on what it becomes later . <p> 3 . By the same mathematical reasoning , when the stock price falls , the dividend yield rises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from $40 down to $32 , the dividend yield rises to 3.125% ( $1 ++ $32 = 3.125% ) . <p> Anyone who tries to time the purchase or sale of stock to maximize dividend income should be aware of how those dates are figured . The ex-dividend date is the date on which stockholders of record earn dividends . Those dividends are not paid out until several weeks later . So before you buy or sell shares so that you will earn the dividend , find out when the ex-date occurs . If you buy after that date ( or sell before ) , you will not earn the quarterly dividend . <p> The dividend yield should be a key ingredient in your evaluation of your portfolio and in the selection of companies whose stock you are thinking of buying . Some companies pay exceptionally high dividends and yet are considered very safe investments . This is not always the case , so if you just pursue the highest possible yield , it makes sense to perform a few fundamental tests first , and to determine whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and highest-rated companies ( by Standard- &amp; Poor 's ) include : <p> - Company <p> - Dividend* <p> - Altria ( M ) <p> - 6.2% <p> - AT&amp;T ( T ) <p> - 5.9% <p> - H&amp;R Block ( HRB ) <p> - 5% <p> - Pfizer ( PFE ) <p> - 4.6% <p> *as of January 1 , 2011 . <p> Never pick a stock based solely on dividend yield .

@@11804993 @404993/ @qwx171675 <h> Comparing the 15-year and 30-year Mortgage <p> Many homeowners with a 30-year mortgage do n't  realize how much they are paying in interest . This is the problem . The solution for many is to accelerate the payment , either by- paying more principal each month or by entering into- a shorter repayment contract . The best-known among these is the 15-year term . <p> An example : If your mortgage balance starts out at $100,000 and your loan is written at 5% interest , the 30-year term requires a monthly payment of $536.83 . Over 30 years , the total of all payments adds up to just under $193,259 . That 's a 93% premium in interest payments - on top of the mortgage balance . <p> It gets worse . It takes more than 20 years to pay off- half of the debt . The other half is paid over the last 10 years . In fact , a 30-year term amortizes so slowly that after five years ( 60 payments ) , you still owe 92% of the original balance . When you consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , this further makes the case that a 30-year mortgage is too expensive . <h> The Advantages of a 15-Year Mortgage <p> Now think about a 15-year term . That $100,000 mortgage at 5% repaid over 15 years costs $790.80 per month , which is $253.97 more than the 30-year term . So , you have to be able to make that higher payment . For many , though , the comparison between house payments and rent makes this higher payment easier to bear . This is especially true when you also take into account the federal and state tax benefits of deducting interest . If your combined federal and state tax rates add up to 32% percent , for example , your after-tax cost for the 15-year mortgage is reduced to $538 . This is about the same as the 30-year payment and comparable to a $538 rental each month with no tax benefits . <p> Over 15 years , the total of your payments on a $100,000 mortgage comes out to $142,344 " or about $50,900 lower than the cost of a 30-year mortgage . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , you will have paid off about one-fourth of the debt , compared to only about 8% with the 30-year term . <p> Another advantage is that lenders often will offer a lower interest rate on the 15-year than on the 30-year contract . A one-quarter percent reduction is worth about $14 per month . Over 15 years , that equals $2,500 . However , the faster payoff has to be practical . If you can not afford the higher payments even after tax benefits , it will not make sense for you to agree to the shorter term . But as long as that is affordable , it makes sense and saves money . <p> If you can not afford to go as low as 15 years , you can enter a 30-year mortgage and add extra payments based on what you can afford . For example , adding $48 per month to the 30-year payment reduces your repayment term five years . It also saves about $18,000 in interest expense . If you increase the 30-year payment by $123 per month , you cut 10 years off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael C.

@@11805003 @405003/ <h> More stories from Joshua Ritchie @qwx171675 <h> India : The New Land of Opportunity ? <p> Few countries have improved their economic prospects so dramatically as India has in the last twenty years . Indeed , one would be hard-pressed to read a long-term forecast that did not view India as a large and growing force in the world economy . With a population of over 1 billion ( as of 2008 ) , it might seem like it could hardly be any other way . Nevertheless , the story was once very different in India . A Brookings Institution report on January 13 states that India was , " essentially insulated " from world markets as recently as 1990 . Not only did , " ups and downs in the world economy matter little " to India , but perhaps worse , " movements in the Indian economy were even less consequential for the world economy " , as the proportion of world trade and investment India personally accounted for was negligible at best . Difficult as it may be to believe today , foreign direct investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 2006-2007 , FDI had increased to $19 billion . Moreover , Business Standard reports that India boasted a 9% per annum growth rate between 2004-2009 . Despite being all but irrelevant to the world economy just two decades ago , India has clearly become a force to be reckoned with on the global stage . Continuing our series on growing economies , well look more closely at Indias economic landscape the opportunities , government incentives to producers , fastest-growing industries , and what the future holds . <h> The Opportunities <p> The phrase " economic opportunity " is frequently used in economic discussions , but within India , it has always had a somewhat nebulous meaning . For generations , the opportunities open to citizens were determined by a socially stratified " caste " system and ones place within it , which was itself determined by birth . A University of California at Santa Barbara essay referred to the 3,000 year old caste system as a , " pernicious practice that discriminates against nearly a fourth of the countrys billion-plus population . " Naturally , such a system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result , neither flourished until the caste system began to wither away . Fortunately , as the BBC reports , " today , caste barriers have largely broken down in the large cities . " The result has been nothing short of transformative from an economic standpoint . A USA Today article from 2004 interviews Sumant Anand , a native Indian returning home after a three year absence . When asked about his friends , Anand remarked , " they were all talking about opportunities in India rather than how to find jobs in the USA . " In a stunning turnaround from just ten or fifteen years earlier , Anand reports that , " if you talk to people my age , nobody wants to leave India . " <p> Largely thanks to market reforms and caste system erosion , India has begun transitioning from low-paid outsourcing fodder into a sophisticated service economy . The nations , " world-class software developers are moving into high-margin consulting " , striving ambitiously to , " take business from the likes of Accenture and IBM . " In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " filling orders for infomercial ab crunchers to handling financial analysis for Wall Street firms . " And Indias drug makers , previously held in contempt by the developed world for patent piracy , " are being wooed by the same global giants whose medicines they were copycatting . " In short , India has become a place where talented , intelligent and hard-working people can get ahead . <h> The Incentives and Top Performers <p> No small amount of Indias longtime economic struggles owed to the governments perennially " self-reliant " policies . As early as 1947 , when it became an independent country , India " set out to achieve what its leaders called swadeshi , or self-reliance " , according to USA Today . In practice , swadeshi amounted to , " walling out foreign investment and imports , and playing the role of obstructionist in global free-trade talks . " Unfortunately , in its quest to be self-reliant , India succeeded only in reducing itself to economic helplessness and virtual destitution . Liberalization occurred at an , " agonizingly slow pace " until 1991 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , India has taken great strides to promote entrepreneurship , trade , production and risk-taking throughout the economy . One major boost came in the form of lowered tariffs on imports , which were as high as 87%-113% as recently as the early 1990s . Today , import tariffs are generally lower than 20% . Another longtime obstacle to entrepreneurship were stifling foreign exchange controls , which limited when and how much profit foreign multinationals could take home from India . After being shunned by multinationals for decades , the foreign exchange controls were relaxed , and in 2007 the BBC reported that multinationals were " leading Indias IT revolution . " <p> Another incentive that has done much to spur business activity in India is the removal of arbitrary restrictions and barriers . In 1988 , for instance , the BBC explains that the Indian government did not make it easy for Texas Instruments to do business there . So involved with every minute detail was the government that , " the Indian Ministry of Communications refused to allow them to set up their own private satellite dish unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companys satellite data transmission centre at all times . " Fortunately , " within a decade , all such barriers were swept aside " , and the cost of data transmission subsequently , " plunged due to the creation of trans-oceanic fibre optical cable networks . " The 2009 Legatum Prosperity Index gives India favorable marks as well , observing the existence of , " only 11 formal business start up procedures . " USA Today notes , in agreement , " private business can now do virtually anything except operate a railroad , nuclear power plant or university . " As word of Indias new found permissiveness to entrepreneurs spread , multinationals began doing business there in unprecedented numbers . Today " more than 500 major international companies have IT operations in Bangalore alone . " <p> As mentioned , Indias $28 billion IT industry is an economic juggernaut and easily its most robust sector . Additionally , however , the country boasts the worlds fastest-growing telecom market , with some estimates clocking new subscriber signups at 1.6 million per month . NextBillion reported that 2008 was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users to make its network the second largest in the world after China , displacing the US . " ( NextBillion also explains how the telecom industry has benefited tremendously from the lower tariffs discussed earlier . ) India is also the global leader in business process outsourcing , exporting $25 billion worth of such services per year as of 2007 and expected to rise to $60 billion by 2010 , according to BBC . <h> What The Future Holds <p> While businesses like Hewlett-Packard , Dell , IBM , and Accenture coming in India is certainly encouraging , perhaps more encouraging than any isolated event is the overall , ongoing trend of liberalization in Indias economy . In 1991 , trade in goods and services as a proportion of Indias GDP stood at a meager 16% . By 2007 , that number had shot up to 49% , according to the Brookings Institution . The country also , " grew 13% per annum in real dollars during the four year period spanning 2003-04 to 2006-07 . " Brookings notes that , " if this rate is maintained and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will grow to " two fifths of the US economy in just two decades . " Nor , it should be noted , are US companies only making " token " investments in India . In 2007 , networking giant Cisco Systems " announced a $1.1 billion investment in Bangalore , creating 6,000 jobs " in one fell swoop . Chief Globalization Officer Wim Elfrink weighed in on the deal by declaring " we believe that India is the hub for the world where the ICT sector is concerned . " Taking the improvements and deregulation of the last twenty years into account , it seems that India is on the road to joining the worlds major economies in less time than anyone thought possible .

Its the coin most frequently seen laying on streets , sidewalks or parking lots . <p> While it might seem foolish to waste money ( however small an amount ) , the publics disregard for pennies is not as irrational as it sounds . In fact , it now costs more than one cent to produce a penny in the first place . <p> How did the penny came to cost more than its face value ? <h> Copper &amp; Zinc Price Increases <p> Pennies , as you may know , are made of 97.5% zinc and 2.5% copper .

In 2008 , it cost 1.26 cents to produce a single penny for circulation , compared with 1.67 cents the previous year . At the end of 2007 , the cost of making a nickel was nearly ten cents . <h> Historical Production Costs <p> The rising cost of penny production is not an extremely recent phenomenon . In fact , the last time a penny cost less than one cent to produce was in 2005 . A helpful chart from CoinUpdate.com displays rising costs in all but three years since 2001 .

And while gains from dimes and quarters have made up for these losses , the fact remains that total U.S. Mint gains would be substantially higher without absorbing ongoing , yearly losses from pennies . <p> The ever-rising cost of the penny has prompted some to ask the obvious question : why not stop making them ? It is the politically unpopular choice , to be sure . In 2008 , then Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson conceded that it made pragmatic sense but was politically unfeasible , and that he had no intentions of attempting it . U.S. Mint Director Edmund Moy also told Fox News- that " people still want pennies , which is why were still making them .

At a time when the U.S. is in the teeth of a recession , there are plenty of superior uses for $22 million than producing dead weight currency . Retailers , too , incur penny-related costs of their own . More than 10 years ago , in a 1999 article , Time Magazine estimated that Walgreens lost $1.3 million each year merely counting pennies . <p> Moreover , eliminating pennies would not create the economic chaos that many anticipate . A common worry , for instance , is that prices will rise if stores begin rounding to the nearest nickel .

He not only wanted to get back on track with his own spending , but also help steer other young people in the right direction . <p> And he grew up with a great finance teacher : his mom . <p> " I probably have a deeper appreciation for personal finance as I grew up fairly poor , but witnessed my mom turn our family 's finances around as a single mother , " he says . " This showed me that with the right mindset almost anyone can achieve financial success . " <p> We recently caught up with Jeremy who told us all about his blog and how it 's saved him from making big money blunders . Here he shares why living modestly has helped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Money ? When and why did you start your site ? <p> I officially launched Modest Money in January 2012 . Around that time I was just getting out of a long-term relationship . I decided that it was the perfect time to turn my life around and spend time improving myself . One specific area that I knew needed major improvement was my finances . It was clear that I needed to get saving more for retirement and stop blowing so much money . <p> So I decided that I would start a finance blog to help bring in some extra side income . As I had previous experience with running financial websites , I was well aware of how profitable the niche was . What I did n't know at the time was just how beneficial running a financial blog would be . Suddenly , I was immersed in an incredible community where I was learning so much about finance on a daily basis . Plus , I was getting to know so many great bloggers who were very supportive . <p> With Modest Money I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics . Although I started as the only writer , I envisioned a knowledgeable collaboration of writers working together to help educate people about finances . Since we generally do n't learn much about money management in school , I figured people could benefit from another source for this kind of information . <p> Who should be reading it ? <p> While I try to cover topics that appeal to all kinds of audiences , my main focus is people who are trying to improve their finances . This is mostly people who are in their 20s or 30s who have previously neglected their finances or might have even made mistakes with managing their money . I knew people like that could really benefit by reading about my own mistakes and successes . <p> How has blogging about finance helped you get a handle on your finances ? <p> Honestly it has helped me more than anything in my life . Early on I was reading dozens of personal finance blogs every single day . I was a sponge absorbing a massive amount of advice and lessons . All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relate to and was not dry reading straight out of a textbook . This advice was coming from people from people with varying backgrounds . <p> When I would cover topics on my own blog , I would often need to do some research to write a more informed post . Then readers and fellow bloggers would leave comments further expanding my knowledge on the subject . So not only was I educating myself , I also had countless teachers . <p> By writing about my finances on a personal level , I found a certain level of accountability too . If I wrote about mistakes , I was acknowledging those mistakes and ensuring a lesson was learned . If I wrote about things I needed to improve upon , I would be accountable to follow through for when I published related posts that mentioned my progress . <p> And the supportive blogging community has been awesome . Whenever I was unsure about something , bloggers and readers would help guide me in the right direction . They would support my decisions and cheer me on . When necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You said in starting the blog that you wanted to rediscover the joys of living modestly ; so what do you think are the upsides of modest living ? <p> Really there are all kinds of benefits to living modestly . When you stop relying on money to make you happy , you take away a lot of the stress associated with money and chasing material possessions . Once you adopt that mindset , you find that you start having extra money to put towards retirement , to spoil loved ones or to take the occasional vacation . In other words , your money can go to things that are more meaningful . <p> People who rely on money for happiness often do n't appreciate other things in life as much . They sometimes get so caught up chasing more money that they lose sight of what 's truly important . They say the best things in life are free , but the money obsessed manage to convince themselves that luxuries are even better . Things that cost less become noticeably inferior and less enjoyable . <p> Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less money wasted on lenders . Your overall financial picture becomes brighter when you live modestly . <p> Do you think there are downsides to modest living ? If so , what are they ? <p> Just like how people can get obsessed about accumulating more money , getting obsessed about spending less can also affect your happiness negatively . If you let it go too far , you end up getting stressed when things cost too much . You might start feeling too guilty to enjoy all the extra money that you 're saving . <p> The other potential downside that comes to mind is how this mindset will affect your social and family life . Becoming too strict with modesty could prevent you from spending as much time with friends and family . Unless they are taking up that lifestyle too , they will want to keep blowing money . That could include expensive activities that you might want to avoid . Extreme modesty could even affect your view of people who do n't live so modestly . Think of emotions like jealousy or bitterness and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The trick is to balance your financial modesty to the point where you can sometimes let loose without stressing out . Being too extreme in either direction can cause various problems . <p> What do you think are some misconceptions about living modestly and/or within your means ? <p> I guess the biggest misconception is that people living modestly are being too cheap to really enjoy life . While that sometimes is the case , the reality is that most of those people have just realized what priorities are really important . <p> An outsider might think that modesty means major sacrifices and a willingness to live a less satisfying life . That 's all a matter of perspective of what makes you happy though . <p> It does n't have to be a black and white life change . Simply finding ways to gradually integrate financial modesty into your life will help you with financial goals . <p> What financial mistake has taught you the biggest lesson ? <p> The mistake that stands out the most to me is buying a brand new car that was really way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about my side hustle , I thought I deserved to splurge . That purchase ended up handcuffing my finances for many years to come . Even now that the car is paid off , the higher insurance premiums are unnecessary . If I had instead bought a used car , it would 've been paid off much quicker and I would 've had more money in savings . <p> The mistake that is easier to overlook is how much I wasted on dining out and entertainment . I tell myself that I was paying for experiences , but really I do n't remember much about all those " experiences . " I was just dumping money down the drain every week . At the time I was just ignoring long-term finances and focusing on the present . <p> What are some of your favorite go-to methods for earning extra income ? <p> Well considering that I do website marketing for a career , I think you can probably guess . Since 2004 , I 've been running my own websites as a side hustle . Traditionally , I would rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 've since diversified with money from freelance marketing services , selling private advertising and brokering advertising for other blogs . In my case it really made sense to put to use my daytime job skills in my spare time . <p> When looking to earn side income you should focus on your strengths and interests . What works for others might not necessarily work as well for you . Spend some time researching what lines up with your skill set and you 're bound to find something you can try pursuing . <p> As mentioned above , dining out was previously a weak spot for me . That definitely is n't the case anymore . I 've managed to get in the habit of cooking the vast majority of meals at home , including cooking enough for lunch leftovers the next day . Combining that with smarter grocery shopping has drastically limited how much we spend on food . <p> Also my entertainment expenses have dropped a lot as I 've cut back on drinking and some other expensive activities . For a budget hobby we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hobby that only requires a decent pair of hiking books . <p> Another thing I make a point of doing is charging as much of my spending as possible to a cash-back credit card . Then I pay that card off in full each month . It might not be much savings on a $5 purchase , but added up throughout the year , it 's a decent savings with minimal effort . With a wedding and honeymoon coming up in the not too distant future , I will be switching over to an airline miles credit card instead . <p> Saving money usually is n't about cutting big chunks out of your budget . To make it sustainable long term , it 's much easier to find ways to get small savings in many different areas . If you limit yourself too much , it may be tough to keep up that discipline .

But in the long term , the benefits of a dental or vision plan may pay off . This is especially true if you are covering family members . <p> First of all , let 's get clear on what these plans cover : <h> Dental Plans <p> Dental plans can come in many forms : HMOs , PPOs , and indemnity plans . Dental HMOs work well for people who only need basic preventive care . They usually cover routine care 100% , but have big cost shares for more complex care . You are also required to stay within a network of dentists . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentist , but they will pay more when you see an in-network dentist .

Indemnity plans are ususally only offered through employer group plans are are not available for individuals to purchase . The average dental plan can range from $15 to $75 per month , depending on the type . <h> Vision Plans <p> Vision plans offered through employers are often just discountsnot true insurance . They are only designed to cover vision exams and glasses or contacts . For pretty much anything that is a real health issue ( such as cataracts , detached retinas , or injuries to the eye ) , you should turn to your medical insurance .

@@11805018 @405018/ @qwx171675 <h> Should You Consider Offshore Banking ? <p> For much of its history , offshore banking has been seen first and foremost as an avoidance maneuver . Countless action and mystery movies depict Swiss bank accounts as places for villains to hide ill-gotten fortunes . Indeed , one need not rely on movies for evidence of offshore banks housing shady activities . Offshore bank accounts have been used to hide the profits for everything from drug sales to arms dealing to bribes not to mention tax evasion schemes . But today , offshore banking is much more than a haven for underhanded financial shell games . Increasingly , legitimate businesses and individuals are finding it more advantageous than ever to utilize offshore banks for the privacy , flexibility and accessibility that they offer . With identity theft and bogus lawsuits as prevalent as ever , its plain to see why people take comfort in storing assets overseas especially in countries where banks pride themselves on being loyal to customers first , and governments second . Swiss banks , for instance , are famous for refusing to cooperate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such secrecy protects not just devious crooks , but innocent citizens with legitimate reasons to keep prying eyes out of their finances . <p> Today , well take a deeper look at offshore banking including its key advantages , what it offers to different types of people and several nations known for protecting the assets and identities of their foreign depositors . <h> Privacy <p> Arguably most compelling benefit of offshore banking is , and always has been , privacy . The advantages of bank account privacy to criminals are too obvious to require elaboration here . However , privacy also has its advantages to completely honest , fair-dealing people and businesses . For one thing , the United States is currently the most litigious society that has ever existed . Sixwise.com cites a study from the Economic Journal showing that , " Americans spend more on civil litigation than any other industrialized country . " The American Bar Association reported in 2006 that , " there are over 1 million lawyers in the United States " more per capita than any other country . Nor are all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixwise states that the number of civil suits filed increased by 12% from 1993-2002 alone . Frivolous lawsuits are a big part of the problem and , " are said to cost the United States $200 billion a year , according to Congressman Terry Everett . " Unlike in many European countries , the losers of American civil suits are not generally required to pay the winners legal fees . Within that kind of legal climate , simply possessing significant assets can be enough to make you the target of a lawsuit . Given such overwhelming incentives to sue , high net worth individuals often find it to their benefit to conceal some or all of their assets overseas . While it is relatively simple for lawyers to run asset checks on bank accounts residing in the United States , many offshore banks are far less transparent . <p> Despite a recent agreement to cooperate with US tax authorities , Swiss banks are still quite secretive . A recent BusinessWeek story reveals that while Swiss banks cooperate with investigations of tax fraud ( a criminal matter ) , they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for civil matters ( private lawsuits . ) Its tough to beat that kind of privacy when it comes to shielding assets from frivolous lawyers and lawsuits . Such people will not even know that you have an account , much less whether or how much money is inside . <h> Flexibility <p> Another attractive benefit of offshore banking is the flexibility that it can offer . This is particularly true for traveling or international businesspeople , many of whom come to find it difficult or costly to run an international operation from a domestic , neighborhood bank account . Accepting payments in foreign currencies , for instance , often triggers hefty fees when those payments are received into American bank accounts . If you or your business regularly transacts in one or a handful of foreign countries , it quickly makes sense to simply set up accounts in those countries , rather than incurring fees by redundantly shuttling money overseas and back again . Best of all , it is usually not even necessary to visit the country in which you wish to set up the account . Belize.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offshore banks , states that , " you can simply bank from wherever in the world you live , via a secure Internet connection , secure e-mail , post or telephone . " Many offshore banks in Belize even provide ATM cards that can be used in your home country . To its credit , Belize also promises , " near hermetic confidentiality " to its offshore banking clients . Additionally , many offshore banks provide 24 hour call centers whose operatives speak your native language and are available to you regardless of time zone differences . Clearly , flexibility is a compelling reason to bank offshore . <h> Hedging Against Political Risk <p> A somewhat overlooked advantage to offshore banking is the partial hedge it provides against political risk . As Offshore-Fox.com wisely points out , " assets held domestically are subject to political and social risks that you can not control . " These risks are broad and innumerable in possibilities , including the risk that your government , " may suddenly raise taxes to fund a failing economic experiment . " Recently , the federal government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector than at any time in US history . While it is n't certain that their actions will adversely affect your domestic bank holdings , the risk is unquestionably there . Inflation is another looming danger with the potential to eat away at domestically held bank assets . In his article on inflation , John T. Reed recalls that , " President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 6102 that required all Americans to turn in gold to the Federal Reserve bank for $20.67 per ounce " a below-market price " by 5/31/33 . " Failure to comply with Roosevelts order resulted in , " a fine of $164,000 in today 's dollars and/or a prison sentence . " <p> There have also been laws such as Regulation Q , which was instituted in 1933 to limit the interest rates that US banks could pay their depositors . The current financial crisis , again , has triggered massive new interventions into private finance whose implications ( good or bad ) for domestic depositors are not yet clear . It is easy to shrug off such risks as remote possibilities that seem unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even millions ) of dollars are at stake , high net worth individuals often prefer to hedge against political risk when doing so is cost-effective . Offshore banking is one of several ways to do that with respect to their assets . Indeed , QWealthReport.coms article on myths about offshore banking reports that , " most people who bank offshore these days are not evading taxes " as is commonly assumed but are instead seeking , " protection against political risk factors " , among other things . <h> Recap <p> Essentially , the most compelling advantages of offshore banking are privacy , flexibility , and protection from political risk . Conservative or high net worth individuals can often keep assets under the radar of frivolous lawyers by storing them in offshore accounts . Businesspeople with nothing whatsoever to hide can nonetheless benefit from the tremendous flexibility and cost savings ( in eliminated fees ) that banking overseas can offer . Finally , citizens from all walks of life can utilize offshore banking as a partial hedge against political and social uncertainty by ensuring that at least the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or regulations .

Most of us like to think that were the best drivers to ever hit the road , but weve all felt the pain of being 18 years old and having to pay considerably more for the same vehicle than the crazy guy who lives down the street . The injustice ! <p> The good news is that there are a number of factors that you have considerable control over when it comes to your auto insurance premium . In the first of a two part series , well cover the 10 prime factors that you have control over that most auto insurance companies consider in the formulas used to determine how much to charge you . <h> 1 . Switch Vehicles <p> Each vehicle is assessed a different risk variable depending on a number of factors , including category classification , crash test rating , price , cost of replacement parts , and even horsepower-to-weight ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a lower premium you should avoid sports cars , expensive vehicles , newer vehicles , and those that are not considered to be top of class in safety ( smaller vehicles ) . Each year , the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) reports an insurance make and model comparison .

Pay Up Front <p> Some insurers offer a discount if you pay for the year ahead up front all at once versus a monthly payment plan . If you have the cash on hand to pay up-front , do n't  worry about losing it if you switch insurers . Your insurance company is required to pro-rate your total bill and refund you for the days that you wont be covered under them . <h> 3 . Drive Like an Angel <p> Believe it or not , your driving record is still considered to be one of the top factors that insurance companies look at . Whether you 've been in an accident or received a major traffic violation within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium . Some auto insurance companies look back three years , while others look back 5 or more . <h> 4 . Cut your Miles <p> A number of auto insurance companies will offer you a lower premium if you drive less miles . Makes sense for them and for you , right ? Moving closer to work might not only save you on fuel and commute time , but it may also decrease your auto insurance premium as well . If you make a move closer to work or end up drastically cutting your mileage driven , call your insurance company to see if it can earn you a discount . A number of insurance companies are offering pay-by-the-mile programs , which may end up costing you less than traditional plans if you rarely drive at all . <h> 5 . Improve Your Credit Score <p> Credit history is becoming a much more highly valued variable that is being looked at by insurance companies ( however , this is not allowed in the State of California ) . We 'd recommend that you move to California if your credit history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than cannibalize any savings in auto insurance . <h> 6 . Reduce your Insurance Levels <p> Whether or not you have collision and comprehensive coverage certainly dictates how much your premium will be , but your decision to carry it really should come down to how much your vehicle is presently worth . Each state has a liability coverage minimum that you should be aware of when determining how much you want to carry . We do not suggest lowering your coverage to the minimum to save money , as that may end up being a big mistake should you get into an accident . However , it might be to your benefit to keep an eye on your liability coverage if it is high and you are in need of cutting your premium . <h> 7 . Buy a Vehicle with a Theft Device or have one Installed <p> Purchasing a vehicle with a theft deterrent system or having one installed will most often get you a discount . <h> 8 .

You may find that even though one car insurance company would charge you more than another , your total insurance cost to go with them is less . <h> 9 . Be a Loyal Customer <p> Loyalty can be rewarded when it comes to sticking with your auto insurance company . As witnessed by the massive amounts of advertising insurance companies partake in , the cost and value to acquiring a new customer is very high . That 's why a good number of insurance companies will give you a percentage off on your total premium each year just for sticking around . Its also for this reason , especially if you 've been a cheap customer for them in the past , that they may be a little more willing to work with you in lowering your cost than a Comcast might be . Stick around long enough , and it may be difficult to find a cheaper policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high of a deductible you set has a significant impact on your premiums . For example , increasing my deductible from $250 to $500 reduced my overall premium by 25% . If you have an older vehicle with a relatively low value it makes a lot of sense to have a high deductible . It makes even more sense if you do n't  have collision or comprehensive coverage to begin with because there is not much else that would make the cost/benefit of having a low premium worth it . <h> What About All the Factors You Ca n't Control ? <p> Well discuss those and what to do about them in the second part of our series on how to lower your auto insurance premiums .

When you factor in market value in the Edmunds example , the new cars value after five years was $7,000 , while the used cars value was just $2,000 . That would bring your total monetary committment , if you were able to sell both vehicles , down to $25,388 for the new car and $16,390 for the used . Still a big difference , though : $8,998 in favor of the used car . <p> The Life-of-Vehicle Argument : Where Conventional Car Buying Advice Takes a TurnHeres where the Edmunds example leaves you hanging a bit . If you had bought a used car at nearly half the price of the new , drove it five years , and it is now worth just $2,000 , the odds are good that it probably does n't  have much life left in it . It would have been roughly 5 years old based on a 50% resale value ( and dealer/seller markup ) when you purchased it . On the flip side , the new car might give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years , particularly if you are a conservative driver who follows all of the proper maintenance suggestions . Suddenly , the picture is not so clear . <p> In the first five years of ownership , a used car cost $1,799 less to own than a new one . But here 's where it gets interesting . Let 's assume you get- five- more years out of the vehicle that you purchased new . If you had bought used and went out and purchased another $10,000 vehicle , you 'd be paying $285/mo. for the second used vehicle . Meanwhile , your monthly payments for the new vehicle would be $0 . Suddenly , you 're saving $3,420/year with the new car purchase vs. the additional used-car purchase in the second five years . <p> And Let 's Not ForgetSome people think of their cars as much more than- four- wheels that get them from point A to point B. There is an emotional connection and joy factor that is hard to put a price tag on . Some also like the peace of mind of knowing exactly what their car has been through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Bottom LineUnless you are in a very short-term , high-need situation that turns the numbers in your favor , leasing rarely makes financial sense . ( Though if you 're truly the type of person who likes to show off with a shiny new car every two or three years , then leasing might be your best bet . After all , if you try to sell a new or used car just two or three years into a longer-term auto loan , chances are you will be " upside down , " or owe more than the car is worth . ) <p> Choosing between buying new or used is much more complicated . If you plan on driving the car into the ground ( that is , keeping it for 10 years or so ) , it might make a lot of sense to buy new versus used . If you want to swap vehicles more frequently , buying used makes more financial sense . The qualitative and emotional aspects of vehicle ownership may yield a different outcome altogether . 
@@11805029 @405029/ <h> More stories from Kevin Duffey @qwx171675 <h> Learning to Achieve a Higher Rate of Return <p> Anybody with common sense understands that saving money is important . Whether were talking about financing your future or investing capital for a higher return , youd need the money to do it . The start of it all is savings . <p> With long-term financial goals , such as planning for retirement , there are two main factors to your success : your savings rate and your rate of return . If you have a short term goal , your savings rate is the most important factor ; however , as you start moving towards a longer term perspective , the rate of return becomes increasingly important . <p> Let 's look at a basic example . Say you want to purchase a home in- five years , and you estimate that you will need $50,000 for a down payment . Between now and- five years from now , the amount of money you save is much more important than the return on that money . This is mainly because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . <p> Now consider another example : say that you will need $2 million for retirement 30 years from now . While saving and contributing money towards retirement is important , especially in the beginning , the rate of return has a much bigger impact on your success . <p> The following chart demonstrates the power of your rate of return over a time span of 30 years . As you can see , even if you save less each month , after 30 years you will still have saved more , thanks to a higher rate of return : <h> Increasing Your Return <p> Now that we 've demonstrated what a difference the rate of return can make down the road , let 's talk about increasing it . <p> Someone who gets paid to provide financial advice may like you to believe that you 're not smart enough to invest successfully on your own . Buying into this idea is exactly what keeps these folks in business . <p> And its important to understand that I 'm not recommending that you try to time the market , engage in day trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements of obscure companies . <p> I am , however , suggesting that if were cautious and diligent , we can begin to learn sound investment strategies and , over time , work towards an incrementally higher rate of return than you could ever get through , say , simply keeping your savin gs in the bank . As we 've already shown , even an increase in a single percentage point of return can make you much wealthier over time . <p> Becoming an active investor is intimidating for many people since most of our experience with the stock market is through a passive investment vehicle like a 401(k) plan . There are ways , however , that we can move towards becoming more active in the stock market with caution . <h> How To Ease Into Active Investing <p> With the rise of Exchange Traded Funds ( ETFs ) , we can buy or sell investments representing a broader share of the global economy as opposed to a single companys stock . <p> ETFs can be a less intimidating way for new investors to get active in the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a group of large energy companies . Or , you can buy an ETF that represents the Chinese stock market . Or maybe you just want to buy an Index ETF that represents the S&amp;P 500 . <p> ETFs are bought and sold just like stocks , so you will still get the valuable experience of buying and selling positions without exposure to the risk of a single company imploding . <p> Secondly , I would strongly encourage new investors to move in and out of positions in chunks . To do this , first determine the total amount of money you wish to allocate towards a specific ETF or stock . Instead of allocating the total amount into the position at one time , split the amount into halves or thirds . Move the chunks of money into the position over time in multiple transactions . By doing this , you will be at less risk of buying ( or selling ) at an improper time . It is a more cautious , conservative approach also known as dollar cost averaging and one that is wise for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known companies ( or , in this case , ETFs that track them ) . Take a look at the companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average list . Do n't  attempt to trade smaller companies and avoid from penny stocks . <p> I encourage you to stick to liquid stocks for well known , well established businesses . I would also recommend companies with a high dividend yield as the dividend income can help offset any potential losses you might incur with share price depreciation . <h> Conclusion <p> How much you save or your savings rate is important when you 're looking at a short-term goal . But with long-term investing goals such as retirement , your rate of return has a much bigger impact . The good news is that , if you have decades of investing ahead of you , you can afford to be patient with learning how to invest ( as long as you keep those retirement-fund contributions coming , of course ) . Ultimately , - a few years of slow learning may have an enormously positive- impact on the size of your portfolio . 
@@11805031 @405031/ @qwx171675 <h> Tricks of Financial Reporting : Manipulating Earnings <p> Most people judge companies as potential investments based on a few important criteria . Among these , revenue and net earnings are extremely important . However , how do you know a company 's reported income is accurate ? <p> One troubling form of falsifying the income statement is inflating current revenue and earnings , a practice that has been given the decent-sounding name earnings management . Under the accounting rules , companies have discretion to make decisions that may increase net profits ; this does not mean it is always accurate to use gimmicks that make performance look better than it is . By accruing revenues this year as an aggressive move , rather than spreading them over future years as a more conservative move , the current results are inflated but future years ' income is going to be lower because this aggressive accounting decision has to be absorbed . <h> Many ways to tinker with the numbers <p> The flexibility in the accounting rules is a big part of the problem .

Given the range of allowed judgments , plus the possibility of outright misleading entries , there clearly is no one version of a company 's net income .

And you 're betting it will carry you thousands of miles , with all of its parts whirring along on four wheels . Its quite a lot to ask , and if you 're not careful , you could end up spending a hefty bit of your paycheck on a rolling lemon .

And for the next three years , it depreciates at least 15 to 20% more each year . Still looking forward to that new-car smell ? <p> here 's an example of new car depreciation : If you spent $20,000 on a new car , in three years having depreciated at a rate of 15% , that no-longer-new car will only be worth $11,000 a $9,000 loss ! <p> Leasing a car , on the other hand , roughly translates to renting it for a specific period of time until you trade it in or opt to buy it .

Leasing is probably better for middle to upper level professionals with a more disposable income and a penchant for the latest and greatest .

Financial tracking software can help you with the last part . Let 's walk through a few of these pointers so there are n't  any surprises once you sign on the dotted line . <h> Down Payments <p> Some say that you should put as much down on your car as possible . Putting 20% down means that your loan will be smaller , your interest rates will be lower , and your grand total will be small enough so you can actually afford todays gas prices .

By the time you pay off your loan , you 're looking at a difference of $656 . <p> However , if you were to take that $4,000 down payment and invest it in a high-interest savings account or CD with a return of , say , 4.75% , you 'll earn $760 by the time it would take you to pay off the 48-month loan . You 'll come out $104 richer than if you put $4,000 down . <p> So if you 're wondering whether or not to put a down payment on the car purchase , just think of it this way : if you do n't  think you 'll be able to set aside $4,000 in a savings account and not touch it for four years , then use it as a down payment .

Do n't  be fooled : your APR should only be affected by your credit worthiness . <p> After adding fees and sales tax , add to your total the upfront costs to the true cost of the car to see how much it will initially cost you .

You 'll only end up with worse credit if you fall behind on payments . <p> Knowing your credit score also has another big advantage : getting the leg up on shifty salespeople . When a dealer offers you financing and its clear you have n't checked your score , they might mislead you about the state of your score so they can sneak in higher interest rates . Do n't  let them walk over you ; they do n't  need their commission check as much as you need a straight deal . <p> Mints bottom line : If you have poor credit , you might want to wait a bit before you buy a car , at least until you clear up some of your record blemishes .

Car loans are n't  always simple : you 'll want to know if you 're eligible for that loan , and how much you 're allowed to borrow in the first place . As a whole , the Internet is a good place to start researching loan rates at banks and credit unions . <p> The Mint lesson here is : Get pre-approved for your loan before you stroll into the dealership . Right off the bat , you 'll have an ace up your sleeve : you 'll know what the current interest rates are , and you can compare them to the dealers offers .

These pre-approved loan checks are usually good for 45 days , allowing you plenty of time to scout out your new Ferrari or Honda , as the case may be . <p> Mints Note : Car dealers try to claim car loan shopping can hurt your credit score . They say each time a financial institution makes an inquiry into your score , your score drops . The truth is that they tell you this so you 'll go with their financing department .

As a rule of thumb , most should avoid these types of loans unless you have good credit and know a lot about how these RISC " loans " work . <p> Typically financial lending sites will also have auto loan re-payment calculators . Some allow you to put in how much you 'll owe and the length of the loan . Theyll even tell you what percent of your income you can afford to pay . <p> Auto loans usually range from three years ( 36 months ) to five years ( 60 months ) .

Its also a good way to verify their asking price . <p> Know the Quality of the Brand <p> Some car models have fewer problems than others . For example , older Pontiac Grand Ams tend to have major coolant and head gasket issues , whereas the worst complaint on older Dodge Neons was the engine light coming on due to carbon buildup . You can expect that the repairs on that Grand Am are going to cost a whole lot more . <p> Use reputable site like consumerreports.com to investigate common problems of the car you are interested in . Google the year , make and model of your car with phrases like " common complaints " or " problems " to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cars History <p> Youve seen the commercial for carfax.com where a seller boasts about " new upholstery " in their car that had suffered flood damage .

You do n't  know what that car has been through because you werent there . <p> You can check the cars accident , damage and claims history by using its VIN number at carfax.com . As a secondary precaution , if the owner regularly services their car at a single location , you can ask that location for the cars repair history and ask if its had any problems . As a final step , ask friends with the same car how theirs performs and if they have had any major issues . <p> Do n't  Get Scammed <p> Not all car dealers are scammers , but a few are and you should know what to look for to tell the good guys from the bad .

Although you 'll still find scam artists , often people are simply selling because they 're shopping for a new car , moving , or just need the cash .

Youre charged with asking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough test drive before you agree to purchase anything . Take it to your mechanic so he or she can do a quick inspection , and do n't  be afraid to negotiate . <p> You 'll need to ask the owner the right questions to find out anything he or she forgot to mention in the advertisement . Your questions should include : <p> Are they the first owner ? If not , how many previous owners does it have ? <p> Why are they selling the car ? <p> Have there been any major repairs or major parts replaced ? <p> Has it ever been into an accident ? <p> Is it currently in need of repairs ? <p> How old are the tires ? <p> When was the last oil change ? <p> When did they last change the brake pads/ rotors ? <p> Did it pass inspection this year ? <p> Has it ever failed inspection ? <p> Do they have the title in their possession ? Is it in their name ? <p> When you test-drive the car , put it through a well thought-out driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like highways and steep curves . Keep in mind what the cars main route will be . If you will be driving up hill to get to work every day , follow a similar route . Test how well it accelerates under pressure , and see if it stops on a dime . <p> Change lanes , keeping an eye out for unusual blind spots . Listen to the engine at different speeds and make sure you do n't  hear any strange rattling . Open up the hood and check to see if any parts look like they are new theyll be cleaner than the other parts surrounding it . Check the color of the fluids . Transmission fluid should be red to pink . Coolant should be light green with no more than half water in the mix . <h> Do n't  be Afraid to Negotiate <p> Car dealers expect to negotiate . They purposely ask for a higher price , knowing that if you think talk them down a bit , you 'll feel like you 're getting a deal and you 'll be more likely to buy . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lower asking price unless they have expressed their wishes for no negotiations . <p> Use the cars estimated market value , and what you 've found on consumer report websites , as negotiation tools . Start with a low offer , but keep it in the ballpark so they come back with another . Know the limits of what you can afford and do n't  get distracted by the cars extra features . Be patient it may take hours or days for negotiations . And remember , the sellers best negotiating technique is the ability to walk away , but this technique can work for you too .

How many of those people , though , set savings goals and track their progress against those goals ? I 'd wager not that manysetting goals and then keeping after them is hard work , and its not something that 's easily done in many financial tracking programs . <p> Mint.coms new Goals feature seeks to take the difficulty out of both setting goals and regularly tracking your progress towards those goals . With a few clicks of the mouse , you can set up a savings goal , and then use Mint.com to help you achieve that goal . <h> How to create a goal <p> Creating a goal on Mint.com is quite simple : just- click the Goals tab at the top of the screen , and you 'll see the Goals overview page , as seen in the image above . <p> Mint provides a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your credit card debt or auto loan , saving for an emergency , buying a car , and taking a trip . You can also create a custom goal to cover whatever specific objective you have in mind . <p> Click on the goal type you 'd like to create and a step-by-step guide will appear , asking you questions relevant to the selected goal . Choose a home improvement project , for instance , and you 'll be asked its projected cost , type of project , and whether you 'll fund the project from one or many sources . Each goal asks a differing series of initial questions , but they 're very simple to answerjust fill in the requested fields , and click Next , as seen below : <p> Next , the guide let 's you name your goal , set a target date for reaching that goal , specify your desired monthly savings amount towards the goal , and even upload a customized photo of your goalso you can look at that Ferrari ( or Jetta ) onscreen as you save towards its purchase . <p> Finally , the guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goal to an account , open a new account to use for that goal , or leave the goal unassigned ( though unassigned goals ca n't be tracked ) . <p> The tough part about setting financial goals ( other than tracking your progress and achieving them , of course ) is knowing how much you need to achieve that goal . Mints Goals feature actually does that math for you . If your goal is to get out of debt , for example , the Goals feature will pull all of your credit card debt and auto loans from Mint , so you can create a pay-down plan . Likewise , if your goal is to save for an emergency , Goals will estimate your monthly expenses based on your spending activity in Mint . If you want to buy a car , Goals will estimate the price based on the Kelley Blue Book value of your desired make , model , year and trim . <p> Goals does have one restriction : an account can only have one goal assigned at a time . Once the goal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another goal . <p> As an example , if you create a goal to save for college and assign it to your savings account , you cant create another goal to buy a car and also assign it to your savings account . You can , however , assign a goal to multiple accounts , so that saving for retirement can involve both your IRA and 401(k) account . <p> You can create a goal without linking it to an account , but you wo n't then be able to track your progress towards that goal , as seen below : <p> To get the most out of Mints Goals feature , its best to link a goal to an accountafter all , what gets measured gets done . <h> How Mint helps you achieve your goals <p> Mints Goals not only helps you set up goals and track their progress the feature is designed to help you achieve them .

The reality for most of us is that any goal we set is going to require a spending reduction in another categoryless eating out , fewer new clothing purchases , etc . As such , its probably unrealistic to think you can go from saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created a goal that said you were going to save $1,500 a month . <p> Similarly , saving takes time , and setting a realistic date for achieving your goal will help you create an achievable monthly savings target . For instance , paying off $8,000 worth of credit card debt at 16% interest in one year will require paying back $726 per month . Spread that over three years , and the monthly amount drops to $281 . Yes , you 'll pay more interest , but a three-year payback target is probably more realistic than a one-year target . <p> * Create a separate account : If you try to save for an objective using your normal checking or savings account , you may find that your planned savings simply get used up on other unplanned purchases . A much better way to achieve a savings goal is to set up a new accountMint.com includes two new account options when creating a goaland then deposit your monthly contributions into that account . The harder this account is to get at ( no checks , no ATM cards , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . <p> * Use automatic deposits through your employer : Instead of having to remember to manually transfer funds to your new goal-related account , use your employers automatic deposit capabilities to do it automatically . Most payroll services will let you deposit your paycheck into more than one accountI once had mine set up to go to six different accounts . By making deposits automatically , you 're much more likely to achieve your goal , as those funds wont be available for spending before you get a chance to make the deposit yourself . <h> What 's to come <p> In the future , you will be able to see an annual view of long-term goals , such as retirement or college savings , which can help turn huge long-term goals into achievable ( annual ) short term goals .

There are alternatives to making it work , even while both parents are still working .

Using an intuitive entry-form , you can now record cash you 've spent or received , checks you 've written , and other transactions that havent cleared your bank yet .

Instead of forcing your waiter or waitress to run six credit card tabs , you decide to split the bill and pay with cash . With earlier versions of Mint , this cash wouldve gotten lost . Sure , you could always work-around this by splitting your ATM transactions but that took additional work on your part . <p> With Mint.coms new Cash Transactions , you can enter your share of that group luncheon . <p> To create the transaction , click the " Add a Transaction " button . When the dialog appears , fill in the date ( you can type any date you like ; you do n't  have to use the wheel ) , a description of the event , select a category , and enter the amount of the transaction . <p> Because this is a cash transaction , set the Type to Cash , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio button .

When entering pending credit card transactions , try to be accurate with both the date and the amount .

Given this stereotype , its tough to imagine people like Warren Buffett ever working " regular jobs " like the rest of us . However , you may be surprised to learn that many titans of industry got their start in very pedestrian positions that you would n't suspect . Today , we look back on the first jobs of 10 wealthy CEOs and entrepreneurs . <h> Ross Perot <p> Respected worldwide as one of the most effective business leaders of the 20th century , Ross Perot got his working start earlier than anyone on this list . As CNN tells it , Perots father was " a cotton broker and a part time horse trader who put his young son to work at the age of six breaking horses for a dollar or two apiece . " ( The elder Perot also notes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls he took . ) " Once he was older , Perot enlisted in the US Navy in 1949 and helped to establish its honor system , and by 1953 , he was president of his battalion .

Reportedly , Huizenga also took a truck driving position at 17 to help his mother with household bills following her traumatic divorce from his father . Huizenga later enlisted in the Army reserve in 1959 . By 1960 , Huizenga was already buying his own truck and recruiting clients for the fledgling waste management company that would build most of his $300+ million net worth . <h> Warren Buffett <p> Investing mogul Warren Buffetts first job reads like something out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewd and old-fashioned-style investment decisions , the Nebraska native earned his first " working capital " as a newspaper delivery boy .

According Forbes , Trump accompanied his father to job sites and collected empty cans and bottles with his brother for the redemption value . It did n't  add up to much ( Trump recalls it equaling a " below-average allowance " ) but it no doubt taught him the value of a dollar . Humorously , Trump also notes that he later accompanied dad on rent collection jobs to scoop up bottles and cans that way , but quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the possibility of being shot " . <h> Sam Walton <p> If ever an entrepreneur rose up from humble beginnings , it was Sam Walton .

Among these were milking the family cows , bottling the milk and hand-delivering it to paying customers . Later , Walton would take to his bike to complete a daily paper delivery route . He also sold magazine subscriptions on the side , perhaps building some early sales skills that proved crucial later on . Upon graduating high school , Walton was voted " most versatile boy " in his class . Walton continued working odd jobs early in college , including " waiting tables in exchange for meals " , according to Wikipedia . <h> Jim Clark <p> Netscape founder and maverick entrepreneur Jim Clark was anything but a " silver-spoon " case .

Once in college Dell wasted little time starting his first business ( PCs Limited ) in a single room of a 27 story residence hall . Before long the young company showed enough promise to inspire Dell to drop out at 19 , taking a loan from his grandmother and re-naming the business to Dell Computer . <h> Ray Kroc <p> Ray Krocs first job epitomizes humble beginnings .

On January 11 , 2010 , Chile became the first South American country to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development . OCEDs press release cites Chiles " nearly two decades of democratic reform and sound economic policies " as justification for its historic membership . To put it in perspective , Chile is only the seventh country to be admitted to OCED in the last thirty years . It was the culmination of a years-long effort by Chile to demonstrate to the world that it was serious about becoming fairer and more transparent . Since talks between OCED and Chile began in May 2007 , Chile has aggressively enacted , " new laws to end the banking secrecy that provides a shield for possible tax evasion " , while simultaneously allowing prosecutors to investigate and punish companies suspected of bribing foreign officials ( a notorious problem in Chile . ) Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% annual growth for the last twenty years , and its , " groundbreaking pension reforms in the early 1980s have served as a model for many other countries .

No longer do Chilean government ministers sit on Codelcos board or interfere with its day to day affairs . Consumer protection and competition laws , likewise , " have been strengthened . " Furthermore , the BBC reports that poverty in Chile has dropped faster than any other nation in the region 39% of the population twenty years ago to just 14% today . In terms of per-capita income , Chileans enjoy one of the highest standards of living in Latin America . Clearly , Chile has taken the next step in forging an economic identity for itself . <p> Today , well continue in our series on growing economies by analyzing Chiles economic landscape " the opportunities , government incentives to producers , fastest-growing industries , and what the future holds . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OCED , the BBC confirms that roughly half of Chiles revenues come from the sale of copper . In fact , Chile alone is responsible for producing one-third of all the copper in the world . So long as China and India continue buying copper to under gird their own expansions , Chile will continue to prosper from specializing in copper production . However , relying so heavily on the sales of a single commodity is dangerous to the economic vitality of a growing country . Fortunately , several other Chilean industries are reporting growth in recent years . At the forefront of these has been tourism . MicroPress.com reported on January 28th the signing of a new law designed to , " change the face of Chile 's tourist industry by setting standards for operators and guides . " Recognizing tourism as , " one of the biggest growth industries " , Chilean Economy Minister Hugo Lavados promised that , " the new law will make 2010 an important year for tourism in Chile . " In 2009 , Chiles tourism industry " generated nearly 10 billion USD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200,000 people . " ReportLinker.com adds that " Chile is , along with Mexico , the country with the best tourism outlook for this year , according to the Association of Asian Pacific Travel ( PATA ) . " Following the passage of the new law , Chilean tour operators will be classified and certified by the government as offering safe services to their customers . <p> Chile has also emerged as a major supplier of fruit to the world market . ChinaDaily.com reported in 2009 that Chilean fruit exports to China , " grew by 68 percent in 2008 compared with 2007 , to US$96 million . " Grapes comprised 46% of these exports , while apples accounted for 21% , cherries for 20% and plums for 10% , according to Chilean Agriculture Minister Marigen Hornkohl . While it has historically been difficult for Chile to enter the Asian markets , " due to cultural differences and geographical distance " , a Free Trade Agreement signed in 2005 has , " significantly promoted bilateral commercial exchanges " between the two countries ever since . Hornkohl adds that Chile has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to ensure that its fruit exports arrive in good , edible condition . Blueberry production , specifically , is a major growth center in Chile .

ReportLinker.com states that Chiles business environment , " is the most accommodating in the region , and the government continues to place attracting foreign investment high on its priority list . " The Legatum Prosperity Index reveals that barriers to entry ( that is , the number of procedures necessary to start a new business ) are " near the global average with nine formal procedures in place .

Entrepreneurs are required to submit a business plan , but the range of acceptable businesses is wide , spanning medical or biotech products , " green " and " cleantech " products and even , " online gaming or social network software . " Essentially , anyone who convinces the Chilean government that their venture is somehow technology-driven can qualify . Upon qualification , the government , " will give you 60% of your due diligence costs , or up to $30,000 " to visit and explore the country . Should you decide to re-locate there , another $30,000 will be provided to you for start-up costs . In fact , if a business is willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the government will pay for 5 years of rent ( up to $1 million ) or split the costs if you want to locate elsewhere . " Beyond that , $25,000 will be provided for training local employees . Furthermore , if your business decides it needs to import talent from other nations , all you need to do is demonstrate the creation of " a legitimate tech job and they 'll give you a visa , no questions asked . " Such immigration flexibility is unheard of in most developed countries , including the United States . <p> These and other producer incentives are discussed at length on InvestChile , a website established by the Chilean government for prospective entrepreneurs . <h> The Future <p> Chiles economic future has brightened considerably merely by being admitted to OCED . From now on , Chile will have a seat at the table when free trade agreements and other economic covenants between major economies are up for discussion . The countrys economic fundamentals also appear strong . ReportLinker expects , " real GDP growth to average a solid 3.4% beyond 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon . Unemployment stands at a modest ( given the recession ) 9% , while inflation has held steady at 4% . Additionally , Chile remains and is becoming an even more attractive foreign direct investment choice . Perhaps most encouraging , however , is Vivek Wadhwas characterization of Chile as , " a thriving democracy with one of the most open economies in South America " and his promise that , " if I was starting a new tech company and did n't need to be in any particular area , I 'd start it in Chile in a heartbeat . " Thirty years ago , nothing close to that could be truthfully said of Chile . Today , majority opinion mirrors Mr. Wadhwas and the numbers are proving it .

Even more frequently , we hear complaints about unexpected credit-card fees piling up on top of snowballing credit-card balances , even as the industry now operates under new , consumer-friendlier rules thanks to the CARD Act of 2009 . <p> On June 15 , the Federal Reesrve tweaked those rules yet again , capping late fees at $25 in most situations , banning inactivity fees- and requiring issuers to reassess all rate increases made after January 1 , 2009 . <p> Such changes affect millions of consumers . There were over 575 million cards in circulation by the end of 2009 , according to the Nilson Report , and according to a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston survey , the average cardholder has 3.5 different cards . The total revolving debt in America ( of which 98% is credit card debt ) stands at $852.6 billion as of March 2010 . <p> Yet , consumer credit was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980s , credit cards were considered something of a luxury . They were not easy to get , and thus relatively few Americans had them . Below , well discuss the rise of consumer credit and where we are today . <h> The Early Days of Credit <p> Consumer credit has been available since the 1920s , when gas stations and general stores extended informal credit to their trusted , regular customers . Back then , people were able to borrow through so-called " charge cards . " Transactions involved only the merchant and its customers , without any intermediaries . By 1938 , merchants began accepting each others charge cards . Bank-issued credit cards first surfaced in 1946 , when John Biggins of Brooklyns Flatbush National Bank invented the " Charge-It " program . Via this program , merchants could deposit their sales slips with the bank , which then billed customers on behalf of the merchants . <p> According to Time Magazine , though , it was not until the 1950s that credit cards as we know them today began to thrive . The first real credit card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , issued in 1950 , was made of cardboard and limited to use at 27 participating restaurants in New York City . The concept quickly caught on due to the convenience and novelty of paying with an exclusive card , and by 1952 , roughly 20,000 Americans were Diners Club cardholders . <p> American Express made the leap from travelers checks to credit cards in 1958 , and Bank of America entered the fray soon after by mailing 60,000 BankAmericards to California residents . They were initially promoted among traveling salesmen ( a fixture of that time ) for easy transactions on the road . <h> Growing Popularity <p> Credit cards became more widespread in the 1970s and 1980s . Once companies like Visa and MasterCard rose to prominence , outside service providers stepped in to streamline transactions . With the aid of these providers , both Visa and MasterCard became vastly more efficient . Standardized rules and procedures were developed for handling bank paperwork , reducing fraud and identifying card misuse . In turn , it became cheaper for banks to issue Visa and MasterCard products to their customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With processing streamlined and costs contained , the credit industry was poised for a major expansion . Bank of Americas initial mass-mailing set the tone for what would become a trend in the credit card business , and heavy promotion continued to consumers believed to be low credit default risks . <p> The growth in credit card popularity during the 70s and 80s pales in comparison to todays situation . It was not until 1987 , for instance , that American Express issued a card allowing balances to revolve month to month . Discover Card , too , waited until the 1986 Super Bowl to lift the curtain on its first credit card . <h> The 1990s Explosion <p> The explosion of credit card use began in the 1990s . In a 2004 examination of Americas growing credit card debt , the New York Times found the number of people holding charge cards had increased 75% between 1990 and 2003 , from 82 million to 144 million . During the same period , total credit-card charges grew even more : roughly 350% , from $338 billion to a staggering $1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1990 . Back then , households that carried a balance on their credit cards carried an average of $2,550 month to month . By the end of 2003 , that average had nearly doubled to $7,520 . <p> Nor was credit card debt the only type of consumer debt to rise during the 1990s . Mortgages , auto loans and student debt all continued to accumulate during the same period . The rise in credit card and other debt dovetailed , while the savings rate dwindled . <p> The situation is similar in the United Kingdom , where , the BBC finds , credit card debt has more than tripled since 1994 . As a result of easier credit card access , British consumers and their credit cards " gobbled up the latest TVs and the furthest holidays " en route to hefty debt totals . <h> Where We Stand Today <p> Though Americas total consumer debt has undoubtedly risen , it is not as widely dispersed as you might think . Liz Pulliam Weston of MSN puts some of the frightening numbers into context . We frequently hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in credit card debt . In reality , Weston shows , " averages do n't  tell the tale . " The $8,000 figure is derived from a 2002 study in which CardWeb divided the outstanding credit card debt at the end of that year ( $750.9 billion ) by 84 million the number of American households said to have at least one credit card . Deeper analysis of the same data showed that 55% of the households owe nothing on credit cards at all . Which means that the rest 45% owe more than $8,000 a lot more .

The premise that the US has had its recession and that now the economy and the markets will advance seems to be not so certain . <p> Bearish sentiment has risen and inflows into broad market ETFs have lessened . An investor has to make a decision , as usual , as to whether or not to be in the market . <p> History suggests that it is better to be in the market because to be out of the market is betting against the odds ; over the last 100 years or so , the market has ultimately moved higher. - And the thing is to be in the market every day , rather than just guessing trends on a short-term basis . <p> In my- book , - Winning with ETF Strategies- ( FT Press , 2012 ) , I showed the results of- investing- $1.00 in the- S&amp;P 500 Index- in 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three different scenarios : <p> If you had been out of the market on the best five days each year ; <p> If you had been out of the market on the worst five days each year ; and <p> If you had simply held the index through the good and bad days of each year . <p> The buy and hold strategy would have returned $16.58 , which is a decent amount . If you had missed the five best days each year , you would have had a very poor return , with only $.11 left on the invested dollar . <p> But if you had missed the worst five days each year , you would have had a great performance , the $1.00 being worth $2,520.94 . <p> There are also big differences in the performances of each year . For instance , 1987 was essentially a flat year . But if you had missed the five best days , you would have been down about 20% that year ; if you had missed the five worst days , you would have been up about 60% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31% , and without the best five days , an investor would be up only about 18% . Without being in the market on the five worst days , an investor would be up almost 46% . <p> Forecasting when to- invest- in the market on a daily basis is much more granular than forecasting on a trend basis because big gains and losses , which change portfolio performance drastically , can both come during one day . <p> You can be right on a major market trend basis , and sell out all or part of your positions for a few days , and have your performance lag because of what happens on a daily basis . <p> One reason that this information should be considered when investing : If you are out of the market on the good days or some of the good days , your performance will suffer and no one knows when the good days or the bad days will be . <p> So if you can not consistently be in the market on the good days , or be out of the market on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long stocks for that amount of capital you can reasonably invest and want to invest . <p> And if you are long , then you want to find the asset- classes- that have the best chance of performing . <h> How to Outperform the S&amp;P 500 Index <p> The S&amp;P- 500- Index is a cap-weighted index , and there are many proponents of investing in other than cap-weighted indices . <p> There is a perceived risk in tying index weighting to market price ; at the least , this can make an index inefficient on the upside . <p> If you are using the S&amp;P 500 the most widely used benchmark as your benchmark , then the more you deviate from this index , the greater the chance there is of outperforming it , but also the greater chance there is of underperforming it . <p> A way of looking at the market is that the market is a zero-sum proposition , meaning that there is only so much gain available , and that for you to profit in the market , another investor must lose . <p> A zero-sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or loss is exactly balanced by the losses or gains of the other people in the game. - When the gains of people are added up and matched against other people 's losses , they sum to zero . <p> In other words , there is only so much pie to go around ; if someone takes a bigger slice , the other or others must take a smaller slice or smaller slices . <p> So if the market is judged against a benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500 , to outperform an investor must invest in other than the S&amp;P 500 stocks and weighting . <p> The most usual ways to attempt to beat the market is to invest in sectors , weighting methods , or cap sizes that will outperform . <h> Looking for Outperforming Asset Classes <p> One place you can look for possible outperformance is in foreign stocks . <p> WisdomTree , the dividend-weighted and other non-cap weighted index ETF maker , is of the opinion that Asian stocks , as defined in as the MSCI AC Asia Pacific ex-Japan Index , are in a sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its studies of historical valuations of Asian equities , the company concluded that Asian equities are selling at relatively low valuations based on past ranges . <p> WisdomTree broke down dividend yield periods from these stocks into three time periods : low-dividend yield years , mid-dividend yield years , and high dividend yield years . <p> They found that the performance for the year following the middle 12-month dividend yield time has been the highest . <p> The year after the middle dividend years returned on average 30.86% , which is more than 17% ahead of the average for years after the other dividend years . <p> As of February 2013 , Asian equities had a trailing dividend of 2.85% , which placed them in the middle dividend year- class .

@@11805158 @405158/ @qwx171675 <h> Can Your Family Afford Life on One Income ? 6 Steps to Figuring It Out <p> Whether mothers ( and increasingly , fathers too ) choose to work outside the home , or stay home to raise their children is a personal decision that often sparks a myriad of emotions from both sides . You can weigh the pros and cons all you want , but there is one basic question that needs to be addressed before the debate even begins : <h> Can you afford it ? <p> For me , this is a question I wish I had asked myself before I even began planning my family . I had n't even considered staying at home to raise my children an option , and because I did n't intend on becoming a Stay-at-Home Mom , it never occurred to me that I might need to plan for it- just in case . <p> Before I had children I had always imagined that once I made the leap into motherhood I would continue to work . Once my first child was born everything changed . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time , I was suddenly faced with paying exorbitant child care costs . I never considered the fact that I might not be able to afford to be a working mother . I did n't have much earning potential at the time of my daughter 's birth and my paycheck was more or less the sum of the cost of daycare . <p> After trying to juggle working part-time and piecing together childcare , my husband and I made the decision that I would become a full-time stay-at-home mom . There were several factors we did n't consider before we made the transition to a single-income household , and it took a number of financially rocky years , which included two lay-offs , until we finally found a way to make it work for our budget . <p> If you are considering starting a family ( or even if you have already jumped on the baby bandwagon ) and want to weigh the stay-at-home option , here are six steps to figuring out the financials : <h> 1 . Track everything <p> Write down every single penny you spend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into three categories : <p> Secondary expenses . This includes things you can live without such as eating out , entertainment , haircuts , gifts , travel , cable TV , gym memberships , beauty treatments , and dry cleaning . <p> Emergency expenses . Leave a comfortable cushion for unexpected expenses such as car repairs , medical bills , and home improvement . <h> 2 . Evaluate the long-term career costs <p> Next , think about the long-term costs associated with leaving the workforce . Taking a few years off work means you will take a hit on your salary when you reenter the workplace . You will also lose accrued social security benefits , and matching 401k contributions or a pension , if your company offers them . Keep in mind that the longer you stay out of work , the lower your future income will be . It also may be harder for you to find employment if your job skills get rusty or you fall behind on technology . <h> 3 . Figure out how much it costs you to work . <p> That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas money you spend on your commute , or maybe you have to pay for parking or a monthly train pass . Do n't forget the dry cleaning , lunches out , coffee breaks , and office birthday parties too . It all adds up . <p> You want to know what the biggest expense of working is ? Childcare costs . The rates vary from town to town , and it also depends on what kind of care you choose : - live-in nanny , nanny-share , home daycare , corporate daycare . The prices also vary for the age of the child ( care for potty-trained kids is less expensive than it is for those still in diapers ) and sometimes you can catch a slight break if you have more than one child in a particular program . I have yet to come across a two-for-one deal yet though , so do n't get your hopes too high . <h> 4 . Do the math <p> Take your double income and subtract the figure you calculated in step 3 ( the cost of working ) . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers are worlds away from each other , you might not be able to make it work . If they are closer together , staying at home to raise your children might be feasible , with some slight lifestyle adjustments . <p> Decide what you can and ca n't live without . For my family , it meant giving up cable TV , regular visits to the hairdresser , dining out , and traveling outside of visiting family . I also avoid Target like the plague , and buy ( mostly ) second-hand children 's clothing . I have even learned how to give myself a pretty decent manicure and pedicure . <p> One word of advice ? Take it easy on the sacrifices . If you give up too much at once you are likely to feel deprived and run the risk of binging on luxuries . Cut out the extra expenses slowly over time and see what you can live without . If life just is n't the same without that morning latte , then maybe it 's worth trading the magazine subscription for . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . <p> While you may have to give up a few luxuries in exchange for more time with your kids , there are also many alternatives to making a little extra cash . Maybe your employer is open to you working part-time or from home , or perhaps you can get hired as a freelancer for on a project basis . Some working mothers have been able to trade longer workdays Monday through Thursday for having Fridays off . And do n't underestimate picking up that old waitressing job that got you through college . It 's a great way to make extra cash without having to bring any work home with you . <p> I also know mothers who have earned extra income by putting their newfound child-rearing skills to work by offering in-home babysitting and daycare services , and others who have found side work with businesses like Mary Kay Cosmetics , and Stella and Dot jewelry . Both of those options require some initial investment though , so do your homework before you dive right in. <h> 6 . Put it all into action- BEFORE YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your new budget before life events force you to . This is the perfect time to give your new budget a test drive before you have made any permanent decisions , like quitting your job . <p> Live off of a single income for a while and put the second income into savings . Not only will this give you a real-life look at your new budget , but you will build a nice nest egg before your little bundle of joy arrives . You will also have time to make any changes to your plan before you go through the biggest change of your life : parenthood . <p> Morgan is a freelance writer and blogger living in Southern California with her husband , two daughters , and flock of backyard chickens .

We cut out cable TV , we rarely go to the movies now ( DVDs rule ! ) , and do a lot of cheap family activities that create a bond for us as a family without breaking our budget . <p> Do You have any suggestions to other families regarding finances ? <p> The key is for you and your spouse to be on the same page in terms of your financial goals and plan , and for you to work as a team instead of working against each other . Finances are a tough issue for many couples , and if you 're not working together , itll be your downfall . <p> A great way to do that is to have some conversations about what you want in life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of house do you want , and how soon do you see yourself buying it ? How much do you want to provide your children for college ? Talk about retirement , and travel , and cars and shopping and entertainment . <p> Its also good to involve your children in the discussion a bit . They 're usually too young to handle the details , but at least make them understand why you cant buy them super expensive things for Christmas , or why you cant go to the movies every single weekend . Kids are much more likely to be on board if they 've been included in some of the decision making . <p> Also have weekly money meetings with your spouse , where you balance your checkbook and review your budget and talk about expenses that are coming up . Above all , curb impulse spending , the enemy of all budgets . Stay away from the mall or Costco or Walmart or other places designed to have you spend . Freeze your credit card ( or cut it up like we did ) so you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put all impulse buying on hold , write down the item you want on a list , and after 30 days , you can revisit buying it if you still want it .

We could do more , but were off to a decent start . Like I said , we include them on discussions about ways to cut back , or ways to have fun without spending a lot . We are teaching them the value of saving for a goal , instead of just spending on little things . <p> I 'm also considering an allowance , which is n't something we 've been able to afford yet , and if we do it I 'd like to make sure that they save a percentage and donate another percentage instead of just spending it .

Its really a habit that we must break , and replace with more positive habits . Another related habit is spending more than we have Ive been replacing it with the habit of spending less than we earn , and automatically saving the rest . <p> Savings is a great positive habit , as is investing for retirement . Habits such as budgeting , and balancing your checkbook , and paying your bills on time , and having one place for your incoming bills , are great positive habits , while doing the opposite are negative ones that many people have .

The culprit ? Debit cards . As senior research analyst Red Gillen told the New York Times , " when debit cards were introduced in the early ' 90s , that was the beginning of the slow and gradual decline of paper checks and cash . " The trend away from cash was further cemented in the early 2000s . According to the Cleveland Fed , the following non-cash transactions grew between 2000-2003 , with percentage growth shown in brackets : <p> * Credit card transactions ( 6.7% ) <p> * Automated Clearing House transactions ( 13.4% ) <p> * Electronic benefit transfers ( 15.4% ) <p> * Debit card transactions ( 20% ) <p> During the same period , the number of paper check transactions declined by 4.3% . <p> The debit card has n't  lost an ounce of popularity during the late 2000s . Just the opposite : in May 2010 , ABC News reported that MasterCard debit customers spent as much on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 as they did on credit cards the first time that this has ever occurred . Visas debit-card volume first exceeded its credit card volume for the first time even earlier , in December 2008 . <h> The Fall of Cash <p> It was largely the increased convenience and safety of debit that inspired people to gradually use less cash in their day-to-day spending . Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey spoke for many consumers when he told the New York Times that " the problem with cash is that it is tangible , it 's inconvenient , you have to carry around a bunch of bills and you have to continually go to the A.T.M . " <p> U.S. coins ( namely the penny and nickel ) now cost more to produce than they are actually worth . And the United States is not the only country to be witnessing a decline in cash-based transactions . The UKs Telegraph , citing a Payments Council report , predicted that cash will be used in fewer than half of all UK transactions by 2015 . The trend is already underway : just 59% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 73% only ten years ago . <p> Japan , meanwhile , has reportedly discussed a total abolishment of cash in order to fight deflation in that country .

A whole host of forces ( from government policy to consumer trends ) is conspiring to make cash less and less relevant to daily economic life . <p> In fact , new transaction methods are popping up every day .

Rather than trying to replace credit and debit cards , American companies like Square and GoPayment are equipping phones to work with them . As the New York Times explains , the credit and debit card issuers " stay in the middle , extracting a fee with each swipe or bump " of the mobile phone .

@@11805172 @405172/ <h> More stories from GE Miller @qwx171675 <h> Why and How to Buy a Mutual Fund <p> The simple answer to the question why should I buy a mutual fund ? recalls the proverbial joke about the chicken crossing the road . The answer , to get a good return on my investment , or even more simply to make money seems so obvious as to be almost an insult to ones intelligence . But mutual funds are just one of a variety of potential investment vehicles . Stocks , bonds , and other investments that are available for purchase also offer the potential to make money . So what makes mutual funds the investment of choice for many ? When you boil it down , mutual funds provide three major benefits for those who decide to invest in them : <h> 1 . Diversification , 2 . Expertise , .. and 3 . Time <p> What do each of these mean ? <p> Diversification : In times of high volatility and risk , owning one , two , or even five different stocks , bonds , or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is simply no guarantee that your picks are going to be winners . Mutual funds , on the other hand , offer risk diversification . This means that funds purchase more than a few different investments and the risk of losing significantly in any one investment is minimized by being distributed over a number of investments . <p> Expertise : You can be fairly certain that professional mutual fund managers have more research , knowledge , connections , and experiences at their disposal than you do . However , expertise and resources do n't  always produce stellar results . In fact , only 31% of actively managed stock-based mutual funds outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the five years ending Dec. 31 , 2008 . That 's why many investors choose index mutual funds as an alternative to actively managed funds . Index funds simply aim to match the performance of the index that they are following . Since index funds do n't  have professionals choosing the investments , their fees tend to be lower than actively managed funds . Whether you choose index or actively managed funds , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . <p> Time : Without professional resources at your disposal , successful investing can take an extreme amount of time and energy . There is a very high learning curve involved in investing that few have enough time to pick up . If you opt to buy more investments in order to diversify , your time commitment only increases . Opting to put your money into mutual funds frees the time that it takes to research and keep up with each of your individual investments . <h> How to Purchase a Mutual Fund <p> If you 've determined that you want to purchase a mutual fund , here 's how you can do it , step-by-step . <p> 1 . Choose a discount brokerage ( i.e. Zecco , Scottrade , Etrade , Fidelity , Schwaab , etc. ) to purchase your fund through . You could opt to invest in mutual funds through a full service advisor , but there is a wealth of comparative resources available to help you choose your fund for free so that you can purchase through a low fee discount broker instead . <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a a general trading account or a retirement account such as a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA . <p> 3 . Research . In an upcoming post , well highlight what you should look for in a mutual fund . For starters , you may want to focus on choosing a fund that consistently has at least met and preferably beat the performance of its peers at a fee that is lower than its peers . <p> 5 . Make your Purchase . Enter a dollar amount that youd like to apply towards the fund . This differs from entering a price you want to pay as you do when you purchase a stock . The price you will pay for each share will be the closing price on the day that you purchase the fund . The amount you enter will be divided by that share price to determine how many shares of the fund you will receive . When you first purchase a fund , you need to indicate whether you would like your dividends , capital gains , or both reinvested into additional shares . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little reason not to choose both . <p> Some funds offer no transaction fees when you make a purchase . For those that do charge a fee ( typically $25-50 ) you do not have to pay this fee when you purchase additional shares of the same fund . Its also worth noting that many funds require a minimum initial purchase that depends on what type of investment account you are using . 
@@11805173 @405173/ @qwx171675 <h> How to Save Money During the Early Days of a Startup <p> There 's a lot of commentary on how to start a business , how to court investors , and how to sell a business . One theme that consistently falls through the cracks , however , is what it takes to , and what it is like to start up and run your own company on the ground level . For many young entrepreneurs , the thought of using investor money to help build your dream sounds like just like that a dream . And while generating funding and starting out with a size-able amount of seed money can help a business get off the ground quickly , there are down sides to bringing others on board with the business that invariably will become your baby . If you have just taken the plunge , or are about to , and for those thinking about bootstrapping ( even for business people that are just trying to save ) , I 've laid down some tips that I 've learned by doing , as a young entrepreneur and investor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Upon starting your business , it should quickly become apparent that you have some customers that are more profitable then others . Ones that take less time and generate more profit . Conversely , there are the customers that take more time , and generate less profit for you . Breaking down each customer into its own profit &amp; loss ( P&amp;L ) statement helps you understand who they are and what characteristics they have in common . Once you 've identified the characteristics of the high profit customers , you can then go after them . Its worth spending the time to analyze your clients in a cost-benefit way , so that you can scale your businesss operations and your profits . <h> Generate Financial Reports Monthly <p> " What you measure gets managed " Peter Drucker once quipped , and that is why its important to review your financial reports monthly ( if not more often ) . Much like it is important to monitor the profit/loss of your customer base , it is important to see where the money is coming and going each month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products they provide/sell . Sometimes they are not always profitable . If you are able to measure efficiency of operations , and profitability , etc. , it will become easier to manage and improve upon each . <h> Raise Money as Late as Possible <p> Launching a company teaches you how to sell . Raising money teaches you how to spend . I 'm not against raising money to grow your business , but ensure you know exactly what you 're going to spend on it , and act as if you do n't  have money to keep the creativity coming that 's so prevalent when you 're bootstrapping your business . Also , raising money later can save you a lot of money in the long run , and will allow you to run and shape the business in the way you want , for longer . <h> Salaries for Start-ups <p> As a start-up you want to keep your salary cost low and compensate either by performance bonuses ( goals ) or by equity . Start-up companies should never be paying market rates for their first few hires sell the dream ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages , there are hundreds , if not thousands , of young , able and energetic individuals with the skills necessary to get the job done and a willingness to sacrifice early on , to be a part of something that they a ) have ownership in ; and b ) that they believe in . Their reward : a slice of the pie . All it takes is an introduction . <h> Keep Your Fixed Overhead Low <p> In todays economy its important to be able to scale up and down your business to reduce your fixed overhead . Things like software as a service where you pay " by the drink " , ex : phone systems ( Ex : www.grasshopper.com ) , monthly subscriptions , contract help , virtual assistants . These are all invaluable services , provided either via the cloud , or part-time independent contractors . What once took several , paid employees do do can now be done in several hours . These services exist for the person for whom this article is written why not take advantages of them ? <h> Access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have access to capital , either by retained earnings or line of credit just in case you come across hard times . The best advice I ever got was , " always ask for money when you do n't  need it . If you can get it for cheap , take it you never know when you 'll need it . " Its common sense for individuals to have six months to a years worth of earnings aside as an emergency fund . This couldnt be more relevant than it is for a young entrepreneur ( albeit , not always doable ) , as most new businesses have unpredictable cash-flow . <h> Focus on Profits <p> Its tempting when you start your company to get sales from anyone willing to buy , but do n't  do this at the expense of not making a profit . You need to ensure you price yourself appropriately so that you can reinvest in growing your company . Yes customers are important , but they need to be profitable or you wont be in business for very long . Simply , think profits not sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early days to " pre-sign " checks and hand them to your accountant , lawyer , employees to buy things big mistake . Remember , that when you start a business of your own , each cent of that money is yours . Think of it as your money . No one cares about how it is spent quite like you . <h> Do n't  be Afraid to Barter <p> I 'm assuming that your new business provides value to your customers , so there 's a chance that someone would be willing to exchange your product or services for theirs . This is a good thing . Think about the market value of what you are trading , and the time involved and if it makes sense do n't  be afraid to scratch someone elses back . This can also be a good source of referrals . <h> Have Your Customers Finance Your Business : <p> I call this strategy " Customer Financing " . Get your customer to pay you for your efforts . Deposits , pre-pay , or even better payment terms . No one , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the bill collector . It not only is a painful process , but it also can slow down growth if every customer is late on payment .

There has been talk of possible passenger flights to the Moon and orbiting hotels , conjuring up images of 2001 : A Space Odyssey . <p> But Tuesdays launch should n't be viewed with such lofty expectations at least not yet . Without strong government support this flight might not have never happened , and it is yet to be determined if there is a commercial market for space travel .

In 2008 , NASA felt that it was time for the private sector to play a bigger role in the space program . That year , the agency signed a contract with Space X , a private company founded by billionaire Elon Musk ( of Pay Pal and Tesla fame ) , to build a reusable space shuttle capable of transporting equipment and people to and from space . <p> On Tuesday , Space X successfully hurled its prototype , Dragon , into orbit for an unmanned test flight . Eventually , Dragon will be used to ferry astronauts to the orbiting International Space Station , acting sort of like an intergalactic private airline . <h> The Most Expensive Flight in the Universe <p> But while Space X should be congratulated for building and launching Dragon , it is still way too early to start getting excited about potential business and investment opportunities in outer space . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , major technological breakthroughs when it comes to space travel since the launching of the shuttle program in 1975 . <p> That means that it is still prohibitively expensive to do almost anything space-related. - For example , NASA is paying Space X $1.6 billion for just 10 roundtrip flights with Dragon , which works out to a whopping $160 million a flight . <p> Unless the price of space travel falls dramatically , then the only customer for commercial space companies , like Space X , will be confined to governments with manned space programs and satellite companies that need repair work . That 's a small pool to draw from . <h> Who Eats the Loss ? <p> There appear to be some similarities between Space X and other NASA subcontractors like Boeing , Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin . While Space X may be " independent " , it is seemingly almost entirely dependent on NASA for business and will probably continue to be for the foreseeable future .

So if there is a cost overrun , Space X would have to eat the loss . That could end up saving NASA some money , but if Space X is upside down for too long , its possible the company would need to declare bankruptcy , leaving NASA in a lurch . <h> The New Dawn of Space Travel <p> So what 's the future of commercial space flight ?

Everyone should understand at least the basics of investing because even if you have someone else manage your investments , it is still your money and no one will care about it like you will . <p> Your husband and you took a 40% cut in income because you had to leave work to raise your child . What methods did you use to handle this financial challenge ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my husband and I were not comfortable with the day care alternatives available , so we decided to take the plunge into the one-income world.The major thing that enabled us to take that cut in income was that we have always spent less than we earned so other than our mortgage , we had no debt . And , our mortgage payment was low . Just because the bank said we could afford a certain mortgage payment did n't mean we wanted to spend that much.While I was home with my daughter I decided my job was to save money where ever I could . During that time we rarely ate at restaurants , and I stocked up on sale items and planned meals around what was on sale . I would go between three grocery stores to buy what was on sale at each store , and I clipped coupons and used them on double coupon days at one store ( the savings in double coupons was amazing ) . I read everything I could find on living on less money and chose the methods from those books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used The Dollar Stretcher and I still do ( you interviewed Gary , the guy running the show on that site ) . I discovered rummage sales in some wealthy neighborhoods where I could get gorgeous baby and toddler clothes and toys for very little money .

To keep from feeling very deprived , I kept my mind on my goal of raising my daughter and I enjoyed the simplicity of our family life ; that season of my life would not last not forever . I was grateful for what we did have and spent little time dwelling on thing we chose to do without for awhile.We had monthly savings goals then as we do now , and we saved up for Christmas gifts and other larger purchases so we would not get taken by surprise by a big outflow of cash .

Do you think parents can be a big influence on how their children will handle finances when they grow up ? <p> Parents absolutely influence their children 's financial choices . Kids imitate what they see and the home environment they grow up in provides them with a compass for what is acceptable .

I also teach her that some things are worth paying more for because of quality or because they are simply more enjoyable . <p> How do you handle your finances with your husband ? Does a single person handle all the details or is this a joint effort ? <p> I handle the majority of our finances but I would never make a major decision without asking my husband what he thought about it .

I thought my husband and I would keep separate accounts plus a joint account when we were first married but I quickly found it to be unnecessary because it 's just easier to keep one account , and each of us knew what the other was spending anyway . I suppose if two people had very different ideas about spending , a his/hers/ours set up would be ideal . I can also see how problems could result if something is needed for the collective household that is more expensive than anticipated but one person wants to use their money on themselves instead of contributing to defraying the costs.I think the answer to whether separate accounts work is , " it depends .

@@11805216 @405216/ @qwx171675 <p> Mints Note : The Digerati Life is a fun-to-read personal finance blog from the perspective of a software engineer/mommy/blogger . Check out todays interview to read up on Silicon Valley Bloggers view on the dot-com bubble burst ; living in the high cost region of Silicon Valley ; and finances in regards to family and kids . <p> Seeing the dot-com bubble bursting from the inside perspective will always be different than those of us not in the industry , can you describe a little bit about what you saw during that time ? <p> Oh yes , this brings back memories of extreme elation , when everyone at one point was dreaming of new beginnings away from the rat race . I saw how people were giddily tallying up their paper money on a daily basis and drawing up plans for their first big purchases from what sports car to buy to planning where theyd move to . I also saw the frenzy get wilder after every new announcement that a new startup just had an IPO , especially when we had friends in such companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Bay Area attracted more and more transplants . People day traded every day while I argued with these people that they were practically throwing away their money on margin . When the bubble popped , I saw some friends lose half their net worth to the markets . Others left and returned to their home lands . Everyone got laid off ( I am not exaggerating here ) . But people remained optimistic about their next ventures while coasting on severance ( when available ) and unemployment benefits so it was n't as bad as you 'd think , except perhaps accepting the loss of those paper millions . <p> Youve mention that a disproportionate number of personal finance bloggers are engineers . Do you think that 's merely a coincident or is there something more to it ? Perhaps engineers ( in all fields ) are more interested in knowing how things work , having control over how things work , and maybe this includes personal finance ? <p> I 'm going to venture a guess on this one . Finance is math based and involves some strategizing perfect for logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many engineers make . The idea of budgeting , investing and even arbitrage may be something that they could be drawn to since a lot of finance deals with discipline , control ( as you 've mentioned ) and maybe even creative thinking to some extent . Finance is a fascinating subject on its own which Ive enjoyed for a long time . It was natural for me to get into it . But I 'm also going to suggest a more sober reason for why engineers do financial blogging : they 're on the lookout for additional income ; they 're technically inclined and comfortable with the internet so they can exploit its opportunities quite easily . Plus they know that financial blogging can be easily monetizable . Hows that for a different angle ? What I 'm surprised about is how talented a lot of these engineers are as writers . The engineers I know personally abhor writing exercises of any sort . Good luck with trying to make them do design and technical documentations with a smile . <p> Silicon Valley is definitely not a cheap place to live ; do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of living ? <p> I will admit that for a long time I lived very simply and frugally to the point of being teased about it . I started investing very early and really saved up during the high salaried days of the dot com boom . I knew it would n't last and really " made serious hay while the sun shone . " My best tip is to never take for granted what you have and receive so no matter how much money you make , think twice before spending it . Also , to survive in the Bay Area , one needs to seek opportunities to grow their money along with tightening their belt . Budgeting or being frugal alone may not be enough to live comfortably in SF . <p> Having a young family can be quite challenging . Youve mentioned that having two children changed your financial mindset significantly , what are some of the steps you 've taken in meeting these financial challenges ? <p> In the past , I was admittedly pretty tight with money . I was very careful how I spent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my expenses will grow greater . I realized that those days of higher expenses came when my kids were born . My financial mindset changed in the sense that I had to be more relaxed about how to spend money because raising kids takes a lot of resources . My spouse and I were glad that we had built up enough financial resources to handle these changes . We also delayed having children until our mid 30s in order to provide our family a stable and secure financial life . Choosing to become older parents was the sacrifice we took to achieve a solid financial foundation for ourselves . <p> One of your dreams is to become a Certified Financial Planner ( which is totally awesome in our book ) , is there a particular reason why you want to be a CFP ? <p> There were occasions when I 've helped out friends and family with some advice regarding their finances . I was surprised at how many people I knew who werent familiar or comfortable with personal finance . I realized how much I enjoyed helping them out via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance blogger , I 've also realized how much there was that I did not know about finance that I am now learning . So it may be the case that I hold my tongue on this for now . = I 'm just glad to have found a place in the financial blogosphere where I can both learn and hopefully help people in this arena . <p> A common question to personal finance blogging parents : how do you plan to teach your kids about finances ? <p> My kids are still quite young so they are n't  yet privy to the whole concept of money . I 'm probably going to approach this in a moderate fashion . I wont be a tightfisted parent but probably one who will lead by example . I will educate them with stories and basic information as they grow older and may withhold allowances until a much later age . I hope to see them build some ambition even while they 're young and will be encouraging them to take jobs once they 're ready . <p> Current Financial Strategy : <p> Keep a solid and hopefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business . Employ prudent asset allocation . Also , were hoping that our home business will fly in the next couple of years in order to relieve me of my 9 to 5 job .

Currently , he s one year into this venture . <p> Best Financial Tip : <p> Never take your money for granted . Educate yourself in the areas of finance and business , stay reasonably frugal and invest your savings in index funds . <p> Worst Financial Move Ever : <p> Emotional investments in independent stocks . Shorting stocks and participating in overly complicated schemes that involve money . I realized that the more complicated a money making scheme or venture was , the worse my returns were .
