In fact , any theology of the kingdom that does n't begin with a heart being changed " from stone to flesh " is mere activism . However , we often think of redemption as an individual event in the heart of one person . But truly , the coming kingdom of God will also redeem the world , all He created as good , but now stained and broken by sin . <p> The kingdom was inaugurated by Christ 's coming ( Is. 61 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He returns ( Rev. 11:15 ) . Because of this , every believer lives in the tension of the " now " and " not yet : " the continuing kingdom between the fall and the fulfillment . Having captured and captivated a believer 's heart , our King calls us to join a community of faith and be part of the ongoing redemption of His world , His kingdom come . <p> A New Community This community of faith is where missions originates . And how it happens reveals much about the community . The very real need in a community of faith is to keep both the proclamation of grace and the doing of justice woven together in our hearts and labors . Embracing both of these together means that we see the gospel not only bringing personal forgiveness and justification , but birthing a new kingdom community that seeks to bring all of life-the spiritual , material , systemic , private , and public-under the lordship of Jesus Christ . A deep work of the gospel of grace , in real time , powerfully touches the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and injustice . <p> The proclamation of grace and the community renewal that occurs through the loving and compassionate practice of justice and mercy should not be reduced to a church 's " personality type , " the emphasis of the church 's primary leadership , or the unique work of parachurch organizations . A faithful embrace of the theology of the kingdom holds that gospel proclamation is active , practical , and is rooted in a passionate seeking first of the kingdom of God . <p> Kingdom Defined This kingdom can be understood as God 's " domain , " the place or sphere of His rule . William J. Abraham explained it this way in ( The Logic of Evangelism ) . : " ... to speak of the rule of God or the reign of God or the kingdom of God is fundamentally to speak of the action of God in history " This kingdom extends from our hearts , as Jesus puts it , " the kingdom of God is within you " ( Luke 17:21 ) . , to the ends of the earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the gospel of the kingdom is the very good , holy , loving , and liberating news that God , because of who He is , came to redeem a people for Himself through the perfect work of Jesus Christ . From the beginning of the redemptive narrative in Scripture , God 's purpose has been to set us free from our bondage to sin and to enable us , through the gift of his Spirit , to become a people of justice , who can love mercy and walk humbly with God ( Micah 6:8 ) . <p> One significant way that God sums up His purpose for our lives , individually and collectively as communities of faith , is the phrase : " Seek first God 's kingdom and his righteousness " ( Matt 6:33 ) . The gospel is therefore woven together with doing justice , which can be understood as the holiness of God on the ground . In other words , justice is God 's character in action-on earth as it is in heaven . <p> The Incarnation : God 's Love , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of His Son , God demonstrated His love , justice , and compassion on the ground . Isaiah prophesied Jesus ' reign over God 's kingdom and the justice of His rule : <p> " Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end . He .

This was my fourth mission trip and is was my favorite by far . <p> Going into this trip , I held little to no knowledge about the culture or even the location of Belize . Right off the plane , delicious food and famous watermelon juice greeted us . Imagine eating three homemade meals every day for a week . Can the women who cooked for us please come live with me in Dallas ? I am barely getting by with the Easy Mac ! <p> The team was told that we would be doing " light construction .

Upon doing so , we got fried in the sun a bit . It felt as if we were in paradise , despite the hard work that we put in that week . Who else can say that they swam with ( and touched ) sharks with their friends ? Also , I swam with a sea turtle ! Who casually does that ? SMU RUF does ! I also lost count of the amount of ice cream that was consumed and the stories that were told around the eating table . <p> As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quite cant put my finger on what made it so extraordinary .

I now have lifelong friendships that started with a simple conversation . I made a friend who has awesome photography skills and another one who lived in my shoes growing up in a single-parent household . The others on this team are all facing similar events in life and handle relatable challenges at Southern Methodist University ( SMU ) .

Also , is it not culturally correct for a woman to work , so all of us girls did a lot of talking to the children and taking a ton of photos to prove that we actually did some work . <p> We created a dozen or so hashtags during our trip including #unBELIZEable , which I think is very original . Now , if any of those phrases are said for any reason , I am reminded of the unbelievable time that I had with this mission team . <p> Starting off the week , our team was given the phrase , " Sometimes we need to drop the shovel and do something else . " This would consist of pausing our rock hauling and helping one of the students with their homework or talking to one of the workers to understand how they live their lives .

I could see in her eyes that she was sad that we could n't have another day together . Yet , what she said next gave me hope and peace . She replied with , " You will be back one day . " That absolutely tore my heart to pieces . It was astonishing that this child was able to comprehend that we would be together again , even if it was years from now .

@@8843208 @2043208/ <h> Why Are the Japanese So Resistant to the Gospel ? <p> One of the most common questions I 'm asked is " Why are the Japanese people so resistant to the gospel ? " It 's a good question . We hear of the explosive growth of the church in China , India , Africa , and even in the Arab world . Why not Japan ? There are many complex issues all interwoven through each other , but here are a few of the key issues . <p> Conformity : There is a strong expectation to always look , act , and be like everyone else . This can be seen in the uniforms worn by most school children and the amazing order in which they sit in nice , neat rows . It 's also seen in the sea of monochrome colors among working adults with their typically nondescript ties . Conformity is deeply ingrained in the Japanese culture , where each person is responsible for the actions of their family , friends , and colleagues . In 1597 , following the expulsion of Portuguese missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instituted a system in which five families were grouped together for public accountability . If a member of this group turned in a Christian , the Christian was killed . If someone outside the group reported a Christian , everyone in the five families was killed . Although Japanese people are now free to worship as they like , this sense of group responsibility remains today . To be Japanese means one is Buddhist and Shintoist ; it 's an inseparable part of the culture . One Japanese man , upon converting to Christianity , was asked , " You are no longer Japanese ? " In a nation where only 0.2% of the people are Christians , sharing the gospel with a Japanese friend is seen as asking them to no longer be Japanese . <p> Perfection : While visiting with students at Briarwood Christian School in Birmingham recently , after I described the level of perfectionism expected in Japan , two different students asked me , " Is Japan a nation of OCD people ? " Well , no , it is not . But there is incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's no accident that Japan is known for high quality cars and electronics . And where else could someone pay $150 for a perfect melon ? The pressure to be perfect in every way is crippling . More than a million young people have isolated themselves in their parents ' homes , and nearly 30,000 people commit suicide every year . In a culture that offers no grace for the imperfect , the concept of " sin " is as foreign as shrimp and grits . In this context , sharing the gospel means telling a Japanese friend that they are not perfect -- that they need help from Someone better than them . Even if your friend is able to admit to being a sinner , he is not accustomed to receiving grace from others , so receiving grace from Jesus is often a lifelong struggle . <p> Japanese Superiority : Most nations have been on the losing side of war . A culture as old as Japan has typically been humiliated many times over the millennia . Japan has done more than its share of humiliating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And although World War II was certainly humiliating , the conqueror helped Japan to quickly rebuild itself and salvage its honor . Japan does see itself as superior to other peoples . As such , it does not take quickly to ideas from these other cultures , including Christianity . <p> Ultimately , however , we know that God is not limited by these cultural issues . Jesus said , " All that the Father gives Me will come to Me , and whoever comes to Me I will never cast out " ( John 6:37 ) . God 's sovereign election of His people is always effective . As the will of God dictates , Japanese people will respond to the gospel . Isaiah 55:11 says , " So shall My word be that goes out from My mouth ; it thing for which I sent it . " As the bearers of God 's word , we can rest in the comfort that God is ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gospel . Japan , too , will one day kneel at the name of Jesus . Please pray that God will soon draw the hearts of Japan to Himself . And please back up those prayers with action , by either going to proclaim the good news of the gospel or by partnering with me or others who have committed to bring the hope of the gospel to this people with so little hope . <p> Brent Kooi is an MTW missionary serving in Osaka , Japan , helping to establish Genesis International College , an English language Christian college that hopes to impact Japanese students with the gospel of Christ .

@@8843540 @2043540/ <h> Why Prayer is Critical to Missions <p> The battle for soulsBeing a missionary is really quite a challenge . In fact , the Great Commission is our personal mission impossible ! The only thing that our lost friends truly neednamely the Holy Spirits divine intervention to bring regenerationis what we do not have in our power to give . This can be infuriating . <p> Sometimes , in order to mask this frustration , we become so enthralled with our tasks that we start living as functional atheists . We come up with plans , we implement our own strategies , and we turn missions into a measure of our own success . Oh , and as an after-thought , we ask God to perfunctorily bless our efforts . <p> Prayer , however , is the most basic acquiescence that we are 100 percent reliant on God for everything . Our every breath , salvation , our abilities and resources are all gifts from Him . We pray because we know that without the bookends of Gods power and presence in the Great Commission , we might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission to conquer the souls of men would be doomed to fail ( Matt. 28:18-20 ) .

Walk around the city for six days , then on the seventh day , seven more times and then blow trumpets and shout ? What earthly good could that do other than bring everyone to the point of total exhaustion ? This military leader might have just laughed except he realized that the One who appeared to him , sword in hand , was worthy of his worship ( Jos . 5:13-15 ) . So Joshua rolled out the plan and the people followed . For 13 rounds of the city , they had time plead with God that this ridiculous plan would in fact succeed . Was it foolish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle plan not have been more strategic ? Would God come through ?

Satan tried to tempt Jesus to cast Himself off the temple Mount and call on the heavenly armies to save Him , as Satan knew his role could command . He wanted Jesus to act independently of His Fathers will . But Jesus had come to fight a different battle . He was to fulfill the Fathers plan by going into the arena alone and powerless .

We plead with Him that He would establish His just kingdom , and bring all things into alignment with His will . But since we know the end of the story , there is so much hope ! <p> In Revelation 19 , we get a sneak peek into the future . Jesus is finally revealed as the triumphant leader of the armies of heaven that Joshua encountered of old . But this time He s wearing a robe dipped in blood , and His sword is coming out of His mouth ( Rev. 19:11-16 ) .

It is an amazing gift and mystery that God has chosen to use our prayers to accomplish his mission ! O , we of little faith ! May we humble ourselves and pray with renewed zeal and expectation and may all glory go to God !
