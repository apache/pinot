They allow us to interpret shapes , faces , colors , and depth by translating the light that reflects off of these things into electrical signals that the brain reads as images . <p> The eyes sit in cone-shaped cavities in the skull called sockets which are surrounded by 6 motion-regulating muscles and multiple layers of fatty tissue that help to protect the eye and give it flexibility . Eyebrows , eyelashes , and eyelids also contribute to this effort . <p> The eye itself is made of 10 general components that all work together to keep us seeing well every day . <p> Cornea The cornea is the outermost layer of the eye and is primarily responsible for focusing the light that comes into our eyes . There are 5 layers to the cornea . The outer layer acts as a kind of shield to the elements and can usually repair itself within a few days of suffering a minor injury . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pupil The pupil is the black circle in the center of the eye , and its primary function is to monitor the amount of light that comes into the eye . When there is a lot of light , the pupil contracts to keep the light from overwhelming the eye . When there is very little light , the pupil expands so it can soak up as much as possible . <p> Iris The iris is the colored part of the eye . Although it might seem purely cosmetic , the iris actually functions to adjust the size of the pupil . It has muscles that contract or expand depending on the amount of light the pupil needs to process images . <p> Lens The lens exists behind the pupil and is responsible for allowing your eyes to focus on small details like words in a book . The lens is in a constant state of adjustment as it becomes thinner or thicker to accommodate the detailed input it receives . With age , the lens loses a lot of its elasticity which often results in cataracts and presbyopia because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it used to . <p> Vitreous Humour The vitreous humour is a gel-like substance that helps to keep the eyeball in its proper , circular shape . This is the area in the eye where floaters develop as pieces of the vitreous humor clump together and cast shadows onto the retina . With age , the vitreous humor begins to shrink and can cause problems like posterior retinal detachment or retinal tears . <p> Retina The retina is the area at the back of the eye that receives the refined , visual message from the front of the eye , and it transmits that visual message to the brain using electrical signals . <p> Sclera The sclera is the white part of the eye , and its main function is to provide strength , structure , and protection for the eye .

The lens guide below will make sense of the confusion and show you how much you can save as a VSP member . <h> Popular Lenses Include : <h> Aspheric <p> Conventional lenses have a front surface that is spherical , meaning it has the same curve across its entire surface . Aspheric lenses have a more complex front surface that gradually changes in curvature from the center of the lens out to the edge . Aspheric lenses provide correction for small distortions in vision .

The magnifying power of trifocals adds to the range of vision , offering a wide field of view when using a computer or glancing at dashboard gauges while driving . <h> Hi-Index <p> This hi-tech plastic lens is designed for people with stronger prescriptions . Vision can be corrected with less material , making the lens much thinner , eliminating that old " Coke bottle " look . They are also lighter and more comfortable . <h> Photochromic <p> Photochromic lenses automatically darken when exposed to sunlight , eliminating the need for separate sunglasses in many cases .

Savvy parents choose polycarbonate lenses for children who may not take good care of their glasses . The durability of polycarbonate lenses makes them a good choice for rimless eyeglasses . Plus , polycarbonate lenses have built-in UV filters to help prevent eye problems such as macular degeneration ( breakdown of macula ) and cataracts ( clouding of the eye lens ) . <h> Progressive <p> Progressive lenses have a smooth progression of power , enabling the wearer to see at intermediate distances as well as near and far .

It identifies and measures imperfections 25 times more precise than Conventional LASIK and creates a customized map for each individual eye . This data is then used to guide the laser during the procedure for optimal results . <p> IntraLase ( bladeless LASIK ) : When performing bladeless LASIK , the LASIK surgeon uses a gentle laser to create the corneal flap .

PRK differs from LASIK in that it is performed on the surface of the eye and no flap is created during the procedure . Instead , the outer layer of the cornea is removed to expose an area for a laser to reshape .

Having dry eyes is a very common problem . Let 's start by looking at the role of tears in your eyes , and then we can address why there are n't enough of them and what you can do about it . <p> Your tears are in charge of lubricating your eyes and giving them the protection and moisture they need to remain healthy and comfortable . The main purpose of your tears is to coat the cornea , the clear covering on the front of your eye . <p> Tears are complex and consist of three main layers . The mucus layer helps keep the moisture attached to the eye itself , the aqueous layer carries vitamins and minerals to the cornea , and the oily layer prevents too many tears from evaporating . <p> When your tear supply starts to dry up , your eyes can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ( ironically ) water more than usual . Over time , this can develop into a chronic problem aptly called " dry eye syndrome . " According to the American Association of Ophthalmology , approximately 3.2 million women and 1.7 million men over the age of 50 suffer from chronic dry eyes . In some cases , dry eye syndrome is a sign of hyperthyroidism . Without proper treatment , chronic dry eyes can result in infection , scarring , or vision loss . <p> There are many external causes of dry eyes such as : medications , indoor heaters and air conditioners , overexposure to computer or TV screens , or contacts that need to be replaced . But there are also biological causes such as allergies and aging . Aging is a common cause of dry eyes in older women because of hormone fluctuations , but men can also suffer from age-related dry eyes . <p> When it comes to finding a treatment for your dry eyes beyond just using eye drops , eating more vegetables , and drinking more water , here are some alternative options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right for you .

Here , the Collingdale , PA , VSP doctor shares some facts about the sight-stealing condition , glaucoma . Dr. Cohen has treated hundreds of glaucoma patients during his career and knows what to watch out for . <h> Q. What is glaucoma , and how many people have it ? <p> A. Its an eye disorder that is caused by too much pressure in the eye . It can damage the retina , optic nerve or both , and cause vision loss and blindness . About 3 million Americans have it , and around 120,000 are legally blind because of glaucoma . Its important to catch it and treat it early , because it can lead to blindness in three to 15 years . <h> Q. Whos at greatest risk ? <p> A. Like a lot of vision conditions , it typically happens to older people . Most often , people over 40 . If there 's a family history of glaucoma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very nearsighted or diabetic have a higher risk . Race can also play a role . Some research has shown that black Americans are about seven times more likely to develop glaucoma . In fact , its the leading cause of blindness among black Americans . Hispanic people also are at higher risk . <h> Q. What causes glaucoma ? <p> A. As part of normal functioning , your eyes produce an internal fluid to help the eyeball keep its shape . The fluid drains out of the eye all the time , but sometimes the drain " backs up " and that 's what usually happens with glaucoma . When this happens , the pressure from the fluid starts building up inside the eye and damages sensitive nerve tissues . In most cases what you get is chronic glaucoma that slowly worsens over time . There 's also a type of glaucoma in which damage occurs without elevated pressure , but its very rare . <h> Q. What are the symptoms of glaucoma ? <p> A. The tricky part is that early stages of glaucoma are usually symptom-free . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " puff test " is a standard part of a comprehensive eye exam . There 's also an acute form of glaucoma in which the " drain " shuts down rapidly . This condition is rare but extremely painful , so there 's no mistaking it . Acute glaucoma requires immediate attention in a hospital emergency room . <h> Q. Is there hope for glaucoma patients ? <p> A. Yes to an extent . There have been quite a few powerful new medications developed in recent years . They can be very effective at slowing or even halting the progression of glaucoma . Laser surgery , with medications , also helps make drainage in the eye better , which reduces the dangerous pressure . While its not curable , glaucoma is often very treatable the earlier , the better . <h> Q.

Hence , the common term , floaters . " They try to brush it away or track it visually , to no avail , " he says . <p> But what causes the freaky floater phenomenon ?

But listen to Dr. Ziskrout and resist the temptation to self-diagnose what 's going on . Call your eye doctor if you experience sudden onset of floaters , or changes to shape , size or frequency of them . Anything from bleeding in your eyes to a retinal tear or detachment could be to blame . Light flashes and blurred vision should also signal alarm .

In the PRK laser vision correction procedure , the laser surgeon utilizes the excimer laser to reshape the curvature of the eye for patients with nearsightedness , farsightedness , and astigmatism . <p> Photorefractive Keratectomy has been performed since 1986 . Prior to LASIK , PRK was the most commonly performed laser vision correction procedure . PRK differs from LASIK as no flap is created during the PRK procedure . PRK may be suitable for people with larger pupils , thin corneas , have other corneal issues or dry eyes . <p> Custom PRK <p> Custom PRK is a procedure that enables your laser vision correction surgeon to further customize the conventional PRK procedure to your individual eyes . Custom PRK provides an additional level of data about your vision requirements using wavefront technology .

This additional data is then used by your PRK Surgeon to customize the PRK laser vision correction procedure to your individual vision requirements . <p> The actual PRK procedure process is performed the same way in both conventional PRK and Custom PRK . Conventional PRK is an excellent choice for many patients . <p> Your doctor will recommend which procedure is best for you based on your visual requirement ; they will help you to determine if you could benefit from the higher level of customization that Custom PRK may provide . <p> The PRK Procedure <p> For the PRK laser vision correction procedure , no scalpels are used and no incisions are made .

Deeper cell layers remain virtually untouched . <p> The PRK laser vision correction process is completed in approximately 30 to 60 seconds , and immediately afterwards , a clear bandage contact lens is placed on the cornea to protect it . Additional eye drops are applied . Since a layer about as slender as a human hair is typically removed , the cornea should maintain its original strength . <p> Often , only one eye is treated per surgery day , although your surgeon may decide to do both of your eyes on the same day . <p> PRK Recovery : After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eye may feel irritation or a foreign body sensation for a few days , but this discomfort can usually be effectively managed with medication . <p> With PRK , prescription eye drops are used for several months following the procedure . <p> Post-operatively , PRK patients are placed on antibiotic drops , along with anti-inflammatory agents to promote comfort and reduce swelling . PRK patients are also fitted with a bandage contact lens to improve their comfort while their eye is healing . Once the epithelium is healed , usually on the second or third post-operative day , your doctor removes the bandage contact lens . <p> To complete the healing process , PRK patients use steroid anti-inflammatory drops for approximately two months under the direct supervision of your eye doctor .

The cost of replacing tenured employees is 50% or more of a persons salary , according to the AARP Employer Resource Center . So , how can companies retain these employees when their healthcare plans are downsized or out-of-pocket costs go up ?

@@71418212 @118212/ <h> School-Age Kids Need More Than Vision Screenings <p> Ten million school children in America have vision conditions that can impact learning . And , many parents may be relying on vision screenings in school to check for eye problems . But as Michael McQuillan , OD , FCOVD shares that while those screenings are good , they 're not good enough . We talked with the VSP doctor and 27-year optometric veteran to get his take on screenings versus complete eye exams . <h> VSP : So what is a school vision screening ? <p> Dr. McQuillan : Usually a school nurse is responsible . The main point of the screening is to check distance vision-how well the child can read a chart from 20 feet . But near vision is n't tested in the screening . There might also be a color-vision test for kindergarten boys because they 're more likely to have color blindness . Its pretty basic stuff . <h> VSP : What kind of things can a screening overlook ? <p> Dr. McQuillan : Unfortunately , they can overlook plenty of problems . I 'd say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to miss . Remember , the exam is checking only for distance visual sharpness - the classic blackboard-friendly " 20-20 vision " - and not for other conditions . A child could easily pass the vision screening , but not be able to see well enough to read a book . <h> VSP : What are the most common problems that go unnoticed ? <p> Dr. McQuillan : The most common is a problem with eye coordination . Just like some kids are " clumsy , " eyes can be clumsy too . The problem is called " binocular vision dysfunction , " and it frequently wont show up in a screening . It can cause reading problems . Farsightedness , where you cant see up close , is also missed a lot in screenings . <p> Another condition Ive occasionally treated , after it was previously overlooked during a screening , is amblyopia , or " lazy eye . " This is where one eye wanders and does n't  join the other eye in focusing . In return , the brain learns to ignore the visual input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the problem is n't addressed . <h> VSP : What can be the results of missed conditions in screening ? <p> Dr. McQuillan : Its really pretty simple : kids who do n't  see well , do n't  learn well . If a child is having problems in the classroom , rule one is get them to an eye doctor for a complete eye exam . I cant tell you how many times I 've diagnosed a condition that was missed in a screening , and resulted in negative results in the classroom . <h> VSP : Any final advice for parents out there ? <p> Dr. McQuillan : A yearly eye exam in children is a must . Their eyes can change so quickly , and before you know it , their performance in school can suffer . The good news is that most conditions can be easily corrected , once they 're detected . <p> Do n't  rely on school vision screenings to keep your childs vision healthy . Make annual trips to the eye doctor just as important as yearly medical checkups . Find a VSP eye doctor who specializes in treating young children today .

Getting contacts from an eye care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to go , not through mail order . " <p> Dr. Christensen breaks down the road to contact lenses into three easy steps . <p> Step 1 <p> " At the first appointment , the patient receives a contact lens evaluation designed especially for those who are switching to contacts . Unlike the annual routine eye exam we recommend for all patients , a contact lens exam focuses mainly on eye-health issues related to contacts . Once that evaluation is completed , the doctor will find a lens with exactly the right amount of curve , thickness and diameter for the patients particular vision needs . " <p> Step 2 <p> " The second step involves a careful fitting of the lens to the eye , along with detailed instructions to the patient on cleaning , storing and handling of contacts .

" This visit is really important , " says Dr. Christensen , " because it gives the doctor a chance to see how the patients eyes are responding to the contacts . During this second appointment , the doctor will determine how well the lens fits the surface of the eye and whether or not its causing any irritation . The additional visit also allows the doctor to review care and cleaning of the lenses . This is helpful because it helps reduce the risk that the lens-wearer may accidentally infect the contacts with bacteria during usage or storage . <p> " Its important to prevent such infections , which can range from mild cases of pinkeye to more serious problems that may actually threaten your eyesight .

@@71418260 @118260/ <h> Getting Kids Ready for Their Eye Doctor Visit <p> For young children , a visit to see the eye doctor does n't  have to be scary . Parents who prepare their children for eye exams can make all the difference . With the right readiness , an eye exam can be an experience that 's exciting and fun . <p> VSP eye doctor Jeanie Washington , OD , of Chicago , IL , recommends that parents make time to sit down with their children and talk about the upcoming appointment . " Parents should talk to their children about annual eye exams , " she says . " Explain to them , We need to visit the eye doctor so that she can check your eyes . This way we can make sure that you see well and your eyes are healthy . " <p> According to Dr. Washington , there are some specific techniques parents can use to ensure kids have a positive eye exam experience : <p> Do your homework . When looking for an eye doctor for your child , focus on phrases like " family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out the practice before you take your little one . Is it kid-friendly ? Is there a play zone ? Do the doctor and staff smile and seem friendly ? What 's their stock of childrens eyewear like ? A little pre-work is always a good idea . <p> Tell them a story . Not from a book , but in your own words . Just take some time to explain in simple terms what the exam will be like from the eye chart to other tests . Let your child know that he or she will be asked to look at pictures , letters or shapes , and like a game , be asked to name what each object is . If you 've done your homework ( see step 1 ) , play up the fun aspects of the office too . <p> Give them a " virtual tour . " Many optometrists have websites ; if the optometrist provides images or videos of the office and exam room , you might have your child log on and get to know the practice . <p> Bring a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feeling speechless all those questions and concerns suddenly fly out the window . So take some time before the appointment to write down anything you 've noticed about your childs vision squinting , headaches and other health notes . This information will help the doctor know what to look for . <p> Give choices . Eye doctors know if you let a child choose their glasses , they 're more likely to wear them . But handle the choices carefully . You might even want to pre-select a range of styles you 'd be comfortable with and let your little one choose from that bunch . <p> Keep your cool . If you 're not hot on the eyewear choices your child has made , try redirecting or offering other choices , rather than getting upset . Your child senses your frustration , and will probably react in kind . Keep it fun , upbeat . <p> Explain the doctors orders . Most kids want to do the right thing , so make sure they understand their role in following through on their eyewear responsibilities . Show them how to clean their lenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn to the World Wide Web . There you can find printable games , activities and stickers that help prepare your preschooler for that important visit with the eye doctor .

Since VSP doctors can detect signs of chronic conditions ( like diabetes , hypertension , and high cholesterol ) , affected members can begin treatment/prevention early . This preserves the members health and saves the employer in future healthcare costs . <p> Affordability of Premium " Do n't  sell four plans on a spreadsheet with costs , like you would a health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only an issue in the absence of value .

" <p> " I want to sell my clients the best , " Tibbs concludes . " After years of selling , I have n't had a single Signature Plan client who asked to reduce their benefit . "

@@71418324 @118324/ <h> What 's Astigmatism ? <p> Most eyes are n't  perfect . Even if you think you have 20/20 vision , its pretty typical to have another condition . But it could be so minor you might not even notice it . Its called astigmatism and often goes hand-in-hand with other vision problems , like nearsightedness or farsightedness . Like these well-known vision conditions , astigmatism is very treatable . <p> What exactly is astigmatism ? Well , in a perfectly-shaped eye , the cornea , or surface layer , is a sphere , like a baseball . It allows light to enter your eyes at the right angle and focus just so on the retina . That means your vision is sharp and crisp . But with astigmatism , the corneas shape is more like a football than a baseball . This irregularity makes the light rays focus on two points on the retina , not one . This causes blurry , distorted vision . <p> " Most people have some degree of astigmatism , " says Randall Fuerst , OD , a VSP doctor in Sacramento , California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even realize you have it . " At the other end of the scale , severe astigmatism is most definitely noticeable , causing blurred vision , headaches and sometimes eye fatigue . <h> Is Astigmatism Correctable ? <p> Whether you have mild or severe astigmatism , its completely correctable . <p> For mild cases , you probably wont need a prescription . Glasses or contact lenses are the ticket for more noticeable cases of astigmatism . " Another option is vision correction surgery , " says Dr. Fuerst , " which can work very well in correcting astigmatism . " <p> Your eye doctor can detect astigmatism with the same tests used for detecting farsightedness and nearsightedness .
