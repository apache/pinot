@@59195014 @8195014/ <p> Choosing your equipment is not only fun , but can also mean the difference between having a good adventure , and having one go sour . Often new players do n't  realize how important their equipment really is , this is generally because they have n't experience all the nuances of the game , or some of the things that a wily Dungeon Master can throw their way . Even my own players fail to ask what equipment to choose , which leads to a good chuckle from me sometimes . Let 's face it . It is n't always easy to choose your PCs stuff . Often players will just choose a few items , and leave out the most important things ! This being the case most often with new players , I decided to write this article to see if I could help a bit . In here , I hope to provide a list of standard equipment that you should never be without , give some useful tips on choosing " special " items , and give you a couple of veteran " tricks . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were not well defined , or are difficult to locate . <p> All of the information contained herein came strictly from the 1st edition rules , specifically from the PHB , DMG , UA , WG , and DG . My researches into theses subjects delved even further than that though , since the information was so scattered , or non-existent ! I even found myself perusing Dragon magazine articles , the second edition books , ( which differ significantly I might add , particularly where encumbrance is involve . IF you 're curious just compare the strength charts between 1st &amp; 2nd editions ) , and also from the cover of the player character sheets released in the 1980s . I sifted through all this data with an eye on reality , before I even began to engage my calculator . I found the bulk density of Gold , made some calculations , conferred with a fellow engineer , and started writing . Specifically this had to do with the sizes , I used for small sacks , large sacks , and backpacks , and I found later after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite nicely with what little is stated in the original books . The things I found have cleared up several gray areas in my own game , and I hope the data contained herein will help some of you too ! <p> In the beginning . <p> You should always try to choose your characters equipment based on several criteria . Your DM will nearly always allow you to be in a place to make purchases from the various shops , and vendors . Before picking up your stuff , though , you should spend some time gathering as much information as you can . You should know where you 're going , and try figure out what type of creatures you 're likely to be facing . You should pay close attention to the weather , and know what the weather is going to be like wherever it is you 're going . Pay very close attention to this ! If you 're going to a desert area , then you need to make sure you carry extra water for you , and your mount , or you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food too ! If you 're going someplace cold , then make sure you carry a winter cloak , extra blankets , boots , water , ( even though you can potentially melt snow ! ) , and maybe even some extra firewood in case there is n't any nearby , or the wood is frozen . If you do n't take these things into consideration , and do the " little things " , then things will go hard for you later . Believe me , many DMs enjoy making life difficult for players that do n't  prepare . Always know how far you have to go too , because if you do n't  you may run out of food , or water , and could find yourself walking ! As far as monsters go , if you know you are going to meet lycanthropes , then adjust your equipment accordingly ! Buy Holy water , wolfs bane , silver weapons , or seek magical items , which you expect will affect the creature(s) in question . Do n't  forget scrolls for protection , deaths door , or resurrection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be prepared ! You should always purchase a few healing potions at the very least ! Your cleric is n't going to be right beside you every second ! Besides , why should the cleric or druid have to pay for all the healing potions ? What if your cleric dies ? Surely you know the Gods do n't  always answer prayers ! If you do n't  know what is effective against certain creatures then ask other PCs , clergymen , sages , magic users or even shopkeepers ! Often benign information can come from the strangest places ! Being prepared will leave you with a lot less trouble and who knows might even save your neck some time ! <p> You have to have a place to carry all those items , right ? Right ! So to start with , the first thing you have to consider is the strength of your character . In first edition , all weights and volumes are combined together , and this is called encumbrance . Encumbrance is a major part of knowing how much weight ( and volume ) your character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how much you can carry , before you can carry it ! Strength is the prime requisite that helps determine how much you are allowed to lug around . On page 9of the PHB ( Players Hand Book ) is the strength attribute chart . If you peruse it , you 'll see a column titled weight allowance . Weight allowance is always measured in gold pieces . Note that anytime weight is mentioned , you keep in mind that 10 g.p. are equivalent to 1 pound . The strength chart shows basically that the higher your strength , the more you can carry . Conversely , the weaker you are , the less you can carry . Also there 's a portion of this chart that says that you can carry the " normal " amount . What is the normal amount ? Well , for a fellow with an average strength of 8-11 , it references 500 g.p ( 50 lbs ) as being the average amount you can carry , without suffering any encumbrance penalties . If you look at the bottom of pg . 225 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left side of the page , you 'll see that there 's a note that says the maximum weight an average person can carry is 1500 g.p. ( 150 lbs ) with full movement &amp; encumbrance penalties ! This person can barely move . The number in the strength chart is to be added to or subtracted from the base ( 500g.p. or 50 lbs ) and this will give you your min/max scores . For instance , a PC with 17 strength has a carrying capacity of 1000 g.p. ( 100 lbs ) without suffering any encumbrance penalties , and his total maximum is 2000 g.p. ( 200 lbs ) One other thing to remember it to exclude from total encumbrance are the following items : clothing worn , material components ( as long as they 're not too bulky ! ) , thieves tools , and even helms ( up to the size of a great helm ) . These things are not to be included while figuring up your encumbrance and while you can carry more than your minimum , if you want to make a fast getaway from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then youd better consider dropping something quick ! So , this all being said , you really have to keep a sharp eye on the weight of what all you 're carrying , and it also makes it even more important to look for and obtain items such as bags of holding , Hewards Handy Haversack , etc . <p> Your backpack , how much it can contain , its appearance , special features , and its material of construction become even more important when you become fully aware of the effects of encumbrance . Getting the data , so you that know more about your backpack is n't very easy either ! I searched extensively through the 1st edition rules and found nothing that gives the amount a backpack can carry , its volume , or what its even comprised of ! I kind of like this in a way , because every backpack I ever saw was different anyway ! That leaves it up to the Dungeon Master ( and/or his players ) to decide what it is and how to make it fit in . If you are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has n't  already ! In the case of a backpack for example , it may hold 750 gold pieces , but it is not overly full , and there is still space inside it . It might be on the point of ripping out the seams ! In other words , if you do n't  know how big your backpack is by volume , then you really do n't  know how much it holds ! In this case , for the sake of ease , I 'll describe what I consider to be a " standard " backpack . I 've used this same description in my games for the last 20 years . I do n't  generally utilize small , medium or large backpacks , because these are things that should be purchased directly from a leather worker , if they are wanted . I consider a backpack to be one of those things that 's specifically designed to be carried by a normal or average person , ( with a base Strength 10 ) . Remember your min/max encumbrance ? This being the case , in my game , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum . Note that this number also includes the volume , and that is important ! Its not too likely that the average person living in medieval times would be carrying 750 g.p. inside a backpack anyhow , much less be able to carry it ! However a person could carry a few potions , a small hand axe , pitons , lantern , or other items that may not weigh much but are bulky , weigh little , or do take up quite a bit of space without weighing much . You 'll need to consult your Dungeon Master to confirm exactly what your backpack can hold , as many items are quite bulky , may take up space that has not been considered . He should be able to tell you exactly what you can put in your backpack . To that end , I 've detailed the area of the standard backpack in a list below as well as some other items that I thought might be handy as a quick reference . <p> When you design or purchase a backpack , consider its material of construction carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth , others use leather . Consult your DM regarding this because as you adventure , you 'll find that leather is much more sturdy than cloth , and it can take the outside elements much better . Technically , leather just gets a better saving throw than cloth does . Take advantage of this . There are also many different types of leather , such as alligator skin , cowhide , dragon hide , etc. and this too may help your saving throws . Another consideration is what features the backpack has . For instance , does it have external straps , hooks , or external pockets ? If so , that 's to your advantage . Remember you need a place to put your shield , crossbow , rope , etc , if you want to get to them quickly . In a melee , it can take anywhere from 5-10 segments justto get intoyour backpack , and find what your looking for ! Now imagine your crossbow buried beneath potions , gold , bed-roll , extra clothes , or even tangled up in your rope ! Wouldnt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rummaging around in your backpack ? How much would your companions laugh ? Make sure to get information from your DM . Sorry I got a bit carried away , so now back to my standard backpack . Mine are always comprised of sturdy , thick bulls hide to resist the elements . Its also been treated with waterproof , non-flammable oil . Each one has 2 ( 12 " x 1 " long ) leather straps , 2 " brass rings , or hooks on each side , bottom , and on top . There 's also a strap ( or again a hook ) just below the two brass buckles , specifically designed for holding a shield or lantern . It also has a small leather loop , or ring on the very top so it can easily be hung on Milords coat rack , or Sea Biscuits saddle horn . Colors are optional . One last word about backpacks , what you put into one , a good thief , or sneaky old hobgoblin can take out ! Many veteran adventurers go out of their way to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and many other means can be purchased if an imaginative fellow looks or asks around . All I can say to this is , be inventive its more fun , and oh yeah , just because that dead fellows lying there beside the road , does n't  mean you can just go up and ransack his backpack ! You may find yourself standing in the nearest local jail cell sharing it with the town drunk , or wishing that fireball had n't  gone off ! <p> There are some other places where you can carry goods . I want to go over a few things first though to set up a kind of basis for some basic items . I 'm not changing anything , only doing a bit of clarification . Note that there might be some things you or your DM disagree with . Starting out , it is clear that one gold piece equals 1/10th pound . This is mentioned several places throughout the books . However no mention is made of how large , or small a gold piece is ! For all intents and purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diameter and 1/8th inch thick since gold is quite heavy in its pure form . Gold weighs approximately 1210 pounds a cubic foot , in other words a block of gold 1 foot by 1 foot by 1 foot would weigh roughly 1210 lbs ! That said , a small sack would be 8 in. diameter and 12 in. tall and would hold exactly 112 gold pieces , a large sack would be 24 in. diameter and 36 inches tall , and it would hold exactly 336 gold pieces . This is as close as I could get to the wide ranges of numbers in first edition while maintaining the size of the gold piece . To further clarify , if one were to fill a bag to this extent it would be on the verge of ripping . Considering the density of pure gold , ( remember that in medieval times there were very few pockets of pure gold and there were few methods of removing the impurities , unlike there are today ) . For the record , based on the coin size above I say a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g.p. maximum . Following these figures , I have included a small list below of common items , their capacity in pounds , and gold pieces , as well as the area of each . Note : Again just because an item will hold the amount of weight , does not mean it will fit inside it ! For instance the weight of a quarterstaff is 2 g.p and a small sack is capable of holding 2 g.p. easily , however the staff is much too long to go into the sack ! Another rule of mine is that if the weight exceeds the maximum amount an object can hold , then the seams will rip , the object will become unwieldy ( thus severely penalizing movement &amp; dexterity ) , will cause faster exhaustion , will cause the straps to break , material to tear , and will cause severe , moderate or mild chafing , caused by straps or strings . DMs are encouraged to use these , or any other problems they see fit when excessive weights are being handled . I encourage you to use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dimensions <p> In pounds <p> Gold Pieces <p> WEIGHT X HEIGHT X THICKNESS <p> Backpack <p> 75 lbs . <p> 750* <p> 16 " W X 18 " H X 12 " T <p> Belt pouch , large <p> 3 lbs <p> 30 <p> 10 " W X 5 " H X 8 " T <p> Belt pouch , small <p> 2 lbs <p> 20 <p> 6 " W X 4 " H X 6 " T <p> Sack , large <p> 30 lbs . <p> 300 <p> 24 " dia .

I generally consider that each set of saddlebags can carry at the very least as much as a backpack , and every horse should have a set . A pannier is used with stronger pack animals such as mules . Basically these are frames that fit comfortably over the mules back , so that large leather sacks , wooden boxes or baskets can be tied and carried with the contents safe . Each single pannier such as one used for a mule can carry up to 2000 g.p. without the mule being discomforted , or encumbered ! The maximum weight for a mule is a whopping 7500 g.p , though the mule will fight and not want to move ! At this weight it most certainly would have some movement penalties ! Since a large sack can hold 300 gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of these could easily be tied to your mule , or horse unless your riding beast is wearing heavy barding , or you had no rope to tie it on with . I suggest you carry your horses food and water , as well as any bulky items in your saddlebags . Carry the things you wont need in the dungeon , but might otherwise be of use ! <p> Usually , there are some standard items I place in every backpack . I use this same list if a character needs items really quickly , or for an NPC whenever I DM . These items should always be carried and include : <p> water skin <p> Iron rations for 2 weeks <p> 6 torches ( or lantern ) <p> Flint , steel , and tinderbox <p> 2 small sacks , ( for treasure ) <p> Sharpening stone , ( For fighters &amp; thieves only ! ) <p> Oil for armor , and weapons , ( For fighters &amp; thieves only ! ) <p> Lantern oil . <p> Also I include 2 healing potions , or more whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Remember these are just basic necessities , and should never be overlooked anytime you adventure . If you 're going out with less than this , then you can expect the DM to have some fun with your character ! Needless to say this might not be " fun " for you ! <p> Other things you may want to consider are personal items . Some items should be chosen because of your characters personality traits , or even class . For instance , every thief should have 2 sets of lock picks . After all what happens if one set gets broken or damaged ? What about acid for those reluctant locks , or blinding powder ? Now granted , these are not powerful items , and may be costly , but if they help just one time , or save your characters life , then what 's a few gold pieces ? Other considerations for items might come from your alignment , or even personal tastes . Take a lawful character for instance . He may decide to carry a comb , or brush , not because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus cares for his appearance . The same character might also choose to carry a small silver cup , plate and spoon , which would be mighty useful at supper when you camp ! Not to mention the fact that this character would likely be quite civilized , and such a fellow would never consider eating with his fingers when not appropriate ! The small items like these only help to further establish your PC , and help give him character ! They also provide some fun role-playing opportunities . Now that you see this , use your imagination and see what other things you can come up with ! Just remember not to overload yourself . To keep from doing this , write down the minimum and maximum weight you can carry next to strength or someplace near your backpack where its visible ! 
@@59195018 @8195018/ <p> The human-like races of dwarfs and gnomes appear in most FRPG , are treated similarly , and so they are the subjects chosen for this essay . Much of what follows likely applies to some degree to most of the various human-like/humanoid races of other sort that are likewise fodder for the role-playing game . Perhaps at some future time I 'll visit those sorts too . For now , though , let us consider the two races in question . <p> Aside from body build , both dwarfs and gnomes are treated pretty much the same in the RPG . That is , the two races are basically treated as underground dwelling . Indeed , gnomes should be mostly subterranean , as dwarfs are generally treated , considering their mythological roots as creatures of elemental earth , dwellers in mines and caves . Their habitat , when compared with their possessions and diet , then brings to mind a number of questions . Have you ever thought about how these underground races get the things they need , are sometimes renowned for , while living in caves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had ? Here are those questions that can not fail to spring to mind in this regard . Note the multiple choices are included in levity . <p> What do dwarfs wear other than metal armor ? <p> Mostly leather &amp; furs <p> Mostly woolens <p> Other sorts of normal cloth <p> Spidersilk garments <p> Woven grass apparel <p> other <p> What do gnomes wear other than metal armor ? <p> Mostly leather &amp; furs <p> Mostly woolens <p> Other sorts of normal cloth <p> Spidersilk garments <p> Wood fiber apparel <p> other <p> What do dwarfs eat ? <p> Cheese <p> Fungi <p> Meat <p> Roots <p> Vegetables <p> other <p> What do gnomes eat ? <p> Berries &amp; fruit <p> Fungi <p> Meat <p> Roots <p> Vegetables <p> other <p> What do dwarfs drink ? <p> Ale <p> Beet wine <p> Beer <p> Mead <p> Water <p> other <p> What do gnomes drink ? <p> Ale <p> Berry wine <p> Beer <p> Mead <p> Water <p> other <p> Wearing apparel of metal sort seems pretty normal for both dwarfs and gnomes , and the addition of leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain hides from hunting forays . As for the rest , well , ahem ! Neither race could logically raise neither crops nor flocks to provide the basic materials needed for cloth . To gain cotton , linen , and wool , considerable trade with humans will be necessary . Do you envisage dwarfs or gnomes with great " farms " where huge spiders are kept , their webs gathered of weaving into cloth ? Not too likely , that . So as depicted , both races perforce interact on at least a commercial basis with humans so as to obtain their fabrics and likely some of their leather and furs as well , because subterranean animalia wont provide the whole of their wants and needs in this regard . <p> Diet of both dwarfs and gnomes is likewise limited by their habitat . Of course these races could enjoy masses of grubs , worms , underground fauna of various ( generally revolting ) sort garnished with roots and fungi . This does n't  meet the " traditional " depictions , however . Yes , both races likely enjoy root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other sorts of vegetation that grows only in the sunlight . Once again , this means that dwarfs and gnomes perforce trade with humans and their ilk that dwell in the light world . <p> Drink underscores the matter . Ale and beer are made from fermented grain and hops . Mead is made from the fermentation of honey , that substance being the product of bees gathering nectar from flowers . Wine is made from grapes , other fruit or berries , grain or vegetables . As ale , beer , and stout are renowned as the drinks of choice for dwarfs , and usually for gnomes too , this means that a most active trade in at least the vegetable ingredients to brew such drink , and of course the wood from which the barrels that hold the end product , is conducted between the subterranean folk and the men above . <p> Without the assumption of such commerce between dwarfs and gnomes with human suppliers , we must either have considerable numbers of agrarian dwarfs and gnomes , or alter their dress and what they eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not according to the way that race is typically depicted in the FRPG . The " ilf " race of the LEJENDARY ADVENTURE game system will indeed serve perfectly in that roll . That 's because when I was developing the " Alfar " peoples for the games environment the need for exchange of such goods was borne in mind . <p> What do dwarfs and gnomes trade for the various products coming from humans and other surface dwellers ? That 's a very easy matter . Here is a list I propose as being the major materials that would be supplied to humans in return for their goods : <p> Building stone <p> Dressing/ornamental stone ( alabaster , malachite , marble , onyx , etc . ) <p> Salt <p> Worked metal itemsiron ware <p> Worked metal itemssteel tools and weapons <p> Stone ware and sculpted items <p> Common ore pigs and ingots ( iron , lead , tin , zinc ) <p> Precious ore ingots ( aluminum , copper , nickel ) <p> Rare ores ( magnesium , titanium ) <p> Other minerals ( phosphorus , potassium , sodium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fancy and semi-precious stones <p> ( Gold and precious stones will generally be reserved to personal use ) <p> The number of things dwarfs and gnomes can supply that are in demand by surface-dwelling humans is more than ample to ensure that their own needs are fully covered . In fact , enterprising folk of this sort could become wealthy from such trade , with the trade balance being such that the subterranean-dwelling races could demand payment in gold and gems so as to draw those things back to their own realms . This is a likely event , and it would have repercussions . <p> Of course an imbalance in trade would make humans resentful , make them seek other sources for the materials they want in quantity . The imbalance and the reaction to it would then bring about some degree of hostility between dwarfs and gnomes on the one hand and humans on the other . The humans would have to turn to trade with less " wholesome " subterranean races . Some of such peoples would want payment in commodities of what will be generally unacceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and armor of human craftsmanship in order to more effectively fight against dwarfs and gnomes . <p> In the main , while amity , or at least tolerance , will be the order of the day in regards dwarfo-gnome relations with humans , there could most certainly exist areas where the races are bitter enemies , where the former races enlist the aid of malign subterranean races and creatures . Of course that will be to counter the like alliance between humans and other sorts of underground dwellers . In the LA game system , the dwarfs and gnomes might be dealing only with veshoges , allied with trollkin , trow , and huldra in fighting humans . The latter , in turn using trogs , even goblins and hobgoblins to attack and pillage their dwarf and gnome foes .

I was at a local book store on the day they received their weekly new books . I was going through the book racks selecting the latest Conan novel , the latest Heinlein novel , and I kept at it until I had seven books . There was a man doing the same thing beside me and when he was done he had the exact seven novels in his hand that I had . We got quite a laugh out of this . He , E.

So the company set out to create some D&amp;D educational products and actually did create three educational modules . However Rose was writing Endless Quest books for TSR and they were selling over 400,000 with each book . Those book bars of gold caused the education department to become the book department . We dropped the education idea in favor of concentrating 100% of the resources on creating more books . Eventually we went from just game books to true novels in the DragonLance series and those sold by the ton and the rest is history . . . <p> In 1982 Gary Gygax was ousted as CEO of TSR and sent to the US West Coast to pursue licensing opportunities and so TSR Entertainment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1983 the Dungeon &amp; Dragons Cartoon Show premiered ( and generated a lot of licensing ) and a movie deal was in the works but troubles started at home . In the sane year the company was reorganized and experienced a big series of layoffs that reduced the employees from 350 to 100 . Do you have any memories of that ? What were , in your opinion , the reasons for TSRs problems ? <p> JMW : Memories of that , I still have the mental scars from that ! I do n't  care what is in print ; Gary was never ousted from control of the company . What would happen is this . Some business decisions were made or controversial orders were given to people in the company . Many of these orders were not in the best interests of TSR . Those people who got those orders ( and no I wont say what they were ) would then go to Gary , lay out their reasons for not wanting to do those orders and Gary would countermand the orders and they would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of this and said to Gary , " Why do n't  we put you in an office in Hollywood and you can work on movie deals ? " . To Gary this sounded like a great idea because being the creative type that he was he could see a great benefit in this . He went to Hollywood . TSR got the D&amp;D Cartoon Show and there were several other positive things accomplished like the Goldman movie script . However , there were many business decisions being made back at the company that Gary couldnt undo . In 1984 the company went from 386 people to 86 people and it was a black time in TSRs history . I fell in the third of five purges with 55 others . . . <p> In 1984 Gary Gygax returned to TSR from the West Coast and was able to get back at least partial control of the company , forcing Kevin Blume to step down from the role of CEO . TSR was in a very difficult state albeit some great projects ( DragonLance and Marvel Super Heroes ) were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Vice President of Administration , Lorraine Dille Williams , the famous ( infamous ? ) Dragon Lady . One of the defining moments of TSR and of the game industry in general was the struggle between Gary Gygax and Lorraine Williams for the control of the company in 1985 that resulted in Gygaxs ousting . What were your opinions at the time ? <p> JMW : If I tell the truth about this question I will be sued into the Stone Age . So we will be moving on . . . <p> Albeit many people expressed and still express dismay and sadness for Gary Gygaxs ousting from TSR , not everybody was unhappy in seeing him go . For example Kim Mohan expressed very harsh criticism in an interview with The Gamer magazine and Don Turnbull , once head of TSR UK , made absolutely scathing comments about Gary Gygax in the very same magazine . It was and is very , very rare to see criticism or condemnation of Gary Gygax . What was the atmosphere at the company after he left ? <p> JMW : we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of us wanted the company to be successful . At the time I was made vice president of product and given a pretty free hand as to what TSR made . I 'm proud to say the company made the most money ever from my yearly product lines . Of course , many of us looked on at Garys new company and wished we worked for him . . . <p> Tell us something more about Lorraine Williams . She has been target of huge amount of criticism from fans , but various people ( for example Kim Mohan ) credit her for installing a more professional attitude at TSR and especially separating management and creative services . What kind of person she was ? Does she deserve credit for saving TSR from a possibly fatal bankruptcy ? <p> Speaking of books , one of the most interesting offerings from TSR was a Game Buyers Price Guide 1985-1986 , perhaps the very first book about game collecting . You were one of the authors of this book along Frank Mentzer and Jean B. Black . How was this project born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> JMW : Frank Mentzer had a lot of great ideas . I 'm proud to say that even as we speak he and I are partners in Eldritch Enterprises , a new RPG company along with Chris Clark and Tim Kask . Please check us out at eldritchent.com . He was running the Gen Con auction in those days and it was a huge affair selling 3,000 units over the four days . Frank set up the auction store that sold even more product without going to an auctioneer . In those days Frank was the primary auctioneer doing eight plus hours a day . Tom Wham and I would help out , but he did the bulk of everything and even today still does the Gen Con auction as one of the auctioneers . Today , he tells me they sell through over 11,000 units . So to make a long story a bit longer , Frank had this wonderful program for the auction that he did n't  create , but he did guide in its creation . The program listed every product , said a bit about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction . Jean Black and I took all of those listings that Frank gave us and turned it into a dandy book . It was to be a regular thing , but the company was in big financial trouble in those days and we did n't  have the resources to do more . . . <p> Besides D&amp;D and AD&amp;D , TSR released some licensed games and adventures , for example a Conan RPG ( in 1985 ) and a Marvel RPG ( in 1984 ) . Were they successful ? Judging from the number of releases , the Marvel Super Heroes RPG was a great seller . Was difficult acquiring such licenses and what challenges TSR had to face to produce them ? I have read that the competition for the Marvel license was fierce with ( for example ) Games Workshop and Mayfair Games pursuing it <p> JMW : You know a person could write an entire book on just this one question . I have to proudly say that I was one of the people who shouted loud and long that TSR should be into many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would like using different baits to fish . The different baits attracted different fish . The Conan and Indiana Jones games sold well , but not great . Marvel sold very well and TSR did Marvel resource books that listed characters and their gaming stats and those sold terrifically . The licenses were easy to get because we were TSR . When the biggest role-playing company goes out and says we want to do a game on your concept , most people say , " Sure where do we sign ? " While the competition was fierce the other companies werent even a quarter of the size of TSR . We had massive distribution and would show our sales figures of D&amp;D and AD&amp;D and the translations in 44 different languages and that would tip the scales in TSRs favor . . . <p> Were you involved in the design and production of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons second edition ? What were the reasons for producing a second edition of TSRs bestselling game ? Just financial ones and , according to Gary Gygax , the desire to stop paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me say I greatly respect and admire Gary Gygax . He gave me my start in gaming . However , he got royalties for second edition . I helped with first and second edition and their creation . In second edition Zeb Cook did a great job taking the game and clarifying it . The game was evolving and needed a new version because there were a lot of role-playing concepts that were developing as people played the game . I can remember having many long talks with the sales department on the subject of second edition . They greatly feared that the design department was slaying the goose that laid the golden eggs . However , I knew the design department was making a better , faster laying goose and TSR would have plenty of those golden eggs with the next version . . . <p> What were the reasons for dropping the Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons line in 1991 ( some modules were released in 1992 but they were nothing really significant ) ? Many people consider it one of the reasons for TSR problems in the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the RPGs and the game industry . Do you concur with that ? <p> JMW : The reasons were mainly financial ones . TSR did n't  have to give a royalty to Dave Arneson if no product was made for D&amp;D . . . <p> Another very important area of interest for TSR was book publishing , starting with the Endless Quest game books line , pioneering with the very first DragonLance novel , Dragons of Autumn Twilight , and then experiencing a real boom of titles , some of them not game related . For some years TSR was one of the top fiction publishers in the USA . Did TSR plan to expand aggressively in the book trade from the beginning or just reacted to a favourable reaction from the market ? <p> JMW : With the great success of the Endless Quest books TSR hit the book market at a run . Doing novels was a natural and having Margaret and Tracy as writers was a huge plus as they are both very talented writers . The book department took off like a rocket and TSR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real interest in pursuing lawsuits in the 90s . Perhaps the most famous ones were hose against Gary Gygax and GDW about their Dangerous Dimensions ( renamed Dangerous Journeys ) RPG . Designed by Gary Gygax himself , the game never had much of a chance to stand in the market and Gary Gygax always maintained that TSR lawsuits had the scope to destroy him as a possible competitor . When GDW and TSR reached an agreement and the entire DJ stock was moved to the TSR warehouse in 1994 , the game de facto completely disappeared . What were , as far as you may recall , TSRs true reasons for suing GDW and Gary Gygax ? Was he right ? <p> JMW : When a company like TSR has a valuable concept like AD&amp;D is needs to protect that concept from those who would use the idea and make their own products . The lawsuit against Gary was a simple matter of Gary using too many of his AD&amp;D ideas in the Dangerous Journeys game . He lost because he was guilty . TSR sent out many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright of AD&amp;D . The company did n't  like the expense of such suits , but they liked the idea of losing the rights to the brand name even less . I 'm quite proud to say I was often the expert witness in such actions . The company never , ever went after a competitor to hurt or quest for revenge . . . <p> Between 1993 and 1996 TSR experienced another big series of financial problems because , besides the hefty sums involved in the two lawsuits I mentioned before ( Gary Gygax noted that perhaps they helped to bring TSR to its knees with no small amount of satisfaction ) , the Magic phenomenon hit the game industry like a giant meteor ( in Italy the RPG market was , in effect , annihilated ) , the Dragon Dice collectible dice game was a flop ( albeit after a promising start ) , there were too many AD&amp;D settings to choose from ( so having TSR competing with itself , companies should hate that ) and TSR faced a multi million bill from Random House for unsold books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You , an insider , do you concur with this analysis ? What was the situation at TSR at the time ? <p> JMW : let me correct you in several areas . Magic did indeed kill the RPG industry just like TSR and D&amp;D killed the war gaming industry in the last 70s . Dragon Dice , an idea I started and Lester Smith designed made $30,000,000 in its first year . I would n't call that a flop . There were never too many AD&amp;D settings . Each setting had its fan following and sold just fine . For example , Ravenloft appealed to the horror fans while DragonLance had a huge female following . Those products did not compete with themselves in my mind . On the other hand , TSR did publish too many novels and Random House was owed a huge debt . I partially blame myself for the swirling end of TSR . The company owned the teen and up market . In those days market studies revealed that 995 of the world population new the term D&amp;D . There was huge money to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magic grabbed all of those people . I should have had the company produce a younger version of D&amp;D or AD&amp;D . I consider it one of my black marks in that I did n't  think of that . Oh well . . . <p> Tell us something about the Spellfire game . Legend has it was designed in a week end after the first design was rejected because it was too similar to Magic . Is this true ? Why TSR went for already seen art ( sometimes used in a terrible way ) , choosing not to produce anything new ? Perhaps TSR was in a hurry to bring the product to the market ? <p> JMW : so , Magic the Gathering was out in the market and gathering a following and a portion of the hobby market share . I was instantly all over it saying TSR needed to come out with our own collectible card game . She who will not be named ( and thus not able to sue me into the Stone Age ) always claimed Magic was a flash in the pan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given the task of designing a competing game . I brought together some of the smartest designers at TSR : Steve Winter , Zeb Cook , and Tim Brown . We worked on the game together . We had all the marvelous TSR art to use . We had the many interesting campaign worlds to draw from . I made sure we purposely designed an easy game that was nothing like Magic the Gathering , mainly because they now had big lawyers as good as TSRs . It was never rejected in the first blush of design because I knew all about Magic and had played it many times . Again the game made the company a huge profit . However , it was n't until the photograph cards in the Ravenloft expansion that the game really took off . Those ultra rare cards were all photographs of fantasy like things and people loved them . First of all you could instantly tell the photo card was ultra rare by looking at it ( unlike Magic ) . Second of all we made sure they were useful cards that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rocket . However I was n't allowed to support the game like Wizards was supporting their excellent Magic game . They were doing great tournaments and lots of things to attract the attention of the hobby industry . A certain unnamed someone would n't let me do the same thing . TSR was sold while Spellfire was still doing well . Imagine everyones surprise ( sarcasm here ) when the game was shut down by the new owners of the company . On the subject of reused art , TSR had the best fantasy artist in the world working for them . There was a great deal of jealously when the game first came out . Why would I as a designer want not use the hundreds and hundreds of great pieces of art for the game ? I did n't  have to use new art , and Wizards did and they were jealous of that fact and spread a rumor that using old art was bad ? That 's a lot like saying I have the Mona Lisa hanging on my wall . Oh its an old painting maybe I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( sarcasm again ) . . . <p> One of the things I always wondered about is TSR refusal to grant licenses to Wizards of the Coast to use D&amp;D and AD&amp;D properties in any way or form . Considering Magics huge success , D&amp;D and AD&amp;D themed expansion sets or compatible games would have been big sellers and netted TSR a lot of money in royalties . Perhaps some Magic players could have been intrigued enough to give TSR RPGs a try Wizards of the Coasts Peter Adkinson told me he was really , really eager to reach a deal with TSR . Why TSR was so stubborn in refusing any deals ? <p> JMW : why would TSR or any company give millions of dollars in potential sales to a company that was a direct competitor ? <p> Anyway , in 1996 TSR crisis had reached a fatal point . According again to the Designers &amp; Dragons book , you left the company " over disagreements about how the crisis was handled " in December 1996 . You were Vice President of Creative Services . What exactly were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire 20 people from my department . It was my thinking that the department that I had groomed was perfect and very capable of making TSR millions of dollars . At that time TSR had just made the most money it ever had in $44,000,000 gross dollars . I pointed out that if they wanted to get rid of people they should n't be getting rid of the people who where were spinning straw into gold bars . I was told my opinion on the matter wasnt wanted . I tried for several weeks to talk them out of this . Finally , I could n't ethically fire people who in my opinion were doing excellent work . I quit . I went from a huge salary to no salary and the Ward household struggled and is still struggling , but my conscious is clear on that topic . . . <p> What was you reaction when TSR was acquired by Wizards of the Coast ? Did they contact you after the purchase ? <p> JMW : Wizards was kind enough to interview me after they bought TSR . I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on moving everyone out to the West Coast . I did some work for them freelance , but did n't  find that very satisfying . I just made it my policy to never do anything with them again . Peter and I did n't  see eye to eye on things and so I looked elsewhere for work . . . <p> I 'm pretty sure you read Ryan Dancey declaration about TSR failure in listening to its fans . When he visited TSR and got ( of course ) access to any area or files at the company , he lamented the " gaping hole " he found about consumer profiling , surveys and feedback . Do you share his opinions about TSR absolute lack of interest in understanding whom its fans were and in listening to them ? <p> JMW : again not wanting to bad mouth mr . Dancey , but his statement is ridiculous . The RPGA was created to pay attention to what the fans wanted . TSR had millions of consumer research cards telling us what they wanted and I bet I personally read over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . The company sent out its designers and editors to fifty plus conventions a year to hear what the fans wanted . TSR paid over a million is scientific marketing studies on our consumers and I read every one of those reports . To say the company did n't  care about listening to the fans is preposterous . I always made sure I knew exactly who the fans were and what they wanted . . . <p> I have read in your Wikipedia biography that from 2000 to 2005 you were president of Fast Forward Entertainment . How and why was this company launched ? <p> JMW : Tim Brown had the great idea that Lester Smith and I should start our own company . We intended to produce RPG product and started with three fantasy modules . They sold well and we went from there . We produced adventures and lots of source books . In the beginning the sales were in the 5,000 plus category . However the bottom was falling out of the RPG market as Magic grabbed more and more of the market share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be profitable and we had to shut our doors . . . <p> FFE was a quite prolific publisher , specializing in d20 products , but it released a new version of Metamorphosis Alpha . In 2003 however the company was forced to recall four books and destroy them due to violation of the OGL and d20 licenses . Were such violations a factor in the FFE closing doors or the d20 glut was the main reason ? <p> JMW : Nope . . . <p> What is your opinion about the gaming market at the moment , especially the tabletop RPG one ? <p> JMW : few hobby companies these days can just sell role-playing products and survive . Its necessary to diversify and try to get into several markets . That 's one of the reasons Eldritch Enterprises created the Heroes &amp; Magic fantasy anthology . The company plans on doing more novels , board games , and card games in the near future , as well as our old school role-playing product . I still believe that " the story is the thing " in RPGs . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  going to be successful . Many of todays games and certainly the 800 pound gorilla that is still going strong do n't  have a solid story in their game products . That 's a mistake my new company is n't making . . . <p> JMW : Just let me say finally , that all of my statements above are given honestly as seen through the eyes of James M. Ward . Some people might not agree with some of my memories , but the above are my memories ...

@@59195355 @8195355/ <p> First and foremost , roleplaying as about having fun . That 's what we have aimed for in the new RPG . The system is " rules lite , " skill based , facilitates any style of play or feature focus-from hack &amp; slash to storytelling-covering and open to any and all in between . A story one new Lejend Master related to us about his first game session speaks well for how the system works . He was using the Lejendary Road adventure module , a series of events that takes the players from mundane persons to LA game Avatars through the course of the scenarios presented in the work . One of the group was adamant . He would not participate , for only D&amp;D was of interest . However , he monitored the session , " just to see how badly it went . " In short order the hold-out was roleplaying a kobold Avatar , because he decided he was bored just watching , might have a little fun being disruptive . About an hour later the kobold was the " life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LM , and fellows . To make a long story short , at the conclusion of the session this fellow allowed that perhaps the LEJENDARY ADVENTURE game was okay for a change of pace . Quite so ! <p> Of course we hope to make it the main RPG played by a group . Being rules-lite , it is easy for the LM to manage . Players have an easy time creating their Avatars from only three main stats , equipping them , understanding the mechanics , so they can get on with the game . The wide variety of non-human Avatar choices-13 total-none of which are quite like those in any other FRPG make selection of such a character interesting and fresh . Rules lawyers are distraught as there so little ground for them to argue from that they are virtually lost . There are just enough rules in the work to empower the Lejend Master , enable the players to know how things work , but none for encumbering play or complicating it . Generally , when a roll is needed , d% covers it . The Abilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a percentile score . A human Avatar has five Abilities , Alfar ( non-human ) one six or in one case seven . It is not merely skill-based , but skills are bundled to make them broad and checks against them less frequently required . When necessary , one LA game " Ability " likely serves where most other systems would require several skills , and dice rolls too . Again the player has a choice in regards to how skills are selected . If an archetype sort of character is desired , the player chooses an Order , an Elementalist for example , thus having initial Abilities decreed , nit selected . The player may choose to have only the first required Ability for an Order , or all , however . Flexibility ! For complete freedom , the player can opt to create an Unordered Avatar and choose whatever Abilities seem best . <p> The adventure is the thing , and with the LA game system it takes only a little time to create an Avatar and get to the play part of things . To facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Merits " for use of Abilities and for participation in the adventure . Killing and accumulation of wealth are not primary measures of advancement . For example , fighting and defeating some creature will likely earn only a few Ability Specific Merits , say in Weapons other Abilities used in the process . Meantime , an hour of good play earns the Avatar 100 General Merits that can be applies to Ability increase , the learning of a new Ability , or even addition to base stats-the Avatar 's Base Ratings of Health , Precision , and Speed . Assuming a campaign that focuses mainly on roleplay , Abilities such as Arcana , Learning , Evaluation , Pretense , Scrutiny , and Urbane will used . On the other hand , is combat is the order of the day , Abilities such as Archery , Chivalry , Physique , Savagery , Tricks Unarmed Combat , and Weapons are paramount . All in between those are covered by Abilities .

Sourcebooks written but not yet in print include the LEJENDARY EARTH TM World Setting , Lejendary Pantheons , and two world settings , the Key of Sand and Maledicted Plateau . More such world area sourcebooks are in process of creation now . In addition to a sturdy LM screen , there are now several adventure modules available , more waiting to be released , and still many others being created . In all there are about a score of products ready for printing and release over the next couple of years , with design work ongoing to keep new material coming . Support extends beyond that . <p> In the spring of this year , 2001 , Hekaforge Productions will launch a monthly magazine , LEJENDS . Its initial size will be 36 pages of a full 8.5 by 11-inch proportions with little white space . Content is game-intensive , full of new material for the LA game system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and game play . I know this because I 've contributed sufficient material to fill about eight issues . Far from being the only writer , though , LEJENDS Magazine actively seeks " outside " material , and even at this early date many articles have been submitted and approved for publication . <p> Add to this the new line of fantasy adventure novels set on the LEJENDARY EARTH world , and it is clear that the game is supported to the hilt , and it is here to stay . The initial book in the new line of novels is The Eye of Glory , a fast-paced and very exciting Swords &amp; Sorcery yarn that has a lot more than action in its pages . The author , Martin Dougherty , manages to slip in character development and some surprising turns of events . The novel is available from Amazon and Barnes &amp; Noble and other online book sellers . More like it will follow . <p> Beyond all that , we plan to broaden the base of the LA game system . It was designed to accommodate genres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , Hekaforge will be releasing several core rules books and a sourcebook-adventure for the LEJENDARY ASTEROGUES TM Fantastical Science RPG .

Following that genre expansion , we will bring out and support others-science fiction , weird science , and alternate " Wild West " are being worked on , and we are interested in adding horror and other genres too later on . It is important to note that something like 90% of the core rules system translates , or will do so , exactly to each new genre . To add new vistas to the campaign neither Lejend Master nor players will have to worry about learning new rules , a few at best .

@@59195465 @8195465/ <p> As a lot of you know , Swords &amp; Wizardry is a retro-clone of 0E , although it 's not as tight as OSRIC is with 1E . The main differences are that there is only one class of saving throw , the initiative system ( there 's not one in 0E ) is rudimentary ( since everyone had to house rule this or use the CM rules , I just used a least common denominator ) and the XP bonuses are constructed differently ( but with similar results ) - for legal reasons . These core rules are a mix of the White Box classes ( only ) , the GH system of hit dice and variable damage by weapon , and spells from across the supplements . <p> In addition to the normal reasons for creating a retro clone ( **29;114;TOOLONG rules , shared brand name , preservation of rules in free format ) , Swords &amp; Wizardry is a project to re-initiate the " hobbyist " approach to OOP gaming , the idea that you can tinker from the ground up and make the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamers ( and this is not limited to modern gamers , I have seen it on OOP sites as well ) approach games like consumers .

But games used to be approached with the ASSUMPTION that the GM and players were going to hack them apart and make them fit the desired effect . The same way we 'd take rules for Napoleonic wargaming and tweak them into rules for Space Marines or 52mm green plastic army men . <p> I have spend an enormous amount of time over the last 6 months or so preparing the rulebooks ( with especial thanks to Red Priest , Finarvyn , Philotomy Jurament , and Jerry Mapes ) and building up a body of supplemental resources such as new spells , city encounters , etc ) . The intro module @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book for 0E is getting close to being done .

Most of the real work on the magazine has proceeded slowly so far , since the rules were n't up yet . Knockspell will cover all OGL fantasy retro-clones for which we receive permission to use the game 's name , and by extension it will be a magazine for 0E , 1E , and Holmes/Moldvay Basic . <p> you can also come up with something that is not only original and creative and artistic , but also maybe even decent , or moral if I can use words like that , or something that 's like basically good -Lester Bangs <p> Take your sword , man , and cut out my heart ; then squeeze it so that the blood will flow over the red stone .

I received my print copy of Swords &amp; Wizardry a couple of days ago , and I could n't be happier . Mythmere and company have put together a fantastic interpretation of the original rules . This is a project that , imo , has been long overdue in the retro-sim market , and I am happy that the niche has been filled now with a game that is tight , organized and begging to be used for some old school gaming fun .

There are some new monsters ( like , four or five ) but more will be added . If you 've got new monsters , send them to me and I 'll get them into the book . 
@@59195466 @8195466/ <p> Since Geoffrey and Grodog expressed interest in the deities of Fomalhaut , the campaign I am preparing for , I am posting a translation of the " player 's guide " document detailing some of the gods and religions the PCs may run into during their explorations . Of course , this is not a full list , since Fomalhaut 's gods , demi-gods and demon lords number in the several dozens , and there are many forgotten or dead gods as well who may still exist , but are not generally well known . This is just what I came up with for a start . <p> Fomalhaut itself is a spiritual successor of the Wilderlands , the stories of Clark Ashton Smith , Jack Vance , Catherine L. Moore , Leigh Brackett and H. P. Lovecraft ( Dream-Quest , mostly ) ; as well as a number of sources that arguably have very little to do with sword&amp;sorcery fiction - the computer games Wizardry VII. , Unreal and even Chrono Trigger . Among roleplaying resources , I am indebted to Judges Guild ( whose Campaign Hexagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ km per hex basis and with quarter-sized maps ) , M.A.R. Barker and early TSR , particularly Gary Gygax . As more immediate inspiration , Geoffrey 's thought-provoking Carcosa campaign has to be mentioned , and a list of inspiring discussions that mostly took place on Dragonsfoot and the Necromancer Games message boards ( occasionally on RPGNet and ENWorld as well ) . A few of the most relevant : - Swords and Sensibility - the evolution of the tone of D&amp;D - Should A/D&amp;D gods have stats ? - Inspirations for D&amp;D setting past and present ( NG ) <p> I suppose the basic idea had been germinating in my mind for a while . One player , an experienced D&amp;D veteran , once made the following remark WRT gods in my Wilderlands campaign : " Wow , these guys are a bunch of assholes . " ( For the record , he was speaking about Mitra and Alliria , both LG gods with paladinhoods . ) That 's sort of how I approached the matter in Fomalhaut as well . Fomalhaut is built on the small gods concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in this respect , small gods are of limited power and distinguished from mortals only by their power - which is impressive , but probably no match for a resourceful and aggressive high level party . Gods in Fomalhaut appear physically , have stats , and are generally weaker than gods in Deities&amp;Demigods , although more powerful than JG 's Unknown Gods . On the other hand , they are most assuredly a petty , small-minded , vindicative and vain bunch ; in short , assholes . Unlike the Lovecraftian Mythos , they can usually be safely followed without facing immediate insanity , but they are n't likable . <p> In creating the pantheon , I included some gods known on Earth ( although not the " usual D&amp;D suspects " ) , some mortals risen to divinity , and also a " humanized Cthulhu mythos " . Clark Ashton Smith 's Hyperborean cycle featured many deities who did , or would fit into the third category : gods who are grotesque , of modest powers and who , instead of spiritual perfection are instead characterized by massive character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , will share these imperfections . They will not be horrific ( at least not most of them ) , but they will certainly be weird . <p> So , without further ado , here it is : <p> *** <p> Gods and demons <p> Due to its great distance , the gods of our world are generally unknown on Fomalhaut , or are of such a weak power that their presence is all but unnoticeable . In its later cycles , shortly before the planet 's long decline and return into the ice from where it was lifted by the sages of older eras , several new or long-slumbering gods declared their powers and assumed the leadership of new-found followers . Some came from the deep chasms of the underearth ; others from the dim reaches of space between the stars . Yet others were mortals who had acquired divine powers , and drunken with it , started testing the extent of their might . So it was in the last years before the coming of the glaciers . <p> BythosAlignment : Chaotic Neutral Symbol : grimacing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his followers . His appearance is unkempt and ragged , with disorderly robes and filthy beard . His cultists breathe in poisonous gasses and vapours to prophesise and divine . Among them are found clerics , magic-users and illusionists in equal measure . <p> Derceto , dark mother Alignment : Chaotic Evil Symbol : night-black disk surrounded with swirling tentacular protrusions Weapons : nets , crooked knives and swords Derceto dwells in the lightless hollows of the Underworld , but also appears on the plane of Fomalhaut in person or through progeny when summoned forth . This occasion is not always a pleasant one , as Derceto has been known to devour her callers after her bizarre fertility rites . There are no female followers , and both goddess and cult are characterised by definite mysogynic tendencies . Obviously inspired by Shub-Niggurath . <p> Dornak , god of peace Alignment : Chaotic Good Symbol : olive branch Weapons : two-handed flails Dornak is a giant , 30 m man with tanned brown skin . He wears a leather tunic and employs a huge flail for combat . Dornak likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole army into pulp to achieve it . His clerics are of the same temperament . From Unknown Gods . These folks are very nasty , as they often start encounters with a detect evil spell , and if they find any , they attack at once ! <p> EllingerAlignment : Chaotic Neutral Symbol : golden pentacle in a field of blue Weapons : magic-user only Ellinger rose among the gods through wizardly might and unrestrained powermongering . This is a habit he has kept , just like his super-mundane charisma and fondness for debauchery . Ellinger has no priesthood or church . His believers - more precisely , allies - are over-ambitious magic-users and illusionists desiring the bounty of his knowledge . This is something he has in abundance , and is n't opposed to sharing same with someone who proves worthy of this attention . <p> FedafuceAlignment : Neutral Symbol : merchant 's scales Weapons : all clerical Although the majority of religions are inherently inclined to simony , Fedafuce 's clerics have perfected it into an art . In his temples , spells , divinations and divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adherence to moral tenets or even the declaration of religious devotion . Prices somewhat exceed the usual level , but various instalment plans , loans and other constructions balance out the inconvenience . Fedafuce 's temples are also involved in usury and money-changing , as well as other monetary transactions . <p> Glyuathk'thAlignment : Neutral Evil Symbol : light-blue garments Weapons : of any type Glyuathk'th is a giant , tentacled patch of light-blue fungus which predates humanity by millions of years . Its first worshippers found it in the underground fissure in which it grows . To those who supply human sacrifices to Glyuathk'th , it grants hallucinatory visions of weird landscapes and forbidden magical treasures . Glyuathk'th does n't care for conversion , and is unlikely to have clerical adherents . Created by Geoffrey <p> Ishab-LambarAlignment : Lawful Neutral Symbol : cobra Weapons : poisonous daggers Ishab-Lambar was formerly an ambitious priest who gained power and immortality by disposing of his own god ( now only known as the Red God ) . He is popular in Thasan and the barren lands to its east , spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west . A desperate sect of the Red God still exists ( although its members have no clerical magic of any sort ) , fighting with bitter devotion to bring about Ishab-Lambar 's downfall . <p> Isthar , goddess of love and war Alignment : Neutral Symbol : bow and arrow Weapons : of any type , especially bows and one-handed swords Isthar , as her religion , is both gentle and merciless ; always possessing a hidden edge when the former , and an indecipherable gentleness and attractiveness when the latter . The number of her followers is countless ( and include women especially ) , being much , much more powerful on Fomalhaut than she ever was on Earth . Clerics are of either sex , but men may only advance to fifth level in its hierarchy . <p> Kang , the Thousand-Eyed , god of adventurers Alignment : Chaotic Neutral Symbol : circle , and several smaller circles within it Weapons : of any type , but especially flails Kang the Thousand-Eyed 's cult excels above all in brazen greed and unrestrained powermongering . His doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of principles , making it both widespread and popular . Kang is a 3m behemoth in chainmail armour . He uses a great flail and wears a horned helmet , from which several small , slimy and round eyes peer . He is irritable and often capricious . <p> KarttekezaAlignment : Chaotic Good Symbol : peacock Weapons : swords with wavy blades Karttekeza is a six metres tall giant . He has six heads and twelve hands , holding swords with wavy blades in all but two of them . He is dedicated to fighting mercilessly against demons . His worshippers are fighter-clerics dedicate themselves to combat , and wear extravagant , rich garments ( they especially prefer gem-studded weapons and clothing ) . Karttekeza is an idealist , caring little for material goods above what is needed , but enjoys music , poetry and female companions . His steed is a great peacock . It is intelligent , but does n't speak . Often , only the peacock appears before priests , which is nevertheless interpreted as a favourable sign . Karttekeza is a young god , having only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an informal network with few followers . <p> MereskanAlignment : Chaotic Neutral Symbol : bat Weapons : short swords Mereskan , the intelligent giant bat-god , is well known for strange and often tiresome humour , as well as paternalistic tendencies . The followers feed him with their own blood ; in exchange , Mereskan provides them with wise guidance and advice . The implements of the sacrifice are idols with pointed teeth , found in all his temples . Mereskan is followed by grave robbers and thieves , who are attracted by his nightly aspect . In practice , Mereskan 's advice is not particularly wise and often extremely dangerous , being wild guesswork at best ; but complaining about this will be fruitless as Mereskan dismisses all criticism directed at his person . <p> Monks of MungAlignment : Lawful Evil Symbol : golden sun in purple field Weapon : of any type Although Mung is no deity , but rather the state ideology of Mungor City , and adherents are no priests in the strictest sense , it is nevertheless discussed under religions , since it possesses both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unhealthy desire for power ; furthermore , it has adopted some religious trappings . Mung 's diligent monks have taken roots nigh anywhere , and are usually involved in machinations towards the overthrow of lawful authority . Where the faith has triumphed ( as is the case in the city of Famful ) , all decisions are made in the name of puppet rulers by advisors straight from Mungor City . Therefore , resentment against monks is rather significant , although few risk their open expulsion due to Mung 's magical , military and technological might . Mung is a synthesis of Mingism ( from Flash Gordon ) , the cult of Morg ( from City State of the Invincible Overlord ) and the Wandsmen/Lords Protector from The Book of Skaith <p> Ozolba , zombie god Alignment : Neutral Evil Symbol : rotting head Weapons : bludgeoning only Ozolba is a huge decomposing corpse . He has minimal intellect , and only concerns himself with destruction and murder , which it relishes . The secretive clergy often includes priests who are themselves zombified corpses . They may only progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ozolba have crude intelligence . <p> Shakkur , god of beggars Alignment : Chaotic Evil Symbol : rag-wrapped hand Weapons : crutches , knives , etc . In physical appearance , Shakkur resembles an old , emaciated man with improbably large eyes and vampire teeth . He has no clerics , and only half-animalistic beggars , the most despicable class of mendicants care to call on him . He preaches cannibalism and murder , and his faithful servants can employ debilitating and dangerous curses . <p> ShodogguaAlignment : Chaotic Evil Symbol : dark gray waves Weapons : tridents This bizarre monster-god reposes in forgotten basalt-deeps , and his once thronging temples have stayed abandoned since the horrific collective suicide of his faithful . Abandoned - but not always empty ! <p> SnologAlignment : Neutral Symbol : slug surrounded by golden halo Weapons : clerical ; all edged weapons , as well as the use of salt is strictly restricted ! Snolog is a deity belonging to the class of gastropoda , being a bulky , well-fed slug . His body is always surrounded by a golden light aura ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shaved priests , and wicked priestesses ( also shaved where appropriate ) are at his disposal , primarily demonstrating their resolution of faith in various orgies and other types of debauchery . Snolog 's philosophy is enlightened hedonism , making him one of the less dangerous gods of Fomalhaut . <p> TargAlignment : Lawful Evil Symbol : imperial eagle in inverted purple triangle Weapons : unknown metal lances and technological Targ is non-magical , and according to many , he is no genuine god but merely a very powerful mortal . This is a purely theoretical distinction , since Targ is very dangerous in either case ! His body is a pudding-like deep purple mass with two glowing red eyes . He always appears encased in armour made of super-metal , with a glass helmet on his head . Targ travels overland in a floating metal fortress , leaving destruction and slavery wherever he goes . His exact goals or the nature and extent of followers ( if any ) are so far unknown . Targ was inspired by the Dark Savant from Wizardry VII . <p> Tsathoggus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any type as long as it hurts Tsathoggus is a rather malevolent god , and his worship is n't too attractive to most people . His devotees wear greenish robes , and perform certain repulsive facial alterations to please their harsh master . Nevertheless , his shrines are found in almost all larger city states , and despite their bad reputation , attract enough visitors to ensure their maintenance . As it is well known , several harmful materials and magical implements are available at the right price ; and it must also be mentioned that the priests of Tsathoggus are not tight-fisted with those who perform certain secret , but hazardous undertakings at their behest ! <p> UthummaosAlignment : Lawful Evil Symbol : faintly glowing chasm in a dark field Weapons : clerical and short swords Uthummaos is the cold breath speaking from dark chasms , and his voice is vaporous and gloomy . His mystery-religion is made up of a web of rituals , superstition and obscure , seemingly self-contradictory commandments , which believers must carry out exactly as ordered . Clerics in the religion are strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make human sacrifices in complete secrecy and according to precise guidelines . <p> YolAlignment : Neutral Evil Symbol : whirling pattern Weapons : of any type Yol is a vast protoplasmic mass made up of millions of large cells resembling frogs ' eggs . The essence of Yol 's teachings is the personal experiencing of divinity ; that is , his followers always carry a smaller cell colony within themselves , thus spreading it all over the world ! The religion is expansionistic , achieving its goals through the usual method of armed coercion . <p> So the milieu is one where Machiavelli would be considered the norm in civilized places , while in the hinterlands the oddest of things are to be expected , the populace as savage and more bizarre than any callow one recorded in the earth 's younger aeons .

This strange and sinister mixture provides a perfect background for the fantasy adventure campaign , of course . -- Gary Gygax on The Dying EarthBeyond Fomalhaut <p> I always wanted to do a campaign where all characters were split class : <p> class/cleric ... with the amount of x.p. that went to the cleric class determined by how obsessively one followed an alignment ( rather than a god ) and where the gods were alignment nodes , not necessarily worshiped ( fitting in theology where angels fit in most theologies ) . <p> All gods have 1-3 traits that characterize them ( traits are on a scale of 0-20 with human ranges generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> So one god might be chaste and cruel , another prudent and selfish , another pious and vengeful , another modest , feckless and cowardly , etc . <p> Following a god would tend to have their traits rub off on you , but would give one access to specific clerical spells rather than just the general ones . <p> the automatic split class clerics would get spell points = wisdom each day ( vs. traditional clerics and normal spells ) . Spells would cost ( 20-character level ) +spell level points to cast ( e.g. a 10th level character casting a 3 level spell would use 20-10 +3 or 13 spell points to cast the spell ) so most characters would not be casting very many spells ... <p> You have to have a god to have be a traditional cleric ( and you can be a cleric/cleric split class -- casting some spells as a cleric of a god , and some from your innate holiness and alignment orientation ) . <p> Never did develop it , but the " small gods " setting reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used like angels in medieval grimoires were used . <p> Very well might be interested ... assuming you 're looking for players .

But , of course , if your players are on the internet , that might be unwise ... <p> I 'm flattered that you saw fit to include Glyuathk'th in your pantheon . Considering that Glyuathk'th is also present on Carcosa , is it possible that the Glyuathk'th on Fomalhaut originated from spores from the Glyuathk'th on Carcosa ( or vice versa ) , transported by way of panspermia ? <p> I particularly like the possibilities of Yol , and I 'm intrigued by the " horrific collective sacrifice " of Shodoggua 's worshippers . <p> I 'm surprised that you included Tsathoggus , though .

@@59195468 @8195468/ <p> I 've recently run into a spell quandary . We have always played that a light and darkness spell cancel one another out . For example , if darkness were cast in a PC 's eyes , a light spell cancelled out the darkness and returned the PC 's vision . Continual light and continual darkness were played the same way . <p> Well , we broke out the PH last session and learned we were 100% wrong . The spell description says nothing of the kind . A light spell sheds light in x radius for y number of rounds , a darkness spell does the same ( shedding " unlight " ) . There is no description of what happens when the spells are cast upon each other . Ditto with the continual variety . <p> To add to the confusion , darkness 15 ' radius does directly address the issue . <p> Without releasing any spoilers , the PCs were up against an enemy that really , really , really hated light . The cleric was wielding a torch with a continual light spell cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the torch . What happens ? <p> I thought I knew what would happen . I assumed the continual light spell would be unaffected . I now believe my assumption was incorrect . I ruled , and I would appreciate some feedback , that the spells were layered . That is , if you cast a light spell on a wall , and then someone subsequently casts darkness on the same wall , the darkness spell is " on top " of the light . The light spell is still functioning , but it is concealed by the darkness . When the darkness spell 's duration runs out , the light spell -if still in effect- shines into effect . Ditto with darkness on continual light , the light will be extingushed only for the darkness 's duration . A continual light could only be permanently extinguished by a dispel magic . <p> I think that 's how it works . Unsure . Any thoughts ? <p> -Confused in Maine . 174048 @qwx584048 <p> We always played that they cancelled each other out , but that a continual light would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual darkness would trump a light spell . ) I 'm shocked that this is n't the case . <p> Well , for one , it will mean a lot of the PCs ' light spells will be burned up quick . As a party of mostly humans , that would be a bad , bad thing in the Underdark . Also , I do try to play by the rules when possible . No one was more surprised than myself to discover that we had appeared to pull this rule whole-cloth out of the air . <p> Hmm . I 'll check out the DMG 's section on spells when I get home . 174048 @qwx584048 <p> Nothing is mentioned as to what negates darkness or continual darkness . But I think we can make some safe assumptions . <p> The main difference between darkness and darkness , 15 ' radius is that one is cast by clerics and the other by magic-users . They have very different statistics , but also different circumstances in which they can be cast ( e.g. , good clerics wo n't be casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can counter darkness , 15 ' radius . Can it also counter darkness ? <p> The argument could be made that the magic-user form of light is the one that can negate darkness , 15 ' radius , but that it ca n't negate darkness because that 's a cleric spell . The book does n't mention this explicitly , and I find it a undesirable argument . <p> I feel it 's better to assume that as darkness is the reverse of light ( though only one half its duration ) , it can counter light just as easily as darkness , 15 ' radius can . The half duration is there to keep darkness , which is more usable as a weapon , from being abused . But countering spells is an instantaneous effect , and we need n't be concerned with the duration of darkness . Balance is not an issue here . <p> By the same argument , I see no reason to say that continual darkness can not be countered by continual light . One spell stops another ; it 's an even trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should look like this : <p> Notice that the magic-user has no way to counter continual light except with dispel magic . <p> A note should be made about the word " negation . " A light or darkness spell is not " negated " just by being within the area of effect of the other . In such a case , if they 're the same strength ( are they continual or not ? ) , they temporarily cancel each other out . If the effect of one of the spells ends , or if they 're moved out of each other 's area of effect , their effects will return . To completely extinguish a spell effect , the counterspell must be cast on the same object , area , or creature as the target spell . <p> I 'm not in a position to determine where I get this from . I 'm sure I 've read it , but whether it 's valid for this version of the game , or official at all I do n't know . In any case , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> It 's odd that this has never been brought up before . 1ed PHB , p. 44 , Light , in its entirety : <p> This spell causes excitation of molecules so as to make them brightly luminous . The light thus caused is equal to torch light in brightness , but its sphere is limited to 4 " in diameter . It lasts for the duration indicated ( 7 turns at 1st experience level , 8 at 2nd , 9 at 3rd , etc. ) or until the caster utters a word to extinguish the light . The light spell is reversible , causing darkness in the same area and under the same conditions , except the blackness persists for only one-half the duration that light would last . If this spell is cast upon a creature , the applicable magic resistance and saving throw dice rolls must be made . Success indicates that the spell affects the area immediately behind the creature , rather than the creature itself . In all other cases , the spell takes effect where the caster directs as long as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the spell . Light can spring from air , rock , metal , wood , or almost any similar substance . <p> 1ed PHB , p. 46 , Continual light : <p> This spell is similar to a light spell , except that it lasts until negated ( by a continual darkness or dispel magic spell ) and its brightness is very great , being nearly as illuminating as full daylight . It can be cast into air , onto an object , or at a creature . In the third case , the continual light affects the space about one foot behind the creature if the latter makes its saving throw . Note that the spell will blind a creature if it is successfully cast upon the visual organs , for example . Its reverse causes complete absence of light . <p> Magic-User 's light and continual light spells are identical to the cleric 's , except that they are NOT reversible ( something I have apparently forgotten ) . Illusionist 's light is identical to mu 's . Illusionist 's continual light same as clerics ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separate spell called " continual darkness , " which reads , " The effects of this darkness , as well as the material component of the spell , are the same as the second level magic-user spell , darkness 15 ' radius ( cf. continual light ) . " Ok , then . <p> And then there is darkness 15 ' radius . 1ed PHB , p. 69 : <p> This spell causes total , impenetrable darkness in the area of effect . Infravision or ultravision are useless . Neither normal nor magical light will work unless a light or continual light spell is used . In the former event , the darkness is negated by the light spell and vice versa . <p> Stormcrow is exactly right . This whole thing could just be bad writing . This " in the former event " on its face , seems to mean that Darkness 15 ' radius is negated by , and can negate , a light spell . Going by the strict wording of the spell descriptions , this ( and continual darkness cast by an illusionist ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed continual light spell , by the spell wording , does not negate a light spell . Apparently , nothing negates darkness . Paging Rule Zero ... <p> However , all this negation language aside ... can a light or continual light spell be covered/masked by darkness/reversed continual light ? None of the spell descriptions address this . If light and darkness do not " negate " one another ( to use the PHB 's language ) , how are the effects to be played when one is cast upon the other ? 174048 @qwx584048 <p> I would still play that they cancel one another out , as this is exacty the way we 've done it for years . However if some one casts light at your eyes and you fail yyour save , even if some casts darkness later , you still are blinded 1-4 rounds . It takes this long for the rods and cones in your eyes to readjust ! If you are worried about the PC 's light , then provide them with a very high powered light that ca n't be put out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides a few minor other quirks ... I 'd make it something the PCs both do and do n't want . <p> Oh , you misunderstand me ! I 'm playing the drow , I want the PCs ' lights extinguished ! <p> I just want to be fair about it . 174048 @qwx584048 <p> Illusionist 's continual light same as clerics ' , which is odd since the illusionist is able to obtain a separate spell called " continual darkness , " which reads , " The effects of this darkness , as well as the material component of the spell , are the same as the second level magic-user spell , darkness 15 ' radius ( cf. continual light ) . " Ok , then . <p> The effects are the same , but the parameters of the spell are different . The cleric spell continual light is reversible . The illusionist spell continual light is not . <p> Since clerics can acquire any spell on their spell lists on any day , all clerics ( of sufficient level ) have access to the light and darkness spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You need to know each spell separately , taking up more known spell " slots . " <p> And sparhawk brings up an interesting point . Surely you would n't say that casting a darkness spell would cure the blindness caused by a light spell cast in someone 's eyes ? <p> Well , Crow , that 's just it . We 've been playing for decades now on the assumption that light and darkness negate one another , meaning that if the light/darkness is negated , then the blindness is as well ( there 's no point in talking about rods and cones , it 's all magic anyway , this 1-4 rounds business is clearly a house rule ) . Now it 's clear that the measly first-level spell darkness ( reversed light ) does not negate light , or vice versa . Continual Darkness or Darkness 15 ' radius is called for . I suppose this means that the drow will have to revert to dispel magic . <p> I suppose my players and I will have to hash this whole mess out next session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall of Snurre and the " you know who " are about to appear . My question is : What strategies do the " you know who " use against the light wielding party . Most of them have no access to continual darkness or dispel magic . <p> The PC 's have continual light stones , " like the sands of desert " . A lot . The " you know who " ' s darkness ability is worthless , as it will not function within the radius of a continual light spell . <p> How do you rule on casting light vs. darkness spells , especially the " negation " effects . Does one spell vs. dozens of continual light spells only cancel out one or all ? If you bring a continual light spell on an item into the radius of a continual darkness spell what happens ? What if there are multiple continual light spells cast on items ? In the overlap area , if you rule neither spell works ( temporarily ) , as opposed to instant negation , will other light sources be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean but I would rule that if an area is lit by the light of three light spells it would still only take one darkness to negate them .

The continual light is negated within the area of the darkness - what happens if the stone is removed from the area ? It ought to shine as brightly as before - what happens to the magical darkness two inches away ? <p> I think dragon mag 's sage advice touched on this .. Saying something like " when a continual light ( or dark ) spell is brought into the radius of the opposite , both are not canceled , but their effects are subdued so the ambient light level is what you ' see ' .

" Heh , D20 , the one ring to rule them all ... " -- Gary Gygax <p> Just to let you know , discussing the differences between various editions of D&amp;D may be better placed in the General Discussion forum . The 1st edition forum is for 1st edition exclusively . But it 's not a big deal , I just wanted to let you know that the discussion on this topic will be very limited in this forum . Perhaps a mod can move it . <p> Anyway , back when DF had an Edition Wars forum , I made a list of the changes that 2e made to the game . I will repost that list here , but I will exclude my commentary on these changes so as not to spark off another edition war . Note that these changes are ones that I found in the 2e player handbook , this list is not entirely comprehensive nor does it take into account the various changes made in the Monsterous Manual or DMG . Also note that I wrote this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out the list that I pasted here , Sieg beat me to it ! <p> OSRIC : It 's FREE ! !

Just as long as the thread does n't become a shouting match between 2e haters and 2e lovers , then all is good . I started D&amp;D with 2e and own the books and so I have a pretty good understanding of that system , although I never read most of the other rules supplements or " splat books " ( e.g. the Player 's Option books ) other than a few Complete Handbooks . However , I definetly prefer 1e now . <p> OSRIC : It 's FREE ! ! NEW and IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publish and SELL your own module or supplement for AD&amp;D by using OSRIC ! <p> There were a lot a minor differences that have already been posted . To me the major differences were that 2E cleaned up how initiative and surprise were handled . However , the artwork and " style " of the rules suffered some in my opinion . <p> Besides those things , some biggies were ... in 2E many things were explicitly identified as being optional parts of the game , 2E had the Half-Orc removed from the core rules as a racial choice for player characters and , of course , 2E had the introduction of the Non-weapon proficiencies as an optional part of the game . <p> Really though , 1E and 2E are very similar game systems ... to the point where you can mix and match stuff without hardly any difficulties at all . <p> Also , just in my opinion ... AD&amp;D really did not need a whole new edition to be published to streamline the rules but TSR did so anyway for reasons I wo n't get into here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need version 3.5 and a whole new set of core books to clarify and adjust some rules and the all powerful buzzwords " balance issues " . <p> What others have said , I agree with , though I 'd note that NWPs actually started in the latter days of 1E with the Dungeoneer and Wilderness Survival Guides . <p> Yes , not to mention Oriental Adventures and Dragonlance Adventures . The latter also had ' specialty priests ' like 2E and divided the set of clerical/druidical spells into spheres , again just like 2E . Second edition was really the natural evolution of this trend , though one might not agree with the trend itself , of course . <p> Still , I would venture to guess that the moderators of this forum would hold discussions of non-weapon proficiencies and specialty priests &amp;c. to be off-topic , and I ca n't say that I would argue with that . <p> TSR published 2nd edition to make money and also to have a new set of core books better suited to the game line they were publishing as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the strongly flavoured PH and DMG did n't work as neutral rulesets to work with the new campaign settings . 2nd edition filed a lot of rough edges off AD&amp;D , papered over others , sometimes with skill and incoherently at others . <p> Quote : <p> Really though , 1E and 2E are very similar game systems ... to the point where you can mix and match stuff without hardly any difficulties at all . <p> As is usually the case between editions of the same game . <p> ' Specialty priests ' are also 1st edition , starting with " Deities &amp; Demigods of the World of Greyhawk " . <p> TSR published 2nd edition to make money and also to have a new set of core books better suited to the game line they were publishing as a whole : not necessarily out of spite to Gary , but because the strongly flavoured PH and DMG did n't work as neutral rulesets to work with the new campaign settings . 2nd edition filed a lot of rough edges off AD&amp;D , papered over others , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gary had been talking about the release of a Revised AD&amp;D even before he left TSR , so even if he 'd stayed I believe we would have seen a 2E ; though perhaps not taking the direction it did . <p> Really though , 1E and 2E are very similar game systems ... to the point where you can mix and match stuff without hardly any difficulties at all . <p> As is usually the case between editions of the same game . <p> ' Specialty priests ' are also 1st edition , starting with " Deities &amp; Demigods of the World of Greyhawk " . <p> AD&amp;D 2nd Edition was actually just a natural evolution and consolidation of many of the options that started in the last 1st edition timeframe . Non-weapon proficiencies , spheres and schools of magic , etc . But it also removed some things people loved dearly , made most of the game " Optional " , and started the trend of the suppliment treadmill for D&amp;D . <p> I can live with the consolidation . I can live with the removal ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . What I could n't live with was the optional-ization of everything . It says right at the beginning of every D&amp;D rulebook I 've ever bought that the rules are suggestions and the DM makes the decisions . Therefore anything printed in the books is " optional " and printing up hordes of rules as " Optional " just confuses the players of the game ! And the treadmill ... do n't get me started on the treadmill ! <p> 2E never deserved the title of 2nd edition . It was more a " AD&amp;D , Revised Printing " . Just like 3.5E is nothing but a tweak and reprint of 3.0E . Or Mentzer BECM is nothing more than a tweak and reprint of Moldvay/Cook/Marsh BX . Personally , I lump AD&amp;D and AD&amp;D2 together as one game , BX and BECM and RC and Challenger together as another , and 3E and 3.5E as another . <p> But I have to admit , having played a lot of 1st edition and NOT playing a lot of 2nd edition , I really like some of the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old house rules in that list - I 'm sure a lot of individuals do as well .

His face suggests age beyond his normal appearance , as if wisdom were a part of his charisma , thrusting out upon those that stand near him almost as much as do his bushy eyebrows . His hair is black and cropped , his beard black with silver streaks and well waxed . Mordenkainen maintains a latge force of mounted archers , and also has two subdued red dragons named Gorki and Porki under his control . Although Mordenkainen is the founder of the circle , it would not be correct to refer to him as the circle 's leader . He is more accurately the first among equals . <p> BigbyRace : Human ; Class : Magic-user ; Level : Circa 20 ; Alignment : NeutralBigby was Mordenkainen 's first apprentice . He was originally encountered by Mordenkainen while adventuring . After a quick battle , Mordenkainen subdued Bigby with a Charm Person spell . Mordenkainen treated the ensnared magic-user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his own free will as his apprentice . Bigby 's appearance is unassuming . His attire is unremarkable , when traveling he usually wears a simple dark gray robe with the hood pulled up ( for Bigby is a somewhat retiring and secretive man ) . When this hood is thrown back , his lean but healthy features will be exposed : studious brown eyes , light brown hair , and a laugh that precedes jokes on almost a forced level . To those who do not know him well , he might be viewed as oddly nervous ( or paranoid ) , but this is nowhere near true . The mark to which Bigby adheres is simple " Caution " . When Mordenkainen is away from the Obsidian Citadel , it is Bigby who assumes the role of steward . <p> YragRace : Human ; Class : Fighter ; Level : 19 ; Alignment : NeutralYrag was the first character Gary created . He appears as a stout and hardy man , flaxen haired , and normally dressed in gray and green robes . He stands over 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchful of things about him , and usually prefers no new undertakings unless these are shared with those persons he knows and trusts . <p> Riggby ( the Ready ) Race : Human ; Class : Cleric ; Level : circa 15 ; Alignment : NeutralRiggby is a cleric of Boccob , with a lesser devotion to Zagyg . He is normally dressed in light gray and off-white colored robes . His eyes are chestnut brown , his hair pure black , and his opinions are short and succenct- " Convert , or else ! ! " <p> FelnorithRace : Human ; Class : Fighter ; Level : Circa 12 ; Alignment : NeutralFelnorith is known as the Sword Collector , and he has a large collection of magical blades . <p> Sigby GrigbysonRace : Human ; Class : Fighter ; Level : 10 ; Alignment : Neutral ( Good ) Abilities : Strong suits are Dexterity and Constitution . Strength is good . Wisdom is low . Charisma is well above average . Comeliness is above average.Mordenkainen met Sigby Grigbyson in Dyvers . The former was looking for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young fighters abilities . Sigby hails from The Archbarony of Ratik . The events that led him from that distant place to the central regions of the continent are not recorded , but Sigby is known as an inveterate wanderer and it may have been simple wanderlust . Sigby honors the god Fharlanghn and like the Dweller on the Horizon , he is able to travel great distances afoot without tiring . Whether this is some blessing bestowed upon him by Fharlanghn , or if it is accomplished by some magical device in unknown . Sigby is a quite likable fellow , and with his high Charisma and Comeliness he rarely has a problem getting along . Sigby is well known for his swordplay . He wields a marvelous blade that strikes well and parries likewise . Recently , Sigby was spotted in the City of Greyhawk . It is rumored that he is planning on traveling north to the Obsidian Citadel to call upon Mordenkainen . Possibly to share information and give over some item he may be carrying with him . <p> ZiggbyRace : Mountain Dwarf ; Class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NeutralZiggby , more commonly known as " Zig " , is the leader of Mordenkainen 's 300 or so dwarven followers . These dwarves were the primary builders of the Obsidian Citadel . During his last adventure , he fought the evil dwarf Obmi and the dwarven throwing hammers were flying . Ziggby had the upper hand , but Obmi managed to escape . <p> The Obsidian CitadelThe Citadel of the Eight is a massive fortress . The central structure of the complex is a great citadel and hall . Eight tower keeps arranged in an octagonal pattern surrond the central citadel . These structures are connected by curtain walls and lesser towers . This complex is surronded by an outer wall , also built in an octagonal form . Reports that the Obsidian Citadel is located somewhere in the Yatil Mountains appear to be greatly exaggerated . It may or may not be found there . The actual whereabouts of the fortress is unknown , but some believe it is in the rocky hills that are covered by the Vesve Forest ... <p> Anything else , except a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the product of latter day Greyhawk writers . <p> well , that 's the info i got from wikipedia , and know , the same from GH wiki : " The Citadel of Eight <p> The Citadel of Eight was formed at some point after 561 CY , and was dissolved in 569 CY . Its initial members were Mordenkainen and Bigby , his apprentice . The two decided to form a group to attempt to maintain the balance between the extremes of Oerth . They recruited Robilar , Riggby , Yrag , Tenser , Serten , and Otis . The name of the group was based on their number and Mordenkainen 's Obsidian Citadel . " <p> no good ? <p> My opinion ?

@@59195474 @8195474/ <p> I have little exposure to these two games . The two threads ( RMC and RME ) on Rolemaster got me interested enough to ask for some questions . I took a look at MERP 2E , which I had ( oh how I wish TE had n't shut down the nice people at merp.com linking all those ICE products ) . <p> So I glanced at MERP 2E . I 'm impressed . Seems to be a smart system , and based on RM from the cover . And from the list of products , they were more prolific than TSR back in the day with AD&amp;D ... lots of suppliments and adventures . So what I 'm interested in first is some of the highlights -- the differences between the games . <p> 1 . What did they change from MERP 1E to 2E ? 2E seems to be a really simple system . What was the reason for the update ? Did it mirror the upgrade of RM to RM2 ? 2 . Rolemaster I know a little about since someone gave me Companions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was perfect for " low level " adventures in a fantasy world and calls out " levels 1-10 " . I 've seen references to levels of 60+ on merp.com . Did the intended level range change between 1E and 2E ? What is the rough breakdown of levels supported in RM ( how high did it go , what did one do at various levels , like BECMI had specific influence for each level range that characters are meant to reach , etc ) ? <p> " OD&amp;D is riddled with opportunities .... " -waysoftheearth <p> Ruleswise MERP 1e and 2e are the same object . MERP 2e adds some Middle Earth detail , and a rule for spellcasting risk ( i.e. one may attract the attention of the Shadow ) , plus some secondary skills . But the core system is the same , and it is more complex than RME . <p> MERP was a simplified version of the Rolemaster system with fewer spelllists , weapon choices , combat tables , etc . It is streamlined to capture the feel of Middle Earth . As characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional rules from Rolemaster ( Spell Law , Claw Law , et.al - but not so easy with the latest - RMSS/RMFRP ) . These could be added at the GM 's discretion , but care has to be taken to maintain a Tolkein flavour if that is desired . <p> I played MERP extensively and found the 10th-level cap was rarely reached and played within a campaign-length story arc . We never really explored beyond level 9-10 but the option was there with RM2 . <p> 2 . Rolemaster I know a little about since someone gave me Companions I and II . But very little . <p> Going by just those two products can be very misleading , especially if you go by the tables and the skills listed in RoCoII . <p> The core of RM2 had 28 skills . Character Law also gave an additional 40 secondary skills that could be added at the discretion of the GM . These secondary skills were optional . <p> Of course RM2 also suffered from a massive case of lousy organization , and thus many folks thought that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not only reinforced this perception , but extended it , as that book added something like another 40-50 skills to those that already existed . And many folks thought that all those skills were part of the core system ( and so grew the reputation of a skill for everything , including wiping your butt ) . <p> All of the Editors of the various Companion books operated under the principle of " check it for grammer , not system balance or power creep " . They felt that if the player used everything that they published , that it was their own fault . It was this attitude and the actions of these editors that ruined the reputation of Rolemaster in the first place . <p> Alex wrote : <p> What is the rough breakdown of levels supported in RM ( how high did it go , what did one do at various levels , like BECMI had specific influence for each level range that characters are meant to reach , etc ) ? <p> Rolemaster basically has unlimited levels . Spell lists ( in Spell Law ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 , 50 ) . And in the core rules , you could not cast a spell that was above your level ( there are options that allow for this though ) . <p> Nothing else in RM is dependant upon level ( well , except skill ranks , but that is worked into the cost of the skill for each profession ) . <p> You could be a 50th level Fighter or a 75th level Rogue or an 90th level Magician . It did n't matter .... <p> At each level you got a number of development points . You spent them on skills ( including the learning of spells ) , and any character may learn any skill - they just have to pay the costs . <p> Skill ranks are n't all worth the same either . If you have no ranks in a skill you have a -25 in using it . If you have 1-10 ranks , you get a +5 per ranks . For ranks 11-20 , you got +2 per rank , 21-30 ranks gave +1 per rank , and 31+ ranks gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives +50 ; 11 ranks gives +52 rank bonus total ) . <p> You could have magicians who are skilled in using a long sword instead of a ton of spells ... <p> That was the beauty of Rolemaster , your character could learn anything ... <p> ... MERP 2E said it was perfect for " low level " adventures in a fantasy world and calls out " levels 1-10 " . I 've seen references to levels of 60+ on merp.com . Did the intended level range change between 1E and 2E ? ... <p> The characters with levels of 60+ were invariably ' legendary ' individuals , the vast majority dating back to the First Age ( not many around in the Third Age ) , and not likely to be encountered by a typical adventuring party . <p> So what 's the general power level comparison between RM2 and D&amp;D ? For example , a 10th level RM character is equivalent to what range of D&amp;D/AD&amp;D characters ( Classic or AD&amp;D , please ) ? Or a 30th level BECMI character or an 18th level AD&amp;D character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all possible ? I understand the games are quite different in style ( class only vs skill-based , hit points only vs critical hit tables ) , but the games seem to have a lot in common and it should be possible to draw parallels between the systems for the strengths of each character ( melee , spells , thieving ) . <p> Do any of you have a RM/MERP web site like many of us have D&amp;D web sites ? Post a link , especially if you have any game mechanical details on the site . Still a curious cat . <p> Waaaaaaay back when , I usually figured an AD&amp;D PC level to be converted at half that of a Rolemaster character . E.g. an 18th level magician becomes a 9th level magic-user . <p> I 'll second that . MERP is a really nice little system , I 've always thought of it as Rolemaster-lite . Levels seem to be roughly set about 2 to 1 in comparsion to D&amp;D as Ancalagon says but you may find a little variation in that . <p> I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rules intensive , but as a fellow DM friend of mine ( who is a big fan of Rolemaster ) pointed out , RM has all the rules there , but the DM and players are free to leave those out they feel they do n't need . <p> " The Emperor wants to control outer space , Yoda wants to explore inner space ; that 's the fundamental difference between the good and bad sides of the Force " <p> Waaaaaaay back when , I usually figured an AD&amp;D PC level to be converted at half that of a Rolemaster character . E.g. an 18th level magician becomes a 9th level magic-user . <p> The RM2 version of Creatures &amp; Treasures included conversion notes to different systems , and RM levels were about 1.5x those of AD&amp;D ( 1E ) . <p> As for d20 ... <p> Well , RM characters can get 2 ranks in a skill at most ( usually , there are a couple of exceptions ) each level , and it is percentile based . <p> This means that a 5th level fighter could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus adolescence level ) , giving them a 60% change to break 100 ( not counting stats . This translates to a +12 to the roll on a d20 . <p> A 5th level fighter in 3.5 has a +5 to attack . An 8th level has a +8/+3 ( or +11 total , as RM does not give multiple attacks* ( see below ) ) and a 9th level gets +9/+4 ( +13 total ) . <p> * = In RM , you do not get multiple attacks because an attack roll in RM is considered to be the TOTAL damage done over a whole 10 seconds spent trading blows . <p> So , to me , I would consider RM to be equal to about 1.5 D&amp;D 3.5 levels as well . <p> All of the Editors of the various Companion books operated under the principle of " check it for grammer , not system balance or power creep " . They felt that if the player used everything that they published , that it was their own fault . It was this attitude and the actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . <p> YMMV of course , but I 've never gotten the impression the skills is what gave Rolemaster its reputation ( or that it 's ruined ) . The fact that you used a different table for just about everything was what gave Rolemaster its reputation . Personally I think the more abstract way of doing it , like in MERP and RMFRP , of having a attack table per *type* of weapon is just right . The difference of four different swords are minimal and should thus have minimal impact on play . <p> BTW I think the editors of the Companions thought of Rolemaster mostly as a toolkit , and thus it was the individual GM that had to pick and choose and do the balancing . Personally I loved the Companions . <p> MERP is an interesting game , and it was my first . Note that while some sourcebooks are very good many of them utilize Middle Earth as a basis for High Fantasy romps , and thus are not all that true to the vision of Prof. Tolkien . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lair of a demigod or a lich of awesome powers ? Not really Tolkien all thge time , but great fantasy fodder . <p> After giving a thorough reading to RME and comparing it with MERP , I must say that while I like the vastly improved organisation of the former , it still feels too complex to me . Too many table lookups ; a thing which never drove me to play MERP , and now I guess the same with RME .

AD&amp;D was littered with tables , too . Lots of tables . But what got me most was the spell lists . The spells were creeplily close to AD&amp;D spells . At the 30 and 50 levels the spells pretty much matched 6th and 7th level cleric spells and 8th and 9th level magic-user spells . I saw old familiars like earthquake , disjunction , and gate . For players RM looks a lot like a poor man 's AD&amp;D . The big difference I saw was in the monsters . AD&amp;D monsters frequently have powers that replicate spells while the RM monsters , even demons , did not make mention of spells . <p> After giving a thorough reading to RME and comparing it with MERP , I must say that while I like the vastly improved organisation of the former , it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a thing which never drove me to play MERP , and now I guess the same with RME .

Perhaps I am getting old , but I simply can not see how to play having to look at all these tables <p> Well , yes , some tables are necessary for RME . I guess one could get by without tables for moving maneuvres and static maneuvres ( just relying on ' target numbers ' instead ) , but I personally would n't do that . And combat and spells do require charts . <p> The thing is , though , that 's where a lot of the charm of RM comes from -- the surprising and vividly described outcomes that the charts provide .

If you do n't like that level of detail , then that is not a problem , but that does not mean that there is anything wrong with the game , which is what your tone ( in the post I quoted when I asked for more information ) seemed to imply . <p> serleran wrote : <p> I 've never been a fan of percentile systems .

As I said , the book is a large improvement over MERP , but only in terms of organisation , not as a simplification of the system ( excluding character creation ) . What I was searching for was a simplification ( and this is quite an objective matter : the game IS more complex than C&amp;C or Basic D&amp;D ) . I would have liked a simplified system . You said something about not using some tables ; it would be nice to know what can be discarded without affecting how the game works , overall .

It 's easy to forget there are lots of sparsely populated areas on Earth . But in terms of my world I 've done something a bit different and created a twisted-fairy-tale-type mini-setting : <p> The setting is an endless forest called the Twisted Wood ( in a ' world ' called Enyss ) . At the Wood 's centre is a single crumbling city , which is slowly being overgrown by the forest . The four Classic D&amp;D races are present : Humans , Elves , Halflings and Dwarves . Most live in Spindle , but the elves live in a region of great stone spires which have been cut by the divided path of the river . The Dwarves ' former realm ( The Greywood ) is now a petrified stone forest in a valley at the base of the Rain Shard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities outside of Spindle , such as Deepwell or the halfling community of Mossroot . <p> The remainder of the Wood is largely inhabited by monster races , such as toadlings ( living in the Toadwater ) , goblins ( Tanglewood ) or the crowlings ( Rain Shard Mountains ) . Oh , and beneath the Twisted Wood lies Labyrinthia - a mythical ' underworld ' ( i.e. mega-dungeon ) that can only be accessed via secret and magical doors ( in trees , under standing stones , in attics etc. ) and only by those who obtain enchanted keys to unlock the lost portals . So , beyond Spindle , and perhaps the Elfkind Spires , there 's plenty of ' sparsely populated wilderness ' to explore ( even if the setting is not a ' traditional ' fantasy world ) . <p> My game world of Pent is a 12-sider too .

@@59195477 @8195477/ <p> I have always wondered how they came up with the treasure types in MM .. The only ones that seem to have a logical progression to me are J through N. I 'm sure there is a reason they did it this way though . Mabye ? <p> Do the treasure type letter codes in Basic correlate with the codes in AD&amp;D at all ? There is a chart in the back of the Moldvay Basic book , right near the Treasure Type chart , that gives estimated total gp value for each type . If the BD&amp;D and AD&amp;D treasure types correlate , this could be useful for you . <p> R.A. <p> " Since the dawn of time , man has yearned to destroy the Sun . " - C. Montgomery Burns <p> I think Gary just made up new types as required . The first few are the obvious ones with a chance for everything , with the monetary values steadily increasing ( I think ) . Otherwise , they seem to be pretty niche-fillers . <p> If you 're trying to make sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to Monsters &amp; Treasure where it was first used . You 'll see all kinds of interesting things . Type A is for Men ( split into land , desert , sea ) , Type G is for Dwarves , Type H is for Dragons , and Type I is for Rocs . Other types are shared by the various creatures . <p> If you look at the Monster Reference Table , you can split it up into types of monsters : Men ; Goblins/Kobolds - Giants are the humanoids ; Skeletons/Zombies - Vampires are the undead ; Cockatrices - Gorgons are , for want of a better term , the petrifyers ; Manticoras - Dragons are the dragon types ; ( Gargoyles - Purple Worms defy my attempts at classifying them ; maybe " gothic types " ? ) Sea Monsters - Treants are the faery types ( though Sea Monsters could easily be removed from that list ) ; Pegasi - Griffons are what I think of as the horse-birds ; Invisible Stalkers - Efreet are the elementals ; Ochre Jelly - Yellow Mold are the fungoids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insects or Animals - Large Insects or Animals are the natural creatures . <p> Study of these types will show that each type ( if it has any treasure at all ; the elementals , fungoids , and horses never have treasure ) is typically spread among the Treasure Types fairly ( but not perfectly ) evenly , with later letters used for more powerful or more difficult-to-deal-with monsters . In the faery-types , for instance , you have Centaurs ( A ) , Nixies ( B ) , Minotaurs , Pixies , Gnomes ( C ) , Dryads ( D ) , Elves ( E ) . <p> ( Remember that Treasure Types in the original D&amp;D were used only for treasure in lairs . Only Goblins and Kobolds have a listing for individual treasure ; the DM was assumed to give any individual creature appropriate treasure as part of the scenario . ) <p> The tables have odd gaps and the treasure types are difficult to classify ( B tends to be copper-heavy , F is gold-heavy , and so on ) , so further analysis has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . For instance , copper for Type B is 1-8:50% . The average value of 1-8 is 4.5 , multiply it by 0.5 for its frequency , and multiply by 1,000 for the number of coins found . <p> Gem Factor and Jewelry Factor represent the average number of pieces found . The value of gems and jewelry has not been factored into the Total in GP column , as the calculation is too complex . As each gem and each piece of jewelry have their values determined by the same process , each piece is therefore worth the same average amount , and the gems and the jewelry of each treasure type may thus be compared relative to each other by the number of pieces they produce on average . <p> The value of magic items is too subjective to reduce to a factor ; that column has been preserved from its list in Monsters &amp; Treasure . <p> The first thing we notice is that lairs of Men have a lot more treasure than most creatures ( only Dwarves and Dragons surpass them ) . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry they 'll possess . <p> We see that the other treasure values are not , as I first surmised , set up in increasing value . Type B has an average of five times as much coin value as Type C , and almost the same gems and jewelry value . Type C has twice as much magic ( though at the same frequency ) , and more variety in that magic . Ghouls , Wights , Hydras , and Nixies are Type B ; Gargoyles , Lycanthropes , Minotaurs , Pixies , and Gnomes are Type C ( and Ogres + 1,000 gp ) . Notice that the Type B monsters , if they have magic in their treasure , must possess a magic armament of some kind . This seems an unusual requirement for Hydras and Nixies . The Type C monsters never have gold in their hoards ( except Ogres , of course ) . This lack is left unexplained . <p> Types D , E , and F all contain large coin values , and varying low amounts of gems and jewelry ( compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly heavy on potions and scrolls , and Type F has no weapons at all . Vampires , Basilisks , Medusae , and Chimeras are the Type F monsters ; I wonder why their treasures never contain weapons . D is where most of the humanoids fall . <p> It looks like B and C are of a different order from D , E , and F. B and C seem to represent the monsters that wo n't have a lot of treasure , while D , E , and F are those monsters that actively collect treasure . ( Keep in mind that the elementals , fungoids , and horses , plus a few of the other monsters , never keep ANY treasure . ) <p> Then , of course , there are the special types . Dwarves ' treasures are full of gold , second only to Dragons , and possess magic on par with Men , and in greater quantity , though they have little gems and jewelry . Dragons , of course , are the great treasure trove of the game , as is only fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the richest of Men . They have the most gems and jewelry too , especially gems ( more than twice the amount that Men have , except for the underwater treasures of Men , which they still beat ) . If you really want a lot of treasure , find a Dragon 's hoard . Rocs do n't keep treasure , but they do manage to collect some gems and jewelry ( probably reflecting the interest of birds for bright , shiny objects ) not as much as Men will have , but more than the midrange B-F treasures . They also collect some magic , probably for the same reason . <p> Now , if somebody has some good ideas as to how this all came about , I 'm all ears !

Does one add the number of segments to the intiative roll ? Also , after an e-mail with Mr. Gygax , who was kind enough to reply to me , it seems the initiative dice to be used is the 10 sided dice and not a 6 sided dice . I mention this because for years i had been rolling the 6 sided dice for initiative . <p> The original AD&amp;D rules specify a d6 for initiative , but as there is a 10 segment round it could make a lot of sense to use a d10 instead !

As regards spell initiative , I do follow the rules in the PHB if it will make a difference to the outcome of an event , but otherwise I simplify that as well . For example , if a mage is ( foolishly ) trying to cast a spell in a melee situation , then all factors will be brought into account to ensure fairness . The casting time modifies the initiative roll . The rules are an excellent framework , but I would always suggest that we do n't let them tie us in knots ! <p> I use the d10 with no weapon speed modifier . With the one minute round , I do n't see how the speed of your weapon is that big of a factor . Your luck and skill in waiting for an opening is much greater . <p> Mages start spells on their init .

We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it all goes pretty smoothly . <p> Even though I 'm on the road , I 'm still trying to check in and give my two fennings In our game we use d10s for initiative , but casting times only in a truly " crisis " situation and no weapon speeds at all . I 've fought enough live steel in my current medieval vice ... er , group ... to know that two people fighting with one carrying a bastard sword and the other a dagger has more to do with the dexterity and training of the fighter than the length/heft of the weapon . I believe it was on one of the classic D&amp;D sites that I saw an interesting system where the dice for initiative depended on the person 's move ( i.e. d10 for a full-move charge , d6 for melee combat , d4 for casting , etc . ) .

Side A wins iniative and their attacks will occur during the 2nd segment of the round , side B 's attacks will occur during the 3rd segment . Even though Side A wins initiative , if they have a spellcaster casting a spell with a casting time of 4 segments or longer , there is a chance the enemy could score an attack and ruin the spell . Even though Side B loses , they could cast any 1 or 2 segment spell with no problem . That 's how the rules were written , and you can see why there are so many house rules .

Gygax might very well use his own house rule , however . Previously , on this forum , he made a post which discussed how he handles initiative in AD&amp;D ( note that what follows is not the official rule ) : <p> quote/Here 's what I used and use for OAD&amp;D initiative . The round has 10 segments of 6-second duration , so I use d6 , 6 equaling the latest segment in a round when action will commence . <p> Forget weapon speed factor ! <p> Spell casting is being prepared from 1 on , so that is a would-be spellcaster suffers damage befor sic the spell activates , there goes the spell . <p> Lowest initiative scores , from 1-6 , go first , all 1s simultaneously , all 2s , etc .

Thus , a 1-segment spell happens in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. +1 to the initiative roll . So if a 6 initiative is held , only 4-segment casting time spells can occur during the round , one of 4-segment 's time going off in the 10th and final segment , while a 5- or longer segment casting time spell will happen in the indicated segment of the following round . <p> Yes , that means a longer spell might well cause a caster to risk two attacks , lost the spell if either hits . <p> To refine the system , although it takes more time , assume half-segments , so there are 20 intervals within the round . Stay with the d6 check for initiative , but you can then use the add of weapon speed factors to give the spellcasters more chance , although 9-segment spells do take 18 of those half-segments . <p> Ah , what 's in a mechanic ? If the group loves complex and time-consuming combat , then play it that was . If more focused on other aspects of the game , get it over by whatever quick and dirty method that suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rexfelis <p> P.S. That post from Gary can no longer be found on this site since the site went down and all previous posts were lost ( or that 's my understanding anyway ) . However I printed out that post from Gary at the time and that 's how I was able to reproduce it . <p> One thing I would add to the description of how initiative works " by the book " ... <p> When weapon speed factor is the determinant of which opponent strikes first in a melee round , there is a chance that one opponent may be entitled to multiple attacks ( DMG p66 ) ... <p> If the speed factor of the slower weapon is double that of the faster , or at least 5 points greater , the faster weapon strikes twice . If the difference is 10 or greater , the faster weapon strikes thrice . <p> Thank Rexfelis ! I remember that post well ! It coincides closely with what I do with d6 . THe D10 initiative as I recall was brought about in second edition , becuase it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . I knew several DM 's though before 2E was released , that had already been using this system for years ! Everyone does it their own way , whatever is easiest for the DM . I beleive that 's true of almost everything , because everyone 's mind works differently to interpret things . So my advice is to use the system that works for your group best , and add the things you need , such as weapon factors . <p> Actually , introducing d10-based initiative in AD&amp;D 2nd Edition does n't have anything to do with 10 segments in a round , because the 2nd Edition does n't use segments ! If you use the optional initiative rules , you add your initiative roll to your weapon speed , but the result is n't in " segments , " it 's just initiative order . I think they just wanted a less-grainy roll . 
@@59195480 @8195480/ <p> The 1E PHB really does a job of talking up the monk class ... but is it really an effective character option for low-mid level PCs ? The high level abilities definitely get very powerful , and the flavor of needing to defeat other monks in single combat to attain levels higher than 7th is excellent ( this kind of flavor is one of the main reasons I 'm switching my group back to 1st and 2nd Edition ) , but ... <p> To help with the AC problem at lower levels , the monk should look for bracers of defense and rings of protection , either of which can be worn by a monk . <p> Good advice , though I 'd kinda like to find a more accessible , non-magical aid to help a low level monk PC as well . I feel like my monk player might get a little frustrated , with too low HP and too high an AC to risk entering melee , and with not much useful to do from range other than fire a crossbow for several levels . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your game ) then a magic-user in the group could potentialy help the monk out with a casting of the 1st level spell armor , or an illsuionist could help him quite a bit more AC help with a phantom armor spell as long as the opponents do n't disbelieve it . ( both spells are touch range and have relativly long duration , both working until discharged by the reciepient acrueing a certain amount of damage ) . <p> Your moldy golem &amp; grubby zombies are after my own black heart cwslyclgh ! Hat 's off to you Genghisdon <p> There was a Dragon article that addressed the same issues you bring up , and offered a number of fixes for them . Unfortunately , they both increased the power level of the monk upwards to where it should be competative with the other classes , and they adjusted the experience point requirements down to better than a fighter . The combo made them overpowered . The article also increased max level to 21 ( but with similar power level at the PHB level 17 , maybe a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So yes , as written the monk is weak low-mid level , and has a hard time surviving until 10th+ when they 're actually impressive . <p> If you want to make changes , I 'd suggest either adjusting the xp requirements down ( this also helps them at higher levels when they have a roughly 50/50 chance of loosing a level everytime they try a trial by combat to advance ) , or allowing Dex/Str bonuses . I would not change their HD to d6 ( remember they eventually get 18 of them ) <p> As noted above , magical protection devices are critical to the monk . Not only does it lower their AC , but rings , cloaks , and other + to AC and saves are great because monks can dodge missiles and save for no damage - if they cam make a saving throw . <p> One of my house rules gives monks d6 hit dice and allows them to use a DEX bonus towards AC . Outside of that they have a tad of the magic user issue going , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point they start becoming powerful . <p> I 've found my house rule works out pretty well without giving them too much . <p> The key is to know how to use the monk tactically . Like the great sage once said , " You 've got to know when to hold ' em , know when to fold ' em ... <p> Seriously , knowing when to do what makes the monk a viable and even tough character at any level . <p> Know when to use your open hand attack , and when to use weapons . <p> Along with that first point goes knowing which weapon to use in a given situation , considering that you 'll eventually have more proficiencies than anybody else . Since your dexterity is at least 15 , which means that you have at least a dexterity only one point lower than that at which dual-wielding becomes viable , know when to use two weapons instead of one , and when no to . <p> Know when to charge , and whom to charge . Just as importantly , know when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear instead . <p> Know when to throw that spear . Know when to advance behind the cover of a steel-clad thug and strike from the second rank . <p> Finally , know when to best use one of the monks most under-rated abilities . Know when to grapple . <p> If you can make sound tactical decision in each combat to use the monk 's strengths against an enemy 's weaknesses most effectively , while preventing your foes from striking against the monk 's vulnerabilities , you will have a character that verily rocks ! <p> p.s . I do n't oppose allowing a monk to gain a dexterity bonus to armor class , as long as it does n't lower the monk 's AC below that granted by his level . In other words , use the better of the two but not both if you feel a monk must be strengthened in mellee at low levels . I advise against this though , as part of the coolness of a monk is to overcome the unique challenges of the class . <p> We had a largely BTB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful . It was best to think of him as " the survivor , " IMHO . He could n't go toe-to-toe in melee like a true tank . He could n't sneak quite as well as a rogue ( especially as the ' seeing in the dark ' problem coupled with magic item restrictions and the human-only limitation means that he had to suck several Infravision spells off of the wizards to be useful ) . He could n't heal as well as a cleric or control as well as a wizard . <p> What he could do was be stripped naked of his gear and still be moderately effective . The monk makes an excellent " fifth man " if you have all the key bases covered , or if you can hire henchmen to fill the gaps . His high speed created tactical mobility and the immunities that seem useless ( ESP , psionics , etc ) were very useful against many common foes in the underdark . <p> So , I think it is highly campaign dependent . Monks will be more effective when certain foes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> ChrisSage of the Major Field of Humankind , Specializing in History &amp; Politics <p> Without a halfway decent defensive magical item , its very difficult for a monk to make 6th or 7th level btb . Even a +1 cloak or ring of protection can make all of the difference . <p> But yes , you can not have a lower level monk charging into combat every time , because he is going to get crushed . As a skirmisher and a flanker , the monk can certainly shine . Using weapons versus heavily armored opponents is only logical , with the spear or falchion sword being a good bet . <p> I modified the class rather heavily for 2e to take advantage of the martial arts styles , and a monk that advances quickly can only help the party with his varied abilities . A lot of those abilities are personal , but can provide invaluable assistance in the right situation as was previously mentioned . <p> For the PHB monk I 'd modify the defensive/offensive capabilities as follows : allow str and dex bonuses but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monks is n't modified by dex but until the natural AC reaches AC 6 the dexterity score can have a positive effect , strength bonuses to damage can be used but then the skill bonus to damge is n't applicable . This makes use of good ability scores at lower levels until the skill and training of the monk exceeds the raw , unskilled abilities . <p> The Dragon monk is n't unbalanced . It 's the one I use for my campaign , and its not like I have everyone running to play one . For one , they are restricted to two , repeat TWO , magic items . And , they are religious , meaning they have to tithe . What Dragon did in a nut shell <p> 1 ) give max dex bonus to AC at 1st level , so a monk with 15 dex is treated like 18 dex and starts with AC6 , all around even rear AC . This improves one AC per level . <p> Seriously , knowing when to do what makes the monk a viable and even tough character at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character class , really . In my situation , though , I think it might be too much to ask from a player that 's never played 1E before , in a role that 's touted to be a highly-effective melee combatant ( IMO ) in the PHB . <p> In any case , I like a lot of the suggestions in this thread . I was leaning toward adjusting the monk XP table anyway , and I think I 'll probably do that while incorporating one or two of the other ideas as well . I think allowing the monk to take advantage of high Dex until it 's eclipsed by his natural AC is a nice improvement for the monk at low level . <p> Here 's one that Jerry taught me in one of these earlier threads : if you are going to play monks by-the-book , then you must use the weapon speed factor rules regarding free attacks . Open hand attacks have a speed factor of 1 . On a tied initiative against practically any weapon-wielding foe , they get a free first attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you the DM are really obliged to throw monks a bone in some other way . <p> I 'm with simak . The Dragon monk version is my choice too since many years . I only had a player rolling up one once since I decided to switch to it and I never got the impression of it being unbalanced ( the character survived until level . Instead it made the frustrating first levels more attractive and interesting to play . <p> For the PHB monk I 'd modify the defensive/offensive capabilities as follows:allow str and dex bonuses but not together with the monk bonuses , i.e natural AC of monks is n't modified by dex but until the natural AC reaches AC 6 the dexterity score can have a positive effect , strength bonuses to damage can be used but then the skill bonus to damge is n't applicable . This makes use of good ability scores at lower levels until the skill and training of the monk exceeds the raw , unskilled abilities . <p> M <p> of all the suggestions i have seen , i like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules for martial arts . Gives them a better AC until their level is up there . <p> And for those saying their HP is low . Well so is a thief or mages , and since they have 2d4hp + double con at first level , having a 16 con gives them the same max hp a a 1st level fighter with 16 con ... how is that weak . Also their Thac0 at first is the same . <p> Also , as i said in one of those linked threads .. <p> Quote : <p> As a possible ' compromise here ' what if we allowed them to use to hit and damage from STR on weapons , ONLY until their natural weapon bonus surpasses it .... that way they do n't overrule fighters at the higher levels .. <p> Also another good benefit to give , is the following .. <p> Quote : <p> This makes them way too potent . Heck , even at 17th level a OA Kensai is only equal to a +4 weapon with his CHOSEN weapon ... <p> Basically they are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to them using their open hand attacks , NOT weaponry . <p> Another thing i offered up ( and have used twice since then ) , was allowing them a limited lay on hands like power .. <p> Quote : <p> I can go with this .. say he can cure a number of hp equal to HIS current total per day on any number of people ... so if his curent totak is 10 he can split that up into five cures of 2hp each .. <p> Keep in mind that is CURRENT TOTAL ... <p> And while i am on the HP , i have compromised in the past allowign them to start out at 2d6 at first , then they are back down to D4 per levek there after . IMO granting them d6 all the way through is making them too tough . <p> You can not dodge what you do n't know is coming . You can not hit what you can not see ! <p> Here 's one that Jerry taught me in one of these earlier threads : if you are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon speed factor rules regarding free attacks .

Monks attack on the cleric table and save on the thief table . ( Typo that was never fixed in any of the printings of the PHB ) 2 . Distance weapons ( such as the crossbow ) benefit from the monk weapon damage bonus too.3 . Treat monks as clerics when psionic disciplines are used.4 . The 5 magic item limit does not pertain to one use items such as magic crossbow bolts or potions.5 .

Sure they do n't get that awesome +4 against unarmored opponents , but on the other hand they have a much better chance of hitting armored ones , so it 's a trade-off . Certainly a trade-off that leads to less flavor though . <p> Btw , even the strictly btb monk makes good dual-class combinations . Do n't think you 're going to win the duel to go up a level ? Dual-class out of there . No point in throwing xp away .

@@59195484 @8195484/ <p> I recently acquired copies of the original Epic of Aerth and Necropolis : and the Land of Aegypt books , which Gary Gygax wrote for the Mythus system ( a few years after he was forcibly divorced from AD&amp;D and Greyhawk ) . Of particular general interest is the Preface in Necropolis , which I thought I would share here . Despite the third-person references , the whole looks to me to have been written in narrative of Gygax sort , of course . ( Scotty , if you think I 'm overquoting , feel free to delete it , but I think this is very interesting to discuss . ) <p> Preface <p> Gary Gygax is a name familiar to game enthusiasts worldwide . An avid game player since early childhood , he began playing chess at age 6 . By the early 1950s , while a young teenager , he took up military miniatures gaming , and by the end of that decade he had begun playing conflict simulation boardgames . In 1968 , Gygax created and ran the first ever gaming convention , an event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest of its kind in the world . Gary moved on to create the roleplaying game form . He co-created and authored the first such game in 1974 , when the company he formed published the Dungeons &amp; Dragons work . <p> Gary freely admits that fantasy has been a principal interest in his life for nearly as long as he can remember . That genre , along with those of science fiction , historical adventure , and horror , has continually fascinated him . Thus , the vehicles devised by Gary over the years for the development of such tales , whether in story form or gaming action , have been many and varied . Using make-believe worlds as a basis , he has in the past created everything from futuristic space war simulations to political-military scenarios . His first major article in the gaming field , concerning the Battle of Gettysburg , was published in Avalon Hill 's General circa 1960 . His first game was a set of rules for medieval military miniatures battles , complete with a fantasy component , the work titled Chainmail , released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work to create a whole new setting for a fantasy game , that for the roleplaying sort he was then devising . He had , in fact , created many other such settings in the past , but this new one was vastly different from those of prior sort . From the cosmic milieu begun then sprung Dungeons &amp; Dragons , Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons , and World of Greyhawk as well as countless scenarios for game adventures in the many worlds of this " multiverse . " <p> Although he kept it a secret , Gygax based his Greyhawk campaign world on our own Earth , and set his beginning and center of action ( the City of Greyhawk--a lakeside metropolis faintly resembling Chicago ) on the North American continent . Later , when the publisher needed a campaign setting , Gary revised his whole fantasy milieu to fit the manufacturing specifications demanded , but kept as much of the scope and variety as possible whle retaining as secret the " world " of his ongoing gaming activities . He explains it this way : " When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered my actual setting so as to be able to pack in as much variety into a relatively small area--that constraint of printable map size--and provide an entirely different one than that I actually employed in my own play . After all , at that time some 30 or 40 participants were still involved in active play in that milieu ! " <p> Because of this radical change , players of the newly devised setting could not adventure into the fantasy " parallel world " lands so frequently enjoyed in Gygax 's own campaign . But while China , India , and Arabia , for example , were not offered , the reduced scope was imaginative and vibrant nonetheless . The published " world " proved to be exciting , its imagery captivating , and the whole most playable . " Meanwhile , " Gary relates , " I kept the ' real world ' --that is , the milieu of my own campaign--strictly to myself . After all , it just wo n't do to have players reading the private notes of the gamemaster , as it were ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were adapted from the private milieu over the years , the work as it existed was never revealed thereby . Active play in Gary 's campaign continued until the mid-1980s , and as long as the gaming continued thus , actual details of the milieu were retained as confidential . To have revealed very much would have ended the usefulness of the setting and brought the campaign to an untimely end . <p> Now this has changed , of course . A greater cosmos is being wrought ! In 1986 , Gary began working on a new way of roleplaying , culminating in the 1992 release of the Mythus game , the first published part of the new Dangerous Journeys multigenre roleplaying system . Not surprisingly , the new creation suits the old fantasy milieu very well indeed . <p> In the years since he began developing his new game system , Gygax has also revised and expanded his private campaign milieu . Why is this material being released ? " With a multiverse which includes all probability , time , and space , a whole universe besides the magickal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new game system with a scope equal to all that , there 's no fear of giving the show away ! " Gary points out . And so we shall begin to see more published material from the private Gygax campaign . One of the results of that capaign 's revision over the years has been a move of the campaign 's center to Aegypt on Aerth . And so you have this work ... <p> The Necropolis campaign scenario is the first campaign-length adventure done for the Epic of Aerth companion volume of the Mythus fantasy RPG ... There are a couple more paragraphs explaining that it is not for inexperienced parties. -- <p> I think this has been covered elsewhere , but I 'll give a quick precis of how the WoG World Setting published by TSR came about : <p> The company wanted a world setting for AD&amp;D , so I was asked if I could do that . When I agreed , I was given the maximum map size for the project . So I wnet to work and created the Flanaess and Oerik to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As much interesting and different material as possible packed into the space available . I used European-type states as the central theme , on the borderlands placed in more exotic ones . <p> Of course I did n't want to attempt depicting my own " World of Greyhawk , " that I used in the campaing then being runby Rob Kuntz and me , for two main reasons . First , it did n't fit the specs handed down to me for the project . Second , it would reveal too much to the large number of players then active in that world . <p> Aerth from the MYTHUS universe does reflect something closer to the globe of the world we then played , although the sytates given for Aerth are not those principally used in the campaign . <p> As a matter of fact , the maps in the WoG product were so handy , useful , and appealing , what happened was that in a very short time we moved play to Oerth , Oerik , and the Flanaess . The Village of Homlett , ToEE , and Stoink became centers of campaign activity 
@@59195486 @8195486/ <p> I think the reason it mentions it there is that in UA PC demihumans were finally allowed to become clerics . Though the PHB allows dwarf , halfling , and gnome clerics , it states that they are for NPCs only ( p 14 ) . The MM entries for each demihuman race also imply that multiclass cleric combinations are possible . Though I have never had to , I would allow PCs playing demihuman clerics ( caveat - their starting ages are obscene see DMG p.12 ) . Here 's what I would use ( reasoning for my changes will be in parentheses ) : <p> I believe that Half-elves are also permitted to become multi-classed Druids in every combination where they can become multi-classed Clerics ( except Druid/Ranger ) . That is , a Half-elf can become a Druid/Fighter , a Druid/Magic-user , or a Druid/Fighter/Magic-user . <p> I remember it was a sad day when I purchased UA hot from the press , opened it , and saw a section devoted to Drow and Duergar PCs .

Oh the fun ! ! <p> I have played a mind flayer before ( well half mind flayer/half human ) , the Illithid father never met the mother though . He was the product of an experiment byt a powerful emperor to breed human psionics .

I would recommend this race perhaps in a one off high-level game &gt;8th , to people who want something a bit different . Or perhaps in the adventure above . But this race or class should never become a regular in any game . <p> Arty , when you run your 3ed game , I renew my request for a Thessalhydra monk . 174048 @qwx584048 <p> Although I have been haunted of late of a scenario where a Githyanki force storms an illithid outpost . <p> Hmmmmm. 174048 @qwx584048 <p> It also says : " Note that this table enumerates all the possible class combinations for player characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must all be permissible . Some of these combinations may be disallowed by the Dungeon Master in his or her campaign . " <p> stuart ........ that illithid/human pc race sounds like fun.i know that if a player went to the trouble of designing a new race and providing all the relevant info i would be inclined to allow it in my games , providing it was well balanced in my and the other players opinions.on the subject of drow pc 's ....... we have one in our high level campaign and it has been an endless series of hassles and setbacks and persecution ... but it has been a challenge to us to overcome these obstacles , not to mention the fun of the ever increasingly dangerous run-ins with his former house members who have been sent to eliminate him i would recommend it purely for the challenge , but only for experienced players 
@@59195487 @8195487/ <p> I know that the DMG says that all magic armor is essentially weightless - the same as 1 layer of regular cotton- or wool-based clothing . What about swimming in it ? Metal is not going to retain water like cotton or wool . Obviously , if you 're in full plate mail , your mobility is going to be quite limited , but if the armor is weightless , would you still float ? <p> Also , I thought I 've read somewhere in the DMG that magic armor expands or contracts to fit the wearer . Am I recalling this correctly ? Since armor comes in basic " sizes " ( human-sized , dwarf-sized , etc. ) , do we assume that the magical ability to form-fit is limited - i.e. , magic armor originally created for a 5 ' 10 " human would n't fit a 4 ' 5 " dwarf ? <p> " I 'm happy to have reasonable access to boobs in exchange for not being able to stomach the idea of LARPing . " <p> No , the DMG gives odds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely saw the self-sizing magic armor . <p> As to the first question , I do n't recall 1E having any clear rules about this . 2E states explicitly that magic armor is non-encumbering for the wearer but still counts for weight when the wearer is on horseback etc . ( That is , the horse still has to carry the rider 's armor . ) I would interpret that to mean that the wearer ca n't effectively swim in armor . <p> For game purposes all magical armor should be considered as being virtually weightless - equal to normal clothing , let us assume . This gives characters so clad a base movement speed equal to an unarmored man . Magic shields , however , weigh the same as a normal shield of the same size . <p> It seems like the swimming issue would be one of mobility and not weight . I 'm going to keep looking for that form-fitting quote ... I 'm fairly certain it 's in there somewhere . <p> " I 'm happy to have reasonable access to boobs in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> For game purposes all magical armor should be considered as being virtually weightless - equal to normal clothing , let us assume .

There is no magical elfin chain mail . <p> I 'm pretty sure the description of magic armor expanding and contracting to fit the wearer you 're thinking of is from UA ( sorry do n't have the page ref ) and only applies to magical field and full plate ( and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being customized to the exact size and shape of the individual wearer ) . <p> The two different weight formulae for magic armor ( weightless on p. 164 , 50% weight on p. 28 ) is one of the two explicit self-contradictions I 've been able to find within the 3 core AD&amp;D books ( the other is the rate of natural healing between the PHB and DMG ) . The reference on p. 164 seems to be the one that 's pretty much universally accepted so I think we can safely declare the p. 28 reference as errata . <p> For game purposes all magical armor should be considered as being virtually weightless - equal to normal clothing , let us assume .

Does anyone know if this was ever fixed in any of the errata that was issued on the books ? <p> I actually use the unencumbered rule ( although half-weight is n't a bad idea , IMO ) . Wonder if any pre-gen characters in various modules would help out on this question , hmmm .... <p> T Foster is right : the statement about the form-fitting nature of magical armor is in UA , and even then restricted to full and field plate mail : <p> In either case , the dweomer of the armor is such that it will perfectly conform to the wearer 's physical dimensions , so long as the wearer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , any human can wear human-sized armor , any dwarf can wear dwarf-sized , etc . ) . ( UA , p.104 ) <p> Interesting distinction in the PHB and DMG . As a DM , I like the PHB ruling better . However , I really like the UA guideline on the magical plate ; I do n't see it being a big deal for all magical armor . <p> " I 'm happy to have reasonable access to boobs in exchange for not being able to stomach the idea of LARPing . " <p> I found this bit from the DMG ( p. 55 ) that answers the swimming in magic armor question and ( not surprisingly ) confirms Fiffergrund 's memory : <p> Quote : <p> Swimming will be impossible in any type of metal armor with the exception of magic armor . Any character wearing magic armor will be encumbered and the only stroke possible will be the dog paddle . It is possible to swim in leather or padded armor , but it is awkward and there is a 5% chance of drowning per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of drowning increases by 2% for every 5 pounds on the character 's person other than his or her leather or padded armor . This includes weapons , purses filled with gold and/or gems , backpacks and hard boots . One unsheathed dagger may be carried by the adventurer between his or her teeth . <p> This further quote from p. 56 also deals with the same subject : <p> Quote : <p> Swimming is not possible in any type of armor heavier than leather ( except magic armor ) , or when encumbered with more than 20 pounds of equipment of any type ( add or subtract 1 pound for each 100 g.p. worth of strength bonus or penalty ) . <p> Interesting question . I think T. Foster clears up the questions of mobility in magical armor . However , the question of magical armor changing dimensions to fit the wearer is problematic . I remember our pre-UA games having armor adjust to the wearer , I think it was 10% max . This was likely a house rule , and was taken from other DMs we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1E had a strong sub-culture of shared house rules that many adopted because that 's how " everyone else " seemed to be doing it . <p> The changes in armor size was a house rule we adapted from the person who introduced the game to us back in 79 ' . So , magic armor does not change in size pre UA . Gygax confirmed this to me in an e-mail .

Bone Hill and Assassin 's Knot are pretty dense modules , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered if Mr. Lakofka had n't originally planned on writing , for example , a big overland portion for L3 , but stopped when the project was initially cancelled . <p> This story has been told before , but here 's the gist of it . Len did indeed have a rough draft of L3 that gathered dust for almost 20 years . In 1998-99 , WOTC ( shortly after their buyout of TSR ) sent one of their staff writers ( whose name I do n't know ) to California to work with Len on " polishing " the manuscript for publication in the Silver Anniversary boxed set . <p> Then , in one of those weird karmic twists that seem to keep biting Len in the ass , the completed manuscript was somehow " lost " between California and Wisconsin . ( The TSR staff had n't moved to Washington yet . ) Since , I assume , WOTC did n't want to fly the writer back to California ( and , presumably , further compensate Len for his time ) , L3 was essentially ghostwritten ( from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the published version was not Len 's original treatment and remains something of a sore subject for him . <p> Interestingly there was just a discussion at the Greyhawk area about the L series and Spindrift Isles maps where I said basically the same thing I am saying right now ... <p> I never played the U series , although I plan to do it soon when I start a new campaign in September . I have played the L series twice , and both times placed it in the Wild Coast , which I believe is a much better starting place for a campaign than either Keoland or Lendore , both of which are a little bit too off-the-road for me ( Lendore more so than Keoland , obviously ) . This requires a bit of changing in the southern area of the Wild Coast , but works well , since the Coast is also believed to have strong Suloise influences in the past which would explain the Suel Gods temples in Restenford area . Or you can change the deities fairly easily . I also think that Dunwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I am a Wildcoastophile ! ) <p> In fact , now that I mention it , there is a potential to create a mega-campaign in the Wild Coast area using these and other modules . <p> Characters would finish the L and U series , any order the DM deems best . They defeat the sahuagin and discover that the smugglers are in fact Slavers who are also working to destabilize the area ( maybe a yellow sail hidden in the cargo hold ... ) : Perhaps the merchant councillor of Saltmarsh is a contact for the Slavers ... Similarly , the assassins of Garroten maybe influenced/controled by the Scarlet Brotherhood . <p> From these two series they jump to the A series . This is in my opinion a much better " linkage " than the lame ( a posteriori , in fact ) linking of TOEE with the Slavers series . <p> Also , you can even connect Dwellers of the Forbidden City with the campaighn , by making it an island a third of the way or so southeast of Wild Coast to the Tilvanost Peninsula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is trying to gain an alliance with some of the monsters ( the yuan ti ? ) . Also , the lizardmen from U2 may be connected to the island , and the Earth Dragon ( from the Slavers series ) may have some connection , or rivalry , to the island . <p> L3 can be dropped in as a lateral adventure . <p> Addmitedly , I am not sure this will work as is ( I do n't have Dwellers and it 's been a while since I 've read these modules ) . I may give this a try for my upcoming campaign . If anyone has ideas , please , shoot away ! ! <p> Somewhere I read that the magic-user in Dwellers of the Forbidden City is actually an agent of the Scarlet Brotherhood . There is nothing about this in the module itself ( in the " suggested adventures " section , one of the proposed ideas is of a " Black Brotherhood " allied to the yuan-ti ) . I do n't think this bit about the Scarlet Brotherhood was anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . <p> A connection between the smugglers of U1 and slavers of A1-4 is a reasonable one , although you would have to come up with a plausible way of bringing the players back around to Saltmarsh to pursue the origins of the smugglers , as U2 and U3 will then almost be a side-treck from the smuggler/slaver campaign . <p> Well ... the focus of U1-3 ends up being the invasion by the sahauigin . The focus of L1-2 is the political intrigue , and the hiring of assassins by the mayor . <p> The slavers employ assassins ( two of the slave lords are , in fact , an assassins ) . <p> So if you 're basing your campaign around Saltmarsh , and effectively turning Restenford into either Saltmarsh or Saltmarsh 's parent community ( the larger town nearby where Saltmarsh gets much of it 's goods , etc ) , the players are going to be near Saltmarsh anyway . <p> It would make sense that the assassins hired by the mayor are connected to the Slavers . You could also work an angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their planned invasion of Saltmarsh - to get slaves to eat and sell off the rest to the Slave Lords , with whom they have a tentative agreement . <p> The slaver angle is that by eliminating some of the key players in and around Restenford , it will destabilize the area enough so that the sahaugin can attack , carrying off various captives for the slavers . The mayor , who is in league with the slavers , can then step up into the power vaccuum caused by the removal of the duke and his family ... which is good for the slavers , as they get someone sympathetic to their aims in power ( providing them another base to work with ) and good for the mayor ( who achieves power heretofore unobtainable ) , and good for the sahauigin , who get crunchings and munchings with little risk to themselves ( after all , someone has to capture the slaves ... and not all of them will be fit for the block ... ) <p> Interesting idea . You could replace the lizard men on the Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U3 , bypassing U2 completely . Of course , a group going from U1 straight to U3 would be completely massacered . Even if , I suspect , you found a way to run N1 in between . 
@@59195491 @8195491/ <p> Strange topic I know , but I was wondering if anyone has any bad / funny now , but not then experiences ? <p> My worst was when I was guest DMing for a friend . I told him that I would run a 6 hour game based on the OAD&amp;D module Ravenloft . The group seemed very excited and I went along one Saturday and run it . <p> The game started very well , all the players seemed very good roleplayers and handled all the situations and encounters well . So I desided to step up the game and use my own material ( which usually goes down much better ) . <p> Afterwards the players were not so happy , so I asked one of them what they thought of the game and they said . " Well it started off well , then you seemed to lose the plot about " . I asked " in what way ? " and then at least 2 of them got copies of the module out of their bags and started to show me where I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and got copies of the module before the game and read it back to front ! I was not a happy frog that day ! <p> Well , I will try and not include any incriminating information in my worst D&amp;D experience . It was many years ago when I was young and dumb and had a hot temper . Mind you , I do not advocate Gaming Room Brawls ... but here is my cleaned up version of my worst time . <p> The year was 1993 I was trying to shag this gaming chick that I met at college . Soon after I met her , she invited me and my brother ( a long time gamer ) to play D&amp;D at a local gaming shop with her group . I had never played with these guys but the DM had a good reputation so we jumped at the chance . <p> Our first sign that there might be trouble was when we were given fifth level NPC to take over and everyone else entered with god-like beings . Heck , one guy in the party played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I laughed at the thought of a L-G paladin sharing a drink with a death knight . But the DM explained it was ok because the Death Knight had a ring of obscure alignment . <p> SO ... the game started and immediately the halfling thief in the party sent the DM a secret note . The DM informed him to make a roll and he failed . The DM then informs me that my character , a fighter/thief detects the halfling trying to steal my coin purse . What a nice way to start an adventure . <p> Now , my brother , you must know , is a BIG DUDE . And he had always wanted to say ONE line in a real life scrum . So after the Death Knight and the Paladin had wrested down my thief and stole all of his gear , the actual players started to threaten us . They said that if we did n't like it we could leave or get a beatin ' . After a few minutes of name calling between the regulars and me , my brother passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DM . I will take the rest ! <p> One player , the fatty that played the Death Knight , tossed a d20 at me , hitting me in the chest . <p> That is when my bro gave me a wink . <p> He tossed the gaming table across the store , dice and papers scattering every which way and said to the six twenty-somethings about us , " One at a time or ALL AT ONCE ... Makes no difference to me boys ! " <p> A grand melee erupted with guys leaping on my brother 's back and much chairs flying . I leaped up and duked up to the DM . He looked at me wide eyed , grabbed his Three Ring Compendium , turned tail and high kneed right out the door . <p> I turned about to witness my brother wielding one of the pencil necked geeks as a club , keeping the others at bay . We both backed our way out of the store and bolted for home . <p> Needless to say , we were neither welcome in that game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool gaming chick ( who sat there stunned the entire time ) <p> There was one time where I was doing a short 2 session adventure I had modified from one published in a magazine . <p> It was a wilderness adventure and one guy , who was playing an elven thief must have been bored ( he seemed to be the only one ) . I tried my best to include him in what was going on , but he was just plain awkward - he wanted to get up to all sorts of mischief and I think he was trying it on because I was not the usual DM . <p> I culminated in him being so bored in the final confrontation at the end of the adventure that he started throwing forks at the miniatures . Obviously I was not amused ( nor were the rest of the players ) and I made it clear what I thought . <p> I am a pretty laid back guy , but I was extremely annoyed and it 's probably the closest I have come to wanting to hit somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well , I 've had it go real bad on numerous occasions through the years ranging from sour grapes explosions to guys who just do n't shut their mouth for one second . <p> But in the end it was probably all worth it as it 's made me screen new players intensely . But even then some " abberant personalities " have slipped through the " shields " due to their years and years of advanced roleplaying techniques . <p> My worst experience as a player was when I was brought through the Companion-level module CM1 " Test of the Warlords " with my uncle ( who is two years older than me ) . I had a 21st level Cleric/20th level Magic-User , and a 22nd level thief . My uncle had the freaking Grandmaster of Flowers ( 17th level monk ) and Saint Kargoth , the Patron Saint of Death Knights ( from Dragon Magazine ) , a 22nd-and-change-level Anti-Paladin . <p> Needless to say , it was n't much of a " test . " We were unstoppable . At one point , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonsense . Instead , we stormed the walls and completely overwhelmed an entire army of giants . It was like scene out of a John Carter of Mars story , with an actual mountain of dead bodies . My thief fought hand-to-hand , for pete 's sake , with his twin short swords of sharpness . It was a massacre . <p> I have never seen anyone have an actual nervous breakdown , but I believe I came close . The crucial plot development of the module mandated that a certain princess ( who else ? ) be kidnapped by the Head Bad Guy . No matter what the poor DM tried , we effortlessly frustrated his every attempt . In the end , in a last desperate attempt , he sent in the Head Bad Guy , with an even dozen huge , ancient white dragons , each ridden by a type V demon . <p> St. Kargoth turned the demons , the monk and mage stomped on the dragons and my thief backstabbed and slew the Head Bad Guy in a single round . The DM swept the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **** expletive deleted yourselves ! " and stormed out . We never finished CM1 , and learned how silly god-like adventures are . <p> My worst experience as a DM came when I was very young and impressionable . I was forced by the other players to run " White Plume Mountain . " At the end of the module , the player 's decided not to give the weapons back . And , armed with Wave , Whelm and Blackrazor , they crushed every amateur attempt of mine to part them . They then forced me to bring these same monty-haul players through adventures for a good year and a half , until the Fiend Folio was released and I introduced them to 1 ) The Hound of I 'll Omen , and 2 ) The Magnesium Spirit ( snicker ) . <p> The second worst DMing experience was trying to make heads and tails of the Dragonlance series . We played the modules as they were being released . Unfortunately , it appears that it was the DL series that hammered the final nail in TSR 's editorial staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out things that REALLY needed to be known in earlier modules , etc . <p> Only one experience of a player buying the module I was bringing them through . During Dragonlance , the mystery of where the draconians came from and why the good dragons were n't helping drove the players crazy . Finally , one player ( the same poor guy who attempted to DM CM1 ) bought the novels and ruined the storyline for everybody . W*nker ! <p> I think my worst experience as a player was taking 3 x 1 hour sessions simply to walk to the top of a mountain . Now normally i would n't mind this , thinking of action , adventure , adversity against the elements , skillful negotiation of mountain obstacles and maybe an encounter . How wrong was i , it was 3 hours of solid waling with the DM punctuation our rather bored existances every so often with ..... you continue walking and get a bit higher ..... arghhhhh . Still , that soon disolved for an adventure a tad more exciting . <p> While our current group is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown head seeking money pot in my youth ( not anything to do with my present friends whom are all most agreeable ) . The only other physical tension is when Jeremy gets a bit frustrated with the plot , i think the destruction count is up to 3 snapped pencils and one shredded T-shirt which he was wearing at the time ( i 'm rather proud of that one ) , still he does enjoy the high stakes really and after a deep breath is right back in the adventure . <p> the worst experience for me as a player was playing in a ( former ) freinds campaign . over 12 years we brought our characters from 1st to 25th+ level through a brilliant storyline to the point that having saved the world we were just about to save the whole universe . the dm told us before we started this particular session that there would probably be only one more session after this one to complete the whole campaign . after the session ( which was great ) an argument between the dm and one of the players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( final ) session and over the course of the next few weeks he failed to reply to any of our contacts and we found out that he moved to the other end of the country . this was bad from a d&amp;d point because we never got to play the final encounter ( we had had a pretty good idea of what was involved for two years ) . i can only liken it to having great sex and missing out on the climax ! <p> as a dm - watching a player break down in tears as his first ( 1st level ) character got killed ( by an orc ) - admittedly he was only 14 and obviously very emotional - never the less , not nice - he was inconsolable and only came back to play two months later . <p> I have to say that the worst experience I ever had was being a player in a DRAGONLANCE campaign , where the DM would not allow anything to happen that was not firmly in the plot line or allow anyone to do anything that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation . Frankly , we might as well have sat there and asked , " What would you like us to do now ? " Needless to say , the whole thing was an unmitigated disaster , it did not last the distance and it severely tried our otherwise calm outlook ! <p> My worst experience as a DM was about 13 years ago when I volunteered to DM City-State of the Invincible Overlord for a local gaming convention . Note this was not the original Judge 's Guild version , but the recently released ( at the time ) Mayfair boxed set . The primary plot was an incremental Drow takeover of the city that the PCs were supposed to stop . A friend of mine was coordinating the Drow takeover , and had a list of 40-odd moves that the Drow would engage in to consolidate the city . <p> Now , the first problem was that the convention coordinator went behind my back and advertised the demo game as a " bring your own character " . I spent the first hour and a half of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 45th level fighter/magic user/Sons of Thor ( with Daddy 's hammer ! ) or the 27th level bard centaur bastard twin of Apollo . When these characters were reduced to mere demi-god status ( ! ) the game began ... <p> The PCs then spent the balance of the game either fighting in the gladitorial pits , hitting the taverns , or getting laid while the Drow took over the city . I remember well the sad look in Mike Haskin 's face ( the Drow coordinator ) as he tried to delay handing me the next segment of the takeover , knowing that it would simply end the game that much sooner on these idiots . And guess what ? The Drow took over the city ! ! ! <p> The worst player experience I must say was n't mine but a game I was watching instead . Another friend of mine , who normally runs good Call of Cthulhu games , was running an AD&amp;D game for my wife and two of her female friends . The entire game was spent with the DM telling the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the adventure . The ladies did their best to try to come up with original strategies and tactics for defeating the orc horde , but the DM constantly would reply , " No , you do n't want to do that , " or " Your character does n't think that 's a good idea . " And so ... I 'm amazed they did n't kill the DM . <p> I do n't know if this is necessarily the worst AD&amp;D experience , but definitely the most interesting . Picture it : The summer of ' 86 , I am all of 14 years of age , DMing the classic module I6 Ravenloft for my best friend Randy Godkin . What is Randy 's first action after digesting the intro material that I just read him : to set off for the town of Barovia , the land that Strahd is subjugating , and then to begin burning it to the ground . Apparently , he had become intent on allying himself with Strahd , and thought that his act of pyromania would please the ages-old vampire lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , forcing me to rewrite large portions of it on the fly . To make a long story short , in the end Strahd was far from impressed with Randy 's act of good faith , level draining him almost to the point of death . Lesson learned for Randy : A vampire is interested only in slaves not allies ! <p> My worst was when I was guest DMing for a friend . I told him that I would run a 6 hour game based on the OAD&amp;D module Ravenloft . The group seemed very excited and I went along one Saturday and run it . <p> The game started very well , all the players seemed very good roleplayers and handled all the situations and encounters well .

" Well it started off well , then you seemed to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ? " and then at least 2 of them got copies of the module out of their bags and started to show me where I went off the rails . <p> It seems that they rushed out and got copies of the module before the game and read it back to front ! I was not a happy frog that day ! <p> Anyone else ? <p> This is one of the funniest things I 've read on this website . <p> <p> Gary Gygax wrote : <p> Players seeking the early death of their characters should be quite satisfied with The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth , for there are many opportunities for the foolish or rash to end it all . <p> Though not game related , we had been playing for a while , about 3 months , weekly . I had 6 players . Only one female . Any way , long story short , it turned out that her boyfriend was also her half-brother . Freaked us all out . I knew her father , from another game , and I mentioned them when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them again .. <p> ----------Current characters on DRAGONSFOOT Gorbit human thief Emetix pbpRoland , The Brave In the Shadow of the Ogre Wars PBP Game . <p> I used to game with group in high school . The DM of the group , a guy named Adam , had " inherited " the mantle of DM from a guy named Matt . Apparently Matt had been an amazing DM , but st some point he had moved away . So Adam picked up where Matt had left off . Unfortunately , Adam was a lousy DM . <p> As I came into this group with my friend Jason , we were basically intruding on something that was not quite a campaign ( there was no established setting or continuity ) but was instead a sort of loose games set withing this massive collection of house rules . This might have been just fine except that there rules were not written down , they were just assumed to be known to everybody ( even though Adam was the only one who really knew them all ) . <p> All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because Adam was the only other DM I knew . Still , I was determined to try my own hand at DMing , because I wanted to DM the sort of game that I wanted to play . So I started DMing my own campaign within the group , and Adam settled in as one of the players . <p> Unfortunately , Adam was always undermining my authority and trying to DM from the players side of the table . It would drive me absolutely crazy when he would assume that his house rules ( which I could not possibly know ) applied to MY campaign . There was a never-ending arguement about the rules , and he would rules-laywer everything insisting on the sanctity to the monster manuals and the game as written , EXCEPT where his own house rules proved to be more in his favor . It was , in short , a nightmare to play with this guy . Eventually , I just started DMing my own games with a few players from that group and some other guys that we rounded up that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events stand out most in my mind from the games that we played . These may give you a bit of insight into his style . <p> Game A : <p> We were exploring a dungeon as lowly 2nd level characters when we came across a jewelled skull sitting on the floor . Knowing this guy , and knowing that we were expected to metagame , I knew this was a demilich . I even yelled out " Do n't touch it ! It 's a Demilich ! " to the other players . Of course , the guy playing the paladin gave it a poke with his sword and it did it 's death-wail thing and killed everybody in the party EXCEPT the paladin who messed with it . <p> Yes , this was a DM whose idea of fun was to have a freakin ' DEMILICH as a random encounter in a dungeon for level 2 PCs . <p> Granted , the paladin was also somewhat to blame for being blatantly stupid , but I placed the primary blame on the DM for not using monsters sensibly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just handwaved it and had our characters raised back in town . So what was the whole point of that encounter ? Every game with this guy was full of nonsensical crap like this . <p> Game B : <p> We were told to roll up some high-level characters for a special one-off game . Cool , whatever . <p> We were told we would be at 18th level , so I made up an elven enchanter ( 2E specialty wizard ) just because I thought it would be fun to play . I specifically was NOT looking to make the most powerful character possible . I was also given a few random magic items , none of them particularly memorable or useful for the scenario we played . <p> The scenario turned out to be quite simple : All of our characters were thrown into an arena to fight to the death , and the winner would receive a very powerful magic item . Most of the other characters died very quickly . I was able to survive by being very sneaky about the spells I used , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The other guy that survived was a barbarian . This was not a newly created character , but rather a legacy character that the player had been using in this campaign for years . If I recall correctly , he was over 20th level , and he had a ton of very powerful magic items , much more than my pathetic enchanter had , and most of them FAR more useful and dangerous . <p> The real doozy was the barbarian 's magical sword . Not only was it a potent weapon in it 's own right , but it could cast every single spell in the magic user list once per day . <p> Needless to say I was hopelessly outclassed . This guy was a better fighter AND a better wizard than I was and had three times as many points . I was able to survive for a long time actually , by being *very* clever in the spells I used . But eventually I was worn down by attrition . Every time I had the upper hand , he had exactly the spell he needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really annoyed at the way this worked out . I was playing brilliantly and creatively , and I lost because the other guy was simply brokenly powerful at everything . This is reflective of Adam 's DM style because this sort of thing happened all the time . Not only did he blatantly favor long-term players in his games , but he would often use these little one-offs just to power one of these super-characters up another notch . We were n't there for a fair fight , we were there to be beaten by his favored PCs . <p> I 've had two that comes to mind , as far as play experiences . The first was a DM running a lovingly crafted " plot " adventure where no deviation from the pre-designed chain of events and encounters was allowed . About midway through , everyone was pretty fed up with it and just stopped caring . Ended up with the DM getting offended and pissed off and inflicting a TPK ( which was actually pretty welcome at that point ) . The second was a DM who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got no problem with judgment calls and variety and rulings and such , but this was just " pull it out of your butt " whimsy and chaos . And stuff like being set to receive the charge of a monster we heard coming , and then when it charges us the DM rolling " for surprise " and declaring that it surprised us and gets a free round of attacks . There were a few comments like " I thought we heard it , and saw it coming ... " and " ... we were set to receive the charge , how could it surprise us , dodge our spears , and get a free round of attacks ? " I just kept my mouth shut and endured it . <p> Worst game I DM 'd was an attempt to use a hobgoblin encounter from one of the books of lairs . The PCs made a rather misguided and uninspired attempt to sneak into the lair , failed , and ended up getting trapped by an entire tribe of hobgoblins . Then they refused to surrender . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't expect the PCs to fight the whole tribe , and I know the players were frustrated and did n't have fun . Maybe I should have made it more apparent that these guys were organized and dangerous , not something to be taken lightly . I think the players were used to encounters being bite-sized kind of things that they 're *supposed* to tackle head-on , and this was more of a challenge ( they were scouting and mapping the area for a local potentate ) . What made this one bad in my mind was n't necessarily that the PCs screwed up and failed ( that happens , and can even make for good/fun gaming ) , but that the players were upset about it and felt they got a raw deal . <p> I had a humongous spate of godawful AD&amp;D experiences from ridiculously overpowered NPC favorites , impenetrably impossible to follow Ravenloft " adventures " wherein the party would get killed by the mega-villain , to tiresome overland journeys where the DM pretty much just picked monsters from the MM until finally at some point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in town and pretty much did nothing ... there were years wherein I was playing Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons and never set foot into a dungeon . All " plot " based with the crappiest plots on record . <p> <p> Bagpuss wrote : <p> You know Prince of Happiness got it right first time the rest of this thread is just filler . <p> I 've had a handful . I honestly wish I had some of the bad experiences some of you have had ... for the humor factor at least . I guess I was pretty lucky in most of the groups I 've bumped into were composed of relatively normal people . <p> I had a DM who had a group of older players that had been playing the " senior " version of their campaign . There was a big bad dragon that was the ultimate goal of their campaign . They were gon na go to his lair and take him out and win their campaign . Since I was the oldest and most knowledgeable of the " younger " crew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play the dragon and set up the final encounter . The real reason was because they all played 1E and I had access to the 2E books . He was hoping with all the extra material , I could pose a challenge for these guys . <p> Well , no . I could not . Each of the players had stacks of papers full of magic items that they had found . It was deliriously Monty Haul and , since I was n't allowed to look their sheets over before the encounter , I was hopelessly outmatched . I had a big 2E maxed out red dragon plus dozens of all the other colors , baatezu/tanarri and other fun stuff . Because of their magic items , they were pretty much immune to dragons and could send baatezu/tanarri back to their planes . Every thing I tried to do , these guys had counters for . So for a few hours , we stood around the table throwing dice and shooting down everything I came up with . <p> When I finally gave in and just let them kill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Champions " . They had rolled up a celebratory joint and each cracked open a 40 oz of Mickey 's . I was happy for them , especially in retrospect . At the time , I was like " you guys are really stoked you cheated at a game and won ? why bother ? " But they were stoked . Something they had been working on 2 nights a week for 2-3 years had finally been resolved . <p> But honestly , if this was my worst experience , I 've never had a really bad one , yet . <p> <p> Gary Gygax wrote : <p> Players seeking the early death of their characters should be quite satisfied with The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth , for there are many opportunities for the foolish or rash to end it all . <p> Well , I will try and not include any incriminating information in my worst D&amp;D experience .

I will take the rest ! <p> One player , the fatty that played the Death Knight , tossed a d20 at me , hitting me in the chest . <p> That is when my bro gave me a wink . <p> He tossed the gaming table across the store , dice and papers scattering every which way and said to the six twenty-somethings about us , " One at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me boys ! " <p> A grand melee erupted with guys leaping on my brother 's back and much chairs flying . I leaped up and duked up to the DM . He looked at me wide eyed , grabbed his Three Ring Compendium , turned tail and high kneed right out the door . <p> I turned about to witness my brother wielding one of the pencil necked geeks as a club , keeping the others at bay . We both backed our way out of the store and bolted for home . <p> Needless to say , we were neither welcome in that game store for a while nor did I score with that cool gaming chick ( who sat there stunned the entire time ) <p> Way back in the day - 1981 or 1982 , when I was 15-16 - there were several different groups I played AD&amp;D with , many of us took turns DM'ng , sometimes porting characters from group to group , but no coherent campaigns . <p> Anyway , one time some friends decided to run through the Judges Guild module @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th + ) it sounded like fun . This guy Mark , who only played , wanted to DM and we agreed ; he was usually pretty cool , though a smartass . <p> There were five or six of us players , some with two PC 's , so there were 8 or 9 characters . Everything started off OK , we enter a gate , down a long long huge tunnel , dead souls around , and we see it 's end - Hell awaits ! <p> First thing we see , in the distance , a citadel with gate . I do n't remember what exactly we tried to do , but I remember some of us trying to scale a side wall . Well , we get spotted by a Pit Fiend , combat ensues , and things are n't going that great - Mark is being a hardass regarding spell effects , initiative , getting potions , whatever . Before the Pit Fiend and it 's little horde are finished , Mark rolls percentile dice , flashes a huge grin , and says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a valiant but extremely futile fight and were all pissed off after the TPK was over . He just enjoyed being an ass about it and wanted to tear up all of our character sheets , since we were all dead - in Hell , with no chance of resurrection . <p> We refused , took our sheets , and left . I do n't think we ever even played another game with him again , except in school-sponsored tournaments . <p> There were a few comments like " I thought we heard it , and saw it coming ... " and " ... we were set to receive the charge , how could it surprise us , dodge our spears , and get a free round of attacks ? " I just kept my mouth shut and endured it . <p> Lol , that 's pretty good , I 've played with people like that . Fun times .... <p> Quote : <p> Worst game I DM 'd was an attempt to use a hobgoblin encounter from one of the books of lairs . The PCs made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , failed , and ended up getting trapped by an entire tribe of hobgoblins . Then they refused to surrender . TPK , of course . I felt bad ; I did n't expect the PCs to fight the whole tribe , and I know the players were frustrated and did n't have fun . Maybe I should have made it more apparent that these guys were organized and dangerous , not something to be taken lightly . I think the players were used to encounters being bite-sized kind of things that they 're *supposed* to tackle head-on , and this was more of a challenge ( they were scouting and mapping the area for a local potentate ) . What made this one bad in my mind was n't necessarily that the PCs screwed up and failed ( that happens , and can even make for good/fun gaming ) , but that the players were upset about it and felt they got a raw deal . <p> I think this was your fault for training your players to rush into encounters that they knew would be beatable . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win , they did what they were trained to do , assuming that you would n't give them something they could n't handle . <p> Do n't feel bad , I 'm guilty of the same thing . <p> As I started exploring the old-school style of D&amp;D I realized that , over time , there was a pronounced tendency to make the game design easier and easier for the players , especially as complex plots grew in importance . It 's gotten to the point where 4E is basically D&amp;D on rails . <p> So I started going back to an old-school style of game design , revising the way I do creatures and encounters . Instead of giving the PCs level-appropriate encounters that can always be beaten by a clever party , I run some encounters that can not be dealt with . Scenarios where the only way to win is to flee . <p> This will occasionally result in a TPK . That 's pretty rare though . This usually only happens to noob players who do n't understand the game . Once they get the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This actually makes the game much more exciting because the players will start thinking strategically about every fight , weighing the odds of winning versus the potential rewards . They also start getting smart . When they realize they ca n't solve every encounter by fighting , they start thinking outside the box . They 'll start instigating fights between other monsters , setting up ambushes , and using diplomacy and building alliances . <p> I also think this is much more fun for the players . When they rush heedlessly into combat , the combat usually goes to the side with the best math . When they start using tactics and strategy , the players choices are much more likely to effect their chances of success and failure . You 're giving them greater agency to act within the game , and by not giving them easy fights , you 're making them earn their success which makes their victories that much sweeter . <p> Worst experience for me is easy . While I was at DeVry I was in a large gaming group that played in the dorms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of PCs fluctuated between 2 and 12 . We had one guy that played for a while that just had a weird vibe . He made everyone around him uncomfortable without even saying a word , and when he talked he was creepier even if he did n't say anything creepy . Then came the weirdness . <p> At first it was minor stuff , like we look at his seat on his turn and he 's just gone . He was constantly running to the bathroom and had an uncanny ability to slip out of a room with nobody noticing . No " I 'll be right back " , he 'd just disappear . <p> Then was the lightsaber incident , having his jedi stick his lightsaber up the villian 's bum and then turning it on . <p> Then came the outhouse incident ( for which I thankfully was n't present ) . Apparently one of the PCs had to use the outhouse when he heard a noise underneath it . He looked down inside and there was a guy yanking it under the outhouse . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outhouse ; hip deep in human waste . <p> Then came the gimp incident . We let him run a game again for some reason and my male character nearly got raped by a man in a gimp suit , ala Pulp Fiction . This should have been the last straw , but we decided to have a conversation with him and he promised to behave . <p> The last straw was actually him just not showing up for a month of games without explanation , we figured he just decided to move on . Then one night he randomly showed up and he was informed we 'd prefer it if he did n't game with us anymore . His response was to take advantage of the fact I was busy preparing to run the session while someone else was talking to him and throwing a backpack at my face . As I caught a blur in the corner of my eye and moved away from the bag he rushed in and sucker punched me in the face . As he continued to flail away at me screaming " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lungs I managed to catch and immobilize his fists and everyone jumped on him and pulled him away . He went running off into the night and was never heard from again . <p> When we were kids , after school and before our parents came home from work ( yes , they locked us out of the house ) we use to play up in the rafters of the garage . One of the players , obviously forgetting about the cramped conditions we were playing in , jerked upward and managed to hit one of the many extra long shingling nails hard enough to drive it into his shoulder blade . Of course all pandemonium ensued and another guy ended up falling out of the rafters and braining himself on the concrete floor , and another , jumping from the rafters , did a really good number on his ankle . So my neighbour ( who already was n't really fond of us ) , had to take 3 of us to the hospital ... We pretty much could n't play for the next 3 or 4 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why are you so fat ?

@@59195494 @8195494/ <p> Is the base movement rate for all unarmored and un encumbered player characters 12 " regardless of their race ? I noticed in the DM guide that they list 12 " as the highest base movement rate for someone in leather , or elfin chainmail . I also looked in the PHB and it shows the highest base movement rate of 12 " assuming someone is carrying about 35# . Then I looked in the Monster Manual and saw that the base rate for elves was 12 " including their armor ( I am assuming they where elfin chainmail ) . The movement rate for gnomes and dwarves was 6 " ( suppose they have shorter strides and wear heavy armor ) and the movement rate for halflings was 9 " ( suppose they have shorter strides but wear lighter armor ) . <p> And do n't forget halflings have a base rate of 9 " . I think the movement rates in the MM are for examples of typically encountered individuals of each race . It 's not written anywhere , but I consider the base rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 9 " . Scott <p> When working out what player characters can do , do n't look at the Monster Manual . It was written first , and is more focused on creatures that are troops or adversaries of the player characters . <p> All player characters have a base movement rate of 12 " , assuming light equipment , no matter what their race . <p> 12 " movement rate is 120 feet per turn . That 's agonizingly slow , and assumes the character is trying to be quiet , mapping , and keeping a sharp eye out for trouble . <p> Halflings and other short characters ' base movement rates will not be slower than this . The base is so slow that anybody could keep up with it . It gets slower with encumbrance because of the difficulty in moving quietly , carefully , and in mapping while carrying a lot of bulky equipment . <p> It does not make any sense for shorter characters to naturally move slower than this already very slow movement rate . <p> This has bothered me off and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just puzzling through it again for my next campaign . I finally decided ( with a little prodding from Stormcrow ) to keep a base 12 " for all major PC races . <p> If you need to reconcile/rationalize it with the values in the MM ( I know I did ) maybe thinking of it like this would help ... <p> Halflings are listed as typically wearing leather or padded , and having an AC of 7 . This implies the use of a shield by the infantry , and perhaps studded leather by the archers . Padded &amp; Shield would result in a base 9 " ( down from 12 " ) --as would studded leather . <p> Dwarves require a bit more in the way of mental gymnastics . They are listed as being armoured with chain &amp; shield , and having an AC of 4 . The armour gives a base move of 9 " ( down from 12 " for our purposes ) --which leaves 3 " unaccounted for . I would suggest that most Dwarves that are encountered away from their homes tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the Dwarf wearing a backpack ! ) --perhaps so much so that they drop down to the next encumbrance category ? <p> Anyway , it works for me <p> EDIT : Just noticed your handle--so I suppose I should consider Gnomes ( not something I 've had to do for Basic D&amp;D ) ... <p> Huh , never noticed that before ... I always assumed they wore studded leather or ringmail with shield for an AC of 6--but they wear heavily reinforced leather with shield for an AC of 5 ! <p> I guess this could solve the problem if we assume that this description refers to scale armour instead . This would give the requisite AC of 5 when combined with a shield , and also account for the base move of 6 " . <p> I ca n't remember where its written --- or maybe it 's just a house rule -- but Halflings , Gnomes and other short critters move at 9 " in my game , Humans , Elves and their ilk move at 12 . " Even though 120 per turn is slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than a man will move faster than 12 " -- slower creatures will move slower than 12 " As long as it remains constant ( i.e. : I have a hard time picturing Frodo outrunning Strider or Legolas ) , you can make 12 " mean whatever you want to -- for example . it could mean 12 miles in 3 hours . The 120 per turn always seemed slow to me -- but the rules also state that this is exploring speed . If characters are running or moving through already mapped territory , this rate can be increased <p> ... I have a hard time picturing Frodo outrunning Strider or Legolas ... <p> I agree . <p> I think a case could be made for making a distinction between tactical and strategic movement--as well as running speed . <p> I see Halflings having a hard time keeping up with Humans on forced marches . They can gut it out , but they 're going to be more fatigued . And of course , when it comes to sprinting , it would n't even be close . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would be able to keep up easily on a forced march--their legs might be moving twice as fast , but they simply do n't get tired . <p> I have a hard time picturing Frodo unable to keep up with Strider or Legolas while sneaking through Moria . When you 're going that slowly , encumbrance affects your ability to be sneaky , not your literal speed . <p> When you move into larger areas , the base movements given in the Monster Manual start to make sense . The smaller folk are n't able to travel as quickly in formation ( which is where those numbers come from ) , because their legs are n't as long . <p> Considering running : I agree that men and elves should be able to outrun dwarves and halflings , given equivalent equipment . This could be addressed with different multipliers for different races . ( E.g. , men get a x5 multiplier when running in a dungeon . Maybe halflings could get a x4 multiplier only . That sort of thing . ) <p> Regarding long-distance travel : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , halflings is n't necessarily true , and what truth there is to it is probably best explained by the greater endurance of the larger folk . Remember that Frodo and his fellow hobbits started out in a very out-of-shape way , and so naturally have a hard time keeping up with the larger folk . This ceases to be an issue later in the story , except in cases where endurance is a factor . <p> You might want to make long-distance travel a special case ( it 's treated differently in the DMG than in the PHB , after all ) , and reduce the smaller folks ' movement rates . <p> But after considering these things , ask yourself : do they really bring needed detail to the game ? If you think so , you should certainly make any changes you like . <p> We 've always played using the base movement rates from the MM . Dwarves may be slow , but once they start moving , they 're hard to stop . 174048 @qwx584048 <p> I never realized that all PCs had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this board . <p> Also , I never really cared for or kept track of movement , other than in combat/encounter situations . When this occurred , for lack of all else , I would use the MV rate in the MM for PCs too . That is until 2e came out an codified the " shorter races move slower " theme into the PHB PC rule set . <p> Scott has brought up a few more points that reminds me just how brilliant Gygax and AD&amp;D really was/is . When looking into the MM , and seeing an entry for the Dwarf , and while realizing his move rate is less than a human , but NOT taking into the account the AC and the armor and equipment worn for the standard " encountered " dwarf , is overlooking the abstract nature of the way OAD&amp;D operates . I guess my last confession is I too overlooked such concepts at times . Now I have to pay my penence . <p> Ernest Gary Gygax 1938 - 2008 " How many people could say that they impacted the lives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine - just a small game of gelatinous cubes , strange dice and 10 ' corridors ?

For example could a dwarf ( move 6 " in heavy equipment ) character escape from a troll ( move 12 " ) just by outrunning it . I figured in those cases I would use base rates of 9 " for dwarves , gnomes , and halflings . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elves , half elves and half orcs then adjust accordingly for encumberance and armor . <p> Good point about a base speed of 12 " per turn being really slow ( 120 feet in 10 minutes ) . So based on that it make sense for all characters to be at the same base rate since the party would all be moving together . Not to harp on 3e but in looking at that product and how they handle movement rates ( speed ) I really like the 1e system better . By having a large number of movement speeds one effectivly gets more variance in their creatures . <p> I respectfully disagree with Stormcrow 's logic . I believe when the AD&amp;D Core Books are read as a whole , it is clear the character races have different base movements . <p> As an initial matter , the PHB directs all players creating demi-human PCs to look to the MM for details on the race ( For example , " Complete information on halflings is found in ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS , MONSTER MANUAL , " p. 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players are expressly directed to review the MM for details of demi-humans . One can not be directed to an entry and not note the given movement of the character race . <p> Before we go there , it is worth noting that the so-called " encumbrance table " on page 101 of the PHB is specifically provided only as a " guideline . " The reduced rates of movement due to encumbrance are clearly mere percentages : 75% of movement , 50% of movement , 25% of movement . The fact that the author uses the base movement of 12 " in the table fits well with both the " guideline " principle , and with the fact that the entire game is humanocentric , as admitted by the author of the table ( DMG , p. 21 ) . <p> Plunging into the MM , we quickly find that the races have unequal movement rates even though they are all described as being equally encumbered . The argument that the encumbrance is " built in " does not stand up to inspection . Dwarves , Elves , Gnomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightly encumbered in " fairly bulky " armor . Dwaves ( 4 ' tall , Move : 6 " ) are " typically armored with chainmail and shield . " Elves ( 5 ' + tall , Move : 12 " ) are " typically in scale , ring or chain mail , and most carry shields . " Gnomes ( 3 ' tall , Move : 6 " ) are " typically armored with leather armor which is ringed or well-studded with metal and shield . " Halflings ' ( 3+ ' tall , Move:9 " ) armor " consists of padded or leather armor . " Either the base movement rates of the character races differ , or elves are supposed to have a base movement rate of 15 . " The logic ca n't work both ways . Note that gnomes ' armor and weapons are much lighter than dwarves , yet their movement rate is the same . <p> As an example , look to Nixies ( 4 ' tall , Move : 6 " ) who are completely unencumbered , or , moving out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Move : 6 " ) who " usually wear loose cloth doublets . " <p> Lastly , look to the " Men " entry in the MM . Even those described as wearing armor ( Buccaneers ) are given a move of 12 " ( those with a given movement of " varies " can be encountered mounted , see " Pilgrims " who wear no armor ) . I believe we are all in agreement that humans move at a base rate of 12 . " Either this entry is incorrect , or encumbrance is not factored in to the monster descriptions . In order to make the universal movement of 12 " argument , there have to be a lot of typographical errors . Given the choice of bending the express language of multiple sources to fit the argument , or crafting an argument that embraces all the sources , it is clear that movement rates have less to do with some built-in encumbrance than with short , stubby legs . The halfling 's somewhat faster move can be attributed to the Hobbits ' described innate nimbleness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength allows them to carry their gear better than gnomes or dwarves. 174048 @qwx584048 <p> 1 . If 12 " per turn is the speed for dungeon exploration , and the speed for following a route or map through a dungeon is 5 times the exploration speed , then movement increases to 6 " per round . A dwarf 's normal speed is 6 " per round . This would mean that a dwarf moves at normal pace when following a known route through a dungeon and a human moves at half speed . Why does a creature with base of 6 " move faster in a dungeon than a creature with base of 12 " ? <p> 2 . If exploration speed is so slow that it makes everyone with different base speeds equal in movement rate , why then does encumbrance even make a difference in how fast you can explore ? 12 ' per minute is so slow that carrying a 100# pack should n't be any different than carrying a 10# pack . <p> " I 'm not dumb .

It takes a troop type , e.g. , " dwarf , " and describes in holistic terms what characteristics that troop type has . The Monster Manual entries are not cookbook recipies for constructing characters , whether player or non-player .

Gary did n't make the numbers work out internally ; he just decided " Hmm , a band of elves goes this fast , and a band of dwarves goes that fast . " <p> I think the answer to all this is quite simple : Gary just ignored or forgot about differences in speeds when considering movement rates in the rules for character movement . Consider the section in the Dungeon Masters Guide on overland movement ( which is much more in-depth than the guideline given in the Players Handbook of 1 " =1 mile of half-day travel ) : the tables assume that terrain and encumbrance are the only factors in how fast overland movement can occur . <p> The game , " as a whole " as Gnarley Bones was talking about it , provides contradictory information about outdoor movement rates . In neither case do the rulebooks say that different races have different movement rates . Gnarley Bones would like to infer this from an examination of movement scores and typical equipment in entries of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iMonster Manual were not designed to mirror character considerations of movement and encumbrance . <p> In my opinion , there is no need to distinguish between races when considering movement anyway .

What I 'm saying is that the base movement rates for the various character races is set forth in the MM , and pointing out the given item descriptions to counter the arguments , previously made , that encumbrance must somehow be figured in . It is n't . I believe gnomes and dwarves move at a base ( i.e. unencumered ) rate of 6 " , Halflings at base 9 " , and humans and elves at base 12 " . I did n't look at Half-orcs last night , I believe orcs move at base 9 " . That may be an open question . <p> To answer Scott 's question , I 've always rounded up , encumbered dwarves move at 5 " , 3 " and 2 " , respectively , halflings at 8 " , 5 " and 2 " . Since the halflings in my campaign tend to be thieves and lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dwarves tend to be fighters and have high STRs , so again , I have n't seen any demi-human PCs with glacial movements . I have seen human PCs turn themselves into beasts of burden and make mincemeat out of their base 12 " movement rate . 174048 @qwx584048 <p> I 've discussed this with EGG before , and the stats in the MM are to be considered for typical encounters with the races listed , and they take things like AC into account . Considering this , and the fact that there is no mention of any separate movement rates anywhere else where encumbrance and movement for PCs is discussed , my opinion is the MM rates are not base rates . In the past I used 9 " as the base rate for small demi-humans and just doubled up the 6 " range , but now that I 've been tossing it around I think I 'll just use 12 " as the base rate for every PC race for most movement situations , except running . Also , if you 're using miniatures and grids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rounding off to 3 ' for movement purposes works much better than the more common 5 ' per square .

( You can do this , but they 're not part of any formula . ) <p> The second reason giving all characters the same base movement rate is not comparable to giving demi-humans unlimited levels is that the former is a lot less generous of the DM ( provided races actually did start out with differing movement rates , which I maintain they do n't ) than taking away the sudden cut-off of power that level limits impose . Slow movement is a minor inconvenience .

( In AD&amp;D , if you 're going to use the DMG 's tables for overland movement , it 's best to make maps with hexes of five miles , just like Outdoor Survival , and 30 miles , just like the World of Greyhawk maps , and to round heavily encumbered movement in rugged terrain to 2 1/2 miles for convenience. ) 
@@59195495 @8195495/ <p> The whole Unearthed Arcana thread got me to pick up the book for the first time in a while and thumb through it . I noticed something I 'd never seen before : Table I on page 7 states that Dark , Grey , and High Elves may all be Cavaliers , and that Half Elves may be both Cavaliers and Paladins . Table II.C on pages 8 and 9 do not list any level limitations for the Elf Cavaliers and Table II.D on page 9 lists no level limits for Half Elf Cavaliers or Paladins . Note : even when demi-humands could progress to unlimited leves , it was still included on the chart . The latter rules on elves , half elves , cavaliers , and paladins makes no mention of elves as these classes or any level limits . <p> So what 's the official rule on this ? Was there an errata in Dragon that covered it ? <p> " Since the dawn of time , man has yearned to destroy the Sun . " - C. Montgomery Burns <p> I remember a dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite good although just as overpowered ( IMHO ... ) as the original . Their required weapon was bow instead of lance , etc. etc . <p> I do n't remember any actual usages of half-elven paladins in any other products I saw although I remember the section to which you refer . <p> Again , I have to express my dislike of allowing Drow as PC ( in any class ) . But this is ridiculous . Cavaliers ( and the UA Paladin ) are supposed to be horsemen par excellence . NOT expert giant lizard riders , horsemen . Which makes them completely unsuited to this class . <p> One 's like or dislike of the Cavalier class becomes irrrelevant here . The Drow simply do NOT have the capability to become proficient at riding a horse ( let alone an expert in the field ) . Cavaliers have been practicing riding since childhood . Drow ? When 's the last time you took a Destrier into a dungeon ? How about getting a stable full into the Underdark in order for the Dark Elf Cavaliers to practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think drow are a natural choice for cavaliers . Also , D3 specifically mentions drow elf nobles using lizards as mounts . Since surface-dwelling cavaliers have special abilities with pegasi , hippogriffs , and griffons , why would n't a subteranean cavalier have special abilities with the fantastic creatures available there ? They may not belong in every campaign ( neither do assassins or paladins ) , but the concept is a good one . Scott <p> Cavaliers do n't ride horses because they are horses , the ride them because they are what is available . Removing the availability of horses is n't going to remove the desire to have an advantage in combat , so why would n't the drow do the same thing that the surface dwellers initially did , use what is available . Scott <p> The introductory paragraphs to table II on p. 8 ( and IIRC the cavalier class description as well ) specifically indicates that elves and half-elves have NO LEVEL LIMITS as cavaliers ( and paladins in the latter case ) . Why an elf who is limited to level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 as a cavalier is beyond me . In my rewrite of the cavalier class I made it human-only . IMO the conception of the class is too lawfully-oriented for chaotic elves . <p> Why an elf who is limited to level 7 as a fighter should be able to achieve level 50 as a cavalier is beyond me . <p> Ostensibly , because they ca n't multi-class as Cavaliers , and they can as Fighters . ( They 're limited as Rangers for the same reason . ) <p> And , of course , a single-classed elven Fighter can achieve 9th level with a maximum Strength score . <p> OAD&amp;D never intended for 50th level anythings , naturally . Elves were given free rein as Cavs to represent ( most likely ) the snotty Grey elf noble archetype who looked down his nose at the " common " Fighter . IIRC , Gygax even had such a character appear in Artifact of Evil ( for illustration ) . <p> The generally frail nature of elves suggests that among the sub-races able to qualify , Cavaliers would be appropriately rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method V is employed , it is noted that demi-humans can not be generated under its provisions . ) <p> " ... we are not loath to answer your questions , but why have us do any more of your imagining for you ?

My point was that as written the Cavalier is a class that is concerned primarily with warfare on horseback . <p> For example , UA states : <p> Quote : <p> " Mounted combat and horsemanship are special provinces of the cavalier class . A human cavalier ( but not an elf or a half-elf ) makes all attacks from horseback as if the character were 1 level higher . This increase applies only to horses , mounts usable as steeds by cavalier at higher levels , and those mounts approved by the DM " ( UA , p.15 ) . <p> It seems to me that the normal mount for a Cavalier would be a horse . The other mounts possible ( pegasus , hipposgriff , griffon &amp; unicorn for a female elf ) only enter the Cavalier 's proficiency at later levels . <p> I think you are correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agin I do no treally use the UA much ) elves and half-elves could be cavaliers . <p> Correct . As T. Foster correctly pointed out , under the rules as written in UA , elves are unlimited in progression as Cavaliers and Half-Elves are umlimited in progression as either Cavaliers or Paladins . Elves can not be paladins . <p> R.A. <p> " Since the dawn of time , man has yearned to destroy the Sun . " - C. Montgomery Burns <p> Elves as caviliers ? ? ? That attitude does n't flow with the way you normaly picture elves . They are n't prone to suicide in battle . Perhaps if the fate of the world or multi-plex relied on fighting an impossible battle , but otherwise they just wait out most problems ( easy when you live so long ) in the forest .

@@59195496 @8195496/ <p> MMII makes mention of the plane of Time . What was this ? This is the only reference I have ever seen to it and I have the post-Gygax MotP . Any ideas ? Also , while time travel seems to be impossible in AD&amp;D , it was entirely possible in D&amp;D ( DA1-4 , etc . ) Any thoughts on this ? <p> What was alluded to in the MM was unclear , but scientifically there are more than three dimensions in our universe . Each could theoretically be called a " plane " . So we have the 1st , 2d , and 3d dimensions ( for simplicity , Length , Width , and Height ) . The fourth dimension would be hyperspace , where all the objects in the universe dent it with their gravity wells ( this actually happens in regular space too . ) <p> And then we have the fifth dimension , which is time . Time as we perceive it is like a river . It flows in one direction , with branches occasionally winding off in different directions , signifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time could conceivably move back and forth upon the river at will , and could vary its apperance either at whim or at random , appearing young or old , depending on the moment in time you see it at . <p> But then again , I 'm rambling and none of this may make much sense . In short , there is a plane of time , in my opinion . But no humanoid on the myriad D&amp;D worlds can pierce the barriers to effect time travel . If a creature can do it , it 's a very rare creature . <p> If you want the real deal on the Plane of Time look at Dragon magazine #69 pages 28-29 . Under Deities and Demigods of Greyhawk , the goddess Istus ' companion is an elemental prince of time .

At that point SVGAMES did not take more wizards based material ..... <p> ..... basically I was told to contact Wizards and get written permission to hand over the pdf I created to SVGAMES to sell .

@@59195504 @8195504/ <p> The 46-page basic D&amp;D rulebook edited by J. Eric Holmes in 1977 can serve as a complete game in and of itself . <p> The rulebook has rules only for characters of levels 1-3 . There is no reason that even a long-term campaign could not be conducted using PCs and NPCs of only 3rd level and lower . <p> Page 22 states : " As a guideline , it should take a group of players from 6 to 12 adventures before any of their characters are able to gain sufficient experience to attain second level . This guidelining will hold true for successive levels . Note that it is assumed that the 6 to 12 adventures are ones in which a fair amount of treasure was brought back--some 10% to 20% of adventures will likely prove relatively profitless for one reason or another . " <p> Taking into account the 10-20% of adventures as profitless , the 6 - 12 range becomes 7.5 - 15 . That gives an average of 11 adventures required to gain a level . Hence , a PC played for 11 adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) will be played for 33 adventures . Assuming one adventure per week , that 's over 7 months of play . Assuming one adventure per month , that 's over 3 and a half years of play . For just one character ! The Holmes rules provide for 12 different types of PC : <p> It would take , then , 396 sessions ( average ) for a player to burn-through all the character types . That 's over 7 and a half years of weekly gaming sessions , and 33 years of monthly gaming sessions . <p> ( And of course , all the above numbers assume that your characters never get killed , resulting in having to start a new character at 1st level with 0 xp . Obviously this would occur , thus significantly increasing the above lengths of time . ) <p> Both 1st and 2nd-level spells are detailed for both magic-users and for clerics--a total of 48 spells . In terms of fantasy literature , the spells are plenty powerful to be impressive : becoming invisible , charming opponents , detecting alignment , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzing opponents , etc . In short , the spell list is sufficient to have spell-casters redolent of the spell-casters in the best swords &amp; sorcery fiction . <p> The Holmes rulebook has the most concise and yet complete roster of monsters I 've ever seen for D&amp;D . It 's not limited to relatively weak monsters : <p> Its selection of magic items is likewise succinct and yet complete , with items ranging from a healing potion all the way up to a ring of three wishes . <p> In sum , I think that using the Holmes D&amp;D rulebook as a complete game would make for a very fun campaign , one that more closely approximates the literature that inspired D&amp;D ( Lovecraft , Howard , Clark Ashton Smith , Lieber , Vance , Tolkien , etc ) . After all , why else did n't Gandalf simply teleport Frodo and the Ring to the edge of Mount Doom , and simply toss it in ? 1100 pages reduced to 5 . <p> My only " slight " disagreement is in the PC class-options . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elf or halfling thieves ; only referring to their inclusion in the AD&amp;D game saying that , <p> Quote : <p> There are special rules for halflings , dwarves and elves who wish to be thieves--these are given in ADVANCED DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS <p> But , if you are playing " Holmes , " you really should n't be playing by Advanced D&amp;D rules . A minor point , I concede ; and one susceptible to debate and disagreement under scrutiny . ( He does say , for those " who wish " ) And , afterall , is n't D&amp;D--Classic or otherwise--a place where Wishes can come true ? Otherwise , I agree with Geof . I like this idea . <p> My take on thieves is that in Holmes D&amp;D , the demi-humans can be thieves , but they simply do not have special rules as do demi-human thieves in AD&amp;D . Plus , the Holmes D&amp;D module B1 : In Search of the Unknown has several demi-human thieves in the character rosters in the back of the module . <p> Yeah . The B1 seemed contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the weird group of pre-gens in the back . I think if you allow demi-humans as thieves , like you say , and hold them to the same rules as the humans in the book you 'll be okay . Like I said , I like it . <p> The 46-page basic D&amp;D rulebook edited by J. Eric Holmes in 1977 can serve as a complete game in and of itself . <p> Have you seen the pdf file " Holmes Companion " which takes the Holmes ruleset up to level 9 ? I forgot who wrote it and his/her name is n't in the file . Anyway , it is pretty good work . <p> Yes , that 's Meepo 's baby , and it is indeed good stuff . However , my idea here is to limit both PCs and NPCs to level 3 . Those 9th-level characters can teleport around , thus resulting in Gandalf and Frodo teleporting from the Shire to Mount Doom , tossing the Ring in , and teleporting back home at the end of the five-page short story . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That seems risky . A party of 3rd level characters would annihilate a 3rd level MU or Cleric bad guy ; even with a cadre of low-level monsters around him . Would you consider allowing NPCs be treated as monsters and therefore not in the same category as players ; that would allow them to run-the-world in a manner more befitting 5th , 6th or 7th levels of abilities . Keeping players to the L3 limit , but allowing them to reach 4th and retire out of the game as NPCs . This would keep a continuous cycle of players *and* stock the world with NPCs . What d' ya think ? <p> You could do that , but that 's not what I 'm getting at here . I 'm considering the Holmes rulebook as complete , so even NPCs top out at 3rd level . <p> A way for an evil 3rd-level cleric or magic-user to be a match for an entire party of 3rd-level PCs is to give him some nasty magic items WITH FEW CHARGES . That way , even if the PCs manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have only a few shots with them . <p> A wand of fire balls , for example , does 6-36 points of damage ( 3-18 if save is made ) to all within a 40 ' diameter . That means that those who do n't save take about 21 hp damage , while those who save take about 10 or 11 hp damage . <p> A single blast , therefore , will take-out just about everyone who does n't make his save . A second blast would take care of the rest . Let the NPC magic-user surprise the party , plus give him an 18 dexterity ( remember , no initiative rolls in Holmes ! ) , and the party is most probably toast . <p> In this example , then , the wise DM would give the wand of fire balls only 2 or 3 charges--enough to fry the entire party , but not enough to be a DM headache if the players get ahold of the wand . <p> Lastly , I do n't think it 's a bad idea to make the DM use his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high hit point totals . In this case , what 's good for the players is good for the DM . <p> I totally dig this idea . And I agree with your assessment on the monsters included , it is one of the best collections of monsters in a D&amp;D book ! <p> There was but one problem with the cutoff on 3rd level : the sample dungeon contains a 4th level magic-user . He must be a demi-god of sorts ! <p> Never thought to put my name on the Holmes Companion . I just stretched the game out based on my own preferences and what was done with later sets . I rewrote the spell descriptions to keep within the 4 page mark , but other than that and time invested , I would n't dare claim any ownership . I just love Holmes and was hoping such a document might let it shine in a better light then it tends to ( outside of nostalgia , that is ) ! <p> What is the enterprising DM to do who wants 3rd-level to be the highest level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( such as Greyhawk , the Wilderlands , etc . ) ? What should he do about those 15th-level NPCs running around ? <p> Well , the DM would convert any sub-class to its base class . An illusionist , for example , would become a magic-user . Then the DM would convert levels as follows : <p> 1st-7th level NPCs in the product would become 1st level . 8th-14th level NPCs in the product would become 2nd level . 15th+ level NPCs in the product would become 3rd level . <p> Hence , a 17th-level paladin would be converted into a lawful good 3rd-level fighter . <p> Speaking for myself , I would find it incredibly boring to play for 3 years and just be barely squeaking by at 3rd level , and then to hit that point and have no hope of any more advancement of the character or the game world around him . <p> " Oh boy , another ' powerful ' NPC wizard who is only more powerful than my 3rd level wizard because he has a fireball wand that only has 3 charges .... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get those wands , and why ca n't I get any ? I 'm the same level as they are .... " <p> Holmes does n't even pretend to be a complete system , and has around 10 instances where it directs the players to go to AD&amp;D to get the full rules ... Trying to force it to be something it 's not is quite a strain . <p> You could play the Keep on the Borderlands over and over and over and just keep putting in different monsters , but that would get boring too . <p> Part of the excitement comes from the advancement of the character ( or even just knowing possibility of great advancement exists ) , gaining new abilities , new spells , and just all around better combat power -- the dream of kicking sand in the face of those big monsters that used to terrify you . Take that away and the game would get old pretty fast ... for me anyway . <p> I can certainly see the appeal of low level campaigning , but I disagree with the contention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigns where characters can reach name level . <p> Numerous examples of level 3 and greater spells populate the books of the authors you mention ( many , as I 'd bet you 're aware , are drawn directly from those texts ) and the fighting prowess of some of their heroes is well above that of even a 3rd level character . Figures like Turjan , Aragorn , and Conan simply ca n't be represented in the world you 're making a case for . <p> As for the teleport issue , there 's nothing to keep a GM from removing a few spells from the lists or just making them exceedingly rare . That 's certainly a lot easier IMO than finding a way to represent the magical magnificence of Rhialto or the the ability to wade through dozens of orcs in a melee combat as Gimli manages on multiple occasions when you 're limited to just 3 levels of experience . <p> Again , none of that is to say your idea could n't be enjoyable . But let 's also be honest and acknowledge that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Unjust laws exist : shall we be content to obey them , or shall we endeavor to amend them , and obey them until we have succeeded , or shall we transgress them at once ? -- Henry David Thoreau <p> I think this proposal would more closely mirror S&amp;S literature than would a party of 14th-level A/D&amp;D characters . <p> I think that depends entirely on what literature you 're referring to . If it 's a campaign mirroring Rhialto and his peers , 14th level , at which spells above 7th level are unavailable , is entirely inadequate ! <p> Unjust laws exist : shall we be content to obey them , or shall we endeavor to amend them , and obey them until we have succeeded , or shall we transgress them at once ? -- Henry David Thoreau <p> I 'll also add that putting aside any " major , systematic changes " to the ruleset , one can still better represent heroic fantasy fiction in many cases with a experience level cap at 5th , 8th , or 9th levels rather than 3rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey them , or shall we endeavor to amend them , and obey them until we have succeeded , or shall we transgress them at once ? -- Henry David Thoreau <p> I 'll also add that putting aside any " major , systematic changes " to the ruleset , one can still better represent heroic fantasy fiction in many cases with a experience level cap at 5th , 8th , or 9th levels rather than 3rd . <p> I agree 100% - for a heroic fantasy game you need potential advancement to at least 5th or 6th level . <p> edit : Although you can cap spellcasting-in-combat at 2nd level if desired , see my discussion elsewhere . <p> Holmes did some great work . I have a lot of respect for what he wrote , including Holmes Basic . <p> That being said , however , IMO a D&amp;D game has to work for the group . We never had the time/desire to spend 6 --12 games trying to get to 2nd level . I also think that D&amp;D is really fun at Lvl 4 --8 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dolorous , then no amount of drink and lively company will lift the pall , old friend . Talk , smile , laugh -- allow yourself to heal ! " Gary Gygax , Night Arrant ; Cat or Pigeon ? <p> I think there is a real aesthetic draw to a complete fantasy rpg in 46 pages . I 'd love to see somebody tackle that chore with the destination in mind . Begin with the ODnD rules . Sprinkle in monsters and treasure . Give just enough magic , monsters , and treasure to keep the game going through something like 9th level . You do n't need a complete spell list or monster list , just enough to lay a framework . Making that sort of thing up is half the fun anyway ! It 'd be a chance to clarify how you want certain things to work , like demihuman classes , etc . It 's a very intriguing game design challenge ! <p> We had more fun with that little book ; I certainly have a lot of love for that --- it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't too hard to extrapolate beyond level 3 -- you had a list of 3rd level spells and although they were n't explained , many of them could be figured out from context -- for example . ' fireball ' spells were presumably just a spell version of the fireball wand . Later we got our hands on the ODD booklets and ' Greyhawk ' --- but we still used the Holmes rules for most things and just used the other books for going above level 3 or rolling up random treasure , encounters , etc . For one thing , the monsters in the Holmes books were alphabetized . Still later we replaced the books with the AD&amp;D books , ... <p> Holmes D&amp;D works great . Back in the day we played it for about a year as our only D&amp;D and then moved over to AD&amp;D as instructed in the text . When we reached 3rd level , we just made new characters and started over with different adventures . We did eventually long to try out higher levels though , and thus , we switched away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is my favorite version of D&amp;D ever . So , what I do now is play it with my son . I 've extended it to allow for unlimited level advancement . The game scales quite easily to any level of play with very little effort . <p> My son and I have had sessions at several different levels , and he 's done quite well picking the game up . <p> I think it is quite possible to have a great deal of fun for quite a while at levels 1-3 . Esp . if you are new to the game , there seems to be almost endless possibilities regardless of levels . I remember the first time I cracked the box open . gaining levels was very low on my list of concerns . The adventure was the draw . I could n't wait to see what the next room in B1 held , or what this strange wand did when you waved it around . So , to the OP , I think you are quite correct that 1-3 level Holmes would provide quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw in my vote ; I think running straight-up , no-added preservatives Holmes could be awesome if it 's set up right . I actually had one of the guys from my old group bugging me to do this , but I held out for B/X . Still , I 'd be psyched to hear some CJ-style stuff from a game run this way . <p> " PC 's are not precious snowflakes . They are the grease that lubricates my GM hate machine . " -- YorkusRex <p> I do not share some of my fellow dragonsfooters ' sentiments that a D&amp;D campaign capped at level 3 would be dull . Interestingly for this thread , J. Eric Holmes himself ( at least as of 1981 , after playing D&amp;D for at least 4 years ) never had a PC of over 4th level : LONG ... <p> 1 . This best allows for a " sit your butt down , open the box , and play D&amp;D " game . ALL your rules are right there in a single book of 46 pages . Even B/X ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself ca n't compare , with 18 additional pages and a noticable lack of many of the more powerful iconic D&amp;D monsters ( such as giants , purple worms , vampires , etc . ) . <p> 2 . Fifth-level magic-users can cast 3rd-level spells , and these spells can blow things to smithereens . Fire ball and lightning bolt alone can make D&amp;D feel a lot less like a Lovecraft , Smith , or Howard story . And let 's not forget the fly spell , or the water breathing spell . How many Weird Tales sorcerers flew around shooting fire balls or lightning bolts ? How many could acquire the object of their quest ( submerged in the sea ) by simply breathing underwater ? Etc . These third-level spells considerably change the feel of the game . Admittedly , then , a 4th-level cap for characters would work just as well as a 3rd-level cap , but then we lose some of that " complete rulebook out of the box " feel mentioned in 1 . above . <p> Having just 1st and 2nd level spells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without sacrificing that sui generis " D&amp;D feel " . Your D&amp;D spell-caster can still : <p> It 's really quite a list . Supplement that with the dozens of magic items in the book , and you have a magic-user who can replicate pretty much anything done in S&amp;S fiction . ( The one major exception being summoning and binding demonic entities , but that can be rectified by DM fiat , without needing any additions to the rules . E. g. , " In the center of room J is a pentagram . Any magic-user standing within can summon the demon Glyutheg with a 50% chance of success . " ) <p> Another thing I like about a 3rd-level cap is that no monster ever becomes something other than scary . Even a 3rd-level fighter will have a fight on his hands when confronting half a dozen orcs . <p> What about Conan ? How would Conan be represented using only the Holmes rules ? He 'd be a 3rd-level fighter , with 18s in strength , constitution , and dexterity . He 'd have maximum hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd most always strike first in a melee round . Also remember that Conan wore armor whenever he could get it , so there 's no need to deny him his AC 2 ( thus a normal man would need an 18 to hit him , and a 1st-3rd level character a 17 to hit him--and remember weapons do only 1-6 hp damage in Holmes ) . Thus , a band of normal men would need , on average , to swing a whopping SIXTY-THREE times in order to kill Conan ! A band of 1st-3rd level fighters would have to swing a whopping FOURTY-SEVEN times in order to kill Conan . A fighter such as I 've just described would be a fearsome opponent indeed . <p> A 1st-3rd level Holmes game would be anything but boring . It really depends more on how the DM creates and runs the adventures . It is the playing of the game , not the attainment of levels that makes this game fun . Holmes D&amp;D ( more than any other version of D&amp;D , except perhaps the original 3 rule books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and skills , and other stuff written on your character sheet , than just giving you a structure to go have some fun . If you want to be Conan in Holmes D&amp;D you just need to play your character like that . 18 Str or 7 Str .... make no difference ( there are no combat modifiers in Holmes for high strength ) Just create a fighting man and you can be Conan . <p> I think for some of us the 3rd level cap is not a problem were we to be characters , but as a DM the lower levels mean more constraints on the kind of adventures you can run . Holmes includes a huge array of monsters that would wipe the floor with 3rd level characters . This does n't mean you ca n't use those monsters ; it just means you have to be careful how you place them and utilize them .

But anyway , that 's the smallest and weakest type of dragon facing a powerful wizard ( on the other hand , if the dragon got to attack first , then the wizard would have to save or die ; that seems balanced -- even the smallest type of dragon can be a real threat to a 10th level wizard ) . <p> Even in Holmes white dragons can have from 5-7 HD , and their actual HP are based on their age , with the oldest white dragons having a full 8 HP per HD ..... <p> So the " huge " white dragon from Holmes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're really arguing two things here .... <p> 1 .

Hommlet is supposed to be 10 leagues southeast of Verbobonc . According to the WoG Glossography , p.3 , each map hex is 10 leagues . Ten leagues = 30 miles . Therefore 1 league = 3 miles . With me so far ? <p> The first page of the map booklet puts Hommlet nearly THREE world-map hexes from Verbobonc . That would be closer to 90 miles from the city ! This same map also places Nulb almost 1 hex away ( 30 miles ) when the text clearly states that Nulb is located 6 miles away . Wait , it gets worse ! <p> The moathouse is supposed to be roughly 2 hours away from Hommlet on a rough track through the marsh . No marsh is indicated on the map . It later states that the trail shows signs of game 1 mile from Hommlet and the moathouse itself is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles . Where is this is relation to the map ? <p> Later on , the text notes that Nulb is located 7 LEAGUES beyond the Moathouse . This would be 21 miles ! What happened to Nulb being 6 miles away ? And then Gary mentions something about making a map using the Nulb-sized map grid and making each square = 100 yards . Then he begins to describe the location of Hommlet and the Velverdyva river , but none of the locations or distances ( here Nulb is only 5 miles away ) are consistent . Has anyone else run into this problem ? ! ? <p> I spent the better part of a year out mapping geologic formations in Wymoing , Colorado , and Utah . I realize that one can estimate distance , but COME ON ! ! The text contradicts itself more than three times ! And no editor caught this ? ! ? <p> Has anyone else run into this problem and what was done to rectify the obvious contradictions ? <p> T1 was written before the published version of the WoG was completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things appear in Gary 's home campaign .

Using the original notes ( Nulb being just 6 miles distant ) makes things much easier on the party and the DM , but when I make it this easy for the party to get to the temple from Hommlet , the party often ignores most of the gaming opportunities in Nulb .

However , he tends to contradict himself when describing the wilderness layout . <p> I 'm thinking that the area between the Low Road ( that skirts the Velverdyva 's south bank ) and the High Road ( in the Lower Kron Hills ) is nothing more than a meadowy marshland . The thickets and brambles surround the moathouse which is in a marsh , and the area surrounding Nulb and the Temple are rather marshy as well . In fact , the description of the Nulb area seems to mention that the main road through the village IS the Low Road . I do n't see how this can be if the Imeryds Run heads north into the Velverdyva . Since the only other crossing of the Imeryds Run is 6 leagues upstream ( and I 'm assuming this is the High Road , that leads to Sobanwych ) , this should n't be THAT close to the Velverdyva . <p> Also , is Greenway Valley the large forested area due west of Verbobonc along the river ?

You could try to find out " what Gary did , " but keep in mind that when he ran T1 in his own campaign he was n't using the same geography as that of the published world of greyhawk setting .

It 's a nice , simple calculation , and I still do n't even know when this will be used , heh . <p> So a small white dragon 6 HD , 36 ' long , could weigh 3,600 lbs . <p> Remember , dragons have long necks and tails ( the pictures show about 1/3 of the length as tail , 1/3 as head and neck , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may have hollow ( but strong ) bones to reduce weight . <p> Then a 10 HD Red dragon would be 60 ' long and weigh 6,000 lbs . <p> The Huge Gold dragon of 22 HD would be 132 ' long and weigh 13,200 pounds .... does that seem right ? hah . is there any way of knowing if it seems right ? ? <p> If we look at B/X , rather than BECMI , and if we assume the diagram of dragon breath is to scale , we find that dragons are about 30 feet long with a wingspan of over 40 feet .

@@59195521 @8195521/ <p> I have never used critical hits in 1E , although I liked the idea back in the 80s . We never house ruled this ( seemed too untouchable ) , and I 'm wondering if anyone ever tried Gygax 's system described in DMG or if they tried anything from Dragon ( pre 2E ) . <p> On a roll of twenty , you multiply the damage rolled by 2 and roll again . If you roll an 18 or higher on the subsequent roll , the damage multiplier goes up to 3 and you roll again . If you roll a 16 or higher on this roll , the damage multiplier rises to 4 and you roll again , etc . Theoretically you can keep rolling this right down to needing to roll a two in order to multiply rolled damage by 11 . In practice , I do n't think anyone achieved better than *6 damage . <p> The only exception to the above is if the attacker needs a 20 to hit . In this case the initial 20 only does normal damage , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 or higher damage is multiplied by 2 and so on . <p> This system is a rough adaptation of the Rolemaster philosopy where even a peasant with a dagger has a chance ( however minute ) of killing an experienced warrior . We liked this system because of the scope for truly epic criticals . A side benefit was that the party had a healthy respect for even relatively puny foes because they still had the potential to deal great damage . This in turn encouraged seeking alternative to just combat when confronted with a problem . <p> I used the critical hit tables out of The Best of Dragon #3 ( not real sure about the number , but it was called good hits , bad misses ) . I used this system for just about 2 years , worked pretty good but tended to break the flow of combat and the game itself , with all the extra rolls and stuff . From that point on I always considered a " 1 " a miss or at worst a fumble , negate with a Dex check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and would cause double normal damage rolled , example : George hits a Hill Giant with his long sword on a natural " 20 " , George rolls a 10 for damage , the giant would take 20 points of damage + strength and magical bonuses . <p> Why do you have to " put your two cents in " .. . but it 's only a " penny for your thoughts " ? Where 's that extra penny going to ? **25;190;TOOLONG <p> For critical hits in combat I 've used the following for a number of years : <p> An attack always hits on a natural 20 . If the natural 20 is at least 5 more than the number required to hit , then that attack is a critical hit . If it is not at least 5 more than the number required to hit then it is just a normal hit . <p> To determine the result of the crit , the player rolls a d6 and compares the result to a table I have : 1-3 Maximum normal damage 4-5 Determine damage as normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the results may seem a bit wimpy for a crit but I 've had sessions in which other crit systems were used that resulted in PC and game demolition by die rolls and prefer not to throw that big a monkey wrench in things . I reward PCs with a little XP bonus for delivering a crit . <p> " The people have spoken . The Old School Renaissance has arrived ! " - Ancalagon , President of Dragonsfoot <p> Used to do the " double damage on a 20 " thing , but realized that this gives high damage weapons a double benfit--while shortchanging the lower damage value ones . The problem is especially acute for monsters with a high base damage ( 3d10 , etc ) . <p> I think next time around I will set a lethality level for the campaign . This will be the additional die rolled on a natural " 20 " ( assuming the required to hit # was less than 20 to begin with ) . . . <p> Very Low Lethality : +d4 <p> Low Lethality : +d6 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Very High Lethality : +d12 <p> This will mean that a lucky strike with a dagger can be nearly as lethal as a lucky hit with a greatsword . <p> To balance this out , I think that on a natural " 1 " in melee , I will allow the target to make a free attack ( riposte ) versus the attacker . <p> If the player rolls a natural 20 the attack hits . The player must then " back up " the roll by rolling again . If the unmodified roll is enough to hit normally then the result is a crit . If the unmodified roll would normally miss then the attack is just a normal hit . <p> Interesting question . I used to love the idea , now I hate it . Once I started using it in 3E I realized it destroys game balance , and seems to take away from teh soul of the game . Anyhow , what you role on the damage die is in a way determining a good hit or bad hit , so no need to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try adding 1 damage point plus any str. damage bonus . This resulted in fighters with high str. getting the biggest advantage from critical hits ... as it should be . <p> Natural 1 = Fumble weapon and miss , fail a DEX check and you drop the weapon . <p> Do n't know if it 's " fair and balanced " but it 's always worked well , been fun , and been easy to remember for us . <p> ' But the discord of Melkor rose in uproar and contended with it , and again there was a war of sound more violent than before , until many of the Ainur were dismayed and sang no longer , and Melkor had the mastery . ' <p> Critical hits can add a new dimension to the game but I 'd only recommend using them for experienced DM 's or gaming groups that can judge the effects to the campaign . I started using a system based on the old Arduin rules a very long time ago before I had the capability to accurately judge the effects . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row are required which tend to make them rather rare . If I started all over I 'd probably leave them out entirely . <p> G. good summary of the problem , after playing 3E a bit I 'm starting to agree with this assesment . Matt , thoughtful methodology but it seems complicated . Do you normaly use this system , or is it unusual ? <p> I do n't like critical hits and fumbles , and I have never used them . IMO , it over-emphasizes luck and de-emphasizes player skill . <p> Critical hits done the 2E way are a balance ( IMO of course ) . To transform a mere threat ( which is pure luck ) into an actual critical hit , a second successful roll to hit is required , and that roll is based on the player-character 's combat ability . <p> For that matter , I allow a save to avoid a rolled fumble ; I am using a custom ability-based save system remarkably like the Out of Harms Way rules , where the save gets easier as the character gains levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC capability . <p> Despite that , many people used Rolemaster . I do n't like the system overmuch , but the critical tables make for amusing reading . <p> A simple critical hit system ( and I like that natural 20 = maximum damage , very nice indeed ) adds a point of excitement to the game without needless complication . For those who like complicated critical hit systems , the 2E Player 's Option books had one , and an even more complicated system ( for 1E ) exists in a Dragon magazine . My brother used to use the latter in some of his solo games using the random dungeon generation table in the DMG . <p> Just using the strict 1E combat rules , a fighter with an 18/00 strength who wields a dagger has a certain " critical hit " feel about him when attacking someone with a two-handed sword ( or perhaps even a pike ! ) and a tie is indicated on the initiative roll ... <p> Personally , I became quickly disenchanted with the complex critical hit systems that proliferated in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Critical fumbles I have never , ever liked - especially after seeing what happened to my brother 's druid in the aforementioned solo game . ( Three fumbles in the row broke all of his weapons and inflicted near-mortal damage on that druid ) . <p> I started using a simple critical system with the 2.5E books , but that lies out of the scope of discussion on this board . <p> I 've used " 20 equals a hit and double damage , 1 means you miss your next attack " since I started with Holmes D&amp;D in the late 70s . I do n't know where or why we picked it up in those pre-internet days ... but many players at the time used a similar system . <p> With ad&amp;d I 've played in games where we used charts and things too , which had people dropping their weapons , impaling themselves , etc . Not really what I 'd call complicated -- but the results could occassionally be humorous or ludicrous . In most cases I retired critical hit / fumble tables pretty quickly simply because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 5% chance of a critical hit and a 5% chance of a fumble on any dice roll is you do crit/fumbles on a 1/20 . If this seriously unbalances your game , perhaps your players are using loaded dice ( little smiley face goes here to show he is only kidding ) . <p> The idea that critical hits can unbalance a game is interesting ; what they do is make combat more random . <p> One can imagine a system where a 2nd level fighter will always beat a 1st level fighter in a fair fight because only the levels are compared - that is not random at all , and totally predictable . <p> AD&amp;D has it so that it is probable that the 2nd level fighter will defeat the 1st level fighter in a fair fight - randomness is introduced through levels of initiative , " to hit " rolls and damage rolls . <p> A Critical Hit system adds another level of randomness ( and lethality ) - and it comes in various points on the scale depending on the system . <p> Somewhere down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for nothing and only chance plays a part . <p> Exactly where you place the bar depends on your desires - I 've certainly played in the first scenario ( non-random ) with the Amber DRPG ... of course , fair fights are far and few between in that game ! <p> If someone gets a natural 20 IMC-plus 1 damage . Each character class gets a critical roll . They roll another d20 . For 1st level types its 1-2 on a 20 . If you roll a 1 or 2 , you add whatever number you rolled in your classes current level bracket , so for 1st level types you either add a 1 or 2 depending on what it was you rolled and add that to the damage . This extra d20 does not add anything to the hit number to be achieved . Allowing full damage on a " 20 " from a weapon was something I also had come up with a while ago , but it 's too much . <p> In any event , the crit bracket widens as levels go up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For fighters . The bracket progression to get the next best crit step is identical to the combat progression step . 5 steps for mu 's 4 steps for clerics etc . For mu 's it tops out at 21st level 1-6 on d20 for clerics it eventually tops out at 19th level 1-8 on a 20 . For thieves it tops out at 21st level 1-7 on a 20 and for fighters it tops out at 15th level at 1-9 on a 20 which is identical for 17+ HD monsters as well . You could allow the bracket increase to continue to higher levels if you so desired . <p> If they need to get a natural 20 to hit the foe .... no plus damage and no crit roll . Seems wrong to give a crit on a hit that takes that number to actually land a hit . <p> I have altered it to the 4th 5th and 6th 20 on the combat table is the natural roll . The 1st 2nd and 3rd are die roll plus mods . <p> Say you want hit an area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly 8 " or less . If on a seperate 20 you are within your called shot bracket , you can roll for the area ac . IN addition you may be able to circumvent something that otherwise would require a natural 20 to hit in order to score the critical damage you are seeking to inflict . <p> Say the armor of the beast you are fighting requires a 23 to hit . But there is a small 4 " hole in its back or somewhere . And its ac 5 for area ac . <p> You have to roll within your bracket to attempt an ac 5 shot . Then if you roll within your bracket and get a 20 you get to add the value you rolled in the bracket to the damage you inflict . <p> Or if you at least roll a number greater than the value to hit ac 5 , then you at least will be doing something to it , because your bonuses will not add even on a natural 20 to get the 23 otherwise required . <p> INherent weaknesses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reward for the players when being fought against .... <p> During my first edition days we used a natural 20=double damage . We also employed the Good Hits/Bad Misses from Best of Dragon . This led to many memerable moments , but tended to cause problems when the 15th level fighter was killed by the low level gate guards outside of the BBEG 's lair . <p> The way my friends and I have always played ( since ' 81 ) is that a natural 20 = double damage ( unless a 20 is needed to hit ) . When I started my Stormcrows Campaign ( circa ' 92 ) , we added the natural 1 = fumble to balance things out . <p> It works great for us . Perhaps I should say it works great for me , I tend to roll lots of 20s against the players . <p> When I started my Stormcrows Campaign ( circa ' 92 ) , we added the natural 1 = fumble to balance things out . <p> Yup .

@@59195522 @8195522/ <p> Well , you 're right , Invisibility is for casting on creatures , not objects , so my DM was being generous lo those many years ago .

That way if he chooses to change the rules he can announce it to everyone , and any issues with the variation are easier to nip in the bud . We just find it easier when everyone knows the score . <p> The way we have always worked this is that as long as the spell falls into a school that is allowed , then it is assumed that you learn the spell from the allowed school .

@@59195524 @8195524/ <p> Another post for those wondering how things were intended to work . I 've seen posts indicating that when one of a multi-classed characters classes reaches its level limit and the other keeps going , the character still has to divide the HD and con bonus for the the class that can still level . Per EGG , this is incorrect . Once one class has reached it 's limit , the other class gets a full HD and con bonus for each new level . A halfling 4th level fighter , 6th level thief with a con of 15 would have Hit Points as follows : 1st level : d10+d6 divided by 2 +1 2nd level : d10+d6 divided by 2 +1 3rd level : d10+d6 divided by 2 +1 4th level : d10+d6 divided by 2 +1 5th Level : d6+1 6th level : d6+1 174048 @qwx584048 174048 @qwx584048 <p> Actually , it stands to reason that this would be so .

" - Calvin <p> Keep in mind that Gary is probably motivated to tell you , not what he meant when he wrote things , but what he should have meant . <p> In this instance , it makes sense . A halfling filcher has 6 hit dice . If a halfling hero/filcher were to gain only half a hit die for his thief levels even after he was no longer gaining fighter levels , he 'd only have 5 hit dice . As Gary describes it , a halfling hero/filcher will have 6 hit dice , with a slightly higher average number of hit points . <p> MerricB wrote : <p> guess , that if you 've maxed out in a class ' level , you 're no longer " professing " that class ? <p> Read it again .

He may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or he may have told him what he should have said .

@@59195526 @8195526/ <p> I 'm working on some more tweaks for the Mystic as presented in the Rules Cyclopedia . <p> As is , the Mystic is painfully underpowered at really low levels , and painfully overpowered at really high levels .... <p> Example ? Well , at 1st level , he 's got maybe 2 HP more than the oft-maligned low-level Magic-User , the same AC ( 9 ) , and can punch 1 time/round for 1d4 damage .... Of course , he can also use any weapon , but not armor or shields . So he 's really not going to want to engage in melee ... And the Mystic does n't even get the 1 sleep spell ! So what use does he server to the party ? He might be able to stay back with the Thief and fire arrows for support ( and even the Thief gets some leather armor ) . <p> And at higher levels ? Well , at level 9 , his damage potential makes a dramatic jump , and then it skyrockets at level 13 .... ( these are the levels where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing with MS Works chart-making tools ... take a look ! <p> This shows average damage if all his attacks hit during a round . <p> So yeah , at 16th level , that 's 78 points of damage every round , on average ( the damage range is 12-144 ! ) . <p> I 'm not overly concerned about the high levels at the moment though , because it 's really difficult for a PC to gain those levels -- He has to fight defeat that monster 13th level Mystic in order to gain 13th level ! <p> It would be nice to make them a bit more playable through the very low levels though . They need to get to level 3 before they can reasonably engage in melee combat . After level 4 , when they get the Heal Self ability , they are much better off and can get in on the action . <p> Of course , the Master 's set said , " feel free to add ... other minor abilities , etc . " And gave the bare-bones " four fighting styles " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting styles and given each of them some Weapon Mastery abilities -- for example , using the " Throwing " style , the Mystic can employ the Hook ability of a Halberd to throw his opponent to the ground , and for the Defensive style , The Mystic gets a -2 bonus to his AC , but only inflicts half damage with his hand attacks . I think this style , especially , would be useful to keep the low-level Mystics alive . <p> Now I 'm considering the Mystic 's Hit Dice ..... <p> In the Master 's Set , Mystics were listed as " monsters " with some notes for adapting them as players characters . They were listed as having up to 16 hit dice , and it was noted that they roll a d6 to determine their Hit Points . <p> This would give a 16 HD Mystic average HP of 56 <p> The RC made the Mystic a full-fledged character class , and following the precedent of other classes , made 9 the max HD , and gave +2 HP per level past 9 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45.5 <p> But I see in the Master 's set , in the section describing how to use Mystics as PCs , it says ( emphasis added ) , " All the details and rules given in the monster description still apply . Use the same XP requirements for level advancement as a fighter , and feel free to add level titles , other minor abilities , etc . Treat each experience level as one hit die , however mystics can not advance higher than level 16 . " <p> It 's making me thing that yeah , maybe Mystics were supposed to have a full 16 HD .... <p> Chart ! ( Hey , be quiet ! I can make charts if I wan na make charts ! ! ) <p> The red line shows the straight linear progression of average HP from the Masters set , and the purple line shows how the RC changes that . <p> The Blue line is an option that might work ... It give the Mystic a d8 for HD , like the fighter class .... And the Gray line is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .... <p> Red ( 1d6 every level , even past level 9 ) Master Set Progression . Advantages : That 's where Mystics are " supposed to be . " Disadvantages : Breaks the precedent of every other character class .... Do mystics have to follow the precedent of every other class ? Maybe not ; they are " special ? " But If not , they would have more HD than any other PC class .... ( usual max is 9 HD ) . <p> Purple ( 1d6 per level till 9 , then +2 HP thereafter ) RC progression . Advantages : Well , it weakens the high-level Mystics who are already super-powerful ? ? And it is in line with all other PC HD progressions . Disadvantages : Does it weaken them too much ? It deviates a lot from the Master 's set .... At 16th level , that is the max HP they will ever have .... <p> Blue ( 1d8 per level till 9 , then +2 HP thereafter ) An option .... Advantages : It helps those very-low level Mystics survive . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same place as the Master 's set progression . Disadvantages : It helps the medium level mystics too ..... does that make them more powerful than they should be ? It deviates a lot in the middle levels .... <p> Gray ( 1d6 per level till 9 , then +3 HP thereafter ) Another option .... Advantages : It sticks very close to the Master 's set progression , and it follows the precedent of other classes . Disadvantages : Maybe none per se , but it 's still no help for those low level Mystics ... And +3 HP per level after 9 seems like a lot ! Only Dwarfs match that amount , but only for 3 levels ( levels 10-12 ; their max level ) . <p> What does everyone else think ? <p> I said there was going to be jumping , did n't I ? Well , there will be .... But I think I 'll post about that later . Got enough to think over here ..... <p> It should be noted that I asked Frank his opinion on giving Mystics the normal DEX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he said it was ( as far as he was concerned ) simply the right way to go* . In AD&amp;D this does n't happen ( why ? Anybody 's guess I guess ) , but Saint Mentzer hath blessed us with his great insight in Classic that they SHOULD get the DEX AC bonus there . Since a Mystic HAS to have a DEX of 13 or higher , their AC HAS to be better than 9 at level 1 . <p> Not a giant bonus , but every little bit helps . <p> LONG ... *Its here somewhere ; if its really important to see the exchange , use the search engine I guess . I 'm too lazy to go find it myself . <p> But those requirements of having a 13 Dex and 13 Wis scores are only found in the RC , not the Master 's set .... And I feel those minimums are really inappropriate for Classic D&amp;D ( maybe in AD&amp;D .... ) . I suggest setting the minimums at 9 , as with the Demi-human minimum scores . <p> Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stun opponents . We could come up with a stun rule for mystics . I believe the 1E monk has a chance to stun every time they hit by more than 5. 3E monks can stun a number of times per day per level , it must be announced before the roll , and on a hit the foe must save . Take your pick . <p> I 'm working on some more tweaks for the Mystic as presented in the Rules Cyclopedia . <p> As is , the Mystic is painfully underpowered at really low levels , and painfully overpowered at really high levels .... <p> Oh and also at high levels , keep in mind that the mystic is still just using his unarmed attacks , which have no magical powers added . The fighter in the party meanwhile has a +5 dragon slayer sword which probably gets other assorted magical powers too . Against a high armor class foe ( or low I suppose considering better is lower ) , the mystic should n't hit nearly as often as the fighter . <p> As to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 , I 'd be inclined to give them a full 16 hit dice . I think they 'll earn it because they have to defeat all other other high level mystics to advance . If you play with the alternate charts in the back of the RC that allow them to go to 36 or do the 2 hp/attack rank trick ( do they get attack ranks ? ) then no . <p> To deal with the overpowered at high levels , I 'd use the RC option of letting them advance to 36th level . <p> If they are still too weak for low levels , perhaps they could be allowed to wear armor ( leather ? ) , though not stackable with their AC bonus at later levels and probably also hindering some of their other abilities . <p> Yeah , that 's a good point ; the fighter does get his magical bonuses to hit as well as damage . And the fighter will usually have a large collection of cool , magical stuff . <p> Though I 'd generally not expect a fighter to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low AC foe , the fighter will only get 1 attack per round , but the Mystic will get 4 . But throw in some Magic , Strength , and Weapon Mastery Hit Roll bonuses , and the fighter might be able to hit the target with a 2 , so his Multiple Attacks kick in .... But he would only get 2 attacks at level 12 . He 'd have to wait till level 36 to get 4 attacks . <p> So the really high level fighters can become better matched with the Mystic , but probably not back at levels 13-16 . <p> And as to using those charts in the back of the RC .... noooo , as usual , they suck , heh . They do n't actually slow down the Mystic 's progression at all . They allow him to advance just as before , becoming unbelievably powerful at level 16 , and then instead of stopping him there , they just allow him to keep gaining more HP and better attack rolls ! Plus his healing ability would continue to improve .... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainly no Frank , heh . <p> Well , one vote for the d8/+2 HD , one vote for the full 16d6 . <p> I have to say the full 16HD may be my least favorite option though , heh . No other PC goes past 9HD . <p> I just took a peek , and I do n't like how late this mystic gets some of the special abilities . Let 's be realistic ; most campaigns do n't go past 20th level . So you want all the major class abilities to have kicked in by around 17th-18th level so that they get used . Putting blankout at 25 and gentle touch at 36 might as well mean for 99% of players that those are n't even there . <p> I was going to adopt that suggestion about giving Mystics " Hear Noise " rather than " Find/Disarm Traps , " so they are n't getting too far into replacing Thieves . <p> The Despair effect seems very appropriate for Mystics as well , though it would require some judgement calls for when to use it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystic inflicted maximum damage ? But it was only 6 points ... ) . <p> Another note there makes me think .... There 's the possibility of requiring Mystics to be able to hit with a roll of 2 before they can use their multiple attacks on a target . That would certainly tone them down ... But it would weaken them too much , really ; it 'd amount to taking away their multiple attacks at low levels , because they 'd never be able to hit something with a roll of 2 until they are up around level 16 anyway . <p> Perhaps another option is just to limit their attacks and say that they can only attack any single target 2 times per round , unless they can hit it with a roll of 2 , then they can use up to their maximum number of attacks on it . <p> Maybe they could still split up their maximum number of attacks between multiple opponents if they were in range , but ca n't hit one opponent more than 2 times in a round ( let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in less than a round ... ) . <p> Or it could be more of a hard limit ; they can only make 2 attacks in a round ( even against multiple targets ) unless they can hit the target(s) with a roll of 2 . <p> Here 's a new chart : <p> Red shows the average damage if you allow the Mystic to make all attacks during a round ( and all attacks hit ) . <p> Blue shows the average damage if the Mystic is only allowed to make 1 attack per round ( possibly due to not being allowed to make multiple attacks unless he can hit on a roll of 2 ) . <p> Purple shows average damage if you allow 2 attacks per round . <p> Grey is what you might expect from a typical fighter . He gets a +1 sword at level 4 , +2 sword at level 7 , +3 sword at level 11 , and I was nice and gave him a +4 sword at level 13 . He also used Weapon Mastery training at level 3 to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The line splits where his Multiple Attacks become possible at level 12 . It 's not likely he 'd be able to use them against many targets at that level , but at levels 13 and 16 it becomes more and more likely that he will get them ( he 'd be more likely to get them than a Mystic using fists , if you require the Mystic to have the " roll of 2 " ) . <p> At the moment I 'm thinking Purple line for Mystics -- allow 2 attacks per round , unless he can hit a target with a roll of 2 . <p> That keeps them from exploding too far out of control .... But still give them a damage advantage over fighters ... Otherwise , the Mystic could just use a sword + Mastery and have the better damage and same multiple attacks of the fighter , which would be better through most of the Mystic 's career ! I want them to have a reason to favor their unarmed attacks ... <p> So , since the Mystic has a damage advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep his HP advantage ... <p> So I 'm favoring 9d6 HD for the Mystic , with the +3 HP/level up to 16 where he stops gaining HP . That closely follows the Master 's Set progression , but conforms to other character classes max of 9HD . <p> As for the low level Mystic , I 've got more miscellaneous stuff coming up to help him out . He wo n't be a good combatant at very low levels , but he can be useful in other ways .... <p> I just took a peek , and I do n't like how late this mystic gets some of the special abilities . Let 's be realistic ; most campaigns do n't go past 20th level . So you want all the major class abilities to have kicked in by around 17th-18th level so that they get used . Putting blankout at 25 and gentle touch at 36 might as well mean for 99% of players that those are n't even there . <p> Yeah , and the same goes for other character classes too ( clerics do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ned 18 wis , fighters do n't get their fourth attack , etc . ) However , if you do n't like those features , change them ; I 'm playtesting that with a mystic character in my campaign at the moment ( up to 9th level , the low level party ) , and I 've made a couple of tweaks , but thus far its holding up really well . <p> What I think is n't important . It is what your DM decides that is - Gary Gygax . <p> The Acrobatics ability for Mystics . It was given in bare-bones form in the Master 's set . The RC gave a couple specific uses for it . I 'm all for the idea of setting down some specific uses for it .... And there are n't enough of them in the RC to justify the cost of the ability : A -20% penalty to all XP gained ! ! <p> Here 's what I 'm working on as a recommendation in my Document : <p> At the top of page 31 , the Rules Cyclopedia offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Check to use his Acrobatics ability . I recommend following that suggestion . Otherwise , someone who has taken the Acrobatics General Skill could perform some of the same things as the Mystic , but with a better chance of success . The Mystic must take on a hefty -20% XP penalty for his Acrobatics ability , and the formula given here for Acrobatics will always produce a chance that is lower than the Mystic 's chance of just making a simple Dexterity check . The Mystic would be better off taking the General Skill instead ! DM 's can always have the Mystic use the more difficult Acrobatic Check if he deems the difficulty of the action calls for it , but for most Acrobatic feats , the Dexterity Check should be fine . <p> The three things the RC says an Acrobatic Mystic can do on a successful Acrobatic Check , are : <p> 1 . Travel across rough terrain with no movement penalty . Not really that useful in most situations .... <p> 2 . Cross a line of enemies without having to break through or go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through " threatened areas " without having to stop , by jumping over them and such . <p> 3 . Do all the things in the Acrobatics General Skill . Also some nice stuff , like ignore the first 10 ' of a fall or gaining a +2 to Save against traps where he might be able to jump out of the way . <p> Now , as I said , the Acrobatic Mystic should have some abilities that are far superior to the Acrobatic Skill to justify the huge cost . Otherwise , the Mystic would be better off taking the Skill .... <p> It 's a nice list of stuff , but you do need some guidelines as to how to actually apply that in the game .... The Master 's set left you to work that out on your own . <p> My first thought for some inspiration came from the Gremlins in PC2 . <p> When they start out , they have the abilities : <p> Tumbling - Gremlins can fall up to 10 feet without sustaining injury . They have an instinct for tumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 ' of any fall is ignored for a gremlin . <p> Jumping - Gremlins can , with great style and panache , leap up to 8 feet horizontally , 12 feet if they have a running start of at least 10 feet . They can also leap up to 5 feet vertically , 7 feet if they have a running start of at least 10 feet . <p> At 6,000 XP ( comparatively between level 3-4 for a Mystic ) gremlins now ignore the first 20 ' of a fall . <p> At 12,000 XP ( comparatively between level 4-5 for a Mystic ) gremlins ' jumping distance goes to 12 ' /15 ' horizontally , and 6 ' /9 ' vertically . <p> So I thought these were some great ideas to base some Mystic Acrobatic abilities on .... <p> One thing to note is that gremlins gain these abilities automatically , and do not require any skill check to use them . I 'm not sure if that would be appropriate for Mystics or not . <p> I thought it would be nice to have a progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , at level 1 he can ignore the first 10 ' of a fall , at level 5 he can ignore the first 20 ' of a fall , and level 10 he can ignore the first 30 ' of a fall .... But then to follow the progression , I 'd get to level 15 where he could ignore the first 40 ' of a fall , and I thought that sounded like too much ! But then I looked at the OD&amp;D Blackmoor Monk .... <p> " Climbing : Monks have the same climbing ability as thieves of the corresponding level with the following important difference : At 5th level monks may fall up to 20 ' without sustaining any damage if there is a wall or similar surface within 2 ' which they can use for friction to break the fall . At 8th level monks may fall up to 40 ' if the wall is within 4 ' . At 11th level they may fall any distance if the wall is within 6 ' . " <p> They could fall an unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and they got the ability for free too .... <p> So I suppose allowing the 15th and 16th level Acrobatic Mystics to do something similar , and ignore the first 40 ' of a fall with a Dex check is acceptable .... <p> Could even change the progression to be an extra 10 ' every 4 levels instead of every 5 .... <p> At 12,000 XP ( comparatively between level 4-5 for a Mystic ) gremlins can jump : <p> 12 ' /15 ' horizontally , 6 ' /9 ' vertically . <p> So that 's how far a Gremlin can jump ... but How Far should a Mystic be able to Jump ? <p> Well , to get a good answer to that , I also had to ask , " How far can anyone jump ? " <p> So I looked at the movement table .... and thought jumping should be affected by encumbrance . And it looks to me that just taking 1/10th of the movement speeds just happens to work out to good jumping distances .... And use half the value if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these should never be converted to Yards for outdoor movement ! heh . <p> The guy carrying over 160 pounds of stuff really ca n't jump very far .... but he ca n't even move more than 5 ' in a round and still make an attack . <p> As for Vertical jumping ... that 's a bit trickier . But still wanting to stick with something fairly simple based on the movement table , I looked at Encounter Speed ( 1/3 normal/running speed ) and I think the numbers are acceptable .... <p> So jump height is 1/10 Encounter speed ( being greatly affected by encumbrance ) , and half that again if you do n't have a 10 ' run : <p> I think those numbers are reasonable .... People can almost match Gremlins in the long jump , but those light , spring-leggedy critters can easily jump higher than a human .... <p> Ok , now we have a baseline ..... <p> But How Far can a Mystic Jump ? I 'm almost to that ! <p> As you know , the Mystic gets faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . So if jump distance is just based simply on movement speed , all Mystics would automatically gain some pretty awesome jumping abilities .... <p> The problem is , I 've been looking for some cool abilities to give only to Acrobatic Mystics to make up for the -20% XP penalty they pay . <p> So it might be a little confusing to not base a ( non-acrobatic ) Mystic 's jumping abilities on his movement rate , but I suppose it could just be stipulated , " Non-Acrobatic Mystics can not jump any better than any other unencumbered PC . " <p> I guess you 'd end up sometimes with encumbered Mystics being able to jump distances that otherwise only unencumbered people could make .... but never more than the maximum an unencumbered character could jump ( H 6 ' /12 ' - V 2 ' /4 ' ) . <p> But is this just limiting non-acrobatic Mystics so we can say we 're giving something extra to the Acrobatic ones ? <p> Or maybe those are just " standard " jumping limits , and you wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can run . <p> Now , a Magical Item like the Boots of Speed actually gets useful ! They let you run at 240 ' per round , so you could make those nice running leaps ( and only running leaps ... not better standing leaps ) of 24 ' ..... That 's still not as far as what the Boots of Jumping can do from a standstill ( 30 ' ) . <p> But I 'm getting off track .... <p> So , how Far can an Acrobatic Mystic Jump ? <p> VERY FAR ! <p> If we allow him to now utilize his full movement speeds when making a leap ( possibly requiring an Acrobatics check ) we get : <p> Seems good thus far ! The only things I do not like are the movement rates in " half-units " , and not multiples of 5 . I think this can be solved by deciding that they can improve every two or three levels instead of every level . <p> You could round the jump distances to the nearest foot if you like .... <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table where he improved x every y levels ( to a nice , even number ) , that still would n't help for standard character jump distances based on encumbrance ( they get half values too ) . <p> But since this is based on a formula , you do n't actually need a table to show the values ( table provided for convenience here , so we can easily look over the entire range at once ) . <p> You just have to describe the formulas : <p> A character can make a long jump of a distance equal to 1/10th his Running Speed in feet per round . If he does not have a run of at least 10 ' he may only make a standing jump of half that distance . <p> A character can make a vertical jump of a height equal to 1/10th his Encounter Speed in feet per round . If he does n't have a run of at least 10 ' he may only make a standing jump of half that height . <p> Ok ... So now we got Acrobatic Mystics able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from falling ( or at least to decrease the damage of a fall ) . And he can flip past opponents without having to stop and fight . <p> Does that about account for the -20% XP penalty for taking Acrobatics ? <p> I got one more option .... <p> The Dodge Skill from PC3 : <p> Dodge ----- This skill can be used only by unarmored and unencumbered characters ( carrying 400 cn or less ) . It allows a character to dodge out of the way of an attack , effectively increasing AC by -2 on a successful Check . A roll of 20 means that the character has dodged the wrong way and will automatically take double damage from an attack . <p> First I 'll note that the skill originally was for underwater adventurers , and it said it did n't work unless underwater , but I thought above-water versions of the skill could exist ( in which case it wo n't work when under water , heh ) . <p> And it just stated " unarmored and unencumbered " which I inferred to mean " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the " unencumbered " movement class . I 'd actually let a character perform a Dodge even if he were wearing light armor , such as leather , as long as his total encumbrance was less than 400 cn ... <p> Ok , so I look a that skill and think , " why would a Mystic ever NOT take that skill ? Mystics are always unarmored , and usually unencumbered . " <p> He 'd be using that skill every round , all the time . <p> So ..... since that 's something every Mystic would want , why not make it a part of Mystic Acrobatics ? Just like the Acrobatics General Skill is also a part of Mystic Acrobatics .... <p> So a Mystic could either take the -20X XP penalty and get the whole package ( Acrobatics General Skill , Dodge General Skill , + the additional improved Jumping and improved Falling abilities mentioned so far in this topic ) . <p> Now THAT sounds like it 's worth the cost . <p> Or , a Mystic could spend 2 General Skill slots to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before continuing , I think the Dodge skill needs to be better-defined and limited , since a Mystic would be using it every round , all the time -- it has a good chance or working , and a very small chance of backfiring ( and even when it does , the opponent could still miss the attack ) . <p> So does it ... <p> a . Give a -2 to AC for the entire round ? And if a 20 is rolled , any attack that hits during the round will inflict double damage ? <p> b . The character must roll separately to dodge each attack . If a 20 is rolled , then only the attack that was being dodged ( if it hits ) will cause double damage . <p> I think b is the better option , since a Mystic has little to lose by using it every round , over and over . But there 's the additional question : <p> A. Can he dodge any number of attacks each round ? Just by rolling the Dodge skill before each attack is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Each round , the character may attempt to dodge one attack , plus one additional attack for each + of his Dexterity bonus . Each time he improves this skill , he may attempt dodge ( some number ) of additional attacks " <p> Actually , I 'm not really liking that .... you 'd still end up with 1 ( too few ) or up to 4 ( too many ? ) . <p> I think 2 sounds about right . Then if you improve the skill later by spending another skill slot , you can Dodge against an additional 2 each round . Or maybe an additional 1 ..... <p> Eh , I 'm not really sure ... I need to think over this and hear more opinions .... None of these options are just jumping out as the best ..... <p> Either way , the Acrobatic Mystic 's ability to Dodge could improve automatically with his level as his other Acrobatic abilities do .... Perhaps being able to Dodge vs. a number of attacks equal to the number of unarmed attacks he can make each round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like that either , heh ..... <p> Anyone else got any ideas ? <p> Remember that successfully " Dodging " just means a -2 bonus to AC vs. that attack , not an automatic miss . <p> I thought an elegant way to handle the Mystic 's crazy multiple attacks to keep them under control . <p> The Mystic can make up to his total number of hand attacks during around until he scores a hit . <p> So , for example , a 7th level Mystic has up to 2 hand attacks per round . <p> If he hits with his first attack , he 's done attacking and he rolls for the damage . <p> If he missed with his first attack , then he can make use of his second swing , and perhaps hit or miss ..... <p> So now he 'll be following that blue line on the chart , which shows average damage if he hits . <p> But his chances of hitting are vastly improved as he goes up in levels , because he can make multiple swings if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's it for him that round . The Fighter might be able to score more damage per hit throughout the mid levels , but the Mystic will actually have a better chance of hitting , once he gets more hand attacks . And that kind of makes up for the extra To Hit bonuses the Fighter will be getting from a magic sword or Weapon Mastery . <p> Yes , this will considerably weaken the Mystic in hand-to-hand combat , but they needed to be weakened .... Look at that red line ! ! <p> Why should they be better melee combatants than Fighters ( by FAR ) and still have a boatload of other incredible special abilities to boot ? <p> And even though weakened , they are by no means weak . Remember , the Mystic can still use the Smash maneuver .... And if he misses the first time because of the -5 to hit penalty , he can swing up to 3 more times ! <p> ( actually , I 'm not sure Smash should even be allowed in conjunction with Multiple Attacks of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character must give up any other attacks when using it .... ) <p> And as with the Fighter 's Multiple Attacks , the Mystic can still be allowed to hit with his full number of attacks on any target he can hit with a roll of 2 . <p> Dodge----- This skill can be used only by unarmored and unencumbered characters ( carrying 400 cn or less ) . It allows a character to dodge out of the way of an attack , effectively increasing AC by -2 on a successful Check . A roll of 20 means that the character has dodged the wrong way and will automatically take double damage from an attack . <p> Gah ! ! ! Rolling an extra d20 just to find out your AC ? ? Sounds like a pain in the butt . <p> Why not just give -1 AC . Its not very disbalancing really , considering only unarmoured and unencumbered characters could use it . <p> Hm . I guess you really do n't like the idea of rolling separately against each attack then .... <p> I suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't like the idea of making it automatic , as it is a Dexterity skill , and people with a low Dex would be getting the same benefit as those with a high Dex . <p> I thought that 3 dodges per round seems about right , and each one has to be used individually against a specific attack .... I suppose making one roll for all 3 dodges could work .... So maybe on a successful Check you get a -2 to AC against up to 3 attacks in a round -- this is similar to how the automatic AC bonuses from Weapon Mastery work . But would that also mean that if you rolled a 20 , you 'd take double damage from up to 3 attacks that round ? That 's the ' gotcha ' ... That seems too harsh . Or perhaps you only take double damage from the first attack that hits you .... that seems better . <p> Ok , so maybe .... <p> One Skill Check is made at the beginning of a round if the character wants to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a -2 bonus to his AC against the first 3 attacks that round . <p> If he rolls a 20 , he takes double damage from the first attack that hits him that round . <p> Mainly because Dodge is a General Skill , and it needs to have a " base " to start from for people who just take the General Skill ( which may not ever improve ) . Starting with only 1 does n't seem like enough ( i.e. , -2AC vs. 1 attack each round ) . I could settle for 2 though .... And let Mystics automatically gain another dodge each time they gain more hand attacks , ending with a max of 5 dodges ( -2 AC/5 ) . <p> Incidentally , that 's the same maximum number of attacks that Weapon Mastery can give you an AC bonus against ( at Grand Master level with the Throwing Hammer : -4AC/5 ) . <p> EDIT : oh , I see that actually the Horned Shield can gain -1AC/6 at Grand Master level . <p> And do you prefer 1 roll for each separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round ( up to your max ) ? <p> OK , here is the end ( ? ) result of my number crunching and tweaking of the Mystic class . I think this ends up being much better balanced and playable throughout all levels . <p> First the info on Jumping &amp; Leaping for everyone : <p> Code : <p> Jumping &amp; Leaping----------------- <p> This is not actually covered anywhere in Classic D&amp;D , but I have found a need to determine how far or high a character can jump , and have arrived at some good numbers that work out well . <p> I recommend that : <p> A character can make a running long jump of a distance equal to 1/10th his Running Speed in feet per round . If he does not have a run of at least 10 ' , he may only make a standing long jump of half that distance . <p> A character can make a vertical jump of a height equal to 1/10th his Encounter Speed in feet per round . If he does n't have a run of at least 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half that height . <p> So , for example , an unencumbered character with a Running Speed of 120 feet per round could make a running long jump of 12 ' or a standing long jump of 6 ' in distance . His encounter speed would be 40 feet per round , so he could make a running high jump of 4 ' or a standing high jump of 2 ' in height . These distances are the maximum most characters will be able to achieve . <p> Note that these distances are always measures in feet ; do not increase them to yards for outdoor movement ! <p> And I included my adaptation of the Dodge skill . I removed the wording " unarmored " because I saw that almost all the creature characters in PC3 have a natural AC of 7 or better , so I only kept the " unencumbered " requirement . Thieves and other lightly-armored characters could still use this skill . <p> Code : <p> Dodge ( Dexterity Skill ) ----- <p> This skill can be used only by unencumbered characters ( carrying 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodge out of the way of an attack , effectively increasing AC by -2 on a successful Check . A roll of 20 means that the character has dodged the wrong way and will automatically take double from an attack . I recommend that this skill is only effective against up to 3 attacks per round , though only one skill check is needed during the Intentions step ( when the character must announce that he is Dodging ) . If the check is successful , the character gains a -2 AC bonus against the first 3 attacks upon him that round . If the character rolls a 20 , he will take double damage from the first attack that hits him that round . To use this skill , the character must be able to move around freely , and ca n't be entangled or underwater , for example . Furthermore , since the character must react to his opponents ' attacks , he must give up initiative during any round he uses this skill . The character also can not apply the Dodge bonus against any attack that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending an additional skill slot could give the character a mere 1 point increase to his skill level , but could also allow him to Dodge against 1 additional attack each round . <p> The Masters set never mentioned any minimum scores needed in order to play a Mystic . But then again , it did n't even state the Prime Requisite for Mystics , and was only presenting a basic framework for Mystic characters , whereas the Cyclopedia fleshes them out more and integrates them as a fully-developed class . That said , I firmly believe setting required minimum scores of 13 in both Wisdom and Dexterity is inappropriate for Classic D&amp;D . As with Demi-Humans , I recommend the character only be required to have scores of 9 or better in the appropriate abilities in order to play a Mystic . <p> Hit Dice-------- <p> In the Master 's Set , Mystics actually got 16d6 Hit Dice , since they were listed as " monsters " with guidelines given to allow them as Player Characters . The Rules Cyclopedia , developing them more , followed the precedent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then adding a set amount of HP for each level after that . But only giving them +2 HP per level past 9 short-changes them from where they should be . I recommend instead giving them +3 HP per level after 9 , up to level 16 . This will more closely follow the original progression . <p> Another change from the Masters set , Mystics are NOT supposed to get their listed number of attacks when attacking with anything other than their bare hands . You can see this by looking at the description of the 7th level Mystic in the Monster section on page 195 , where the number of attacks is listed as , " 1 weapon or 2 hands . " Mystics ARE supposed to gain the Fighter 's Multiple Attacks option , which does apply to attacks with weapons as described on page 104 . This will first be available at 12th level when 2 attacks per round are available . Since Mystics ca n't advance past 16th level , they would never gain more attacks .... However , you could allow them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past their maximum level ( as Demi-Humans do ) . A Mystic would gain more attacks at the same XP totals a Fighter normally would ( i.e. , 3 attacks at 2,040,000 XP , and 4 attacks at 3,480,000 XP ) . <p> Though the Rules Cyclopedia mostly does a good job bringing everything together into a fleshed out Mystic character class , the basic guidelines for doing so in the Master 's Set concluded with , " Whenever developing a new character class , remember to keep the abilities of these new characters in balance with those of the other classes . " As a ' monster ' in the Master 's set , Mystics made potent allies or opponents for high-level characters , but when developing them into a character class , some changes do need to be made to keep them balanced against the other classes . The following section contains a couple of suggestions in that regard , along with several other finishing details . <p> Hand Attacks------------ <p> The Mystic 's unarmed attacks are the main concern when balancing them against the other classes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , the average damage a 20-36th level Magic-User can do with a Fireball is 70 , and although it affects multiple targets , they each get a Saving throw for half damage . A 16th level Mystic can inflict an average of 78 points of damage every round with his bare hands ! This can be brought into balance by placing limits on how the Mystic can make use of his multiple unarmed attacks . Here are my suggestions : <p> A Mystic may make up to his total number of unarmed attacks each round UNTIL he scores a hit . For example , a 9th level Mystic may make up to 3 unarmed attacks each round . If he hits with his first attack , he may make no further attacks . If he misses with the first swing , THEN he may make his second attack , and so on . However , as with the Fighter 's Multiple Attack option , if the Mystic can hit his opponent with an attack roll of 2 ( after all modifiers ) , then he may make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even after scoring a hit . In circumstances where the Mystic must give up a number of attacks during a round , the attacks are first taken from his maximum number of attacks . For example , using some of the fighting styles detailed in the next entry , a Mystic has to give up an attack each time he successfully Deflects . So if a 7th level Mystic ( maximum of 2 attacks per round ) Deflected one of his opponent 's attacks , the Mystic would still be left with 1 attack available when his next attack step came up . <p> Also , when using his Martial Arts a Mystic may make no other type of attacks during the round ( he ca n't make an additional off-hand Strike attack , for example ) . <p> With this method , the 16th level Mystic will now do an average of 19.5 damage each round ( much better balanced against other high-level characters ) , but will still have vastly improved changes of hitting , since he gets 4 swings . <p> Acrobatics---------- <p> At the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply having the Mystic make a Dexterity Check to use his Acrobatics ability . I recommend following that suggestion . Otherwise , someone who has taken the Acrobatics General Skill could perform some of the same things as the Mystic , but with a better chance of success . The Mystic must take on a hefty -20% XP penalty for his Acrobatics ability , and the formula given here for Acrobatics will practically always produce a chance that is lower than the Mystic 's chance of just making a simple Dexterity check . The Mystic would be better off taking the General Skill instead ! DM 's can always have the Mystic use the tougher Acrobatic Check if he deems the difficulty of the action calls for it , but for most Acrobatic feats , the Dexterity Check should be fine . <p> I also offer some additional optional abilities available to Acrobatic Mystics , to make sure this ability is superior to the inexpensive Acrobatics General Skill . Some of these are based on abilities from the original D&amp;D Blackmoor Monk and the Gremlin class from PC2 Top Ballista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystic can move , he can jump no farther than the maximum distances achievable by other unencumbered characters with a 120 ' movement rate ( see the entry for page 88 about Jumping &amp; Leaping ) . An Acrobatic Mystic , however , has special training allowing him , on a successful Acrobatics Check , to make impressive jumps based on his FULL movement rate ( encumbrance permitting ) . He can do flips , run along walls , pole-vault off a staff , or any other similar action needed to achieve such distances . <p> Tumbling - As with the Acrobatics General Skill , the Mystic can fall up to 10 feet without sustaining injury . On a successful check , he can ignore the first 10 ' of a fall by tumbling to minimize damage to himself . As he gains levels , he can fall even greater distances without sustaining injury . At 5th level , he can ignore the first 20 ' of a fall . This increases to 30 ' at 9th level , and 40 ' at 13th level . The Mystic will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or otherwise slowing his fall by using any nearby wall , ledge , branch , or other object . <p> Dodging - The Acrobatic Mystic has the same ability to Dodge as with the Dodge General Skill . He can gain a -2 bonus to his AC against up to 3 attacks per round by making a successful Acrobatics Check . As the Mystic gains levels , his Dodge becomes effective against more attacks each round . At 6th level the bonus is effective against up to 4 attacks per round . This increases to 5 attacks per round at 12th level . All other aspects of the Dodge General Skill apply ; see the entry for page 83-85 for details . <p> Thief Abilities--------------- <p> As I have seen suggested elsewhere , I recommend giving the Mystic the Hear Noise ability rather than Find Traps and Remove Traps . This seems more appropriate for Mystics , and keeps them from diminishing the usefulness of the Thief class . <p> Movement Rate------------- <p> There 's no mention of how fast an ENCUMBERED Mystic can move .... Extrapolating from how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this table , multiplying the Mystic 's unencumbered MV by these factors : <p> When using this ability , the Mystic is not just invisible ; he 's completely undetectable . Frank Mentzer has said that the Mystic should be considered utterly silent , and the Master DM 's Book , page 33 , notes that the Mystic can not even be magically detected . <p> Higher Experience **30;304;TOOLONG <p> The battles to gain higher levels are supposed to work in the same way as for Druids ( see the topic about Higher Experience Levels in the entry for page 28 about Druids ) . In these challenges Mystics may not use any of the Mystic Abilities ( namely , Blankout and Gentle Touch ) . They may use all their unarmed fighting abilities though . <p> The Mystic 's unarmed attacks can hold their own against basic weapons , but when Weapon Mastery is used , the Mystic will find that his unarmed attacks are quite inferior through the lower to mid levels , when he could just as easily be using a sword along with Weapon Mastery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include the information , but the Master 's set listed four styles of martial arts fighting for Mystics . The styles were only basically described , and were left for the DM to develop . <p> Based on the information in the Master 's Set , I 've fleshed out those four fighting styles so that the Mystic 's unarmed attacks become a more desirable choice even when Weapon Mastery is in play ( though you can also use this option even if you 're not otherwise using Weapon Mastery ) . <p> A Mystic must declare which style he is using during the Intentions Step . All his attacks that round must use the same style . If no other style is declared , Offensive is the default style . <p> Most of the styles are based on a certain weapon ( including a cheesy-sounding name for each style ) , and will use Weapon Mastery special effects of that weapon . These special effects will automatically function at a level of Mastery based on the Mystic 's Experience Level : <p> This style of fighting causes damage by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow , and other parts of the body . Use of offensive style can break boards and bricks . This is a straight-forward , aggressive style ; the Mystic launches direct attacks upon his opponent , doing increasing damage as the he gains skill . By focusing his chi into his strikes the Mystic can even damage creatures that are immune to normal weapons . <p> - Use the standard hand attack tables for this style . Also use the table for hitting as a magic weapon ( and do not apply that table to the other styles below ) . <p> This style of fighting is used to incapacitate a foe through lock holds , counter leverage , and nerve pinches . The Mystic strikes at specific pressure points , attempting to grasp and hold on to his opponent . This does n't cause much physical damage , but some masters of this style may be able to paralyse a foe so that the victim need not be held further . <p> - Treat this as if attacking with a Bola ( but gaining no defense bonus ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Special results will only last for one round unless the Mystic actively maintains the hold . For as long as the Mystic wishes to maintain a hold , he must continue using this style and must give up one of his attacks each round ( the victim may still break the hold with the usual Saving Throw ) . If the Strangle result is achieved , the Mystic must give up all further attacks to maintain the hold until the victim is dead ( unless the Mystic wishes to release the hold sooner , in which case the standard Paralysis occurs ) . While maintaining any hold , if the Mystic is attacked by anyone he is not holding , treat the Mystic as if he he is Prone against the new attacker ( see page 150 ) . If the Mystic has enough attacks available , he can attack the new opponent while holding the old one , and might even score a hold on the new opponent . <p> The Mystic moves with continuous , flowing motions , blocking attacks and turning them aside . With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher levels he can deflect many incoming attacks by making circular sweeps with his hands . <p> - When using this style , the Mystic gains a -2 AC bonus and the Deflect abilities of a Staff . The Mystic may still make his usual unarmed attacks , but will inflict only half normal hand damage ( round up ) . If the Mystic successfully Deflects any number of attacks , then during his next attack step he must give up one of his attacks for each attack he deflected . <p> This style of attack turns the momentum of the attacker against him by tripping , pushing , or throwing an opponent . As the Mystic strikes , he grasps at the opponent ( or the opponent 's weapon ) and attempts to push , pull , or throw the opponent ( or weapon ) to the ground . This will inflict minimal damage , but successful use of this style can allow a Mystic to Disarm or leave the opponent prone and unable to properly defend himself on the following round . The Mystic can also occasionally Deflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mystic gains the special abilities of the Halbard when using this style . When using the Hook ability , the Mystic will inflict damage based on his equivalent Weapon Mastery level for the style : Basic = 1 damage , Skilled = 2 damage , Expert = 3 damage , Master = 4 damage , Grand Master = 5 damage . If the Mystic successfully Deflects any number of attacks , then during his next attack step he must give up one of his attacks for each attack he deflected . <p> When Mystics fight each other , the mechanics of Dominance come into play depending on which style each Mystic ( secretly ) selects during the Intentions step . <p> If a Mystic has chosen the style Dominant to his opponent 's style , he gains +2 to hit . If hit , his opponent must make a Saving Throw vs Spells ; if the Save fails , the attack inflicts double damage and the victim receives a -2 penalty to any Saving Throws against that attack ( including Deflect attempts ) . <p> If a Mystic has selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he receives a -2 to hit . If he hits , his opponent gets to make a Saving Throw ; if the Save succeeds , the attack only inflicts half damage and the opponent gains a +2 to any Saving Throws against that attack ( including Deflect attempts ) . <p> Nope , there was nothing like that in the Master 's Set . It never listed their PR or any minimum scores . <p> The original Blackmoor Supplement said that Clerics who had a wisdom of at least 15 and a strength of at least 12 and a Dexterity of at least 15 could be Monks . I do n't know if it gave a bonus to XP for high abilities ... <p> The RC just selects Strength as the Mystic 's PR , and says they need minimum scores in Wis and Dex . <p> What you mention is similar to the Elf . He has two PRs : Str and Int . If he has a score of 13 in both of them , he gets a 5% XP bonus . If he has Str of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he gets the 10% bonus . <p> Halflings have Str and Dex as PRs , with Con needing a minimum of 9 , but if either Str or Dex is 13 , then they get the 5% bonus . If both scores are 13 or better , they get 10% . <p> Something like that might work well for the Mystic too , rather than being totally based on Str , like a Fighter .

If you 'd like to add a link to a thread , feel free to post it here . I 'll periodically " clean up " this thread , combining the links into the first post for easy access . Where it appears reasonable to do so , I 'll copy the body of the relevant post into this thread . For the sake of brevity I plan to delete any post that is n't directly an answer to a frequently asked question ( after copying any links therein of course ) . <p> Character ClassesRace &amp; Class optionsQ : Does Holmes Basic support separated race and class ; i.e. halfling thieves , single-class elf fighters , etc. ? A : The monochrome B1 that originally came with it offered such race &amp; class options for the pregenerated characters in the back . However , the rules did not actually provide any guidance on how to actually play say a dwarf or halfling thief , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are n't worried about balancing their extra abilities out . <p> Q : How exactly do elves progress in two areas ? A : It is assumed that you add the experience required to progress to each fighter and magic-user level to come up with a new elf chart . This honestly should have been done for the reader : <p> EquipmentOther weaponsQ : Page 20 lists javelins and sling stones , but they do n't appear in the equipment list on page 7 . A : I recommend javelins cost 1 gp since spears cost 2 gp . Slings - and clubs and staves for that matter - are free . <p> Weapon DamageQ : With all weapons doing 1d6 , I like it that magic-users can use swords and there generally are n't class weapon restrictions . How can I keep that flavor but vary weapon damage ? A : Many people who run Holmes Basic or White Box D&amp;D use class-based damage . Here is my recommendation using weapon classifications : <p> Note that in this design , fighters are tops at everything , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : That 's great , but how can I further differentiate say maces and morning stars and flails ? A : That 's a tough one . For flails you can have them ignore 1 point of armor class from a shield due to the way they bend . <p> CombatInitiativeQ : Why can daggers allow two attacks per round when all weapons do 1d6 ? A : I 've heard it is largely an editing mistake , because it was supposed to be used in conjunction with another subsystem that got dropped . <p> Modules and ExpansionsPackagedQ : What adventure did Holmes Basic come with ? A : The box set had 3 variants . It originally came with the Dungeon Geomorphs and the Monster &amp; Treasure Assortment Set One . Then it changed to include B1 . Finally , it came with B2 . <p> Published adventuresQ : What published modules were written expressly for Holmes Basic ? A : B1 and B2 were originally written for it . The Holmes B1 is the monochrome one , and the Holmes B2 has slightly different artwork and mentions a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Expansions beyond level 3 ? Q : What are some fan-made expansions ? A : The most popular is Meepo 's . It goes to level 9 and basically incorporates the OD&amp;D rules to do so . Another choice is Patrick 's . It also goes to level 9 but keeps the power level low ( saves do n't improve , attacks do n't improve but fighters get more of them , cleric spells do n't go beyond level 2 , magic-user spells do n't go beyond level 3 ) . Others have been made , but the links seem to be dead . <p> Q : What does TSR provide for continuing a Holmes campaign past level 3 ? A : The Cook/Marsh Expert book provides instructions for those coming from the Holmes Blue book as opposed to the Moldvay Magenta book in the first page . <p> MOLDVAY/COOK/MARSH BASIC/EXPERTPublished 1980-1981 <p> ClassesQ : What is the purpose of level limits if each race is already balanced by different experience point requirements ? A : Level limits were largely intended to keep D&amp;D humanocentric , but honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of xp by race . Elves and dwarves already have steeper charts than fighters and goes up to decently high levels ; it is the halfling chart that needs attention if you are to drop level limits but keep race classes . I 'll come back with a suggestion later . <p> Q : What about gnomes ? They are already mentioned heavily in the rulebooks.A : I think they were n't presented as a playable race because the rules do n't allow enough differentiation between them and dwarves . <p> Q : Why does backstab never improve beyond times 2 ? A : In a system where fighters never get more than one attack and thieves can actually backstab with 1-10 damage two-handed swords , one can argue there 's no need . I do recommend , however , doubling the magic bonus of the weapon as well , so that as the thief gets better weapons , his backstab improves proportionally . If you do prefer to allow thief backstab damage to increase , one option to avoid every thief carrying a two-hander or pole-arm to maximize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 5th . <p> EquipmentQ : What is the rate of fire for a crossbow ? A : If you look at the " Using D&amp;D Expert rules with an early edition of Basic D&amp;D " section , you 'll see that they fire every other round , but this rule is n't present in Moldvay Basic . <p> Q : Why do staves in Basic do 1-6 ( at least as inferred by the damage a snake staff does ) , and in Expert do 1-4 ? A : This is a discrepancy . Note that even in Expert , a staff of striking with a charge used does 2-12 , not 1d4 + 1d6 . <p> Q : Why do the encumbrance values for magic armor differ in Expert from Basic ? A : This is a discrepancy ; presumably the authors of Expert decided the values needed to be a bit lower . <p> CombatQ : When movement is listed as say 40/120 , can my character move 120 feet in a single combat round if he does not attack ? A : The rules do mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , but you can use it as a " full move " as well . Just be careful , because if two sides start out separated by 120 feet , and side A wins initiative , moves up 120 feet and does not get to attack , and side B , which lost initiative , then attacks them first , well then you 'll start getting into situations where players always want to delay and go last . My recommendation is to allow 1/3 movement and guarding while running through the initiative order , and then combatants who did n't take an action and are n't threatened can move their remaining 2/3 of movement during " end of round movement " . <p> Saving throwsQ : Why do halfings and dwarves have different saving throws in Basic vs . Expert ? A : My understanding is that playtesting showed that the lower scores improved their playability , so they updated the rules in Expert . However , if you look at Blackrazor 's Companion , he has level 1-3 dwarves and halfings use the Basic figures , level 4-6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7-9 dwarves and ( up to 8 ) halflings use the Expert 4-6 figures , and so on . <p> Turn UndeadQ : Can the cleric try again the next round ? A : The rules do not say one way or the other . Some have argued that the turning tables are as advantageous as they are because they take into account 1 turn per encounter only . One compromise you can use is the house rule that if the cleric 's turn undead roll exceeded the type of creature actually being turned ( i.e. turned up to say a wraith when facing wights ) then the cleric can try again the next round . <p> SpellsSleep spellQ : Is there an area of effect ? A : No . Mentzer Basic , AD&amp;D , and BFRPG can be looked to as sources if you want one . If you want to play that it does not have an area of effect , you can say either that ( a ) anyone in range can be targeted , but the caster must be able to see them to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot , and proximity to that spot determines who is possibly affected . <p> Detect invisibilityQ : Where is the spell description ? A : It is missing . Mentzer Basic , AD&amp;D , BFRPG , and the B/X Companion can be looked to as sources . <p> TreasurePotion of PolymorphQ : Can you voluntarily end the duration ? Can you make more than one shape change ? A : ( going to take a second look at this ) <p> Ring of RegenerationQ : Is 1 hp/round too much ? A : All other versions , OD&amp;D included , have it at 1/turn . <p> OtherQ : Why are bracers of defense not listed ? How can I better protect my magic-user ? A : Some people embrace this as a feature . The balance between the 4 classes in B/X is remarkable , and we know this because we have threads about each class not being powerful enough Labyrinth Lord does take the other viewpoint and adds this item back into the game . <p> Companion RulesQ : What are the most popular 3rd party Companion expansions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are n't mutually exclusive either , they each feature distinct new spells and monsters . Blackrazor 's focuses more on fleshing out the rules and Barrataria 's is really all about the additional classes &amp; races . <p> PrintingsRevised Expert SetQ : What does the Revised Expert set have different than the original Mentzer Expert set ? A : The thief chart is slowed down to correspond with Companion 's ( these changes are repeated in the thief chart in the Masters set ) , the magic-user and elf spell charts are altered , and the thief experience point chart was tweaked . <p> Here is the Revised thief xp table ( it differs at levels 4 and 5 ) . <p> Level <p> XP <p> 1 <p> 0 <p> 2 <p> 1200 <p> 3 <p> 2400 <p> 4 <p> 5000 <p> 5 <p> 10000 <p> Here is the Revised elf spell progression ( it starts to differ from the original sequence at level 6 ) . <p> Level <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 3 <p> 4 <p> 5 <p> 1 <p> 1 <p> - <p> - <p> - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - <p> - <p> 3 <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> 4 <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> 5 <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> - <p> - <p> 6 <p> 3 <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> - <p> - <p> 7 <p> 3 <p> 3 <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> - <p> 8 <p> 4 <p> 3 <p> 2 <p> 2 <p> - <p> 9 <p> 4 <p> 4 <p> 3 <p> 2 <p> - <p> 10 <p> 5 <p> 4 <p> 3 <p> 2 <p> 1 <p> SpellsMagic MissileQ : In the spell description , the duration is 1 round , but somewhere else in the booklet ( I should look up the exact page ) , it says 1 turn.A : The magic arrow is meant to hang at the magic-user 's side for up to one turn if it is not fired right away . This allows the magic-user to cast the spell a number of times and allow the missiles to stack into a formidable arsenal . You may want to limit how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1991 <p> Source MaterialExpert SetQ : I noticed that some of the RC 's charts do n't line up with my Mentzer Expert set 's . Why ? A : Aaron Allston was a freelancer , and he apparently only had the first printing of the Mentzer Expert set to draw upon . Since he had the Masters set , he does have the Revised version 's 1-36 thief chart , but the elf spell progression , magic-user spell progression , and thief experience point chart do n't quite match Frank 's final vision . <p> CombatMove and AttackQ : On the first page of the combat section the RC says that a PC can do one thing , such as run 20ft or attack but on the following page it says a PC can move up to his encounter movement and still attack . Is this a contradiction ? A : The RC says you ca n't RUN 20 ' and still attack . It should have said 120 ' instead of 20 ' to be more clear , but 20 ' does qualify as running speed if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your encounter speed and still attack . <p> Hit PointsRecoveryQ : How many points are recovered through resting ? A : This rule is missing . <p> CLASSIC D&amp;D Published 1994 <p> ClassesHalflingsQ : Why do n't 4th level halflings improve in their to hit chart ? A : This is the only rule change between Classic D&amp;D and the Rules Cyclopedia that I 'm aware of .
