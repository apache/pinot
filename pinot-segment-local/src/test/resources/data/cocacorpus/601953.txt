@@108643910 @4043910/ <h> By David Miller , MD , - Clinical Vice President at Bracket <p> Cognitive and Functional outcomes are generally the co-primary endpoints in most symptomatic and disease-modifying clinical trials of Alzheimer 's disease . But Quality of Life ( QOL ) is an important component in understanding the disease , and measuring it can be difficult . <p> There are a handful of measures currently used in clinical trials to evaluate QOL . However , like other clinical outcomes in Alzheimer 's disease , there are unique challenges to understand QOL and difficulties to measure its change . <p> One important consideration is that as the dementia progresses , insight worsens . Therefore , determining when a reported change is real and when it it 's colored by diminished insight can prove challenging. - Often , caregivers are asked to serve as a proxy for the patient . However , this raises the question of when in the illness course the patient 's insight is better ( earlier in the course ) and when the caregiver 's becomes more reliable . <p> A recent article in Alzheimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges . In this study , the researchers examined a cohort of patients and caregivers and analyzed both patient and caregiver reports of QOL to try and better understand the differences . There were several important results in this study , including this ; <p> Older patient age was associated with overestimation of QOL by caregivers , whereas neuropsychiatric inventory score and caregiver burden were associated with underestimation . <p> At Bracket , we 've focused on making sure the QOL outcome measures are implemented in a valid and reliable way . Clear and concise training for investigators and raters on how QOL information should be collected is essential . Distinguishing between patient and proxy versions is important , as is effectively outlining how the sponsor company wants caregivers to provide the information . For example , distinguishing for a caregiver between their own estimate of a patient 's health OR their estimate of how the caregiver thinks a patient would answer on their own , if they could . Generally , the way QOL is handled is specified in the protocol " whether subject and/or proxy " - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to administer it . <p> These nuances are important , and are incorporated into Bracket 's customized training programs . Through effective training and remediation efforts , hopefully researchers are better prepared for handling these issues when they arise with their patients in a clinical trial .

Increasingly , pivotal phase 3 trials in Alzheimer 's disease are required to screen , and eventually randomize , exceptionally large numbers of patients . The result has been the requirement for a very large number of centers to be identified , globally , for every new program . An analysis of currently recruiting , industry-sponsored , phase 3 intervention trials listed in ClinicalTrials.gov shows an average of 67 centers open for each trial , and 7 studies with more than 100 centers . <p> Bracket has traditionally focused on providing technology to investigators that will allow them to better collect outcomes data in these trials . And in training and certifying the sites and site personnel who will execute a trial . However , there are things that can be done even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detection in your trial . <p> The selection of investigative sites to participate in clinical trials is often focused on evaluation of historical therapeutic experience , past subject recruitment and regulatory compliance records . However , in these difficult trials , we already know the very subjective Clinical Outcomes Assessments can be difficult to administer , and identifying sites , investigators , raters who have demonstrated competency with these instruments in past studies can be a meaningful strategy . <p> At Bracket , one approach we 've taken is to bolster traditional site feasibility data with additional metrics utilizing historical clinical outcome assessment administration performance data . In research that was presented at the 2015 Clinical Trials on Alzheimer 's Disease Conference ( CTAD ) - conference in Barcelona , sites were able to be stratified using this performance data , giving sponsors an additional criteria to assist in their evaluation . <p> Since potential recruitment numbers , and past recruitment experience , is so important to the feasibility process , it 's important to evaluate recruitment in the context of these performance data as well . <p> The evaluation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of improving study execution . In this study , a methodology was developed to evaluate historical experience and clinical outcome administration performance data as a mechanism to enhance site and rater selection . Historical data shows only a limited correlation between sites with high or low performance quality , and sites with high or low recruitment rates . So combining both factors in your feasibility process is essential . And in some cases , it can still be valuable to invest the time in initiating a site that may have very limited recruitment , if you can have greater confidence that they will enroll good patients , and provide high quality data .

The migration of these complex scales to an electronic clinical outcome assessment ( eCOA ) format aims to improve trial conduct and data quality for Parkinsons disease ( PD ) studies . <p> The increasing prominence of PD , a progressive disorder of the nervous system that affects movement , drove MDS to prioritize the update of its scales .

@@108644018 @4044018/ <h> Findings at the 11th International Conference on Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's Disease <p> On Day 1 of the 11th International Conference on Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's Disease ( AD/PD ) , I delivered an oral presentation in a Symposium on- Cognitive Deficits in Parkinsons Disease . My paper , entitled- The Prevalence of Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinsons Disease Appears Greater with Automated Cognitive Testing , was based on an analysis of research conducted with my co-author , David Burn MD , Newcastle University , UK . We found that in 380 PD patients , speeded cognitive test scores were more sensitive than accuracy scores in identifying MCI in PD ; and that using the latest MDS criteria , up to 82% of PD patients could be identified as PD-MCI with the- CDR System . This contrasts to detection rates of PD-MCI of around 25% in previous large surveys , which had largely relied on traditional pencil and paper scales . This incidence is more realistic considering the rapid conversion to dementia in PD , compared to the much slower conversion of MCI to Alzheimer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of the major cognitive deficits in PD is to attention and information processing capability ; deficits are not well detected by non-automated tasks , which though able to measure response accuracy can not properly assess the speed of the various cognitive processes involved in task performance . The clear recommendation of the Symposium was to include more sophisticated cognitive test procedures in therapeutic trials in PD and related areas . <p> I also had the opportunity to present two posters revealing the first human evidence of impaired neurogenesis in both PD and AD patients using a CDR System object pattern separation task . Both posters confirmed preclinical data ( much of which was presented at the conference ) showing compromised dentate gyrus hippocampal neurogenesis in animal models of PD and AD . The poster in PD , co-authored by David Burn and David Miller of Bracket , showed that a task measure shown previously in man to be sensitive to dentate gyrus ( DG ) activity was selectively impaired in 348 PD patients , and that the impairments could not be accounted for by either disrupted attention/information processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here- . <p> The other poster in a well characterised AD sample confirmed preclinical data by demonstrating that this DG sensitive measure correlated selectively with the CSF levels of A+42 , as well as being selectively impaired in AD patients with double APOE -4 alleles . To view the poster , - click here- . <p> Both posters have important implications for new therapies in PD and AD as many target neurogenesis , and this 4 minute task will not only provide a non-invasive human proof of concept of this mechanism of action , but will also serve as a treatment outcome for such therapies .
