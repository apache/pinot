There are many types of bonds with varying degrees of risk , including the following : <p> Corporate bonds are issued by corporations seeking to raise capital . In general , they offer the highest yield but also have the highest risk . <p> Municipal bonds , also called " munis , " are issued by state or local governments .

The executor has several critical tasks , including overseeing the distribution of your assets , hiring an attorney to handle the legal details , paying the estate taxes , paying any outstanding bills , and closing up your house . This role involves significant responsibilities , so think carefully when choosing a person for this role . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Gift tax <p> The gift tax is designed to make sure that you ca n't avoid estate taxes by simply giving your estate away during your lifetime . There are exceptions , though . As of 2016 , you can give away up to $5.45 million during your lifetime without incurring a gift tax . In addition , you can gift up to $14,000 per year to as many individuals as you like ( or a married couple splitting gifts can give $28,000 per recipient per year ) tax-free .

Any property that was owned by one spouse prior to marriage ( as well as an inheritance ) remains separate property unless it is commingled with other marital assets . In community property states , each spouse is free to leave his or her half of the community property to whomever he or she chooses . There is no requirement to leave it to a surviving spouse . <p> If you are in a committed non-marital relationship , you must have a will or trust if you want to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This means that if you die without a will or trust , your estate will be distributed according to your state 's laws , and your partner may get nothing .

See below for more on powers of attorney . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Pay-on-death and transfer-on-death accounts <p> A pay-on-death bank account does exactly what it says ; upon your death , all of the assets will go to the person you designatewithout going through probate .

It is generally required when assets are registered only in the name of the person who has died , and when the only estate planning document is a will ( or when there are no documents at all ) . During probate , your will is submitted to a court for approval , your assets are collected and distributed , and all bills and taxes are paidall under the supervision of the court . <p> Although probate can help guarantee that your assets will wind up in the right hands , the process can be both time-consuming and costly . In addition , probate documents are public records , which can compromise privacy . Whenever possible , it is generally desirable to minimize ( or , even better , avoid ) this process . In fact , a good portion of estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx542747 <p> Property titling <p> Property titling is another way to pass on your assets ( real estate or other property ) .

The following table lists the advantages and disadvantages of the most common forms of property ownership , and indicates which will avoid probate . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Pour-over will <p> A pour-over will is a particular type of will used in conjunction with a trust . This kind of will " pours " any property the deceased still owned at the time of death ( and that was intentionally or unintentionally left out of the trust ) into the trust that the person set up during his or her life . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Stepped-up basis <p> When you give someone appreciated property during your life , he or she generally assumes your cost basis for income tax purposes . For example , if you give your daughter 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now worth $20/share , the value of the gift is $2,000 . But for her tax purposes , she takes on your cost basis of $1,000 . This means , for example , that if she later sells the stock for $3,000 , she will owe taxes on the $2,000 difference between her cost basis of $1,000 and the sale value of $3,000 . <p> On the other hand , when you give away appreciated property at your death , the recipient will inherit your cost basis along with the property . In the example above , your daughter would pay taxes only on $1,000 , or the difference between $2,000 and the sale value . This is known as a stepped-up basis . <p> This effect is compounded for spouses in community property states . As an example , let 's say that you and your husband purchased a home for $100,000 . At his death , 40 years later , the home is valued at $1 million . Had you sold the home prior to his death , you would have had to pay taxes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your primary residence ) . Upon his death , however , the basis is " stepped up " to its current value of $1 million , avoiding all capital gains . On the other hand , if you live in a non-community-property state , the stepped-up basis is applied only to the deceased 's interest . In this way , married couples in community property states have a distinct advantage over those in common law states . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> State death taxes <p> Depending on the state in which you live , you may be liable for state death taxes in addition to federal estate taxes . State death taxes are inheritance taxes , meaning that they are imposed on the people ( beneficiaries ) who receive property from the deceased . Inheritance tax rates depend not only on the amount being transferred , but also on the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary .

The heirs are liable only if the executor fails to pay the tax . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Trusts <p> Depending on your circumstances , your attorney may recommend that you set up a trust or combination of trusts to distribute your assets outside of probate . <p> Speaking in broad terms , trusts can be set up either under the provisions of your will ( a " testamentary trust " ) or as a separate legal entity while you are alive ( a " living trust " ) . Since a testamentary trust is n't created until after your death , it 's irrevocable , meaning that it ca n't be changed .

Note that in the event of your death , a revocable trust usually becomes irrevocable . <p> A common planning tool to avoid estate taxation of life insurance proceeds is the irrevocable life insurance trust ( ILIT ) . With an ILIT , a trust irrevocably owns the policy , and the proceeds are kept outside the individual 's taxable estate ( as long as the trust purchases the policy or the original owner lives at least three years after transferring an existing policy into the trust ) . <p> Although a trust requires more time and expense to set up than a will , it can have several advantages . A trust not only avoids probate but also provides for your potential incapacity . In addition , depending on how it is structured , it can reduce your estate tax bill . You should always consult with a professional estate planner on all trust matters . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Unlimited charitable deduction <p> This deduction allows you to transfer unlimited assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Unlimited marital deduction <p> According to estate tax law , all spouses who are U.S. citizens can transfer unlimited assets to their spouses , both during their life and at death , free of estate tax . Note that if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen , you can set up what is known as a qualified domestic trust ( QDOT ) , which postpones payment of estate taxes until after your spouse dies . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Wills <p> Everyone needs a will , especially if you have children . In most states , a will is the only way to appoint a legal guardian for your minor children .

However , as with most things , there 's also a minus side because borrowing from your 401(k) " and borrowing often " can also expose you to a few risks . <p> But before we get into those issues , let 's first answer your specific question . While the IRS has regulations regarding penalties and taxation on withdrawals from retirement accounts , whether or not you can borrow from your 401(k) " and how many times " depends on the provisions of your individual plan . So the first thing you need to do is check with your employer or plan administrator to determine what your specific plan allows . <p> Even if your plan let 's you to borrow multiple times , there 's more to it ; following are some general guidelines . <h> How much you can borrow <p> Loans from a 401(k) are limited to one-half the vested value of your account or a maximum of $50,000 " whichever is less .

So let 's say you borrow $40,000 on January 1 , 2016 and repay $25,000 on April 1 . Then on December 1 of the same year , you want to take another loan . Even though you 've repaid part of your first loan , you would still be limited to a maximum second loan of $10,000 because your highest balance within the previous 12 months was $40,000 . If you waited until April 2 of 2017 , you 'd be able to borrow $35,000 because your $25,000 payment would have been factored in and your highest balance in the prior 12-month period would then be $15,000 . <p> As you can see , it 's not just a question of how often you can borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're carrying multiple loans . <h> When you have to pay it back <p> The term of a 401(k) loan is five years unless you 're borrowing to buy a home .

Even though you 're paying yourself back , if you do n't follow the repayment schedule ( or if the term or amount of the loan is n't within the allowed parameters ) the loan could be considered a " distribution " and be subject to federal income tax and a 10% early withdrawal penalty if you 're under 59-+ ( state income taxes and penalties may also apply ) . <h> What happens if you lose your job <p> The next consideration is job stability . If you borrow against your 401(k) and then lose your job , in many cases you have to pay back the loan at termination or within 60 days . ( Again , the exact timing depends on the provisions of your plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loan in the first place , how will you have the money to pay it back on short notice ? And if you fail to pay it back within the specified time period , the outstanding balance will likely be considered a distribution , again subject to income taxes and penalties . So while you may feel secure in your job right now , you 're wise to at least factor this possibility into your decision to borrow . <h> The impact on your retirement savings <p> Also , do n't forget that while a 401(k) loan may give you access to ready cash , it 's actually diminishing your retirement nest egg . First of all , you 're losing the tax-deferred growth of your savings . But on top of that , some plans wo n't allow you to contribute more to your 401(k) until you pay back the loan . In that case , not only are you prevented from saving more , you could also miss out on your employer match . <p> As you can see , while there are n't strict rules about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 401(k) , doing so can have other far-reaching consequences . If you have no other options , it can be a convenient solution . But my advice is to protect your retirement assets and consider all other available choices before signing on the line . In fact , maybe you should be focusing on building your emergency fund so the next time you 're in need of cash , you 'll have it . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

Stocks and bonds might seem pretty basic but there 's more to understanding the different types and why one might be a better choice than another . So this week , I want to give you some insight into what to look for when choosing investments . <p> Starting with stocks- Topline , a share of stock is a share of ownership in a company as well as a share of possible profit . Owning stock is a great way to participate in a company 's growth potential .

But there are also smallcap and mid-cap stocksplus foreign stocks , representing companies based outside the U.S. <p> Getting more granular , there are two styles of stock : growth and value . A growth stock is considered poised for a rapid rise ( think high tech ) ; a value stock is considered underpriced .

These investments generally pay a specific interest rate over a certain time period and promise to return your principal at maturity . A bond is right up there at the top of the fixed income list . A bond is like an IOU .

Actively managed funds , on the other hand , strive to beat the market . An important consideration is cost : index funds generally have low fees ; actively managed funds can cost a pretty penny .

What do you think ? <p> - 132741 @qwx542741 <p> - <p> Portfolio rebalancing is a core concept for every serious investor , so thanks for asking this question . In a rising market , it 's human nature to want to ride it up to see how far it will go , but this is exactly the time when we should be looking at our overall investments and making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Traditionally , investors have been encouraged to rebalance their portfolios annually . However , what you 've probably been reading about is the idea of rebalancing using what 's called " tolerance bands . " It 's an alternate approach that involves rebalancing according to allocation parameters rather than a timetable . <p> - <p> But before we get into how and when to rebalance , I 'd like to go over the basics of rebalancing for the benefit of all of our readers . <p> - <h> Why rebalancing is important <p> Rebalancing means adjusting your portfolio periodically to keep it in line with your chosen asset allocation and risk level " in other words , maintaining the relative percentages of stocks , bonds , cash and other investments that you originally selected . Often market movements , whether up or down , can push you out of these percentages . As an example , let 's say you 're a moderate investor with 60 percent in stocks , 35 percent in bonds and 5 percent in cash investments . The stock market has been on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exposing you to a much higher level of risk . <p> - <p> While your first inclination in a rising stock market may be to hang on in the hopes that things will continue to go up , that 's probably not the wisest move . Smart rebalancing would suggest that you sell some of your high performing stocks and buy more bonds , bringing your portfolio back to your original percentages . <p> - <p> In this situation you have a couple of choices . First , you can sell asset classes that have performed well and use that money to buy asset classes that have done poorly . It 's counterintuitive , but think of it this way : you 're not only taking profits , you 're actually buying low and selling high " an investing ideal . Alternatively , if you 're adding money to your portfolio , you can direct those funds to the categories that have recently underperformed " ratcheting up their percentages . <p> - <h> The benefits of rebalancing annually <p> Rebalancing annually gives you a structure and provides a discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might lead you to sell low and buy high . On the flipside , it can help protect you from what 's probably equally common " doing nothing . <p> - <p> The recommendation to rebalance at least annually gives you a timetable and a plan to help assure that you wo n't let emotions " or inertia " overly affect your investment decisions . Your annual rebalance is also a good time to revisit your goals and attitude toward risk and make changes based on those as well as market movements . <p> - <p> As an added benefit , rebalancing according to a timetable helps you better control trade commissions by limiting your sales . It 's also a good opportunity to consider tax consequences " matching gains and losses in taxable accounts and using tax-advantaged accounts to rebalance to the extent you can . Importantly , if you 're in retirement and using your portfolio to generate cash , you can take needed cash for the next year from over-weighted assets first . Conversely , if you 're still saving for retirement , you can always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> The plus side of rebalancing using tolerance bands <p> Rather than setting a timetable , rebalancing using tolerance bands focuses on a preset percentage of change in your asset allocation whether to the plus or the minus . It also looks at the change in individual holdings in your portfolio . - <p> - <p> Let 's say your stock allocation is set at 60 percent and you set a tolerance band of 10 percent . If the stock portion of your portfolio reached 70 percent , you 'd make a sale . But instead of just trimming back your stocks by 10 percent across the board , you 'd zero in on the particular category of stocks ( for example , small cap domestic or emerging markets ) that had outperformed , and sell only those . Likewise , if a particular category dipped to 50 percent , it would trigger a buy . <p> - <p> With this approach , you 'd wait to rebalance until the tolerance band was breached , whether that 's three months or three years . By doing so , you more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're able to confidently sit tight when it 's not . Current research suggests that this rebalancing method has better results in terms of overall returns . The downside is that you have to pay much closer attention to your portfolio , and to the movement of the individual investments in each asset class . <p> - <h> Getting help when you need it <p> The method you choose will depend on how closely you want to monitor your portfolio . Here 's where an advisor can be extremely helpful . Many advisors have access to software that can track investments within tolerance bands and notifies you when your portfolio deviates from your risk tolerance . <p> - <p> But either way " whether you rebalance annually or using tolerance bands " do n't ignore it .

Now that the market has had a pretty good run , I 'm getting questions from stock investors who are nervous about the future . Should they stay in or get out while they 're ahead ? While there 's no one answer that works for everyone , there is one key element that everyone needs to consider : time . Because , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeline should be your guiding force . <p> General guidelines everyone should followall the time First let 's talk about some general guidelines that apply to all investors , from the young investor just starting out to the seasoned saver living in retirement . Some of them you 've probably heard before , but I think they 're worth reinforcing . <p> Honestly evaluate your feelings about riskWhen times are good , it 's natural to want to jump right in with both feet . When times are bad , there 's a tendency to be more conservative . But no matter what the market is doing , you need to look inside firstat your own timeline and your personal feelings about risk . Do n't forget how you felt in 2008 ; your reaction then will most certainly be tested in the future . <p> Be thoughtful about your asset allocationBuilding an investment portfolio is a bit like building a house ; your blueprint is your asset allocation , or the way you divvy up your money between various asset classes , such as stocks , bonds , cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tool for controlling your level of risk as well as your potential for gain . <p> Stay diversifiedIn plain English this means not putting all of your eggs in one basket or , in other words , spreading your risk among many investments . If one ship sinks , you wo n't lose the entire fleet . <p> Pay attention to your goalsAs you determine and later review your asset allocation , keep your goals front and center . If stability is more important to you than growth , or if you 're investing for short- to medium-term goals , it might be appropriate to gradually move out of the stock market . But your own circumstancesnot market movementsshould determine this . <p> Invest for the long-termA long-term perspective will help keep you on track even during market downturns . Trying to time the market is never a good idea and can actually result in even greater losses . It 's equally important to have realistic expectations for long-term returns . We probably wo n't see the double-digit returns of the recent past , but that does n't mean you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , a long-term approach does n't mean invest and forget . Checking your portfolio at least quarterly and rebalancing yearly will help you make considered , timely decisions . <p> Measure your portfolio against the right benchmarksTracking your portfolio against the right benchmarks will help you evaluate your performance in terms of the overall market . Take a look at benchmarks like the S&amp;P 500 stock index or the Ibbotson Intermediate U.S. Government Bond Index . How does your performance compare ? Be sure to use appropriate benchmarks that reflect your own investments to get an accurate reading . <p> Get help when you need itIf you have a financial advisor , check in periodically . Many brokerage firms offer complimentary consultations where you can discuss your asset allocation and get recommendations on possible changes . Even if you 're a do-it-yourselfer , a little professional help can go a long way in making you feel more confident . <p> Specific scenariosdepending on your time in life Now let 's get more personal . Your age and the time you have to keep your money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest . Here are just three scenarios that demonstrate how this may play out : <p> Twenty-something : Time is your greatest assetAs a young investor , your age is a huge advantage . Even though stocks can be volatile short-term , long-term they remain a key to portfolio growth . With a long timeline , you 're in a good position to ride out market highs and lows . And although you have to consider how much risk you 're personally willing to take , in general , in your twenties you could aim for as much as 80 , 90 or even 100 percent in stocks . <p> Mid-fifties : There 's still time for growthAt this time in life , with retirement several years out , the potential for growth is still paramount . Someone who got out of the market in late 2008 would have lost a tremendous upside opportunity . So again , with your own risk tolerance in mind , you 'd be well positioned to consider having about 60 percent ( or more ) in stocks . Also , consider the alternatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't offer the same growth potential . Cash may feel safe short-term , but long-term it 's far from it . Right now , returns on money markets and Treasuries are negative after inflation . That said , you should always keep enough cash to cover at least three to six months of expenses in interest-bearing FDIC-insured accounts so you 're not forced to sell at the wrong time . <p> Seventy and retired : Be realistic about your time frameThis is the time to make protecting your savings a higher priority . Your first concern would be having enough cash on hand to cover your expenses for at least a year , ideally three to five years . That does n't mean you should sell everything right away , but it does mean making a gradual shift to investments like bonds and FDIC-insured CDs , still maintaining some equities ( perhaps 20 to 40 percent or so ) for growth . <p> Market risk goes hand in hand with investing ; adhering to the time-tested principles of asset allocation and diversification is the key to mitigating that risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure your portfolio is appropriately allocated and diversified to meet your circumstances and goals .

@@49276405 @2776405/ <p> I inherited a traditional IRA from my father . Should I convert it to a Roth IRA ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> As I 'm sure you know , an inheritance can bring up conflicting emotions , placing the positive of financial gain against the sadness of losing a loved one . Complicating the situation further , certain inheritancessuch as an IRAare more difficult to sort out than others . <p> The first thing to understand is that IRA inheritance rules differ depending on whether the beneficiary is a spouse or non-spouse . A spouse has almost limitless options , including treating an inherited IRA as his or her own , even to the extent of converting it to a Roth . <p> A non-spouse beneficiary such as you , however , has much more limited choices . As a non-spouse you can either take the IRA money in a lump sum or as mandatory withdrawals over time . Unfortunately , though , a non-spouse beneficiary can not roll over any amounts into or out of an inherited IRA , so the short answer is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your father into a Roth . <p> However , you can make choices as to how you take the withdrawals , which will have some bearing on your tax situation. - Let 's review your choices . - If you take the assets as a lump sumAs I mentioned , a non-spouse can take the assets all at once. - The upside is that you have access to all the money right away , and there 's no 10 percent penalty for early withdrawals . The downside is that you 'll have to pay income tax on the distribution at your ordinary income tax rate , which could be quite a sum depending on the amount of the inheritance . <p> Another concern is that the distribution itself could bump you into a higher tax bracket , increasing the amount of taxes you have to pay . So a lump sum may not be the most tax-efficient way to access the assets . <p> If you take withdrawals over timeTaking mandatory withdrawals over time can ease your tax burden , but the process is a bit more complicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inherited IRA in the name of the original account holder for your benefit . Just like the original account holderin this case , your fatheryou wo n't be taxed on the assets until you take a distribution , so your tax hit is spread out . Again , there 's no 10 percent penalty . <p> And you have potentially one more choice to make depending on whether your father was under or over 70+ when he passed away. - The rules are a bit complex , but here , in a nutshell , are your options : <p> If the original account holder was under 70+ , there are two methods for taking distributions : <p> The Life Expectancy method , in which you must take an annual required minimum distribution ( RMD ) spread over your own single-life expectancy , based on IRS life-expectancy tables and determined by your age in the calendar year following the year of your father 's death . Distributions must begin no later than December 31 of the year after the year of death , and will be reevaluated each year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RMD if you wish . <p> The Five-Year method , which allows you to take distributions of any amount at any time up until December 31 of the fifth year after the year the account holder died , at which time all assets must be fully distributed . <p> If the original account holder was over 70+ , you must use method number one , the Life Expectancy method . The five-year option does n't apply . And one more thing : with the Life Expectancy method , if the original account holder did n't take an RMD in the year of death , an RMD must be taken from the account by December 31 of the year the original account holder died . <p> If there 's more than one beneficiary If there are several beneficiaries and you 've chosen the Life Expectancy Method , it 's important to open separate IRAs for each beneficiary ; otherwise , distributions will be based on the life expectancy of the oldest beneficiary . <p> Looking at the positiveAs you can see , there 's a lot to think about . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could also consult IRS Publication 590 , which goes into greater detail on all aspects of IRAs . <p> While the rules are complex , taking mandatory withdrawals does have its benefits . For one , the undistributed assets keep growing tax-freewhich can be a significant boost over time . You can manage the assets according to your own goals and time horizon . And you can name your own IRA beneficiary , potentially one day passing your father 's generosity on to your own heirs . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

Of course , you then have to stick with using the cash . Okay , there may be times when cash just does n't work , but the point is that using cash makes you more aware , more mindful , of what you spend . Ideally , during this first week , you 'll also keep a record of what you 've spent " and figure out where you could cut back . <h> Getting going on Week 2 <p> Week 2 takes this spending awareness a step further to track and categorize ALL your monthly spending . Think about it . When was the last time you looked carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Internet service , and the dozens of other expenses that chip away at your bottom line each month ? If you 're like most people , a lot of your essential spending is probably done kind of automatically . Now 's the time to pay attention . <p> You can do it in three easy steps : <p> Begin to track your essentials as well as out-of-pocket expenses . <p> If you have a stack of bills , go through them . If you have most of your bills on auto-pay , check recent bank statements . From mortgage or rent to utilities and insurance premiums , add up all your essential living expenses . <p> Make a budget , by category , separating out your essentials from your nice-to-haves . <p> Start with the essentials .

An online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't forget to prorate expenses that only come up once or twice a year , such as property taxes or insurance premiums . <p> Next list the nice-to-haves " the extra specials like concert tickets or a weekend getaway " plus the weekly out-of-pocket expenses you 're already keeping track of . This should give you a dollar figure for your complete month . <p> Compare your total monthly spending to your monthly income . <p> Here 's where the rubber meets the road . Subtract your monthly expenses from your take-home pay . Are you in the black or the red ? <h> Where to go from here <p> With these monthly numbers in front of you , you can begin to make more mindful decisions . If you have the good fortune to be in the black , perhaps you can direct more money toward savings " or even treat yourself to something special now and then . If , on the other hand , you 're falling short , you 'll want to take another look at your budget . Where are you spending too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago is n't worth it anymore . Or you might look to renegotiate your cable and Internet costs . And what about those credit card bills ? If you regularly carry a balance , it might be time to see if you can lower your interest rate . Sometimes all you have to do is ask ! <p> But remember too that it 's not so much about doing without , but rather about spending mindfully . Much better to consciously cut back than to unconsciously put extras on a credit card . <h> Staying motivated <p> I hope by now I 've got your attention , and that you 're intrigued by the idea of mindful spending .

My father lost money on the whole , investing more than we 've gained . What are the rules for custodial account taxes ? Am I able to deduct the loss on my return ? <p> A Reader- 132741 @qwx542741 <p> A custodial account can be a valuable gift for any child . And while it 's managed by an adult until the beneficiary reaches the age of majority ( usually 18 , or 21 , depending on the state ) , the money always belongs to the beneficiary , not the custodianso the gains or losses are yours , for better or worse . <p> As you 've now experienced , a custodial account offers no special protection against losses . However , there can be a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is " yes , " when you realize a loss as you did by " cashing out , " you can deduct it when you calculate your taxes . <p> Your decision to cash out raises a question of my own that I 'll address later , but first let 's talk about how you might turn those losses into a tax benefit . <p> Capital losses can offset capital gainsWhen you sell a security for less than the purchase price , you have what 's called a capital loss . While no one likes to sell at a loss , there are certain potential tax advantages that can lessen the blow . <p> First , a capital loss can be used to offset a capital gain , as long as the sale took place in a taxable account . A custodial account fits that definition . So you need to look at the overall picture of your gains and losses when you cashed out your account . <p> For the sake of example , let 's say that you sold $5,000 of stock ABC and realized a gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes on that sale . However , let 's say that you also sold $5,000 of stock XYZ at a loss of $2,000 . That loss on XYX would offset the gain on ABC , and you would n't owe any capital gains taxes . <p> Now if you sold other stocks and realized additional losses that went beyond any gains , you could end up with a surplus loss . That takes us to the next point . <p> Capital losses can be used to reduce taxable incomeWhen your capital losses exceed your capital gains in any year , up to $3,000 can be used to reduce your taxable income . So if by cashing out your account , you realized $3,000 in losses beyond any gains , you can deduct those losses from your other income to potentially reduce your tax bill . <p> But what if you had more than $3,000 in net losses ?

An accountant can help you with the paperwork necessary to properly file any capital losses . But , to me , the bigger question for you is what you 're going to do with the money now that you 've cashed out . If you have a specific use for it , that 's great . But if it 's just sitting in an account earning very little , I 'd give some thought to your next steps . <p> You may have been disappointed by your father 's results , but that does n't mean you should ignore the potential that long-term investing offers . When you 're young , you have a lot of time ahead of you to make your money growand investing is one of the best ways I know to do that . <p> At the very least , if your employer offers a 401(k) or similar retirement savings plan , definitely contribute enough to get the company match ( and more if possible ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through work , I 'd advise you to open an IRA and make the maximum contribution each year ( as long as you have earned income ) . <p> Then , rather than being discouraged by the loss in your custodial account , use it as a lesson .

Yes , investing always involves a certain amount of riskbut the upside potential over time can be significant . Give it some thought . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

We were married about 16 years , we divorced and I remarried . I am now divorced from my second spouse . Am I now able to receive survivor benefits from my first ( deceased ) ex-spouse ? - - A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Social Security benefits can be confusing enough , and when you get into the rules and regulations concerning ex-spouses they 're potentially even more so . But the good news is that as an ex-spouse you definitely can file for survivor benefitsas long as you meet certain qualifications based on age , length of marriage and current marital status . And benefits paid to an ex-spouse do n't in any way affect benefits paid to a widow or widower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security , there 's more to consider . So let 's start by going over the basics ; then we can explore some scenarios that may help you maximize your benefits . <p> Be at least 60 years old ( 50 if disabled ; no age rule if caring for an ex 's child under age 16 ) <p> Have been married to the deceased ex-spouse for a minimum of 10 years <p> Not have remarried before age 60 " or if he or she did remarry before age 60 , that marriage must have ended <p> If you meet all three qualifications , you 're entitled to the same survivors ' benefits as a widow or widowerup to 100 percent of the deceased spouse 's monthly Social Security benefit . That 's the straightforward part . The more confusing considerations come into play as you look at how your age and current work status may affect those benefits . <p> That 's because , just as with regular Social Security retirement benefits , survivors ' benefits are reduced if you begin collecting before your full retirement age ( FRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you 'll receive just over 71% of the full amount . And if you make over a certain yearly income$15,720 in 2015some of your survivor benefits will be temporarily withheld . <p> Three possible scenarios The simplest situation is if you 're already collecting Social Security . In that case , you have a clear choice : if your own benefit is higher than the survivor benefit , stick with your own ; if the survivor benefit is higher , make the switch and increase your monthly income . The key point is that you have to choose . You ca n't collect both . <p> However , if you have n't yet filed for benefits on your own work record , you have the opportunity to do some strategizing to potentially maximize overall benefits . Here are a couple of other scenarios to consider : <p> If your own retirement benefit is estimated to be higher than the survivor benefit , you could choose to collect the lower survivor benefit starting as early as age 60 , and let your own benefit grow . You can then switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 . The longer you wait , the larger your own benefit will be . <p> On the other hand , if your own benefit is lower , you have the option to start taking reduced benefits based on your own work record as early as age 62 , then at FRA you could switch to the higher survivor benefit . While taking your own benefits early results in a permanent reduction of any benefits based on your own record , that reduction does n't apply to the survivor benefit once you make the switch . <p> The opportunity to switch between spouses There 's yet another possibility should both ( or any number of ) spouses pass away . Let me give you an example . A friend 's father and mother , I 'll call them Frank and Marie , divorced after many years . Marie remarried and her second husband passed away after a couple of years . At her FRA , Marie began collecting survivor benefits from her second husband . Ten years later , Frank died . The survivor benefit from Frank was much higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . - What 's best for you As you can see , once you get beyond the basics , there 's more to think about . Since it appears that you qualify for survivor benefits , I 'd recommend that you talk to a financial advisor familiar with Social Security who can help you take a look at these scenarios in light of your overall financial situation . At the very least , speak with someone at the Social Security Administration by calling 800-772-1213 or contact your local SSA office . If you need the added income now , by all means take it , but carefully weighing your options before you file could ultimately mean more money in your pocket. - <p> This article is part of the Ask Carrie : Social Security series .

@@49276420 @2776420/ <p> It seems pretty clear that after many years of below-normal levels , interest rates are about to start climbing. - What does this mean for my investments and for my finances in general ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Predicting when the Federal Reserve will begin raising interest rates seems to be a top focus of economic forecasters these days . And for good reason . The Federal funds ratethe interest rate that banks charge each other to borrow Federal funds overnight " has been effectively at zero percent since 2008 , so any rate increase is big news . <p> But why should the average consumer care what interest rate banks charge each other ? Because that same interest rate is used to determine a variety of other short-term rates that touch us all in our daily finances such as interest on bank deposits , loans , credit cards and adjustable rate mortgages . And it will ultimately have an effect on both the bond and stock markets . <p> Overall , the fact that the Fed is considering raising rates is a good thing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a different impact on different people . In general , an increase in rates is good for savers and bad for borrowers . For investors , it 's more of a mixed bag depending on the types of investments you hold . <p> The current prediction is that the Fed will begin to raise rates this fall or winter . However , it 's also predicted that any rate increase will be slow and gradual rather than dramatic . There 's no need for consumers and individual investors to panic , but it 's a good idea to know what to expect and what changes you may want to make in your own financial strategy . - Impact on bond investors When interest rates rise , bond values decrease . However , the impact will vary depending on your circumstances. - Here are three possible scenarios courtesy of my colleague at Schwab , Kathy Jones : <p> If you 've been on the sidelines waiting for interest rates to rise , around the time the Fed begins to raise interest rates you might consider investing in intermediate-term bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income in your portfolio . You might also consider building a bond ladder by buying individual bonds or bond funds with different maturities . Bond ladders work because they give you the flexibility to make changes as interest rates change . <p> If you 're currently invested in long-term bonds , this could be a good time to add some short-term bonds or cash to add balance and reduce volatility . <p> If you 're already invested in intermediate-term bonds or already have a bond ladder , you may not need to make changes . But again , you could consider adding some short-term bonds or cash to reduce potential volatility as rates change . <p> Impact on stock investors Generally speaking , interest rate hikes depress stock prices . That usually also means more market ups and downs . The good news is that , because of all the speculation on when and by how much rates will rise , it 's likely already somewhat built into stock prices . So a rate increase may not have that big of an impact . <p> As always , keeping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are looking to invest , focus on companies that have a strong balance sheet , meaning they have good reserves and less need to borrow . Also , an uptick in interest rates will likely mean different things for different sectors .

If you 're a saver , you can look forward to eventual better returns on your money in savings accounts . Short-term CD rates should also begin to go up .

Mortgage rates will rise , which is significant if you 're applying for a new home loan or have a variable-rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider that a one percent interest rate increase can increase the cost of a $100,000 mortgage by over $700 a year .

And , as borrowing costs go up , people tend to buy less , which affects businesses in general . - Keeping a balanced perspective No doubt there 's a lot to be aware of , but it 's also important not to over react .

Makes sense ! I have a home equity line of credit , which I have often used to get quick cash for unexpected bills . Should I continue after retirement to rely on this ' cash reserve ' arrangement , rather than setting aside money in a bank account that has very little growth potential ? - - A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> For retirees , the well-known phrase , ' cash is king , ' takes on a special meaning . Without a regular paycheck , creating your own cash flow is up to you . And how well you handle that cash can mean the difference between a financially comfortable or stressful retirement . So I join the chorus of financial advisors who recommend that a retired person have cash on handbut not only for emergencies . Smart retirement planning requires that you create a few different buckets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELOC ) can certainly be an extra resource to cover unexpected expenses , but that 's as far as it goes . It 's not a cash reserve when it comes to creating your own retirement paycheck and managing your cash flow . There are a couple of good reasons why . <p> First , when you draw on a HELOC , it has to be paid backwith interest . So , while it can help with an emergency in the short-term , using a HELOC could become a long-term expense that actually adds to your monthly cash needs . Second , a HELOC typically has a life of 10 years , after which it becomes a regular home equity loan with amortized payments unless you renew it . Renewing means you have to qualify all over again , which is n't as easy to do once you 're retired and do n't have a regular paycheck . <p> However , I understand your reluctance to just park your cash somewhere , especially in a low-interest rate environment . The key is to keep a balance of easy accessibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time generating enough income to keep filling your cash buckets . Here are some ideas on how to do that . <p> Keep a 12-month cash cushion for current spending Your first cash bucket should hold enough to supplement a year 's worth of expenses . By this I mean , once you add up all your reliable sources of income such as Social Security , pensions or real estatemoney that comes from sources other than your portfoliodecide how much more you need to cover your annual costs . <p> So if you generally spend $50,000 a year and receive $30,000 of non-portfolio income , you 'd want to have $20,000 set aside someplace safe and relatively liquid . This might include money market funds , short-term CDs , or a simple interest-bearing checking account . Granted , you wo n't be earning much on that $20,000 but that 's not the point . The purpose of this cash is to allow you to pay the bills without stressing or having to sell investments at the wrong time . <p> Try to set aside an additional two-to-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot , but think of it this way . When you 're retired , it may be wise to start moving toward a more conservative asset allocation . <p> You might consider longer-term CDs , or high quality short-term bonds or bond funds . And you 'd want to construct a ladder with these investments , staggering maturity dates .

What are the parameters and pitfalls ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Your question combines two of the issues I 'm asked about most often : paying for college and planning for retirement . These are pressing needs for most Americans , and often competing ones. - <p> I have a " bad news/good news " answer for you . The bad news is that you can not borrow from your IRA for any reason . The good news is that you can not borrow from your IRA for any reasonand it 's good because it helps you preserve what is probably the cornerstone of your own retirement plan . <p> IRA " Hardship " DistributionMany company-sponsored 401(k) plans do permit plan participants to borrow from their accountsto borrow from themselves , in other words . IRAs do n't offer that feature . But like a 401(k) , you can make what the Internal Revenue Service calls a " hardship distribution " from your IRA . <p> Here 's how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA or 401(k) before you turn 59 -+ , you 'll have to pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty in addition to income tax . But in some instances , your withdrawal can be considered a hardship distribution , and the IRS will waive the 10% penalty . For example , if you want to take money out of your IRA to cover medical expenses above a certain percentage of your income , or for a down payment on a first-time home purchase ( up to $10,000 ) , or to pay for higher education expenses , the IRS allows you to do so penalty-free . ( Note that higher education expenses do not qualify as hardship withdrawals from a 401(k) . But even without the penalty , taking money out of your IRA can be an expensive proposition . You 're still on the hook for income taxes , and you 're giving up some of your opportunity to build wealth for your retirement . <p> Expensive Money Let 's say you are 50 years old , in the 28% tax bracket , and you need $10,000 for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount from your IRA , you 'll pay $2,800 for federal income taxes and possibly state income taxes on top of that . But that does n't reflect the true cost of your withdrawal . You have to factor in the opportunity coststhe potential investment income your distribution might have generated . For example , let 's assume that your $10,000 withdrawal could have earned a conservative 6% for the next 15 years until you retire at age 65 . You 'd be giving up around $14,000 in potential investment income . Put another away , your $10,000 withdrawal would generate only $7,200 cash in hand ; if left alone in your IRA , it could reasonably become nearly $24,000 in 15 years . That 's quite a difference ! <p> Better Alternatives Your daughter can apply for financial aid , which many schools are well-prepared to give . Aid might include scholarships or loans , or a combination of both . No one likes to start out in life with a mountain of debt , but I believe student loans are an investment in the future . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of her adult life . Of course you could also consider borrowing from a home equity line , if you have a reasonable amount of equity in your home , but only if you are confident that you can repay the loan without undue hardship . <p> Finally , there are ways to make higher education more affordable . Some people go to inexpensive junior colleges for a year or two before transferring to a bigger name ( and probably more expensive ) school to earn their degree . Some go part-time while working to help defray expenses . <p> It 's certainly commendable that you 're eager to help your daughter pay for collegebut I think it 's pretty clear that you should think of your IRA as a last resort . As a general rule , it 's more important for most people to fund their retirements than it is to fund their children 's higher education .

@@49276437 @2776437/ <p> Several of my friends and I ( all in our early 60s ) are understandably thinking about Social Security . Everyone seems to have different ideasand different informationabout when to apply for benefits , how to apply , and how much we can expect to get . Can you give us a straightforward answer on what we should know ? - <p> A Reader <p> Dear Reader , - <p> Since Social Security plays such a big part in people 's lives , you 'd think we 'd have a better idea about how it all works . But on the contrary , a lot of folks do n't fully understand their benefits or , more importantly , how to maximize them . <p> It 's essential to take some time to consider your options before you apply or you may miss out on thousands of dollars over your lifetime . There 's a lot of helpful and detailed information at socialsecurity.gov , but for starters , here are five important things you and your friends should focus on : <p> 1 . Understand how timing affects benefitsWith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many people think they should apply for benefits as soon as possible . But there 's more to it . <p> In a nutshell , if you file at the earliest possible age ( 62 ) , your benefit is permanently reduced . If you wait until your full retirement age ( FRA ) , which would be 66 for you and your friends , you collect 33 percent more . Wait until 70 and your benefit goes up by a total of 76 percent ! <p> There 's a point where total benefits balance out ( a larger check for a shorter time ) , but generally speaking , if you 're healthy and longevity runs in your family , you 'll increase your total lifetime benefits by postponing your start date . <p> 2 . Factor in reductionsand taxesif you continue to work In terms of timing , you also have to consider your work plans . If you take benefits before your FRA and your income exceeds certain limits , part of your benefit is temporarily withheld . In 2014 , $1 dollar in benefits is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year you reach your FRA , $1 is deducted for every $3 you earn above $41,400 . However you do get this money back as an increased monthly benefit once you reach your FRA . <p> Taxes are another thing . Regardless of when you take benefits , 50-85 percent of your Social Security income may be taxable if your modified adjusted gross income reaches certain levels . For 2014 , that 's between $25,000 and $34,000 for individuals ; $32,000 and $44,000 for married filing jointly . Your benefit might also bump you into a higher tax bracket . Best to discuss this with your tax advisor . <p> 3 . Strategize with your spouseWorking as a team , married couples have some choices that can significantly boost their combined benefit . That 's because of the spousal benefit which allows one spouse to take up to 50 percent of the other 's benefit ( as long as that spouse has already filed ) while letting their own continue to grow . <p> There are a number of ways to do this . For instance , in a strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouse takes Social Security as early as age 62 while the higher earner delays until 70 . In the meantime , the higher earner can take the spousal benefit as a bonus . <p> Another option is for the higher earning spouse to apply for benefits at FRA , then suspend them . The lower earning spouse could then collect a spousal benefit based on the higher earner 's record , while the higher earner 's benefit continues to grow . This can get complicated so , again , best to consult with a financial professional . But it 's definitely worth exploring ! <p> 4 . Find out how much you 'll collectEveryone age 60-plus who has n't yet applied for benefits is mailed a yearly Social Security statement . This provides an estimate of retirement and disability benefits , as well as survivor benefits . Or you can create a personal account at socialsecurity.gov to access your statement . The site also has a number of calculators where you can explore how different start dates or continuing to earn would affect your benefit . <p> For 2014 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,642 . The estimated average monthly benefit is $1,294 . And FYI , you can apply for benefits online when you 're readyup to four months before your start date . <p> 5 . Be aware of survivor benefits , benefits for ex-spouses and disability benefitsWhile exploring timing and benefit amounts , it 's also important to be aware that : <p> At FRA , a widow or widower can collect up to 100 percent of a spouse 's benefit ( or reduced benefits at age 60 ) . If you collect early and receive reduced benefits , that reduction also applies to your surviving spouse. - <p> Under certain circumstances you can collect benefits based on an ex-spouse 's record without affecting what your ex or your ex 's current spouse can collect . <p> If you 're disabled and under full retirement age , you and your family members may qualify for disability benefits . <p> These basics are the same for everyone , but the individual decisions you and your friends make may well be very different . You 'll each have to thoughtfully consider your choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information should give you a lot more to talk about ! <p> Looking for answers to your retirement questions ?

@@49276442 @2776442/ <p> Asset allocation and diversification are two of the most important keys to your success as an investor . <p> If you 're just getting started , think about dollar-cost averaging , or easing in over time . <p> Dear Readers , - <p> If you 're new to the world of investing , welcome . In this first column of a three-part series , I want to help you crack the codestarting with the most important foundational concepts . And then in the next two columns I 'll define and describe the investments , accounts , and steps that will allow you to put these concepts to use over time . <p> Investing is n't something that comes naturally . It 's not like riding a bike . The reality is that the language of investing is often obscure and the rules and regulations can be complicated . <p> That said , investing is the best way that I know to build your financial future . So if you 've been afraid to ask questions and get started , I encourage you to read on . The challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few words about risk Like everything in life , investing carries risk . There 's no way around it . The only way that you have a chance to make a gain is to take the chance that you might have a loss . Sometimes more risk means the potential for more gainbut not always . As an investor , your most important job is to understand the difference : when the risk you 're taking is giving you the opportunity for greater returnand when it is n't . In other words , you only want to take on smart riskrisk that 's appropriate for your situation and that carries potential for reward . <p> Building a portfolio : Two cornerstone concepts Building an investment portfolio is a bit like building a house ; you need to start with a blueprint . In investing , this blueprint is your asset allocation , or the way you divvy up your money between various asset classes , such as stocks , bonds , cash , and other investments . <p> Your asset allocation will help determine both your level of risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset allocation would be comprised largely of stocks , carrying significant volatility as well as the potential for significant growth . An aggressive portfolio would be appropriate for someone who is young and saving for retirement because he or she has the time to ride out the downs . <p> At the other end of the spectrum , a conservative allocation means investments such as U.S. Treasury bonds , Certificates of Deposit ( CDs ) , or other fixed income , and is most appropriate for an older person or someone who wants to avoid risk . This type of portfolio probably wo n't lose value , but it wo n't gain much , either . A moderate portfolio falls somewhere in between . <p> As an investor , selecting and adhering to your chosen asset allocation is job number one . Before you even think about buying an investment , you have to think about what you need in terms of growth potential and risk control . Before you decide to buy , ask yourself , " Will stock XYZ or fund ABC fit into my asset allocation ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> The second most important concept in investing is diversification . In plain English this means not putting all of your eggs in one basket or , in other words , spreading your risk among many investments . If one ship sinks , you wo n't lose the entire fleet . <p> In practice this means that you need to own several stocks or several bonds , each with different characteristics . Even if you 're convinced that you want an aggressive portfolio , you need to own a minimum of 10-15 stocks , and preferably more . Diversification is n't a magic bullet ; it ca n't guarantee a profit or eliminate the risk of loss . However , if you do n't diversify , you 're setting yourself up for a huge hit if your chosen investment falters . ( If any one investment equals roughly 20 percent or more of your portfolio 's value , that 's known as a concentrated position ; a definite no-no ! ) As I 'll discuss in the next column , purchasing one or several mutual funds or exchange-traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the foundation for your portfolio . <p> Do n't try to time the market There 's a saying , " time in the market is more important than timing the market . " Before you invest a penny , repeat those words . Even the most experienced investors ca n't accurately predict how much and when the market will move in a particular direction . Many of the best performing days immediately follow market dips . <p> So what 's an investor to do ? Get in and stay in . You need to carefully select and monitor your holdings , making adjustments as neededbut to be successful , you have to stay in for the long term . Otherwise you greatly increase your chances of getting in ( or out ) at precisely the wrong time . <p> Dollar-cost averaging : A prudent strategy Sometimes getting started can be the hardest part of investing . The good news is that you do n't have to jump in with both feet . A strategy known as dollar-cost averaging can help you ease in over time . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular interval ) you invest a set amount of money , regardless of how the stock market is performing . When the market is down and prices are low , you can buy more shares for your money . When the market and prices are up , you 'll buy fewer shares . <p> As an example , let 's say you decide to invest $400 a month for a year . In the first month , you may purchase 40 shares of Stock XYZ at $10 per share . If the price goes up to $12 in month two , you 'll only purchase 33.33 shares . And if the price falls to $8 , you 'll purchase 50 shares . The key is holding steady at $400 every month . <p> Of course , no strategy , dollar-cost averaging included , can protect you against losses when stock prices tumble . And if the market were to go straight up , you 'd be better off purchasing all of your shares as soon as possible . But dollar-cost averaging can be a prudent way to ease into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( You should be aware that this strategy involves a continuous investment in securities regardless of fluctuating price levels .

The important thing is to make sure you have it if you need it " and have the right type to suit your needs .

@@49276449 @2776449/ <h> Today 's Retirement : Does the 4 Percent Rule Still Make Sense ? <h> Key Points <p> The 4 percent rule is still a useful guideline for determining how much to save and how much to withdraw annually from your retirement portfolio . <p> When applying it to your own situation , you have to look a little deeper and remain flexible . <p> Rules aside , the key to a secure retirement is to save as much as you can now . 132740 @qwx542740 <p> I plan to retire in about 10 years and I 'm trying to be smart about saving and planning . I 've read about the 4 percent rule in the past , but given the economic uncertainty of the last several years , I 'm wondering if it still applies ? <p> " A Reader - 132741 @qwx542741 <p> My first thought is that when it comes to retirement planning , there 's no one rule that applies to everyone . The amount you need to save depends on a lot of personal factors such as where you live , how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probable longevity . <p> That said , there are certainly guidelines that you can apply to your own situation , and the 4 percent rule is one of them . And you 're correct that there has been a lot of discussion about whether this rule still applies . But to me , if used as a starting point and a guideline , I think it still has value . <p> Let 's start by reviewing what it is . <h> What is the 4 percent rule ? <p> The four percent rule says that you will have a 90% chance of not outliving your assets if you withdraw four percent of your portfolio 's value in your first year of retirement , and increase that amount every year for inflation . It assumes that you have a moderate portfolio ( 40-60 percent in stocks ) and will have a 30-year retirement . <p> Another way to look at the rule is that you should save 25 times ( this is another way to back into the four percent rule ) what you think you 'll need from your portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security and other non-portfolio sources of income . <h> What does it mean in terms of dollars ? <p> Percentages are fine , but dollars tell the real story . To come up with a dollar figure , first do a rough estimate of how much annual retirement income you 'll need . An easy way is to just base it on your current expenses . Then , subtract estimated Social Security benefits and any other non-portfolio sources of income . The remainder is what you 'll need from your portfolio . <p> For the sake of example , let 's say you expect to spend $65,000 the first year of retirement and anticipate $24,000 in Social Security benefits . If you have no other sources of income , you 'll have to withdraw $41,000 from your portfolio to meet your income needs . Now multiply that figure by 25 to come up with your target retirement portfolio . In this case , you 'd need to aim for a portfolio of $1,025,000 to be able to follow the 4 percent rule . <h> Making the 4 percent rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in stone ; it 's just a guideline . Some money managers think a 4 percent annual draw on your portfolio is too much considering current investment returns . Others worry that the 4 percent rule actually short-changes some retirees , especially in their early retirement years . <p> To make it work for you , you need to get more specific and understand that flexibility is the key . Here are some things to consider : <p> How dependent are you on that 4 percent for fixed expenses like housing , food , and medical care ? If you can cover most of these non-discretionary expenses from other sources of income such as a pension or Social Security , you might want to withdraw less from your portfolio ( or at least not adjust for inflation ) , especially when the stock market has a down year . Conversely , if the stock market is doing well , you can think about taking a little more . <p> Do you have the potential or desire to earn some money from part-time work during retirement ? If so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more protection for the future . <p> Could your retirement last longer than thirty years ? If you 're healthy and longevity runs in your family , consider withdrawing less . On the other hand , if you 're fairly certain you wo n't be funding a thirty-year retirement , you could increase the amount . <p> What 's your risk tolerance ? The 4 percent guideline is designed to provide you with a 90 percent certainty that you wo n't outlive your money . If you 're comfortable with a lower confidence level , say 80 percent , you can withdraw more " say 5 percent . But if you want to increase your confidence , you should withdraw less than 4 percent . <p> How active do you want to be ? The early years of retirement when you 're traveling or pursuing other interests might be more costly . If you think you 'll spend less as you age , you can budget accordingly . <h> Bottom line : Save as much as you can <p> Rules aside , retirement planning is ultimately about saving enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement calculator to explore different timelines and savings amounts . With 10 years to go , you have time to fine-tune your retirement plan . You might be surprised at how much difference a few extra dollars and a few extra years can make .

@@49276450 @2776450/ <p> I 'm turning 70 in a few months and know I 'll be forced to withdraw money from my retirement accounts . How does that work and are there some special rules I need to be aware of ? - - A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> I think reaching age 70 is an important milestone , so first of all , congratulations . You probably have a lot to celebrate . However , while you 're blowing out the candles , the IRS is lying in wait , ready to collect some revenue . That 's because you MUST begin taking a yearly Required Minimum Distribution ( RMD ) from your retirement accounts once you reach age 70+ . <p> This includes many of your tax-advantaged accountstraditional , SEP and SIMPLE IRAs , and 401(k)sonce you retire . ( You can delay taking an RMD from your 401(k) if you 're still employed . ) If you have a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) , you 're in the clear . There is no RMD for a Roth . <p> While the concept of a RMD is simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of to avoid some pretty hefty penalties . Here are a few things to keep in mind . - Do n't be late Technically , you have until the year AFTER you turn 70+ to take your first RMD . The IRS gives you the choice of taking it either by the end of the year you turn 70+ or by April 1st of the year following . For instance , if your 70th birthday is on December 1 , 2015 , you turn 70+ on June 1 , 2016 , so you could delay taking your first RMD until April 1 , 2017 . All subsequent RMDs must be taken by December 31st of each year . <p> This timing is no casual matter . The penalty for failure to take your RMD on time is a hefty 50 PERCENT of the amount that should have been withdrawnand you still have to pay taxes on it . Which brings us to the next point . <p> Factor in taxes While delaying your first RMD may seem to make sense if you do n't need the money , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1st deadline , you still have to take your 2nd RMD by December 31st of that same yeartwo distributions in one year . Distributions are considered ordinary income and are taxed as such . Taking two in one year could bump you into a higher tax bracket . Best to think big picture . <p> Calculate correctly You must calculate an RMD for each of your retirement accounts , based on their value on December 31st of the previous year. - Start by listing the fair market value of your IRAs as of that date . Next , determine your life expectancy using appropriate Life Expectancy Tables from the IRS . You can find them in publication 590 , available at IRS.gov . The basic formula is : fair market value divided by life expectancy equals RMD. - <p> Here 's a simple example . Say your IRA is valued at $100,000 . Using the Uniform Lifetime Table , the first year you would divide that by 27.4 years . So your first RMD would be $3,649.64 . <p> To make it easy , the financial institution where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's wise to know the formula yourself . <p> Decide how to take your distribution While you calculate an RMD for each retirement account , you do n't have to take the distribution specifically from each . You can take the sum total of your RMDs from any one account , making it a much simpler process . <p> There 's an exception , however , for 401(k)s and most other types of employer-sponsored retirement accounts . If you have more than one , you have to calculate and take a withdrawal from each individual account . <p> Consider consolidating If you have just one retirement account with one financial institution , taking your yearly RMD can be a pretty simple process . But if you have several accounts at various banks or brokerages , you might want to consolidate everything in one place . You could also consider rolling any 401(k)s still at a former employer into an IRA . This would make it easier to calculate your total RMD as well as to determine which account to tap for the distribution . <p> One more thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't mean you have to spend it .

A broker can help you evaluate your portfolio , make buy and sell recommendations , and execute trades . <p> In contrast , an investment advisor , also known as a registered investment advisor or RIA , is registered with either the Securities and Exchange Commission or a state securities regulator specifically to provide financial advice and management , which can include buying and selling securities .

A one-time consultation might be free or it could be charged by the hour . For ongoing management , it 's common to be charged a percentage of assets managed , typically averaging about 1 percent .

In fact , if someone is compensated by commissions or incentives , I 'd proceed with an extra amount of cautionif at all . <p> Ask the right questions Finding the right advisor is about asking the right questions . Arrange for an initial consultation ( it 's usually complimentary ) and ask about education , time in the business , number of clients , types of services and amount of money under management . Find out about their investing philosophy and preferred types of investments . And get very specific about how you will be charged and why . <p> Plus , do n't overlook the importance of a good rapport . If you expect to have a long-term relationship , you want to be comfortable personally as well as professionally . <p> Stay involved Lastly , even with an advisor , stay on top of things .

@@49276457 @2776457/ <p> I 'm thinking of taking a distribution from my Roth IRA . What do I need to know ? Are there any taxes or penalties ? 132745 @qwx542745 132741 @qwx542741 <p> This is a great question because a transaction that presumably would be very simple can quickly get bogged down in rules and exceptions . <p> The reason ? While Roth IRA distributions are often tax and penalty free , there are also situations in which this might not be the case . In reality , it all depends on how long you 've had your Roth IRA , your age , and what you plan to do with the money . <p> As always when it comes to tax issues , I suggest you talk to your accountant or tax advisor . But I can at least give you a rundown on the basics so you 'll be armed with some information . <h> The basic rules <p> Because Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars , you can withdraw the contributions tax and penalty free at any time . That 's the simple part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be tax and penalty free . And that 's where things can get more complicated . <p> The IRS makes a distinction between what they call qualified and nonqualified distributions . According to the 5-year rule , for a distribution to be qualified , or not taxable or subject to penalty , you have to have held your Roth IRA for a period of five tax years , and meet one of the following conditions : <p> You must be at least 59-+ , or <p> You use the money to pay for a first-time home ( $10,000 lifetime cap ) , or <p> You become disabled , or <p> The distribution is made to a beneficiary or to your estate after you die . <p> Here are a couple of sample scenarios : <p> Qualified distribution " Let 's say you opened a Roth IRA in 2005 and have made yearly contributions amounting to $50,000 . With your earnings , your account is now worth $54,000 . Let 's also say you turned 59-+ in 2016 . Because you meet both the 5-year holding period and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties . <p> Nonqualified distribution " Now let 's say you 're only 45 ( and you 're not disabled or buying a first house ) . In this case , you 'll be taxed on the $4,000 in earnings at your ordinary income tax rate . But that 's not all . Because you 're under 59-+ , and you do n't meet the other conditions , you might also have to pay a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty on your earnings . I say might because , as with all rules , there are exceptions . <h> The exceptions <p> In general , if you withdraw money from your Roth IRA before you 've met the 5-year holding period and/or before you reach 59-+ , not only is the earnings portion of the distribution taxable , but you could be subject to a 10 percent penalty on those earnings unless the distribution is used for one of the following exceptions : <p> Made in substantially equal periodic payments over the period of your life expectancy , or <p> Due to an IRS levy of the qualified plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has rules about the order in which funds are taken out . Withdrawals are considered to first come from contributions ( which are not subject to any holding period ) , then from Roth conversions , and lastly from earnings . So how much you 're withdrawing and what percentage comes from earnings will also determine the extent of any taxes and penalties . <h> Different rules for Roth IRA conversions <p> If you 've converted your traditional IRA into a Roth , there 's yet another set of distribution rules . Unlike contributions to a Roth that come from your income , if you 're under 59-+ contributions from a conversion must be held in your account for five tax years from the time of the conversion to be penalty free upon withdrawal . <h> Talk to your tax advisor <p> As you can see , unless you clearly fit the specific conditions for a qualified distribution , there are plenty of things to consider .

@@49276458 @2776458/ <p> According to a January 2014 Schwab Money Myths survey , no matter how savvy we think we are , there are still a lot of financial misconceptions floating around out there . And surprisingly , a number of those misconceptions are n't about esoteric investing theories ; they 're about everyday financial situations . <p> To help you avoid these common misconceptionsand perhaps help your loved ones avoid them , tooI 'm going to share not only the myths but also the facts . After all , a little financial reality can go a long way toward helping you protect yourself and meet your goals . <p> Myth 1 : A will is the best way to ensure your property will be distributed the way you want . That would seem to make sense . But the problem is that many people forget that they 've already designated beneficiaries on many of their financial accounts , such as IRAs and on their insurance policies . Or they think that a will overrides those designations . However , the opposite is true . <p> If there 's a discrepancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your will , your financial accounts will prevail . So while a will is an important part of your estate plan , you also need to update your beneficiary designations to make sure you do n't inadvertently leave something to an unintended recipient , such as an ex-spouse . <p> Myth 2 : It 's important to eliminate all debt by the time you retire . It really depends on the type of debt you have " good " debt or " bad " debt . Good debt is low interest and tax deductible , such as a mortgage . Bad debt is high interest and non-deductiblethink credit cards . Your personal circumstances and tax situation will help determine how much debt to eliminate and when . To me , credit card debt should always be the first to go . <p> Myth 3 : After you retire , you can always get another job if you need more money . Continuing to work , at least part-time , is a great idea for a lot of reasons , but the reality is that while more than one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to get income from a part time job in retirement , only 4% of those who are currently retired actually do . Often , the reason has to do with health issues . Plus , the current job market does n't make it any easier . <p> Myth 4 : Every adult should have life insurance . Do you have young children ? Are you supporting other dependents ? Do you own a small business ? Or do you have significant liabilities that will continue after you die ? If you answered yes to any of these questions , life insurance may make sense . Otherwise , it could be a waste of money . <p> Myth 5 : You should start taking Social Security as soon as you 're eligible . If you wait to take your benefits starting at age 70 , they will be 76% higher than if you start at age 62 . Of course , you also have to factor in your current needs , health , spousal benefits and family history of longevity before you make this important decision . <p> Myth 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your 40s or younger . It sounds right because younger people have a lower premium . But on the other hand , you 'll be paying that premium for a longer period of time , increasing the total cost . Bottom line ? If you 're in good health , the ideal time to consider long-term care insurance is between ages 50 and 65 . <p> Myth 7 : Retirees should n't have their money in the stock market . While it 's often recommended that you decrease the percentage of stocks in your portfolio as you get older , keeping a certain amount in a combination of stocks , stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) is good protection against inflation no matter your age . You do n't want to risk money that you 'll need in the short-term , but there 's such a thing as being too conservativeespecially if you anticipate a long retirement . <p> Myth 8 : If you need cash while you 're still working , a 401k plan is a good place to turn for a loan or a withdrawal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort unless it 's an emergency . First , you 're immediately depleting your retirement savings . Second , you 're risking taxes and penalties if for some reason you ca n't pay it back on time . Third , if you leave your job for any reason , you 'll need to pay back the loan ASAP .

It 's generally not possible to replace 100 percent of your income . <p> All states offer workers ' compensation , but only if your injury or illness is work related . <p> Military personnel are entitled to veterans ' benefits only if their disabilities are service related .

When you purchase a disability policy , make sure you understand what 's covered . <h> Two types of disability insurance <p> There are two main types of disability insurance : <p> Short-term policies cover disabilities that last for a few weeks or months . <p> Long-term policies can provide coverage for anywhere from two to five years , or even until you reach age 65 . <p> If your employer offers a disability insurance policy , it is most likely short term . In this case you may want to purchase additional long-term coverage on your own . This will also protect you in case you leave your job . <h> How much coverage do you need ? <p> Start by determining how much money you need each month to pay your bills if you become disabled . Policies generally wo n't cover more than about two-thirds of your gross earnings . However , if you buy your own policy you wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your take-home pay would be about the same . <h> Things to consider when buying a plan <p> If you become disabled , you 'll have to wait a certain amount of time ( the elimination period ) before you receive benefits .

Do I have to retire for him to be eligible ? 132745 @qwx542745 132741 @qwx542741 <p> These are all great questions , so thanks for asking . Let 's go in order : - <h> You can fund a spousal IRA <p> One of the best deals around for a nonworking spouse is a spousal IRA . If you 're married filing your tax return jointly , you can contribute funds into two separate IRAs " one for him and one for you " as long as you have earned income equal to both contributions . <p> Since you 're both over age 50 , you can currently contribute up to $6,500 ( $5,500 plus $1,000 catch-up for those over 50 ) into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have earned income of $13,000 or more to cover both contributions . <p> Tax-deductibility is another issue . If you participate in a 401(k) or pension plan at work , and earn more than $184,000 , your contributions to a spousal IRA are not fully deductible . If you earn more than $194,000 , they are not deductible at all . ( And tax deductibility for contributions to your own IRA will be phased out between $98,000 and $118,000 of income ) . <p> I do want to mention one caveat , however , especially appropriate for someone approaching retirement . Withdrawals from a traditional IRA are taxed at your ordinary income tax rate . On the other hand , withdrawals from taxable accounts are taxed as capital gains ( with a preferential rate for investments held for more than one year ) . <p> Therefore , depending on your personal tax rate and the length of time you plan to hold your investments , it might make more sense for you to invest in a taxable account rather than an IRA . Alternatively , if you qualify ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider a Roth IRA . - I recommend working with a tax advisor to crunch the numbers . - <p> In any case , I encourage you to save to the max ! - <h> Spouses can collect Social Security benefits <p> The short answer to your next question is that yes , a nonworking spouse who has reached age 62 can collect Social Security benefits based on the working spouse 's earnings record once the working spouse has filed for benefits or once the working spouse has reached their full retirement age ( FRA ) . - <p> This sounds clear enough , but there are a number of rules and exceptions to think about . - <h> What and when a nonworking spouse can collect <p> The Social Security benefit of a nonworking spouse is up to 50 percent of the working spouse 's FRA benefit . ( FRA is 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954 . ) So if your FRA benefit is $2,000 per month , your husband would be able to collect up to an additional $1,000 . Once you file ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take Social Security right away . However , filing before his FRA will permanently reduce his spousal benefit. - <p> Wait until FRA in order to receive his full spousal benefit , which is 50 percent of your FRA benefit. - <p> Just for the record , there is an exception to the age requirement if your spouse is caring for your child who is under age 16. - Also note that there is no benefit for your husband to postpone filing beyond age 66. - Unlike the worker 's benefit , which continues to increase until age 70 , a spouse 's benefits max out at FRA. - <h> Why timing is important <p> Both you and your husband should give a lot of thought to when to begin collecting Social Security . If you apply now , at age 62 , your benefit will be permanently reduced by 25 percent . That could make a big dent in your monthly income and would also reduce any future survivor benefits should your husband outlive you . <p> Therefore , even though it might be tempting to begin taking benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect checks for a longer period of time " it 's a good idea to look at your " break even age " before making a final decision . This is how long you need to live to give you greater lifetime benefits despite postponing your start date . Chances are , the longer you can each wait ( up to FRA for him , 70 for you ) , the better . <p> Bottom line , if you wait until you reach your FRA to file , you will be capturing the maximum spousal benefit . And if you can hold off even longer " until age 70 " you will receive the highest possible retirement benefit for yourself and the highest possible survivor benefit for your husband. - <p> As you can see , there are several things you and your husband can do to increase your retirement security , and I highly recommend that you look into them all .

@@49276465 @2776465/ <h> Do You Need Life Insurance ? <h> If so , what type and how much ? <p> Most people use life insurance as a way to assure that their loved ones will be able to maintain their quality of life for years to come . To decide if you need life insurance , first ask yourself if your family is adequately protected should something happen to you . <p> If you 're single with no children and no dependents , you probably do n't need life insurance at all . If you have substantial assets , you may be able to self-insure . But the vast majority of people fall in between and may want to consider life insurance for a variety of possible reasons , including : <p> Income replacement " It can be a vital resource for your loved ones to help replace your income , pay off the mortgage or fund your children 's education in the event of your death . <p> Terminal illness " Some policies allow you to access a percentage of your policy benefit over your lifetime if you become terminally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses or medical costs at a time most critical to you and your family . <p> Estate taxes " You may be able to use insurance proceeds to pay estate taxes , preserving your estate for your beneficiaries . <p> Own business " If you own a business , life insurance can be used to cover outstanding business loans , ensure financial stability after the untimely death of a key employee , and to provide cash needed to fund a buyout by a surviving owner . <h> Types of life insurance <p> As mentioned in the general discussion of , there are two basic types of life insurance , term and cash value . Here are some key differences to help you decide which type might be best for you : <h> Term insurance " the best low-cost insurance for a limited time <p> Term life insurance is pure insurance .

If you do n't use it during the term of the policy , there is no refund of your premiums . <p> Term life is by far the least expensive and a good choice for young families wanting to make sure basic expenses are covered . <p> Cash value or permanent life insurance insures you for your lifetime . Unlike term life , there 's no expiration date . As long as you pay your premiums , you should be covered . <p> In addition to lifelong coverage , these policies also offer a savings component " a cash value . A sliding percentage of each premium is set aside " more at first , less as you age . The insurance company usually invests this money , which grows tax-deferred . You can then make withdrawals from or borrow against it . <p> Cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , but may be warranted if you have what you believe will be a long-term or " permanent " need for coverage . For example , if you have a dependent who will always need care , health concerns or other estate planning needs , this may be the wisest choice . <h> How much life insurance do you need ? <p> A simple way to decide how much life insurance you need is to calculate how much it would cost to : <p> Replace your income for a specific number of years <p> Pay off major expenses including your mortgage and your children 's college educations <p> Provide an emergency fund <p> Pay for any final expenses ( e.g. , estate settlement , funeral or final medical expenses ) <p> An industry rule of thumb says you should have six to eight times your annual salary .

@@49276469 @2776469/ <p> I get this question a lot and I 'm always happy to answer it because I think it 's so important . Of course , taking Social Security at the first possible opportunity is an option . And depending on your personal circumstances , it might be the right decision for you . <p> But while it 's tempting and very commonmore than three-quarters of eligible workers file early according to the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) my concern is that a lot of folks do n't think about what taking benefits before full retirement age ( FRA ) means in terms of dollars over your lifetime . So while you 're trying to decide , I suggest you consider the following financial repercussions . <p> Your benefits will be permanently reduced While everyone who has earned enough work credits is eligible to take Social Security at age 62 , if you do , the SSA reduces your benefits by 25 percentfor life . That could be a pretty good reason to wait . On the opposite end , for every year you delay between your FRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 percent . That could be an even better reason to hold off . <p> Now let 's put that into dollars . Let 's say your full Social Security benefit at 66 would be $1,000 . Take it at age 62 , and you 'll get only $750 . Hold off until age 70 , and it goes up to $1,320 . That 's a pretty significant spread . Of course , the amount you 'll collect over time depends on the size of your monthly benefits and how long you live . Using the same example , if you live to 78 , you 'll pretty much break even whether you begin collecting at 62 or 66 . <p> And the longer you live , the more the numbers favor waiting . Consider this : If your full benefit at 66 would be $1,000 but you file at 62 and live to 95 , you 'll collect almost $100,000 less than the 95-year-old who waited until age 70. - If you 're still working , some of your benefits will be withheld You mention supplementing your income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years . If so , realize that when you file for Social Security benefits before your FRA and your earnings exceed certain limits , part of your benefit will be temporarily withheld . <p> In 2015 , if you file at 62 , $1 in benefits will be withheld for every $2 you earn above $15,720 . In the year prior to your FRA , $1 is deducted for every $3 you earn above a higher limit , currently $41,880 . Once you reach your FRA , there 's no deduction and you 'll get the money previously withheld in the form of a higher benefit , but the withholding will have an impact on your payout during your pre-FRA years . <p> And regardless of age , as much as 5085 percent of your benefit may be subject to income tax if your modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) is above certain levels , currently $25,000 for single filers , or $32,000 for married filing jointly . Another consideration : your Social Security benefit could actually bump you into a higher income tax bracket . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're married , and you predecease your spouse , taking Social Security early would also reduce his or her monthly spousal survivor payout . It may seem a long way off , but it 's something to consider if your spouse will be collecting on your work record . <p> On the plus side , a child under 18 could bump up the family benefit While I 've been focusing on the downside , if you have unmarried children or grandchildren who are your legal dependents , you could get a bit of an increase as a family no matter when you file . Children under 18 ( up to 19 if a full-time student in elementary or secondary school ) or a disabled child can receive a monthly payment of up to one-half of your full retirement benefitwith a family limit of between 150 to 180 percent of your full benefit . If it applies , it 's worth noting as you do your calculations . <p> Do the math before you decideLike most other financial decisions , deciding when to file depends on your personal circumstances . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all means take Social Security at the first opportunity . But if you can manage without it , I think it 's important to at least consider waiting . <p> Do the math . Talk to your spouse . Consult with your financial advisor . It 's worth the effort because the decision you make now will have very real financial repercussions both for the present and the future . <p> For the record , if you do decide to take your benefits at age 62 , the SSA gives you the chance to change your mind during the first yearas long as you pay back any benefits that you 've received . But I urge you to think it through before filing to save yourself time , money and potential aggravation . <p> This article is part of the Ask Carrie : Social Security series .

Does it still make sense or have I missed the boat ? 132745 @qwx542745 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Rising short-term interest rates are on a lot of people 's minds these days . For savers , it 's a plus , but borrowersespecially those with credit card balancesmay see their payments creep up over time . However , for homeowners with a mortgage , it 's a slightly different story . <p> While adjustable rate mortgages may be affected by short-term rate increases depending on the benchmark used to adjust the rate , fixed mortgage rates tend to be more closely aligned with the 10-year Treasury note . So , for instance , the recent increase in the short-term federal funds rate is unlikely to cause rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage to increase dramatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , when you compare today 's mortgage rates to historical norms , current rates are still a good deal . <p> But rates aside , deciding whether or not to refinance depends on a lot of personal factors .

Reduce the length of your mortgage ? Take out extra money for home improvements ? These are important initial questions . <p> If decreasing your payment is a top priority and you can lower your interest rate by- + to 1 percent , it 's probably worth the effort . For instance , lowering the interest rate on a $350,000 30-year fixed mortgage by 1 percent could lower your monthly payment by about $300 a month . <p> On the flip side , if your goal is to shorten the length of your mortgage and you refinance that amount for 15 years , your monthly payment would go up , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loan . - How long will you be in the house ? Refinancing usually involves paying points and fees . Points basically represent interest you pay upfront to get a lower rate on your loan . It 's not uncommon for points and fees to add up to 3-6 percent of your loan . You can pay this out of pocket or , often times , add them to the balance of your loan . ( One positive : points on a refi are tax deductible , amortized over the life of the loan . Should you refi again , you can deduct any unamortized points at that time . ) <p> However you pay them , it will take time to get to the breakeven point where these additional costs are offset by the lower rates , so you have to think realistically about how long you intend to be in your home . If you plan to sell in the near future , the extra cost of refinancing may outweigh the monthly short-term savings . <p> How much home equity do you have ? Just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have less than 20 percent equity in your home , you 'll likely have to pay private mortgage insurance ( PMI ) . PMI fees can range from less than half a percent up to about 1.5 percent of your loan . While that may not add a considerable amount to your payment , if your goal is to reduce your monthlies and you have very little equity , you may want to reconsider . <p> Do the math As you can see , it becomes a numbers game . A good way to start is to run some different scenarios using an online mortgage refinance calculator . That way you can see how it all adds up and decide on the optimum rate and loan term for you .

So put retirement savings firstbefore saving for a house or a child 's education . Start by contributing at least enough to your company retirement plan to capture the maximum match . Then contribute more if you can to either your 401(k) or an IRA , putting contributions on automatic .

Beyond a will , the complexity of your estate plan will depend on your financial situation .

That 's what our estate planning attorney helped us to do and I 'm happy to pass his insights on to you . <p> Ask yourself these questions Answering the following questions will help you zero in on what 's most important as you consider the possibility of someone else raising your children . <p> Does the prospective guardian share your values ? Whether it 's religious , moral , political or personal , ideally you want someone to raise your children with the beliefs and attitudes that you hold dear . Of course , no two people think exactly alike , but if , for instance , you want your kids to grow up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an open mind on social issues . <p> How intimately does this person know you and your family ? How comfortable are your kids with this person ? The closer your kids are to a potential guardian , the easier it will be on them during what is a very difficult transition . <p> How many children does the prospective guardian already have ? What is their parenting style ? If someone already has a full house , there may not be room for your kids . And in terms of parenting , you want someone who could provide a sense of continuity when it comes to things like discipline and personal responsibility . <p> What 's the age and health of the individual you 're considering ? Since you mention your siblings , age may not be a factor , but it 's good to think about these things . Depending on the age of your children at the time , this could be a long-term commitment . <p> Where does the guardian live ? Do you want your children to be uprooted ? It 's one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear a teenager away from junior high or high school where friends and social networks have already been established . <p> Focusing on these issues may point more toward one or another potential guardian . But once you 've answered these questions to your mutual satisfaction , there 's still another important consideration . <p> Think about financial stability Hopefully you and your husband have enough life insurance to provide for your kids financially through college . It 's one thing to ask someone to care for your kids and quite another to ask them to support them . <p> But whatever your financial circumstances , whether it 's through personal assets or insurance , your children will most likely have some type of inheritance that needs to be managed carefully . Fortunately , you can choose to appoint both a personal guardian and what 's called a guardian of the estate . They do n't have to be the same individual . <p> So let 's say your sister is the most financially savvy and your husband 's brother has the best family set up to care for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , it 's very important that the guardian of the person and the guardian of the estate get along and agree on what 's best for the kids . <p> Get the guardian 's consent Once you and your husband agree , the next step is to talk to the prospective guardian . Make sure he or she understands why you 've chosen them and is willing to take on the responsibility . Actually , I think it 's a good idea to have a second choice in case the first one is unable at the time to fulfill the role . <p> Realize that you can revisit your choice every few years Nothing is cast in stone , not even your will . If something changes over the years , do n't hesitate to change your guardian choice . No one 's feelings should be hurt . The deciding factor should always be what 's best for your children at the time . <p> Believe me , I know this whole process is n't easy , and hopefully your guardian will never have to step in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . Then as you and your family go about living a full and happy life , you can rest a bit easier knowing your kids are taken care ofjust in case . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765 
@@49276474 @2776474/ <p> I 'm suffering from credit card fatigue . It 's not that I ever carry a balance from month to month , but I 'm guilty of falling for sign-up incentives " and currently have 25 cards ( including department stores ) . Is this too much ? And if so , how can I decide which ones to keep and which ones to give up ? <p> " A Reader- - 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Credit card sign-up incentives are everywhere these days because they work , as you can attest . But while saving money or adding up miles may sound enticing at the time , you also need to consider the potentially serious consequences when you carry too many cardsfrom an increased risk of loss or fraud to wasting your valuable time managing multiple accounts to just plain overspending . <p> And now that you have all those cards in your wallet , you need to be careful not only about the way you use and protect them , but also about how you might eliminate a few . Before you get out the scissors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Decide which cardsand incentivesyou 'll really use Certain features can make particular cards worthwhile . So first do a little sorting . <p> Put all of your proprietary ' cards in one stack . This includes cards issued by retailers like Macy 's or Target or a gasoline company . Think about how often you use each card and whether it gives you a discount or other valuable benefit . <p> Now look at your bank credit cards . Which ones do you regularly use and why ? If it 's a matter of rewards , decide which are the most practical . For instance , cash-back programs can add up . On the other hand , while travel perks may be alluring , be realistic about whether you will , or even can , use the accumulated miles or other services . <p> Also look at what each card is costing you . Is paying an annual fee justified by the benefit you derive ? How do interest rates compare ? If you travel outside the U.S. , are you charged foreign transaction fees ? <p> The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the most beneficial and the least costly . <p> Understand your credit utilization ratio Once you 've made your pick , it 's not just a matter of canceling the rest . You also have to consider what is known as your credit utilization ratio ' and understand how that number affects your credit score . The issue here is n't how much credit you have available , but how much of your available credit you use . <p> To get your ratio , divide your total debt balance by your total available credit . For example , let 's say you have $50,000 in available credit and $8,000 in charges . Your credit utilization ratio would be 16 percent , which is low . Now let 's say you eliminate several cards , bringing your available credit down to $25,000 . Your ratio jumps to 32 percent . <p> While there is n't one perfect number , a lower ratio can result in a higher credit score . As a general guideline , 20 to 30 percent is a good goal . <p> Think carefully about which cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem as long as you manage them wisely . One tactic could be to simply put your less frequently used cards aside and carry only those that suit your everyday needs . However , if you prefer to cancel some of your cards , do it thoughtfully . <p> First , keep in mind how long you 've had a credit relationship because a long credit history is a positive . Again , consider your utilization ratio . To keep your available creditand your ratioat a healthy level , you could increase the credit limit on the cards you keep before you cancel the ones you do n't need . <p> Finally , remember that it takes more than cutting up a card to cancel an account . You must contact each issuing company and request that the account be closed . <p> Approach new offers with caution Once you 've winnowed down your cards , make a deal with yourself to resist the lure of new offers . Before getting sucked in , carefully review the terms and conditions , and make sure the rewards are worthwhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some experts recommend having only one or two , especially for those just starting out or with a history of mismanaging credit . Others say anything over five or six is too many . But if you 're good at juggling multiple accounts and pulling out just the right card for the right reward , and you 're not paying multiple annual fees , the exact number is n't significant . <p> Ultimately , I recommend that you carry the cards that help you do business cost-effectively andmost importantlystay on top of your bills . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

@@49276476 @2776476/ <p> My husband and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and have been debating continuing to rent versus buying a house . Meanwhile , our down payment savings is making less than 1% interest . My financial consultant said not to move it into stocks if we need these funds in the next 5 years , but it 's hard to accept such a low rate of return . I 'd love your thoughts on this . <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> First , let me say that I agree with your financial consultant . Money that you think you 'll need in the next two to five years definitely should n't be in the stock market . Yes , it 's hard to see it making so little interest , but just think how much harder it would be to have to sell at a loss when you need the money to buy your home . <p> There 's really no way around it . As a general statement , higher returns mean more risk ; lower returns mean more safety . You could try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CDs , but do n't go out too long or you could end up paying a penalty for an early withdrawal . <p> On the bright side , you 're lucky that you have a down payment , and hopefully you 're continuing to save . Ideally , you want to be able to put at least 20 percent of the purchase price down so that you can avoid paying mortgage insurance . However , when it comes to the rent vs. buy debate , there are a number of other things to consider beyond your down payment . <p> Start with your personal reasons for buying While the general rise in home prices across the country has a lot of folks thinking about buying , I always counsel taking a step back and looking beyond the numbers . That 's because homeownership is as much personal as it is financial . For example , some people derive satisfaction from owning and caring for a home , while others think of it as a burden . Some people get a sense of security from home ownership , while others may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what it will mean to you . And in any case , I advise you not to think of your home as an investment . If its value increases , that 's great . But you ca n't count on that , especially in the short term . <p> Look at the long-term financial reality If you 're emotionally ready to be a homeowner , then it 's time to run the numbers . And not just the initial numbers that will get you into a homedown payment , closing cost , fees and assessmentsbut also the ongoing financial obligations . <p> A big mortgage can be a tremendous source of stress if times get tough . You want to be sure you 're not stretching yourself to the limit from day one . If paying your mortgage will mean you have to compromise on other financial obligations , you may need to rethink the situation . <p> Therefore , before you commit to a home , make sure that you are n't carrying credit card debt month to month and that you have a substantial emergency fund ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including your new mortgage ) . Also make sure that you are saving adequately for retirement , and that you are confident that you will be able to continue contributing after you are a homeowner . <p> And remember , your mortgage is just a part of the overall cost of owning a home . There are property taxes , insurance , repairs and maintenance , and perhaps even renovationsall should be factored in from the start . <p> Do a rent vs. buy comparison for your area There 's no cut and dried way to determine whether you 're better off renting or buying . So much depends on location . In fact , costs can vary significantly not only from city to city , but in different parts of the same city . In the San Francisco Bay Area where you live , both rents and property values are generally high across the board , and continuing to rise . <p> There are a number of online calculators to help you figure out the overall cost of buying vs. renting . Trulia.com has an easy one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , including how long you 'd need to own the home before buying would make economic sense . <p> Carefully consider your timetable Which takes me to the next point . Even if you live in an area where prices generally appreciate ( such as San Francisco ) , you ca n't count on that continuing . As we all saw during the recent recession , prices can drop precipitously short-term . And even in the long-term , prices can certainly dip . <p> Therefore , buying a house is a long-term proposition . Before you commit , look at your job stability , your desire to remain in a particular location , and your willingness to spend the time , money and energy it takes to maintain a home . From a financial perspective , five years seems to be the magic number . Unless you plan to own a property at least this long , buying probably wo n't work in your favor . <p> Get pre-approved If you 're serious about buying , be sure to get pre-approved for a mortgage . With your down payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house you can really afford , you 'll be in a much better buying position in today 's quite competitive market . <p> I know none of this will increase the return on your current down payment , but think of it all as an investment in your ability to get the house of your dreams . That 's a return you can enjoy for many years to come . <p> Looking for answers to your retirement questions ?

I invite you to join me over the next four weeks as I delve into ways to control spending and enhance financial health . <h> Why we should pay closer attention to our spending habits <p> There 's clear evidence that our financial and our physical health go hand in hand .

Things like morning coffee , cab rides , or lunches out ? If you 're like most people , a lot of your spending is done kind of automatically . You may have a general idea of where your money goes , but because it 's so convenient to pay for most everything with a credit card , it 's easy to lose track of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 30 days , you make a commitment to use cash for those everyday expenses . First , plan your day-to-day spending for a week , then go to the ATM and get cash to cover them . Taking this a step further , write down every cash purchase in whatever way is easiest for you . Some people like to carry around a little notebook ; others might use an app . You can also use an online tracker . Finally , see where you might be able to cut back . With a heightened awareness of each expenditure , you may quite naturally make better spending decisions . <p> Interestingly , a colleague and her husband recently did this exercise for several months and found that the very first month they saved an impressive amount of money . <h> Getting motivated <p> Of course , there 's more to mindful spending than just getting on top of your day-to-day expenses .

@@49276487 @2776487/ <h> Creating an Estate Plan <h> It 's your legacy <p> Setting up an estate plan does n't have to be complicated . Here are some things you can do to get started : <h> 1 . Take an inventory of your assets and liabilities . <p> List the value of your home and other real estate , cars , jewelry , artwork and other physical assets . Gather recent statements from each of your bank , investment and brokerage accounts . Make a list of all insurance policies , their cash value and death benefit . Finally , list all liabilities , including mortgages , lines of credit and other debt . To simplify this task , use our net worth worksheet ( PDF ) . <h> 2 . Define your estate-planning objectives . <p> How do you want your assets distributed ? List the people and the percentages you want them to get .

@@49276489 @2776489/ <p> I 'm in my late 20s with a good job and can finally save some money . I know that I should start investing but it 's a little overwhelming . Where do I start ? - <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> I understand that investing can seem extremely overwhelming at first. - However , I believe it 's one of the best ways to build your financial security , so I applaud your interest in getting started . The good news about investing is that you do n't have to understand all the intricacies to get started . The trick is to break it down into simple steps . <p> But before you put any money in the market , I suggest that you cover a couple of financial bases . First , set aside enough cash in an emergency fund to cover three to six months of essential living expenses . Next , make sure you have health insurance ( absolutely essential ! ) as well as car insurance and renters or homeowners insurance , depending on whether you rent or own a home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore investing . <p> Here are five steps to help you get going . You can build on them as you become more comfortable . <p> 1 ) Set some goals Investing is about growing your money , but to do that effectively , you have to know what you want to accomplish . So do some thinking . Lay out your short- , medium- and long-term goals . Write them down , give them a time frame , and put a dollar figure beside each . For instance , a short-term goal might be a vacation . A medium-term goal could be a down payment on a house . To me , your number one long-term goal should be retirement . <p> Having tangible goals is a good motivation to keep saving and investing . It also helps you understand how to invest for the time frame attached to each goal . <p> 2 ) Check in with your personal risk-o-meter Risk is the scary part of investing , and there 's no way to avoid it completely . So it 's important to think about how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also important to understand that risk and return go hand-in-hand : often the greater the potential return , the greater the risk . Stocks are on the high end of the risk-o-meter with small company stocks often more volatile than large company stocks and emerging markets stocks more volatile than domestic stocks ; fixed income investments such as bonds are in the middle ; cash investments like CDs are on the low end . <p> Two things will determine how much risk or uncertainty you can handle : your personal feelings and your time frame . If market ups and downs are going to give you a constant upset stomach , you can take a more conservative approach . If you 're able to live with market fluctuations and think long-term , you can be more aggressive . <p> Also look at how long you plan to keep your money invested . The longer your time frame , the longer you have to recoup any short-term losses that might occur with normal market changes . In general , if you 'll need your money in : <p> Three to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50-60 percent in stocks , with the balance in bonds or cash equivalents . <p> Five to 10 years or longerYou can add more stocks to the mix . <p> 3 ) Open the right accounts With your goals in mind , make sure you have the right accounts . In addition to a checking account , you should have : <p> A tax-advantaged retirement account , which could be an employer-sponsored account such as a 401(k) , an IRA , or both . ( At your age , consider a Roth 401(k) or Roth IRA , both of which can provide tax-free withdrawals . ) To me , these types of retirement accounts are the most important because saving for retirement should be a top priority. - And the sooner you start , the less you 'll likely have to put in each year . If you begin now when you 're in your 20s , and save just 10 percent of your income a year for your entire working life , you 're preparing yourself for a comfortable retirement . If you wait until you 're older to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage . <p> A savings or money market accountThis is where to stash your emergency fund and any money you 'll need in the next three years . <p> A taxable brokerage account " This can be appropriate for medium- and long-term goals . <p> 4 ) Start with broad-based investments It 's easy to get hung up on choosing investmentsthere are so many . But fortunately , broad-based mutual funds and exchange-traded funds ( which pool the money of many investors to purchase a variety of securities ) give you a simple way to begin . Funds help you automatically invest in a variety of stocks and bonds so you do n't put all your money in one investment ( which is much riskier than owning several investments ) . Do a bit of research on performance and fees . There are plenty of reliable websites that give details of particular funds and let you comparison shop . You might start with your brokerage company 's website . <p> 5 ) Put things on automatic Once you 're set up , put as much as you can on automaticsavings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fund . The less you have to do , the less overwhelming it will be , and the more likely you are to stick with it . <p> That said , you do want to stay involved . Check your portfolio at least once or twice a year to evaluate performance and to make sure your investments still match your goals and feelings about risk . And try to keep a long-term view . You 're young . You have plenty of time to ride out market swings and reap potential returns . And once you have some money in the market , you may be inspired to learn more . Investing can actually be fun as well as financially rewarding ! <h> Subscribe : 132730 @qwx542730 132750 @qwx542750 <p> ( 0115-0600 ) 132750 @qwx542750 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

@@49276491 @2776491/ <p> It 's smart to understand your potential capital gains tax liability before you put your house on the market . <p> An individual can exclude up $250,000 of profit on a home sale from their taxable income ; a married couple can exclude up to $500,000 . <p> To qualify for these exclusions , the seller must pass the IRS ownership and use tests . 132740 @qwx542740 <p> Two and a half years ago my husband and I moved from a home we had owned and lived in for ten years . At that time we bought a new house and have been renting out the old one . Will we have to pay capital gains if we sell the old house ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Great questionand good you 're asking it now . That 's because , while there are generous exclusions allowed when it comes to capital gains on the sale of a home , timing is crucial and the clock is ticking . <p> Under current laws , if you sell your principal home and make a profit , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that 's just the exclusion for an individual . Married couples can exclude up to $500,000 ( if both spouses each meet the ownership and use tests below ) . So , depending on how much of a profit you make on the sale , you and your husband could potentially have no capital gains tax bill at all . <p> I say ' potentially ' because in order to claim the maximum exclusion , you have to pass what the IRS calls the ownership and use tests . This means : <p> You have to have owned the house for two years . <p> You have to have lived in the house as your principal residence for two out of the last five years , ending on the date of the sale . <p> There are a few exceptions to these rulesfor example , if you had to move before owning the home for two years because of a job change or because you experienced what the IRS designates as an " unforeseen circumstance , " such as a divorce or natural disaster . In these situations the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And interestingly , the two years residency does n't have to be consecutiveyou just have to have lived in your home for a total of 24 months out of the five years prior to the sale . <p> It sounds like you easily pass the ownership test . However , since you 've been out of your prior home for two and a half years , you have only six months left to meet the residency requirement . So there 's no time to lose . Here 's what I suggest to help you determine your potential taxes and maximize your exclusion . <p> Calculate your cost basis To determine capital gains on the sale of your home , you simply subtract your cost basis from the selling price . But what exactly is your cost basis ? It 's not just the purchase price . It also includes certain settlement fees , closing costs and commissions associated with both the purchase and the sale ( excluding escrow amounts related to taxes and insurance , etc.see IRS Publication 523 for more information ) . Add to this the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time for renovations , additions , roofing , landscaping , and other upgrades . All of these improvements will increase your cost basis , and therefore lower your potential tax liability . Hopefully , you 've kept good records because this can add up ! <p> On the other side of the equation , there are a few things that can reduce your cost basis . A lower basis will increase your profit , and potentially your tax . For example , if you have a home office and have claimed depreciation over time , you now have to subtract those deductions from your cost basis . Or if you received tax credits for energy-related improvements , you have to subtract that amount as well . <p> Estimate sale price and capital gains Now estimate your sale price and subtract your cost basis . Let 's say you bought your house for $350,000 , put in $50,000 in improvements and had related fees and costs of another $15,000 , giving you a cost basis of $415,000 . Now let 's say you expect to sell the house for $850,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Factor in exclusion In the above example , if you met both the ownership and use tests , you and your husband could exclude the entire gain from your taxable income . You would n't even have to report the sale on your tax return . However , let 's say your capital gain turned out to be $525,000 . In that case , you 'd have to report the sale and pay long-term capital gains on $25,000 . <p> Act fast ! In your situation , with only six months left to meet the residency requirement , I 'd get your home on the market as soon as possible . The five-year residency period is from the date of purchase to the date of sale . On the bright side , if you successfully sell your old home within the time limit and take the exclusion , you can take it again should you decide to sell your current homeas long as the two sales are more than two years apart . Good luck with your sale . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

But in 2014 the U.S. Tax Court set the record straight . According to this ruling , it is clear that we are limited to one 60-day rollover per 12 months , no matter how many IRAs we may own . A second rollover in the same year could trigger income taxes as well as a 10 percent penalty. - ( Note that this ruling does not apply to trustee-to-trustee transfers , or a transfer between financial institutions. - You can continue to do as many of those as you like . ) <p> Social Security and Medicare changes for betterand worse For retirees , there 's a plus and a potential minus : <p> Social Security benefits increaseThe cost-of-living increase ( COLA ) for 2015 Social Security benefits is 1.7 percent . This will be reflected in your January benefit payment . The monthly maximum benefit at full retirement age has also increased to $2,663 . <p> Medicare Part A deductible goes upOn the downside , the deductible for hospital stays under Medicare Part A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital stays past 60 days have also gone upanother good reason to look into a Medi-Gap policy . Fortunately , the basic premium and deductible for Medicare Part B are unchanged . <p> Small tax changes worth noting Looking ahead , there are some inflation adjusted tax benefits that will apply to tax year 2015 : <p> The standard deduction goes up to $6,300 for singles ; $12,600 for married filing jointly . <p> The personal exemption also increases to $4,000 , subject to a phase-out that begins with adjusted gross incomes of $258,250 ( $309,900 for married filing jointly ) . It phases out completely at $380,750 ( $432,400 for married filing jointly . ) <p> The estate tax exclusion rises to $5.43 million ( from $5.34 million ) . However , the gift tax exclusion stays at $14,000 . <p> There are also minor adjustments to the Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT ) exemption , the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , and limits on contributions to flex spending accounts .

I 've been luckier than most of my friends and have a full-time job , but I 'm wondering whether I should pay off my loans before I start saving for retirement . What do you think ? - <p> A Reader <p> Dear Reader , - <p> This is a great question and absolutely timely . With total student loan debt now topping 1 trillion dollars , there 's a lot of concern about how this debt is preventing young people from buying a home , saving for retirement , or starting their own families . Paying off student loans is , in effect , keeping young adults from investing in their futures . It 's bad for themand bad for the economy as a whole . <p> But it does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prioritize . Youand every graduate who 's struggling with debtcan make choices on how to pay down your loans that will help balance past obligations and future goals . <p> Obviously , you have to pay at least the minimum on your student loans and never miss a payment . But beyond that , you can create a system to stay on top of your loans while at the same time contributing to your financial future . <p> Understand the difference between ' good ' debt and ' bad ' debt The first thing is to realize that not all debt is equal . Some of it can actually work for you . For instance , debt that 's lower cost , and potentially tax deductible , such as a mortgage or a student loan , falls into the ' good ' debt category . <p> On the other hand , high-cost debt such as credit cards and car loans is definitely in the ' bad ' debt category . It 's the most costly , especially over time . Plus , you 're borrowing to own something that depreciates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new car off the lot . <p> Good debt can actually be a financial tool . Bad debt can be a financial nightmare . So your goal should be to she 'd the bad debt as soon as possible , while systematically paying down the debt that 's working for you . <p> Strike a balance between debt payment and saving From my point of view , your top saving priority should be retirement . So once you 've accounted for the minimum payments on your student loans , here 's how I suggest you prioritize your savings and payments : <p> 1 . Contribute enough to your company retirement plan to take full advantage of your employer match . This puts extra money in your pocket . <p> 2 . If you have a credit card balance or a car loan , focus on paying those down next , starting with the highest interest . <p> 4 . Save more for retirement . The good news is that because you 're starting in your twenties , you should be in good shape for retirement if you can save 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who postpone starting to save for retirement have to increase this percentage . ) <p> To me , these first four points are important for everyone . Once you have a handle on them , you can tackle the following goals according to your personal preference . <p> These final four savings priorities will vary in importance as your life changes . The main thing is that you keep saving even while you 're paying down your student debt . <p> Understand the difference between saving and investing As you look ahead , it 's also essential to understand that saving for the future and investing for the future are two different things . Saving means putting your money in a safe place , for example in a federally insured bank account . You wo n't get a big return , but when it comes to your emergency fund or any other money that you know you will need in the next three to five years , safety is paramount . <p> When you 're preparing for a goal that is many years out ( such as retirement ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stock market so that you have the potential to outpace inflation . Do n't hesitate to consult with an investing professional as you build a diversified portfolio . <p> Stay on top of your student loans Do n't get me wrong . It 's great that you 're focusing on paying off your student loans right away . As you figure out your other savings and payment priorities , you 'll want to continue to keep a sharp eye on them . To make it easier , organize your loan documents so that you always know the amount owed , interest rate , term of the loan , minimum monthly payment , and repayment date . A simple spreadsheet should do the trick . <p> Make it all automatic Finally , put as much as you can on auto-paymonthly bills , including student loan payments , and your savings . Your 401(k) contributions automatically come out of your paycheck , but do n't stop there . You can set up automatic transfers from your checking to your other savings accounts as well . Once you have money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brokerage account to start building a diversified portfolio . <p> I give you a lot of credit for taking your student loans seriously , and for thinking about retirement this early .

How can we avoid this ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Great question , and one that has as much to do with your values as a couple as it does with your finances . Financial equality in a marriage does n't always mean that you contribute the same amount of money , but it does mean that you respect each other and choose to work as a team , no matter who 's on first financially . <p> During the course of a marriage , it 's very likely that at any given time , one person will make more money than the otherand that you 'll trade off being the primary breadwinner . For instance , you may have limited income while you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much higher salary down the road . <p> You and your husband are wise to be thinking about this before you start grad school and get swept up in your new responsibilities . Money issues are notorious for causing problems in a marriage , so it 's best to discuss any concerns that either of you have in advance . While you 're worried about feeling dependent , your husband may have his own worries about picking up the slack . Once you put these things on the table , it will be easier to come up with a plan that will work for you nowand hopefully be a blueprint for the future , as well . Agree on some general principalsBefore you get into the specifics , I 'd sit down together and make sure you agree on a couple of important points .

This will help you focus on your budget . <p> Determine a set amount you can save each month , both for an emergency fund and ideally for retirement contributions . <p> Agree on how much you 'll each have to spend ( it probably should be equal ) on personal things like clothes , gym memberships , lunches , coffeewhatever you decide . <p> Spend the balance as a couple for dinners out , vacations , etc . <p> Now this is just one straightforward way to specifically handle monthly income and expenses . Some couples might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the higher earner covering a correspondingly higher percentage of the bills . But you get the idea . The goal is to cover the basics , save a bit for the future , and still have a certain amount of personal money that you can each spend with no strings attachedand no concern about who 's making the bigger salary . <p> Check in with each other oftenWhatever approach you choose , realize that this new financial arrangement may feel uncomfortable at first . See how it works for a couple of months , and do n't be afraid to bring up any issues . You can always make changes . The last thing you want is for you to feel guilty about spending money or your husband to feel resentful that he 's bearing the bigger financial burden . <p> While you 're discussing your present situation , do n't forget about the future .

How can I figure out if any of them are worth it ? - " A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> You 're absolutely right that credit card sales pitches are everywhere . Whether in the mailbox or online , none of us can escape the constant barrage of offers and incentives . From a marketing perspective , that makes a lot of sense . Credit cards are increasingly a part of everyday life and , according to creditcards.com ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bureau ) , the average credit card debt per U.S. adult credit card user is $5,284 . Companies know we not only fall for their pitches " we also rack up the debt . <p> Do n't get me wrong . I 'm in favor of using credit cards wisely " they certainly make life a lot easier . But I also always urge caution . Not only can credit cards cost you extra money in terms of fees , interest , or a damaged credit score , they can make it more difficult to spend mindfully and they can also increase your financial risk by encouraging you to carry more debt . <p> Just to set some context , credit card offers generally fall into one of three categories : 1 ) those that feature a balance transfer or low interest rate , designed for people who are working to get out of debt or who carry a balance month to month ; 2 ) secured cards for people who do n't have a credit history or are rebuilding their credit ; and 3 ) reward cards that offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash back. - <p> Increasingly , the types of offers that you 're referring to are for the last category , reward cards , designed for people with disposable income and a strong credit rating . As you review your options , here are a few things to think about : <p> 1 . Look at what a card will cost you " An initial low interest rate , cash back , bonus points or miles may be desirable , but also think about annual fees , foreign transaction fees , late fees and penalties . Some cards with great sounding benefits charge a whopping annual fee . If a travel card charges foreign transaction fees and you travel outside the U.S. , it can really add to your bill . If you always pay your bill on time , late fees may not seem important , but it 's wise to consider all the potential costs . <p> 2 . Decide which reward is the most valuable for your situation " Cash back can be great and easy to understand as a benefit . Travel points or miles can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of reward is best for your lifestyle ? Once you decide that , get into the details . For instance , if you 're looking at cash-back offers , do n't just focus on the percentage back . Look at the percentage on specific types of purchases " gas , groceries , general " and how that fits with your spending . <p> Travel cards also vary in how points are accumulated and redeemed . Some offer statement credits ; others give you miles to apply to future trips . Some even include travel insurance , entry into exclusive airport lounges , or hotel upgrades. - It all can sound alluring , but you have to think practically about how often you 'll actually use the benefits . <p> 3 . Read the fine print " None of us like to do it , but here 's where you really need to pay attention " especially when it comes to introductory offers . That teaser rate may be great for a few months , but be sure you know when and how it will increase . There may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be after that ? The point is that the great sounding offer may not be so great once you dig a little deeper . <p> 4 . Limit the number of cards you have " and use " There 's nothing wrong with having a couple of cards with different perks . For example , in order to capture the maximum rewards , you might use one for everyday purchases like gas and groceries and another for travel . Or for security reasons , it can be prudent to reserve one card for online purchases. - The potential problems come when you have too many cards . <p> First , you have to be able to manage your cards wisely so you do n't end up overspending and struggling to make payments . Second , you have to think of your credit score . Opening too many accounts in a short period of time can be a red flag to the credit bureaus . Also , you have to be careful with how much credit you use . If your balance is more than 30 percent of your available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower your score . <p> 5 . Do n't give in to store incentives " While 10 percent off a purchase may sound good at the time , to me , opening a store card just to get a one-time discount is usually a bad idea . Chances are you wo n't use the card that often and there 's no long-term benefit . Plus , if you open the account impulsively at the counter when you 're checking out , you 're definitely not looking at the fine print . <p> 6 . Do a little online comparison-shopping " Once you have an idea of the type of card that suits your needs , comparison shop . There are a number of websites that help you compare credit card offers and details . Creditcard.com or nerdwallet.com could be a good place to start . <p> 7 . Consider your own financial goals " How you use credit should be part of your overall financial plan .

No matter how many cards you have , make a commitment to charge only what you can pay off each month . And remember , that while one industry rule of thumb states that your overall debt should never exceed 36% of your gross income and consumer debt should be less than 20% of your net income , the best rule for how much credit card debt you should regularly carry is 0% . <p> Finally , it 's a good idea to check your credit report before you apply for any new cards . You can check your credit report from the major rating agencies ( **27;27;TOOLONG ) for free every 12 months at annualcreditreport.com . <p> Having a higher score can be helpful in getting a better deal .

@@49276511 @2776511/ <h> Does It Make Sense to Pay Off Your Mortgage ? <h> Key Points <p> The decision to pay off your mortgage before you retire involves a balance of practicality and psychology . <p> Doing the math on your mortgage is the first step . <p> Factors such as cash needs and tax deductibility need to be weighed against the peace of mind of being debt-free. 132740 @qwx542740 <p> I 'm 65 and about to retire and I still have a mortgage balance of $100,000 at 4 percent . My investment portfolio and retirement savings are about $1 million . Should I pay off my mortgage before I retire ? 132745 @qwx542745 <p> - 132741 @qwx542741 <p> On the surface , the answer to your question might appear to be a simple calculation . But while your mortgage math is a big part of your decision , there are a few other things to consider including your retirement budget , your taxes and your mindset . <p> Let 's start with the math . <h> Consider the real cost of your mortgage <p> You say your current mortgage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's even lower once you factor in the tax deductibility . Let 's assume you 're in the 30 percent tax bracket and your mortgage interest is fully deductible . In this instance , a 4 percent mortgage is really only costing you about 2.8 percent . <h> Factor in future investing opportunity vs. risk <p> How much your mortgage is costing you is only one side of the equation . On the other side is your investment style and attitude about risk . If you 're on the conservative side ( and even if you 're not , as you move into retirement you may want to invest a little more conservatively ) , paying off your mortgage would be equivalent to a risk-free 2.8 percent return . With interest rates as low as they are on fixed income investments such as CDs , that 's not bad . If you 're happy with that return , it could make sense to pay off the mortgage . <p> But if you think that you can earn more than 2.8 percent from another investment " and you 're comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the mortgage and continue to invest that $100,000 elsewhere . So think about your comfort level . Would you prefer to invest your money in potentially higher-yielding investments or take the safer route ? <h> Determine your retirement cash needs <p> A $1 million portfolio is sizeable , but whether or not it will cover your income needs in retirement depends on your lifestyle . With a $1 million portfolio , you could comfortably withdraw around $40,000 a year . If you reduce your portfolio by $100,000 , you 'd want to reduce your portfolio withdrawal proportionately as well . <p> So you need to figure out your retirement budget and whether or not your combination of income sources such as Social Security or a pension as well as your portfolio will meet your needs . On the other hand , if you maintain your monthly mortgage payment , how big of a chunk will that take out of your available monthly cash ? <h> Evaluate your tax situation <p> Home mortgage debt remains one of the few sources of tax-deductible interest expense left to individuals who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say you can deduct the interest expense on up to $1 million ( $500,000 for married filing separately ) of home-secured debt used to purchase or make capital improvements on your qualified principal and/or second residence . <p> You can also deduct the interest expense on up to $100,000 ( $50,000 for married filing separately ) of home equity debt secured by your home , whether in the form of a regular loan or revolving line of credit . Once you 've paid off the original mortgage , you 'll be limited to the $100,000 home equity debt ceiling unless you make capital improvements or buy another home . <p> Because your current mortgage balance is $100,000 , this may not be important to you . Also , if you have fewer than 10 years left on your mortgage , more of your payment is likely going toward principle than interest , so tax deductibility may not be a real concern . <h> Think about your peace of mind <p> For some folks , a strong desire to be debt-free overrides other considerations . There 's an emotional security in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be especially true for those who are near or in retirement . If that 's the case for you , all other concerns may take a back seat . So you need to weigh the psychological value of having more money in the bank ( or in your portfolio ) versus being mortgage-free . <p> As you can see , there is n't one right answer to your question . It 's more a matter of the right balance for you . If the time you have left on your mortgage is short , if the tax deduction is not significant , and if you 're secure in the amount you 've saved for retirement and less concerned about future investing opportunities , you may very well benefit from paying off your mortgage .

Or add the $5K a year to a new Roth IRA ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> As tax advantaged retirement savings accounts , both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA have their advantages . The first gives you tax benefits upfront , the second tax savings down the road . For young people just starting out who will most likely be in a higher tax bracket later on , a Roth IRA may be the best choice . For those in their peak earning years , who can benefit more from the tax break now , a traditional IRA likely makes more sense ( and may be the only option ) . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IRAs working for them is the ideal . That 's because having both a traditional and a Roth IRA can be a good way to help control your income tax bill when it comes time to make withdrawals . So I 'm glad you asked this question , because it opens the door to looking at a Roth not only as a way to save for retirement but also as a part of your retirement tax strategy . But before you think about long-term tax planning , you first have to determine if you qualify for a Roth now . <p> Deciding if a Roth IRA is right for you A Roth IRA is attractive for a number of reasons . Earnings grow tax-free ; you do n't pay income taxes on qualified withdrawals ; and because contributions are made with after-tax money , you can withdraw them at any time without paying taxes or penalties . But no matter how good it sounds , a Roth does n't fit the bill for everyone . <p> The first consideration is the income limitation . While income restrictions were lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRAs remain . If you 're single , your ability to contribute to a Roth IRA for tax year 2010 phases out between $105,000 and $120,000 of income and for married filing jointly , between $167,000 and $177,000 . <p> You also want to consider your tax bracket now and in the future . If you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire , a Roth makes sense because , while contributions are n't tax deductible , qualified withdrawals are tax-free . If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket when you retire , and it 's more important to get the upfront tax deduction now rather than the tax-free withdrawal later , contributing to your traditional IRA may be the better choice . <p> Using a Roth as part of your retirement tax strategy If you qualify for a Roth , opening one now to complement your traditional IRA can make good tax sense come retirement time . Having both types of IRAs allows you to strategically balance your yearly withdrawals to help control your tax liability . For instance , you could plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain amount , and then switch to taking tax-free distributions from your Roth to avoid bumping yourself into a higher tax bracket . <p> Another strategic plus is that there is no required minimum distribution ( RMD ) for a Roth at age 70+ . This allows you to keep your Roth IRA money growing even while you take RMDs from your traditional IRA . A Roth may also fit into your estate planning strategy , since inherited Roth assets are tax-free to your heirs . <p> Expanding your options You say you 've rolled over a couple of 401(k)s , but you do n't say if you 're still able to contribute to an employer 's plan . If you are , keep contributing as much as you can and take advantage of any employer match . The IRS allows you to contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA at the same time , although your IRA contribution will not be tax-deductible if you or your spouse is an active participant in a retirement plan at work and you earn over the limit . Along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Roth 401(k) and let you split your contributions between them . So check into all your options . And do n't forget to up your IRA contribution to the maximum ( currently $6,000 ) when you turn 50 . <p> There 's no telling what future tax rates and tax laws will be , so it 's wise to maximize your opportunities to increase your retirement savings nowas well as strategize for tax savings in the future .

Are there other options for using this money ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> One of the greatand challengingthings about having kids is that they can surprise you at every turn . While you can save diligently for their education , you ca n't predict what their talents or interests will be . Trust me " as a mother of three , I know from experience ! <p> I think many of us envision a four-year college for our kids , but that 's only one of a myriad of choices , especially today . So does that mean a 529 account is no longer a good idea ? Absolutely not . Because while a 529 is often- called a college savings account , it probably should more accurately be called a post-secondary education savings account . That 's because the good news is that a 529 can be used for other types of education besides college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't realize that 529 assets can be used at any eligible institution of higher education . That includes not only four-year colleges and universities , but also qualifying two-year associate degree programs , trade schools and vocational schoolsboth at home and abroad . This means that whether your child wants to be a computer expert or cosmetologist , an artist or an electricianand chooses to pursue post-secondary training in his or her chosen fieldthere 's a good chance you can pay for that training with your 529 assets . <p> If your son has another type of school in mind , find out if it qualifies for 529 assets . Generally speaking , to qualify , a school must be eligible to participate in student aid programs offered by the Department of Education . Savingforcollege.com has an easy online tool for determining if a particular school qualifies . You just need to take the time to do a little researchor better yet , have your son do it . <p> If post-secondary education is n't in the cards Even if your son 's path does n't include any type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 529 for the benefit of your son , but the account belongs to you and you have the right to change the beneficiary . <p> As long as the new beneficiary is a family membera sibling , first cousin , grandparent , aunt , uncle or even yourselfthe money can be used for qualified education expenses without incurring income taxes or penalties . Qualified expenses include tuition , required fees , books , supplies , computer-related expenses , even room and board for someone who is at least a half-time student . <p> Most 529 plans allow you to change the beneficiary once a year , so that leaves the door wide open for future use . You could even convert it back to your son 's benefit should his plans change . <p> This flexibility gives you a lot of options . Let 's say you decide to go back to school . You make yourself the beneficiary and use 50% of the 529 assets for your studies . What do you do with the balance ? You could simply change the beneficiary to another member of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses . <p> The problem with taking the cash Taking the cash is always a possibility , but it will cost you . If assets in a 529 are used for something other than qualified education expenses , you 'll have to pay both income taxes and a 10% penalty on the earnings . ( An interesting side note is that if the beneficiary gets a full scholarship to college , the penalty for taking the cash is waived . ) <p> Since one of the main benefits of a 529 account is the tax-free earnings , I 'd think carefully before cashing it out . And really , it might be wise to sit tight before making any decisions . Your son may surprise you again by going in a whole new direction and you 'll be glad you 've kept those 529 assets in reserve . <h> Subscribe : 132730 @qwx542730 <p> Important Disclosure : Before opening and investing in a 529 plan , carefully consider the information contained in the 529 's official statement , including investment objectives , risks , charges , and expenses .

How do I qualify for Social Security disability benefits ? <p> A Reader . 132741 @qwx542741 <p> I wish there was a quick and easy answer to your question , but unfortunately there 's nothing quick and easy about Social Security disability benefits ( SSDI ) . There are a lot of rules and regulations regarding these benefits , and it 's tough to qualify for them . In fact , most applications are denied . For instance , according to recent SSA statistics , in the third quarter of 2015 less than 32 percent of applications were approved . <p> I do n't mean to sound discouraging , just realistic . Because while it appears that you do meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full retirement age and you have a medical condition that is expected to last at least one yearthe application and screening process is generally arduous and slow . <p> I can walk you through the basics so you 'll have some information to draw on as you start the process . <p> Basic SSDI qualifications As I said , there are very specific regulations around disability benefits , and qualifications are strict . To qualify : <p> You must be younger than your full retirement age ( FRA ) . <p> You need to have accrued enough Social Security work credits to pass two earnings tests : the " recent-work test " and the " duration-of-work " test . The credit requirement is a sliding scale , based on your age ( fewer years the younger you are ) . At age 60 you must have had Social Security-covered employment for five out of the last ten years . You also must have worked at Social Security-covered employment for a total of at least 9+ years . <p> Your medical condition must be so severe that you are incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or until death . <p> You ca n't earn more than a minimal amount of money ( $1,090 per month in 2015 ; $1,820 per month if you 're blind ) . However , there 's no limit on the amount of assets or unearned income you have or how much income your spouse has . <p> There are certain medical conditions that automatically define you as disabled . The SSA maintains a list that you can get at **29;56;TOOLONG . If your condition is on this list , the application process may be a bit faster . It 's worth checking into . <p> How benefits are determined If you qualify , your benefit is based on your average lifetime earnings . Generally you 'll receive the same amount that you would receive from Social Security at your FRA . The maximum SSDI monthly benefit for 2015 is $2,663 . The average monthly benefit is $1,165 . <p> It 's important to realize that once you reach your FRA , SSDI benefits are automatically switched to your Social Security retirement benefit . You do n't receive both . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , for instance if you receive other state or federal benefits such as worker 's compensation . Once again , it 's complicated . <p> As a side note , you get automatic Medicare coverage after you 've received SSDI benefits for two years , regardless of your age . <p> Family benefits On the bright side , your family members may also be able to collect benefits based on your disability once you qualifyup to 50 percent of your basic benefit subject to a " family maximum " of between 150 and 180 percent of your benefit . <p> These family members include : <p> Your spouse age 62 or older provided you were married at least one year . <p> Your spouse at any age if he or she is caring for your child who is age 16 or younger , or disabled . <p> Your unmarried children under age 18 . <p> Your children under age 19 if full-time students ( through high school ) , or disabled . <p> Severely disabled children over age 18 . <p> Similar to spouses , ex-spouses also can collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married at least 10 years , or at any age if caring for your child who is 16 or younger , or disabled . <p> The application process You 'll have to compile a library of information about yourself , your work history , and your medical condition , and complete numerous forms . The more thorough and accurate you are from the start , the more likely you are to speed up the process . <p> If your claim is approved , your first check will cover the sixth full month after your disability began . If your claim is n't approved ( and most claims are n't ) , you can appeal the decisionbut you have to do so within sixty days . A bit of good news here is that you have a better chance of being approved on appeal than you had on the first go-round . <p> The SSA states that an application for disability benefits can take three to five months , so if you believe you qualify , do n't delay .

@@49276523 @2776523/ <p> I 've tried to save for my daughter 's college , but have fallen far short . We 're considering student loans , but I worry about having her get in over her head . Are loans a good idea ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> I wish more potential borrowers would ask this question before signing up for a student loan . While student loans are a necessary fact of life for most college students ( almost two-thirds borrowed money for college in 2013 according to a study by the Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress ) they can also lead to a great deal of financial trouble later on if not handled wisely . <p> Because they 're relatively easy to apply for with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ) , many student borrowers do n't realize the very real responsibility they have to pay these loans back in a timely fashionor the equally real repercussions that can go on for years if they do n't . <p> There 's a lot to consider before either of you takes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment realities if you do . <p> What to think about before taking on a student loan Just because your daughter may qualify for a loan does n't mean it 's necessarily the rightor the onlysolution for her . Start by doing some homework together . <p> Figure out a realistic loan amount . First , look at the alternatives to a loan . What will your savings cover ? Can she work part-time ? Has she applied for all possible grants or scholarships ? Plan to borrow the minimum she can get by on because the real question is how much she 'll be able to afford to pay back once she graduates . Not every degree leads to a lucrative career and not all schools offer the same " bang for the buck . " Have her do some research on tuition costs and on average salaries in her field of study . A good rule of thumb is to limit the debt to the amount she can reasonably earn in her first year of work . <p> Discuss federal vs. private loans . While both are options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally lower and repayment options more flexible . <p> Decide who will take out the loan . This can be tricky . If the loans are solely in your daughter 's name , she 's the one who is legally responsible for repaying them . You could , of course , offer to help . You could also co-sign the loans . However , if you do , you 're equally responsible for repayment , and a default would affect your own credit rating . There are also federal Parent Plus Loans that allow parents to borrow , although at a higher interest rate than federal student loans . <p> Understand the terms of the loan . Loans vary . Compare basic interest rates and how interest accrues , as well as repayment requirements , grace periods ( time before you have to start repaying ) , and debt forgiveness programs . <p> Check out websites such as finaid.org and studentaid.ed.gov for more specific information on types of loans . Then talk to the financial aid office at the school your daughter hopes to attend . Be sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to approach debt responsibly is an important part of her financial education . <p> Repayment realities to keep top of mind Even the most responsible borrowers can find themselves in a bind if their post-college employment plans do n't work out . A recent report1 by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that over seven million borrowers are in default on student loans . Here are some things your daughter can do to make sure she does n't join this group : <p> Stay on top of the loans . Keep all loan documents organized so that she always knows the amount owed , interest rate , term of the loan , minimum monthly payment , and the repayment start date . <p> Explore repayment options . Federal loans have more repayment alternatives than private loans , including graduated repayments , income-based repayments and public service loan forgiveness . Figure out which is the best choice before payments are due . Consider consolidating loans to possibly lower interest rates and monthly payments . <p> Never miss a payment . At least pay the minimum on each loan every month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries , including high penalties , growing debt , garnishment of wages , and a dismal credit rating that can take years to repair . <p> The main thing to remember is that , while student loans can be a wonderful tool for opening up future opportunities , they must be repaid whether or not those opportunities become high-paying realities . You and your daughter should carefully evaluate the possible problems , as well as her career potential before either of you signs up . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

So to keep moving forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of a comprehensive financial plan . <h> Why a financial plan makes sense <p> First , a financial plan is about developing a realistic and informed perspective on how you can put all of your financial resources to their best use .

This can be an excellent opportunity for you and your wife to step back , rethink and agree on what 's most important to you . <p> Second , a successful financial plan is holistic . It looks at all the interrelated parts of your financial life " income , expenses , investments , retirement planning , the role of insurance in risk management , income tax liability , estate planning needs and desires " to make sure they 're all coordinated . This is essential because if you do n't have a handle on how much money is coming in and going out every month , it 's next to impossible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a savings plan , you wo n't be able to manage your most important goals like buying that bigger home , paying for your children 's education , or funding a comfortable retirement .

Otherwise , your experience remains an academic exercise : interesting , perhaps , but not that useful . The goal of a financial plan , after all , is to make your goals a reality . <h> What a financial plan includes <p> A comprehensive financial plan can have many parts , including : <p> A personal net worth statement " a snapshot of what you own and what you owe. - This will help you know exactly where you stand , and also give you a benchmark against which you can measure your progress . <p> A cash flow analysis " so you can see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the foundation for your budget ( including identifying what 's fixed and what 's discretionary ) and can also help you get a handle on your debt . <p> A retirement plan " specifying how much you need to save each year .

By gathering your information , evaluating your financial status , and developing and helping you implement specific recommendations , a financial planner can help your get your financial life on track . - <h> What you can expect <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to keep all the pieces on track as you progress from your initial consultation to eventual implementation and follow-up .

At this point it 's important to ask lots of questions so that you 'll understand exactly what you can expect in terms of deliverables , cost , and time frame . <p> Information gathering and goal setting . Once you 've set the ground rules , your financial planner will start the process of obtaining a full understanding of your resources , obligations , and expectations . At the same time , your planner will delve into your goals , time horizon and risk tolerance . This is your chance to make your wishes clear so that your plan will truly reflect your values and priorities . <p> Evaluation of your financial status and creation of a strategy .

Nothing is cast in stone at this point ; your goal is to understand your options and make choices . <p> Now it 's time to put your plan into motion as you select the best products and accounts to meet your goals ( for example , you will be able to examine the benefits of a Roth vs. traditional IRA , a custodial account vs. a 529 account for college savings , or even term vs. whole life insurance ) . At this point you might begin to work with other professionals including an accountant , attorney , or insurance agent. - <p> Last but not least , it is essential that you and your planner continue to monitor your progress and make adjustments as your goals , priorities , and time frame evolve . <h> Working with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER - professional <p> There are many types of financial planners , but I recommend working with a Certified Financial Planner - professional .

But to those who doubt the effectiveness of financial education programs , I 'd like to point to a couple that show just how life-changing financial education can be : - <p> A recent study of more than 1,600 teens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Schwab and the Boys and Girls Club of America ( BCGA ) showed an 82 percent improvement in saving , a 33 percent improvement in budgeting , and a 46 percent improvement in managing credit and debt. - <p> Key findings from the Finances 50+ program co-founded by Schwab and the AARP Foundation showed that participants had a 25 percent increase in financial confidence . Results included an overall improvement in savings and debt management , with 33 percent fewer participants spending more than their income , and 47 percent of participants reducing debt . <p> Another interesting educational program at Dartmouth College that provided new hires a step-by-step guide plus informational videos about enrolling in the College 's retirement plan saw an immediate increase in plan participation. - <p> - <p> Of course not every program is going to have dramatic results . But my point is that when the information is provided in a relevant way , a certain percentage of people will learn and take steps to improve their financial lives . To me , that 's worth the effort . <p> - <h> What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some skin in the game . So since we all deal with money , I encourage everyone to help create financial education opportunities in their own lives and to take advantage of the ones that already exist. - <p> - <p> As a parent , give your kids financial responsibilities early on . Whether it 's through an allowance or a part-time job , make sure they have some money of their own to manage and are accountable for certain spending and saving decisions . Also reach out to your kids ' schools to see how you can get financial literacy classes added to the curriculum. - <p> - <p> As a teacher , even if it 's not part of your formal curriculum ( only 17 states require a class in personal finance to graduate ) , incorporate financial ideas into your lessons as a way to bring math to life . Young kids often have a natural interest in learning to save and spend so the numbers fit in naturally . You can talk to middle schoolers about wants versus needs , and demonstrate the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basics of investing will pique a high school student 's interest " and provide valuable tools for success in real life. - <p> - <p> As an employer , explore ways to bring financial education into the workplace , especially around retirement saving decisions . As an employee , go to your HR department and make sure you know what your retirement plan options are . Do n't be intimidated by what you do n't understand ; ask questions . <p> - <p> As an individual , look to your community . Many banks and other financial institutions have financial education programs . And do n't hesitate to be your own advocate . There are a number of- online tools- and- calculators- that can help you . Before you make a financial decision- or- enter into a contract like a mortgage , do your research . Get the facts .

Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you help plant the seeds of financial education awareness , you 'll reap the benefits .

But the answer is anything but , thanks to the complex web of rules and regulations surrounding the whole range of retirement investment options . Still , it 's an important question , because the need to build capital for retirement is the most critical financial challenge for most Americans " regardless of their age . <p> Despite its complexity , the tax code can help you . So you owe it to yourself to take full advantage of what 's available . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> What 's tax deductible <p> Anyone with earned income ( i.e. , wages or self-employment income ) can open an IRA and contribute to it annually based on certain maximums and income limits , which I 'll discuss . But whether those contributions are deductible depends on two things : 1 ) whether you ( or your spouse ) participate in a company retirement plan ; and 2 ) your income level . <p> There are essentially three scenarios : <p> If you ( and your spouse ) are not active participants in a qualified workplace retirement plan such as a 401(k) , 403(b) or a traditional defined benefit plan , in both 2015 and 2016 at age 55 you can deduct annual IRA contributions of up to $6,500 . That figure includes the basic maximum of $5,500 for people under 50 , PLUS a " catch-up " contribution of a $1,000 for those 50 and over . <p> If you are an active participant in a company-sponsored plan , then an IRA is deductible only if your income is below certain thresholds : - in both 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayers ; $98,000 to $118,000 for married filing jointly ; $0 to $10,000 if you 're married filing separately . Deductibility is phased out between those limits . <p> If your spouse is an active participant in a plan but you 're not , for your 2015 return you can contribute and deduct the full $6,500 if your income is below $183,000 . Deductibility gets phased out between $183,000 and $193,000 . ( These numbers change to $184,000 and $194,000 for 2016 . ) <p> Even if you ( or your spouse ) do n't have any earned income , either of you may be able to contribute to what is known as a spousal IRA " provided the other spouse has sufficient earned income . Contributions limits are the same as any other IRA . That contribution may also be tax-deductible , again depending on the above scenarios . <h> Definition of " active participant " <p> It may seem obvious that if you 're contributing to a 401(k) plan , you 're an " active participant . " But there 's a bit of nuance that you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through payroll deductions , you might be an active participant according to IRS rules . <p> For instance , if your company has a traditional pension plan , you are probably considered an active participant as long as you 're eligible " even if no contributions are being made at the moment . If you 're unsure where you stand , check with your human resources department . <h> Two steps to maximize financial security <p> The first step is to determine your status in terms of what you can contribute and what 's tax deductible for you . <p> Step two is to put as much as you can into the right vehicle . A 401(k) plan has much higher annual contribution limits than an IRA , in both 2015 and 2016 up to $18,000 plus an additional $6,000 for those over 50 . Since contributions are made with pretax dollars , it 's essentially the same as tax deductibility for an IRA contribution . Contribute the max if you can , but at the very least , contribute enough to get any company match . <p> If neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum to an IRA , including the catch-up contribution . That will shave $6,500 off your income and save you taxes . If you were in the 35 percent tax bracket , you 'd reduce your taxes by $2,275 . <h> Beyond a deductible IRA contribution <p> If you do n't qualify for a deductible IRA contribution , you can still make a non-deductible contribution . But you do have a couple of other options . Alternately , you could : <p> Invest that money in a traditional taxable brokerage account . You give up tax-deferred growth , but in return you 'll be able to take advantage of long-term capital gain rates ( withdrawals from traditional IRAs are taxed at ordinary income rates ) . Plus , taxable accounts are more flexible , with no rules about early withdrawals or minimum distributions . <p> Consider a Roth IRA . Contributions to a Roth IRA are n't tax deductible , but qualified withdrawals of earnings are tax-free ( withdrawals of contributions are tax-free at any time ) . However , there are income limits . For 2015 , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross income ( AGI ) is at or below $116,000 for single filers ; $183,000 for married filing jointly . You can make a partial contribution if your AGI is between $116,000 " $131,000 for singles ; $183,000 " $193,000 for married filing jointly . ( For 2016 , those numbers go up to $117,000 to $132,000 and $184,000 to $194,000 respectively . ) <p> At age 55 , you probably have 5 to 10 years before you retire , so now may be a great time to sit down with a financial advisor who can help you evaluate your needs . But at the very least , take full advantage of the tax code to sock away as much money as possible . Remember , you have until April 15th of the following tax year to make your contribution . <h> Subscribe : 132730 @qwx542730 <p> Tax information is for general purposes only and is not intended to be a substitute for specific individualized tax or legal advice .

@@49276532 @2776532/ <h> Can Money Make You Happy ? Three Things to Think About . <h> Key Points <p> Once you have enough to handle your basic financial obligations , more money wo n't necessarily equate to more happiness . <p> Spending money on experiences seems to make people happier than buying more things . <p> Spending for the benefit of others can also be a source of happiness . 132742 @qwx542742 <p> Although my weekly columns are usually about the everyday practical side of managing money , to me there 's also a philosophical side to money decisions . So every once in a while I think it 's good to take a step back and put money in the larger context of your life . Because while we all like to quantify money concerns " how much or how little we have , what we earn , what we save " there 's also a personal , emotional side to how money affects our lives . <p> This was brought home to me once again as I recently listened to behavioral economist Dan Ariely discuss the relationship between money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " many of Ariely 's colleagues have done extensive studies on the subject " but he made some very clear points that I think are worth exploring . <h> More does n't necessarily mean happier <p> It 's an old theme that money itself does n't buy happiness . You can have all the money in the world and still be miserable . Of course on the flip side , if you 're always struggling to pay the bills , it 's harder to enjoy life . <p> But once the basics are covered and you feel pretty secure in your ability to handle your financial obligations , does accumulating more money make you measurably happier ? In other words , how much is enough ? <p> There 's been a lot of research on the subject . One 2010 Princeton University study suggests that after you reach an income of around $75,000 , more money does n't translate into improved emotional well-being . Other research indicates that our happiness may be more tied to our sense of relative wealth ( having more money than our peers or neighbors ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , just having more money does n't equate to being happier . <p> This does n't in any way mean you should n't have your own financial goals and strive to meet them . It just means being realistic about what effect the added zeros on your paycheck or your bank account will actually have on your life . <h> How you spend is more important than how much you have <p> Behavioral economists make a strong point that spending money on experience is ultimately more rewarding than spending on things . I was talking to a friend about this recently and she shared that her mother never valued traveling because , in her words , " what did you have to show for it ? " My friend 's mother much preferred to spend money on something tangible . <p> But according to Ariely , the happiness we derive from an object such as a new car or new piece of furniture is short-lived . That 's because we quickly become accustomed to the new thing . With an experience such as a great vacation , the pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may actually change the way we think about our life . While the new thing becomes old quickly , we get to relive and reflect on the experience for years to come . <p> To me it comes down to spending according to your values . As I stressed recently in my series of articles on the- Financial Cleanse , it 's not only important to monitor how much you spend , but also how you spend it . I believe that thinking about what you really value " as well as what you can afford " and spending accordingly will make you happiest . <h> Give it away to get it back <p> I 've long been a big believer in philanthropy , whether you give of your money or your time . You may have heard that the concept of prosocial spending " spending money for the benefit of others " brings greater happiness no matter how much or how little you have . A study on giving published by Harvard University makes this point and found that even toddlers were happier when they gave away their treats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending idea and I believe it 's one that we all should incorporate into our own money plans . <p> If you Google " money and happiness , " you 'll find myriad articles and research corroborating these three points . But the bottom line is that while money is a necessary part of our lives , no matter who we are or how much we have , it 's how we think about money , how we spend it and share it that may determine whether or not it makes us happy. - <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

College graduation is a real milestone , but you 're wise to realize that your daughter 's education is n't quite complete . The unfortunate reality is that most young adults have received little instruction about personal finance at the moment they need it most : when entering the workforce and starting " real life . " <p> To help your daughter start out with confidenceand hopefully avoid some very common mistakesI 'd begin with a few basics , both big-picture ideas and some very practical ones . <p> Live within your means This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you can impress on your daughter the importance of budgeting her money ( including some for savings ) , and sticking with a lifestyle she can afford , you 'll be doing her a great service .

An online monthly budget planner can be a great starting point . <p> Plan for retirement Your daughter might think this is jumping the gun , but now is actually the ideal time for her to start saving for retirement . To catch her attention , tell her that if she can start putting away just 10 percent of her income toward this big goal now , she 'll probably never have to increase that percentage . If she 's at a job with a 401(k) , at the very least she should contribute enough to get any company match . Otherwise , a Roth IRA is a smart move . <p> Prepare for the unexpected Urge your daughter to start creating an emergency fund to cover three-to-six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment . Even if she knows that she can count on you to be a safety net , having her own nest egg will give her a greater sense of independence . <p> Have health insurance This is a musteven for the healthiest 20-something . A bad accident or an unforeseen illness could be ruinously expensive ( for both you and her ) . If your daughter can get health insurance through work , perfect . If not , she should be able to stay on your policy as a dependent provided she 's single and under 26 . If she ca n't be covered under your policy and does n't have a job that offers healthcare benefits , shop around and find a high deductible policy . It should be relatively inexpensive for a healthy young person . <p> Start a banking relationship Most college kids have checking accounts with ATM/debit cards attached , so they are familiar with how these work . If your daughter needs a new account , she should look for a no-fee or very low-fee account ( some of the online banks offer debit/ATM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands the rules about overdrafts , particularly the fees associated with them . <p> She should also get a credit card and begin building her credit history . Again , a no-fee , low-interest card is bestbut urge her not to carry a balance unless absolutely necessary . Explain how quickly compound interest adds up . And make sure she reads the fine print to understand interest rates and penalties for late or missed payments . For an extra lesson , a cost-of-debt calculator can be a real eye-opener ! <p> Keep on top of student loans If your daughter has student loans , they can quickly get out of hand if not tackled right away . Help her find out the repayment process and when repayment should begin . Like credit card debt , she should never become delinquent on a payment . Check out studentaid.ed.gov for more information on how best to repay student loans as well as loan forgiveness programs for certain types of work . <p> Learn about investing As your daughter starts to save part of her paycheck , help her become acquainted with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds , mutual funds , and exchange-traded funds ) , the concept of risk vs. reward , and the importance of diversification and asset allocation .

@@49276535 @2776535/ <p> Last week I talked about Giving Tuesday and ways to increase your charitable giving . This week , I 'd like to talk a bit about how to creatively extend that spirit of generosity to friends and family . Giving traditional gifts is fun and I enjoy choosing what I think is ideal for someone . But when possible , I like the idea of wrapping that gift in a package that may have a bigger meaning . So before we all get caught up in the holiday buying frenzy , here are some ideas on how to do just that. - <p> Start with a list As your circle of family and friends grows , it can be a challenge to give meaningfully to everyone . To help you focus on the people to whom you want to be generous , make a list . Put your dearest family members and friends at the top and work down to the others in your life that you want to acknowledge in some way . <p> Think carefully about each recipient . What would be most appreciated ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is n't an issuebut rather about why you think a certain gift will be just right . For some people on your list , a small token will be meaningful . For others , your creative approach to their gift may make the value of it even greater . <p> Wrap up your gift in financial know-how One way to give your gift added meaning is to make your own financial know-how part of the package . Everyone in your lifefrom your youngest child to your parents or grandparentscould likely benefit from your insight and experience with money , investing and personal finance . And there are some creative ways to share that wealth of knowledge . <p> For instance , the perfect sweater might make your teenage daughter momentarily happy , but perhaps attaching it to a clothing allowance that she 'll have to manage would give you the chance to teach her about budgeting , saving and spending wisely . A piggy bank for a younger child could come with a savings account and a trip to your bank to learn about how money grows over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working part-time or a young adult who has recently entered the workforce , how about helping them open a Roth IRA , perhaps with some initial funding from you , and then offering to match their contributions for a time ? You can then help them get started investing for the long-term . That 's a gift that can have a lifetime of value . <p> Even older adults , perhaps your parents , could benefit from your gift of knowledge . If they 're struggling economically and you can help out monetarily in some way , that 's great . But if you can also help them budget more wisely , and make certain they 're making the most of their Social Security and Medicare benefits , that would take your economic support further . Even if they are n't struggling , perhaps you could help them fine-tune their finances or estate plan by offering to help them meet with the appropriate professional . <p> Be generous with your time Giving of your knowledge also involves giving of the time it requires to help a child or parent learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent just on fun . Whether it 's with a friend or family member , arranging a special event togethera dinner , a visit to the museum , a ballgame , a special vacationcan be the most perfect gift of all . If you have the ability to foot the bill , great . If not , sharing the cost as well as the experience can be just as thoughtful . <p> Give a purpose to your monetary gifts A gift of cash , of course , is always appreciated . But earmarking the money for a larger purpose or a long-term goal can be even more significant . <p> For example , opening a savings account or custodial account for a young person is a way to introduce personal finance basics and perhaps initiate an interest in investing . Creating a 529 plan for a child or grandchild is a gift to the parents as well as to the child . Or if kids are already in college , you could offer to make a direct tuition payment to the school . <p> Another idea is to jumpstart the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a computer or a family trip . Or if you know that someone on your list has a cause or charity that is of particular importance , you could make a donation in that person 's name . <p> Make it mutually rewarding So often during the holidays , people worry about over-extending their budgets or they feel bad that they ca n't afford the type of gifts they 'd like to give . But to me , being generous is n't just about money . It 's about being thoughtful and willing to share your time and knowledge as well as your good fortune . By doing so you may find you 're also giving yourself a wonderfully rewarding experience . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

@@49276537 @2776537/ <p> The company I work for has not made any contributions to our 401(k) for over two years . Does it still make sense to stay in this retirement plan ? <p> Ann <p> Dear Ann , <p> I 'm a broken record on the importance of saving for retirement . It 's also no secret that I 'm a big fan of company plans such as 401(k)s , especially when they provide matching contributions . <p> But you ask a great question . Since the employer match is one of the highlights of many plans , does it make sense to contribute if you 're not getting this extra benefit ? <p> In a word , yes . Let 's run through the reasons , and then take a look at your other options as well . <p> 401(k) BenefitsInvesting on autopilot : One of the best features of a 401(k) or 403(b) plan is that it puts saving and investing on autopilot through payroll deduction . It 's the ultimate way to " pay yourself first . " <p> Pretax contributions : The ability to fund your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as an example , if you 're in the 28% tax bracket , a $1,000 investment saves you $280 in taxes ( plus a possible reduction in state income taxes ) . You 'll pay taxes on the money when you take it out , but in the meantime , you 've made a $1,000 investment for just $720definitely worth doing . ( Note though that many companies now also offer a Roth 401(k)in which case you trade the current tax deduction for the ability to withdraw your money tax-free down the road . This can be another great way to save . ) <p> Tax-deferred growth : As I 'm sure you know , you do n't pay taxes on 401(k) investment gains or income until you take the money out ( which you can do legally and without penalty at age 59+ ) . Since you 're not paying taxes on income or growth , all of your savings are working for you until you retire . <p> High contribution limits : Another big plus of the 401(k) plan is that it allows employees to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the 2011 tax year , the maximum contribution is $17,000 , plus an additional $5,500 if you are 50 or older . <p> Consider the Alternatives In other words , a 401(k) is a great way to invest for your future ; a match simply makes it better . But you also should think about the alternatives : <p> Traditional IRA : Anyone with the earned income can contribute up to $5,000 ( $6,000 if you 're at least 50 ) per year to an IRA . Watch out , though , because if you are what the IRS calls an " active participant " in a company-sponsored retirement plan , and your income exceeds certain limits , your contributions may not be tax-deductible . ( In this case , you should instead consider investing in a brokerage account ; see below . ) Regardless , your money will grow tax-free until you start to make withdrawals . You also have the benefit of being able to invest in any publicly traded security . <p> Roth IRA : If your income falls within the limits ( in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for married filing jointly ) and you believe that you will be in a higher income tax bracket when you retire , a Roth IRA can be a great choice . Contributions are made with after-tax dollarsthere 's no upfront tax advantagebut withdrawals after age 59+ are tax-free provided your money has been invested for at least five years . The contribution limits are the same as those for a traditional IRA , so you may view this as a supplement , rather than an alternative , to your 401(k) . <p> Brokerage Account : If your income precludes you from investing in a tax-deductible IRA , a traditional brokerage account can be a good alternative . Your contributions are n't tax-deductible , but you will have the advantage of withdrawing funds held more than a year at the long-term capital gains rate ( currently 15% ) instead of the ordinary income tax rate . <p> What to make of all this ? There is no doubt that a 401(k) company match is one of the best deals out there . Never , ever walk away from it . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resume some level of matching contributions . But in the meantime , keep saving for retirementand do n't give up on your company plan .

Just when we thought we could put the worries of 2008 and its aftermath behind us , market volatility once again has individual investors spooked and wondering what to do . While every investor knows that risk comes with the territory , the recent wild gyrations are enough to make even the hardiest investors question their approach . <p> So it comes as no surprise that I 'm getting a lot of questions about how to protect a portfolio . People understandably want to know if the standard thinking has changed , and if so , how . The good news is that even though some points of execution have been fine-tuned , the fundamental principles of asset allocation and diversification remain the best ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asset allocation and diversification still best for risk control Asset allocation and diversification seem pretty similar and a lot of folks confuse the two , but they 're actually quite different . The key to creating a lower-risk portfolio is to understand that difference and how the two work together . <p> Asset allocation is the way you divide your money among stocks , bonds , cash and other investments . This division into the various asset classes should be based on how much risk you 're willing to take and how soon you 'll need your money . Stocks carry the highest risk , cash the lowest , and bonds/fixed income are somewhere in between . Any money you 'll need within the next three to five years should be kept in lower risk investments . <p> The use of asset allocation as a way to manage risk was first introduced in the 1950s as Modern Portfolio Theory . This theory basically proposed that rather than judging risk by looking at an individual investment , you need to look at how all the investments in your portfolio work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to market conditions " those described as having a low correlation to each otheran investor could reduce overall risk . <p> Diversification takes this a step further . It spreads your money around different types of investments within each asset class . For instance , instead of one stock or bond , ideally you would have many of each . Dividing even further , you want to have different types of stocks , such as large cap , small cap and international . And within those divisions , it may be best to have stocks in different sectors ( i.e. , technology , healthcare , telecommunications ) and different industries within the sectors . Your ultimate goal is to find investments that do n't move in lock-step with one another . That way , when one investment goes through a rough patch , another will hopefully compensate . <p> You might say that asset allocation lays the foundation for the structure of your portfolio , and diversification fills it in . With the two working together , you have greater exposure to investments that ideally will perform differently under various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance your risk . <p> Adapting to changing market realities But we live in a far from ideal world . Since the 2008 financial crisis , there 's been a much higher correlation between asset classes . Anticipated returns from stocks and bonds are both lower . Globalization has meant that markets are more susceptible to external shocksnot only financial but also political and environmental . And investors are more wary . As a result , updated portfolio advice , while still built upon asset allocation and diversification , focuses more on downside risk with the goal of giving you the greatest return for the least risk . This means that there are some further refinements that today 's investor needs to consider . <p> Finding your target asset mix As I mentioned before , the appropriate basic mix of asset classes depends on your feelings about risk and how long you plan to keep your money in the market . Traditionally , an aggressive investor with a long time horizon and a high risk tolerance might have as much as 90 percent of a portfolio in stocks with 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds and cash ; a conservative investor could pare that back to 20 percent stocks and 80 percent bonds and cash . Of course , the more aggressive the portfolio , the greater the risk . <p> Those broad categories still hold , but what 's evolved is the fine-tuning possible within them . Individual investors now have access to what are considered " non-traditional " asset classes that can offer even greater diversification . These include things like real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) , commodities ( i.e. , energy , agriculture , precious metals ) , Treasury Inflation Protected Securities ( TIPS ) and international bonds among others . These non-traditional asset classes have low correlation to traditional asset classesthey move differently in different marketsso adding them to your portfolio can potentially lower your investment risk . <p> How to stay on top of it all An appropriate asset allocation and a long-term view are still fundamental to mitigating risk and protecting your portfolio , but that does n't mean you should invest and forget . <p> While it 's never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market , you can take advantage of market opportunities or attempt to avoid risk by tactically changing your asset mix within a certain range . It 's important to note , however , that this does n't mean that you would move in and out of the market all together , but rather making subtle shifts to respond to changing market conditions . For instance , if your current equity allocation is 40 percent , you may choose to underweight or overweight by a small percentage , depending on the markets . At the very least , you should be reviewing your portfolio quarterly and rebalancing yearly to stay within your target asset allocation . <p> There 's a lot to think about , but bottom line , yes , asset allocation and diversification are still essential for protecting your portfolio . But to make yourself feel even more secure , it would be a good idea to check in with your financial advisor and discuss adjustments you might make in light of our current financial realities . <h> Subscribe : 132730 @qwx542730 <p> Asset allocation and diversification can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses . <p> ( 0116-0346 ) 132750 @qwx542750 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

My ex is also turning 65 , and as far as I know , he 's still working . I 'd like to file for my ex-spouse 's Social Security benefits , but do n't really want to talk to him about it . Does he have to be involved ? - - A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> I 'm getting a lot of questions about ex-spouses and Social Security lately , so I 'm going to try to broaden my answer to yours to cover a few more bases . <p> The direct answer to your question is no , your ex does n't have to be involved for you to collect benefits based on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Security rules governing ex-spouse benefits . He does n't even have to have filed for benefits himself ; he only has to be eligible ( at least age 62 ) . As long as he 's eligible to collect , you 're eligible for a spousal benefit . <p> Your own age plays a part in how much that benefit will be . Once you 're 66 , or what the IRS calls your full retirement age ( FRA ) , you 're entitled to 50 percent of your ex 's full primary insurance amount ( PIA ) , which is the benefit he would get at his FRA . So if your ex 's PIA were estimated to be $1,600 , at your FRA you 'd collect $800 . But if you collect early , there 's a penalty in the form of a reduction of between 5/12 and 25/36 of 1 percent for every month you 're ahead of your FRA . Therefore , collecting at your current age of 65 ( 12 months early ) would permanently reduce your benefit by about 7 percent . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , if you are n't in touch with your ex and do n't know his PIA , you wo n't know exactly what your spousal benefit will be until you file . The Social Security Administration ( SSA ) ca n't tell you anything in advance . <p> Bottom line , the fact that your ex does n't have to be involved can be a plus " but figuring out how to maximize your benefit requires a closer look . <p> Digging into the details Your age , the length of your marriage and your current marital status all factor into whether you qualify for an ex-spousal benefit . I 've described these in another column , and chances are you 've read them before , but I think they bear repeating . In a nutshell : <p> You must be at least 62 years old . <p> You must have been married for a minimum of 10 years . <p> If your ex has n't yet filed for benefits but is eligible , you must have been divorced for two years . <p> You must be currently unmarried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended . <p> If you 're under your FRA , the benefit based on your own work record must be less than the spousal benefit from your ex . <p> If you have more than one ex-spouse ( with a minimum 10-year marriage ) , you can collect on either spouse 's record , but not both . Likewise , you ca n't collect simultaneously on your own work record and an ex 's . It 's one or the other . <p> Important tips about timing If you meet these basic qualifications , the next step is to decide when to file . Here 's where it can pay to do some strategizing . To help clarify , let 's look at a couple of scenarios . <p> Filing before FRAHelen and John have been divorced for seven years after a 20-year marriage . She wants to collect a spousal benefit on John 's record at age 62 , and then switch to her own benefit at her full retirement age . <p> Unfortunately , this would n't work . When you file for ex-spousal benefits before your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . Not only that , at age 62 your benefit would be the greater of either your own benefit ( reduced because you filed early ) or the spousal benefit ( also reduced ) . As you can see , filing before your FRA not only lowers your benefit amount , it limits your options . <p> Filing at FRATodd and Gwen divorced after 10 years of marriage . Gwen remarried but Todd did n't . Todd is now 66 and Gwen is 64 . Even though Todd 's full benefit is higher than Gwen 's , he wants to collect on her work record and let his own benefit grow until he reaches 70 . <p> This is a realistic strategy . First , Gwen 's marital status does n't affect whether or not Todd can collect on her record ; only his own marital status is important . Also , even though Gwen is younger , at age 66 Todd can collect 50 percent of the full benefit she would receive at her FRA . And because Todd is at his FRA , he can choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit later . Every year he waits to collect on his own work record , he 'll earn delayed retirement credits of around 8 percent until he reaches 70 . <p> As you can see , the main issue is whether you file before or after your FRA . In my opinion , it 's generally best to wait unless you 're in a financial bind . But never postpone a spousal or ex-spousal benefit past FRA because it maxes out at that age . <p> An extra word about remarriageand survivors ' benefits The issue of remarriage can be confusing because the rules are different for spousal and survivors ' benefits . As I said , you must be unmarried to collect any ex-spousal benefit . However , with survivor benefits , if you remarry after age 60 , you can collect on your ex 's record no matter your marital status . Plus , if you 've survived more than one spouse , you can choose to collect on the one with the higher benefitand even switch between them if , for instance , a spouse with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The SSA does a pretty good job of explaining the details at ssa.gov , however , if you still have questions , you could look for a financial advisor who specializes in Social Security issues .

Unfortunately , she never provided any written or verbal guidance about her wishes for care , so my friend finds herself in a very tough spot . I want to make sure this never happens to me or to my loved ones . What do we need to do to prepare ? 132745 @qwx542745 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Contemplating the possibility of dementia is tough , whether you 're talking about yourself or a loved one . We want to think that it only happens to the very elderly , someone in their 90s such as your friend 's mother . And so we put it off . But according to the " 2014 Alzheimer 's Disease Facts and Figures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association , one in nine Americans age 65 or older have some form of dementia . And the annual number of new cases of Alzheimer 's and other dementias is projected to double by 2050 . It 's scary . It 's sobering . And to me , it means there 's a real need to confront this possibilityand prepare for itwhen we 're young and clear headed enough to look at financial and healthcare decisions from a practical as well as an emotional perspective . <p> Your friend 's situation is a heartbreaking example and you 're very wise to take steps now to prevent this from happening to you and your family . But no matter how forward thinking you are , it wo n't be easy . You may be willing to face the possibility of incapacity , but others may not be so comfortable with the idea , either for you or for themselves . So you may have to tread gently . Here are some thoughts on how to go about it . <p> Think realistically about care options Exploring care options for someone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's because , while there is certainly the need for doctor 's visits and medications covered by insurance , a lot of the care required by people with Alzheimer 's or other forms of dementia involve more personal carecalled the activities of daily living ( ADLs ) . Where do you turn for help with eating , bathing , dressing or just making sure you do n't injure yourself ? These things are n't generally covered by health insurance . <p> Again , according to the report from the Alzheimer 's Association , unpaid caregivers such as family members provide billions of hours of care . Professional care is available , such as assisted living , in-home care or adult daycare centers , but the costs can be a challenge . For instance , basic assisted living services average about $42,000 per year according to alz.org ( as of 2015 ) . And that 's just the estimated average . I recently spoke with someone who was paying $12,000 a month to have both parents in assisted living with full care . <p> Your own family and financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you or to a loved one . But whether you 'll have to rely on professional assistance or you have a supportive family network that can provide help , be aware that you 'll be dealing with potentially significant emotional as well as financial costs . <p> Plan for the financial side There 's a whole list of costs you may have to deal with from ongoing medical care to home safety related expenses to full residential care . <p> Most insurance policies do n't cover nursing home care or help with ADLs . And while Medicare covers some skilled home health care such as skilled nursing care , long-term care is n't covered . Medicaid is a possible solution , but it 's only available when an individual has depleted most of their personal assets . <p> Unless your family has significant assets to self-insure , you may want to look into long-term care insurance . Here , too , you have to be cautious . Not every LTC policy covers Alzheimer 's . And you want to make certain that a policy covers things like assisted living , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are , of course , other financial options . People with a lot of equity in their homes may see that as a potential source of funds . Others may max out a health savings account ( HSA ) every year and keep it in reserve for this type of care . Your retirement funds can also be a significant resource . <p> Talk to your family about the emotional side Once you 've thought through potential practical solutions , talk to your family . Be upfront about why you 're bringing up the subject . Your friend 's story could be a good starting point . <p> If you 're talking to your parents , they may welcome the chance to discuss their own fears and desires . Your children may be more resistant , but make it clear that you 're not being morbid , just realistic . And no matter what response you get , be willing to listen to everyone 's concerns . <p> Put your paperwork in place Basic paperwork includes an advance healthcare directive , power of attorney for healthcare , a will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances . You 'll find more specific information on legal documents for someone who 's incapacitated at alz.org . <p> There 's no one solution for every family . But thinking about it and planning ahead is something everyone should do .

What should I do ? Is it hopeless ? - <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Your situation is n't hopelessnor is it uncommonbut it certainly should be a wake-up call . Ideally , everyone should begin thinking about retirement with their first paycheck , but the reality is that many people do n't start to seriously save ( or panic ) until much later . <p> In fact , the 2013 Retirement Confidence Survey published by the Benefit Research Institute ( EBRI ) notes that more than half the people surveyed had less than $25,000 in total savings .

In a situation like yours , I 'd go a step further and try to contribute the maximum allowed . <p> The IRS has set the 2014 limit at $17,500 plus an extra $5,500 once you turn 50 for a total potential savings of $23,000 a year . Your employer may limit your contributions to a percentage of your gross salary , so first find out how much your specific 401(k) plan allows , then go for the max . <p> Yes , it will be a chunk of money , but if you cando it . Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are generally taken out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis , which reduces your taxable income .

However , there are also income limitations to contribute fully to a Roth : $114,000-$129,000 for single filers ; $181,000-$191,000 for married filing jointly . <p> Save in a regular brokerage account for a different type of tax advantage If neither a traditional nor a Roth IRA work for you , funneling your extra savings to a regular brokerage account is also a good choice .

Let ' ' s take a look . <p> How a SEP-IRA works One great option is a Simplified Employee Pension Plan ( SEP-IRA ) , which is specifically designed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more but keep paperwork to a minimum . It 's easy to open and let 's you make fairly high annual contributions . It also gives you the flexibility to vary contributionsor skip them entirelyaccording to your yearly business needs . <p> You do n't say if you have employees , but if you do , you will need to make equivalent ( percentage-wise ) contributions on their behalf . So be sure to factor that in . <p> A big plus of a SEP-IRA is that it allows you to sock away a significant chunk of money ; after a fairly convoluted calculation , the maximum works out to be 20 percent of your net income after subtracting self-employment taxbut no more than $49,000 for both 2010 and 2011 ( up to the due date of your return , plus extension ) . While there are online calculators to help you determine your maximum contribution , it 's probably wise to get your exact figure from your accountant . <p> Once your SEP is up and running , it works like an IRA . Contributions are tax deductible , earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either until you withdraw them . And just like an IRA , you can make withdrawals penalty-free at age 59+ . <p> A couple of other choices You might also look into an Individual 401(k) . Your yearly contribution could potentially be higher and you 're allowed to borrow against your balance within certain limitations . <p> If you have employees , A SIMPLE IRA ( Savings Incentive Match PLan for Employees ) allows both employees and employers to contribute to traditional IRAs set up for employees . It 's ideally suited as a start-up retirement plan for small businesses . Your tax advisor can help you weigh the pros and cons of your different choices . <p> Adding another IRA Having a small business retirement plan does n't prevent you from opening an individual IRA . Depending on what you qualify for and what makes the most sense tax-wise , you could also make a maximum total yearly contribution of $5,000 to either a traditional IRA , a Roth IRA or a combination of the two . <p> You can contribute to a small business plan and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as your income falls within a certain range . For single filers in 2010 and 2011 , adjusted gross income must be $56,000 or less . The tax deduction phases out between $56,000 and $66,000 . For married filing jointly , the limit is $89,000 in 2010 ( $90,000 in 2011 ) with the phase out between $89,000 and $109,000 ( and between $90,000 and $110,000 in 2011 ) . <p> As you may know , there 's no upfront tax deduction for contributions to a Roth , but withdrawals at age 59+ are tax-free . However , your eligibility also depends on income . The income limit to make a full Roth contribution in 2010 is $105,000 ( $107,000 in 2011 ) for singles , $167,000 ( $169,000 in 2011 ) for married filing jointly . <p> If you expect to be in a lower tax bracket later on , a traditional IRA probably makes the most sense . On the other hand , if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket at retirement timeand you qualifya Roth is a choice worth considering . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific limit on the number of accounts you can have , there is a limit on the amount of tax-advantaged contributions you can make each year . So I 'd first talk to your accountant or tax advisor to see what combination of accounts gives you the best savings and tax advantages . Then make a commitment to fund them to the maximum you can afford . <p> If you can save beyond the limits of your retirement plan and individual IRA , open a taxable brokerage account and ramp up your savings even more . You 've got a bit of catching up to do , but it sounds like you 're ready to get started .

@@49276556 @2776556/ <h> We 've got a tip for that . <p> If you missed Money Management 101 , consider this your cheat sheet . Whether you 're signing a lease on your first apartment or looking for ways to rein in your spending , we 've got a tip for that . These bite-size bits of financial advice are designed to help you get a grip on your finances " and then get back to doing something about it . <h> Budgeting <h> Related : <h> When it comes to budgeting , figure out what works for you . Daily ? Weekly ? Monthly ? It all depends on your savings goals and spending habits . <p> Setting a monthly budget is a very useful exercise , especially because many expenses recur each month . But you do n't have to just think monthly when it comes to budgeting . Try breaking down your budget by day or by week ( or by each paycheck ) it might give you a more concrete sense of how much you can safely spend at a time . And if you 're saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can give your budget a longer-term view . The point is to come up with a system that works for you and keeps your spending and savings on track . Try starting with . <h> If you think a budget 's too much hassle , try this budgeting baby step : Hang on to your receipts . <p> If you find it tough to make a budget and stick to it , try this instead : For one month , keep all of your receipts in your desk drawer . At the end of the month , tally up the total ( do n't forget to add in automatic bill payments and anything else you buy online ) . Single out smaller expenses , like ATM fees or music downloads , which can really add up , and look for any obvious places to cut back . <h> How much do you spend on eating out ? Cutting out one trip a week to your favorite lunch spot can add up to a lot of savings . <p> Even at the cheapest sandwich place , it 's hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you were to put that $10 into an interest-bearing account every week instead , you would have more than $5,000 within a decade ( assuming a 1% interest rate ) . And if you increase that amount to $25 a week , your savings could grow to nearly $14,000 in 10 years . We 're not saying you should never eat outbut on even the smallest discretionary spending does add up . <h> Charities need help year-round , not just at the holidays . So work your donations into your monthly budget . <p> On average , Americans give 3.2% of their income to charity . Whether you give more or less , it 's important to work charitable giving into your monthly budget . If you ca n't give as much money as you would like , volunteer instead . Time really is moneyand most charities need as much as they can get . <h> If you get a raise or promotion celebrate ! Next stay within your old budget , and bank the rest . <p> It 's easier to maintain a modest lifestyle than cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a nice raise , resist the urge to spend it . Living within your old budget and saving or investing at least half of your extra cash can help you reach your savings goals faster . Consider increasing your contributions to your 401(k) or retirement account , or setting up a monthly automatic transfer from checking to savings . <h> Create savings buckets for your various goals . It might help you stay on target . <p> If you 're saving up for multiple goals , consider setting up different accounts for each one ( or using a bank that let 's you put your savings into subaccounts ) instead of lumping everything together . Being able to see the amounts you 've saved for each goal may help you more easily track your progress , and prevent you from dipping in for other expenses . This setup does n't work for everyone , though . One consolidated account is often better if you 'd rather streamline the process of managing your money " and it could earn more interest in the long run . <h> Go plastic-free for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on spending : Kick it old school for a week and leave your plastic at home " credit and debit . Go to your bank today and withdraw the amount of cash you think you 'll need to cover your expenses for the next seven days . A set limit on your spending can make you think twice about making that purchase you " ca n't live without " . <h> Create a game plan for your holiday gift giving <p> Whether you line up at daybreak for Black Friday deals or spend weeks searching for the perfect gift , make a holiday spending plan and stick to it . <p> If you 're carrying a balance on a card with a high interest rate , a balance transfer can be a great way to save money . But while zero percent APR can seem enticing , a habit of transferring balances can be a red flag to credit bureaus that you ca n't manage your debt . And remembereven at its best , a balance transfer is an aid , not a cure . You still need to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay down more than the minimum each month . If you 're late even once , it 's a good chance that your new interest rate will surge and you 'll be back where you started . <h> Create a spending plan and put it on automatic . <p> Most online bank accounts allow you to put all your recurring monthly bills on autopilot , helping to prevent late fees , and sometimes even reaping points and cash rewards . Just do n't forget that due dates and minimum payments can change , so continue to monitor your bills even when they are on automatic payments . In addition , you can also make saving automatic , with auto-deposit into your IRA , savings or brokerage accounts . <h> Taxes <h> Related : <h> A credit card that offers rewards can be pretty sweet " but it 's only worthwhile if the terms align with your spending habits . <p> To choose a rewards card wisely , look at the fine print . How many points do you get per dollar spent ? Do the points expire or only accrue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you can buy with them ? Look for a card that will reward you for purchases you regularly make . And remember that steep fees " or interest payments " can cancel out the value of your points . If that 's the case , you 're probably better off forgoing the rewards for a card with a better rate and no annual fee . <h> Zero-percent financing usually has a catch . Proceed with extreme caution . <p> When you need to buy a big-ticket item ( a fridge or a car , say ) and ca n't pay in cash , 0% offers can seem attractivebut they can also come with some pretty ugly terms . Because the payoff period is often shorter than that of a traditional loan , monthly payments on a 0% deal can be quite steep . And if you miss a payment , you could get stuck with a late fee the size of your cable bill . If you know you 'll be able to pay off the item before the 0% rate expires , then it 's worth considering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . Once the 0% financing ends , the interest rate usually goes way upand that 's just not worth it . <h> Consider dipping into savings to pay down high-interest debt . It can save you money . <p> While it 's always important to build up a savings , it 's even more important to pay off nondeductible , high-interest debt like that pesky credit card balance . Compare the interest you 're paying on debt with the interest you 're earning on your savings , and you may find that you 're paying more than you 're making . For example , let 's say you have a $1,000 balance on a credit card with an 18% APR and $1,000 in a savings account earning 1% interest annually . Over the course of a year , you 'll pay about $100 to your credit card company while earning only $10 in your savings account . <h> Applying for new credit can affect your credit score . Choose wisely . <p> Applying for a credit card just for the incentive is usually not worth it . You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of card often has a higher APR than other cards you may qualify for . Plus , applying for multiple credit cards can lower your credit score . Each application triggers a credit report inquiry , which gets logged on your report " and a lot of inquiries can have a lasting effect on your score . <h> If you have a credit card with a high interest rate , ask to lower it . <p> If you 're carrying a balance on your card with a high APR , you 're losing a lot of money . The best way to deal with this " short of paying off what you owe " is to simply call up your credit card company and ask for a lower rate . Surprisingly , many credit card companies will lower their rates if you just ask " because if you 're a good customer , they wo n't want to lose you . For leverage , you can mention the lower offers you 've received in the mail from other companies . <h> Using a credit card to withdraw cash is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . <p> We know the scenario : You 're in a pinch , you 're at a cash-only joint , and your checking account is running dangerously low . There 's an ATM in the back ; you use your credit card to withdraw a couple twenties . Problem is , you can have multiple interest rates with the same credit card , depending on the type of transaction , and cash advances are usually the most expensive . So the interest you 'll pay on that cash is going to be way higher than if you 'd swiped the card for a purchase of the same value . <h> Do n't let that trip to the emergency room send you to collections . When it comes to your medical bills " negotiate . <p> Doctors and hospitals negotiate with insurance companies all the timethey get paid different amounts for the same procedure based on the type of insurance the patient has . Do n't be afraid to have a polite discussion with the billing department about your financial situation . You may be able to negotiate a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a monthly payment planthough most places will give you a significant discount for paying in full up front . <h> Boost your credit score by clearing out old or inaccurate black marks . <p> Having a good credit score is the key to securing a car loan , mortgage or other funding . And since your entire financial history determines this score , even small mistakes you made in the past can bring your number down . To fix those , and bump up your credit score , start with your yearly free credit reports from **26;122;TOOLONG . If you find inaccurate or unflattering entries from more than 7 " 10 years ago , like late payments , your spouse 's debts , or credit applications , request the credit reporting agencies to remove them . Even having one blemish removed can bump up your credit score significantly . <h> Closing extra credit card accounts might hurt your score <p> Closing a credit card account or two might seem like an easy way to improve your credit score , but the opposite is often true . Your overall credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the amount of debt you have compared to your available credit limits . The lower your utilization rate , the better . So , if you close cards but still carry the same amount of debt , your utilization rate will go up and your credit score may go down . <h> Employment <h> Related : <h> If you 've got a good reason to ask for a raise , do it . Even in a tough economy . <p> In this economy , you may feel lucky just to have a job , let alone get paid what you deserve . But if you 've taken on more responsibilities and your company is financially stable , it may be worth asking for more money . Set up a meeting with your boss and point out how you 've benefitted the organization and its bottom line . Avoid mentioning personal financial problems or threatening to leave " keep it positive instead . Let your boss know the dollar amount you 'd like , and be prepared to go lower if necessary . If a raise is n't in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its place , like extra vacation time . <h> Relocating to a new cityeven with a jobcan be financially risky . Make sure you know cost-of-living of your new home . <p> Landing a job in a new city can be exciting , especially when it means a raise in salary . But that extra money wo n't go very far if the cost of living is higher than you are used to . Before you break your lease and pack up your belongings , be sure you can afford your new locale . <h> Springing for a transit pass or gym membership ? Find out if your employee benefits will cover part of your purchase . <p> If your employer makes a financial contribution to your health plan and keeps your salary going when you 've got the flu , chances are good it offers a few nice quality-of-life perks , too . If you 're considering a car-sharing membership , donating to charity , taking a class , joining a gym , or shopping for a big-ticket item , remember to check your benefits package first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matching gifts . Do n't go it alone if you 're lucky enough to work for a company that will share the expense . <h> Update your resume " even if you 're not actively looking for a new job . <p> This week , spend an evening updating your resume . It may not be fun , but it 's important to have a current resume on hand just in case you find yourself needing it . Look for ways to expand your network : Connect online with people in your field and stay in touch with contacts at companies you 'd like to work for . Even if you 're not looking for work , it can pay off to do this legwork now . If you do suddenly find yourself without a job , you 'll have contacts you can call upon for leads and potential opportunities . <h> If you get a raise or promotion " AWESOME ! Now make a plan to stay within your old budget . <p> It 's easier to maintain a modest lifestyle than cut back once you 're used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urge to move on up to a two-bedroom of your own . Living within your old budget and saving or investing at least half of your extra cash can help you reach your savings goals faster . Consider increasing your retirement account contributions or setting up a monthly automatic transfer from checking to savings . <h> If you usually get a fat tax refund " or the other way around " it might be time to adjust your W-4 . <p> It may feel like a win to get a sizeable refund from the government every April , but it just means that you 're overpaying to begin with . Withholding less from your paycheck will give you extra cash on payday . On the other hand , if you withhold too little , you could find yourself owing a whopper at tax time . For this coming year , take a good look at your W-4 and figure out if you should make any changes . <h> This year , boost your saving for retirement by 1% of your salary " and boost it another 1% next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem far away , but paying for your golden age needs to happen now . And the sooner you start , the better : If you begin saving in your 20s , you 'll need to save 10 " 15% of your annual salary to have enough to retire in your 60s . Wait until you hit 30 to start saving ? You 'll need to put away 15 " 25% . A good goal : Increase what you save by 1% of your salary every year . Because the more you save now , the less you 'll need to work later . <h> Build up enough savings to float your new business through the first year or two . <p> It might seem like common sense , but before you launch a new business , make sure you have money in the bank . Do n't count on personal or bank loans to see you throughmost new businesses do n't start turning a profit for months , or even years , and you 'll need to start payments as soon as possible . Instead of finding yourself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HELOCs to pay off loans , take the time you need upfront to build out your savings , so you can start your business on solid ground . <h> Donating to a great cause ? See if your employer offers a match <p> Whatever your charity of choice , it can almost certainly use every donation it can get .

The earlier you start saving , the better " she 'll be out of diapers and off to prom before you know it . <p> You 've promised " to have and to hold " but does that also mean a joint bank account ? Joint accounts can encourage you and your partner to talk about your financial goals and work together to achieve them . Of course , the drawback is that there 's no spending privacy . With separate accounts you gain independence , but you 're also likely to spend a lot of time deciding who pays for what .

It 's not a fun topic , but it 's important . <p> Having the talk with your parents wo n't be easy , but it 's better to do it than to assume your parents have all of their affairs in order . Ask them about their overall financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where their accounts and official documents are held . Find out whether they 've granted power of attorney to someone to manage their finances and health care .

But the splurges add up even faster than your baby will grow out of those tiny clothes .

Three easy rules to help you on your way : Start saving for retirement now even though that seems like a world away , never fall behind in paying your student loans , and avoid racking up credit card debt . <h> Giving Back <h> Related : <h> Charities need help year-round , not just at the holidays . So work your donations into your monthly budget . <p> On average , Americans give 3.2% of their income to charity . Whether you give more or less , it 's important to work charitable giving into your monthly budget . If you ca n't give as much money as you would like , volunteer instead . Time really is moneyand most charities need as much as they can get . <h> Before you donate , get the facts so you know where your money is going . <p> Find out where your money is going before you donate to a charity you 've never heard of . Confirm the organization 's 501(c) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your donation will go to program services versus administration and fundraising ( sites like charitywatch.org and charitynavigator.org can help you with this ) . General rule of thumb : Steer clear of organizations that spend less than 60% of their cash on directly serving their cause . This is not to say that charities asking you for money on the street corner are not trustworthy " it 's just important for you to understand exactly what your $10 pays for . <h> Do n't be a Scrooge . Give what you can to charity , whether it 's time or money " or both . <p> You do n't have to be a zillionaire to donate to charities " for many , even a $10 donation helps . But there are many other valuable ways to give back : Sort and wrap toys for a holiday drive , donate blood , or mentor a student , to name a few . Or , gather up those winter clothes that do n't fit anymore and bring them to an organization collecting warm gear . Trust us , if you did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear it now . <h> Do n't let guilt put you on the spot . Donate only to the causes that mean the most to you . <p> It 'd be awesome if you could buy a whole table at your friend 's charity dinner , or chip in for every 5K fundraiser . But when you do n't have an endless supply of cash , giving out of guilt can mean you have less for an organization you 're really passionate about . Create a charitable giving budget for the year , and once you 've hit your limit , do n't feel guilty about saying no . Giving back to your community is important , but when resources are tight , you can only give so much . <h> Donate ! You 'll feel great " and you may even get a tax write-off . <p> A tax-exempt donation is a charitable gift you can claim as a tax write-off .

Wait until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away 15 " 25% . A good goal : Increase what you save by 1% of your salary every year . Because the more you save now , the less you 'll need to work later . <p> For all of you freelancers , hourly workers , and small business owners : You do n't need a 401(k) to have a tax-advantaged retirement plan . Anyone with an income ( who has n't reached age 70-+ ) can open a traditional IRA through a bank , brokerage , or fund company and begin investing money for their golden years . Each year , you can add earnings up to $5,000 ( until you reach age 50 , when that limit goes up to $6,000 ) . If you 're self-employed or own a small business " consider a SIMPLE IRA , individual 401(k) , or SEP-IRA . <h> Convince yourself that retirement funds are untouchable . <p> For most of us , an early withdrawal from our retirement savings is a bad idea . Outside of a few special cases , there 's a 10% penalty to partially or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And unless you have a Roth IRA , these withdrawals are immediately subject to income tax , so you 'll be paying a lot up front . If you really need the funds and you have a 401(k) that allows it , you can consider taking out a penalty-free loan . But if you leave your current job , you 'll have to pay back the full amount or it 'll be subject to the 10% penaltyand you may be able to find a better rate on a conventional loan anyway . <h> You 're young . That 's a pretty good reason to open a Roth IRA . <p> There are two kinds of IRAs in this world : the kind that are tax-deferred and the kind that are n't . A Roth IRA is n't , which means you 'll pay taxes on money you contribute now , but not on your withdrawals when you retire . That 's a good thing if you 're just starting your career , because you 're more likely to retire at a higher tax bracket . <h> This year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and boost it another 1% next year . <p> Endless rounds of golf and early-bird specials may seem far away , but paying for your golden age needs to happen now . And the sooner you start , the better : If you begin saving in your 20s , you 'll need to save 10 " 15% of your annual salary to have enough to retire in your 60s . Wait until you hit 30 to start saving ? You 'll need to put away 15 " 25% . A good goal : Increase what you save by 1% of your salary every year . Because the more you save now , the less you 'll need to work later . <h> Consider the pros and cons of long-term care insurance <p> Long-term care " help with the " activities of daily living " such as bathing , dressing , and eating " is not covered by Medicare or other health insurance . While an estimated 70% of people over age 65 will require this type of care at some point , only about 10% of the elderly are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a 2013 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research . Both long-term care and long-term care insurance are quite costly , so examine your situation carefully , preferably with the help of an independent financial advisor . If you decide to purchase a policy , be sure to comparison shop and understand all of the fine print . In general , the most cost-effective time to purchase a policy is between the ages of 50 and 65 . <h> Save for your kids ' college without derailing your retirement <p> Of course you want to help your kids pay for school , but you need to keep your financial future intact at the same time . The key is to stay true to your retirement savings plan while taking advantage of tax-advantaged college savings options such as 529 plans and Coverdell accounts . By all means , help your children , but make sure that after graduation , they can feel confident that you 've taken care of them " and yourself . <h> Contribute to your 401(k) and an IRA- <p> Supplementing your workplace retirement account with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings . There are contribution limits and deductibility issues to consider , but you can potentially decrease your tax bill at the same time that you help strengthen your future . <h> Diversify your tax liability- <p> If you expect your income tax bracket to be lower when you eventually make withdrawals from your retirement account , a traditional , tax-deferred 401(k) or IRA might make the most sense . On the other hand , if you expect your bracket to be higher , a tax-free Roth might make the most sense . And if you 're not sure , why not hedge your bets by contributing to both ? That way , you 'll have maximum flexibility come retirement . <h> Delay Social Security benefits " and reap the rewards- <p> Early retirement might sound appealing , but claiming your Social Security benefits before you need to might mean less money in the bank during your later years . If you are able to hold out on taking your Social Security benefits until age 70 , you 'll collect a check that is 76% bigger than if you took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan repayment or 401(k) ? - <p> If you 're carrying a lot of student loan debt , it makes sense to want to pay it off as aggressively as possible . Realize , though , that student loans can be considered " good debt , " in that they generally carry a low interest rate , the interest may be tax-deductible , and they wo n't be a ding on your credit rating . It 's important to make your payments on time each month , but beyond that , do n't let your repayment interfere with retirement savings . <h> Always contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture the maximum match- <p> If your employer matches a portion of your 401(k) contributions , do the math , and at a minimum contribute enough to capture the max . Otherwise , you 're walking away from free money . <h> Student Loans &amp; Education <h> Related : <h> If you ca n't make a student loan payment , take a deep breath and call your lender . <p> If you 're having trouble making payments , talk to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're unemployed , back in school , or facing economic hardship . With a subsidized Stafford or Perkins loan , you wo n't accrue interest while you 're in deferment . If deferral 's not an option , ask about forbearance , where you make reduced payments for a period of time while accruing interest . No matter what you do , the important thing is to talk to your lender now , because once you go into default , many of these options will no longer be on the table . <h> Grad school is a big investmentmake sure you consider your plan carefully . <p> In a tough job market , graduate school is an appealing option if you ca n't find work with the degree you already have . But before you dive into the application process , make sure you know what you 're getting into . Is there demand in the marketplace for the degree you want ? How much will it cost ? And how much financial aid will you qualify for ? The last thing you need is more debt than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how much their degree boosted their opportunities and earning potential . For certain careers , an advanced degree is a necessity " for others , it can be a financial burden that 's worth thinking twice about . <h> Deduct your student loan interest . You deserve the break ! <p> Paying for your education can really set you back , but the good news is that you can deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest from your taxes ( assuming your modified adjusted gross income is less than $75,000 a year ) . Even better , you do n't have to itemize to get this deduction . Make sure you received Form 1098-E , which states how much you paid in interest last year , from your lender . Enter that number into the Adjustments to Income section of Form 1040 or 1040A . This lowers your adjusted gross incomewhich means your tax liability goes down . <h> Setting up your student loan payments to debit automatically can reduce how much you pay over time . <p> Student loans can be great until it 's time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rate reduction if you sign up for automatic debit payments . It 's usually 0.25 " 0.5% , which can save you a couple thousand dollars over time , depending on your loan amount and interest rate . Plus , auto-debit helps you keep your payments on schedule , which can lead to an additional rate cut down the line . Just make sure you always have enough money to cover the debit " one bounced payment and you may lose the reduced rate . <h> Keep it together " consider student loan consolidation . <p> Paying off multiple student loans can be a hassle . Consolidating let 's you roll them all up into one and lock in a fixed rate . You can also extend the payoff period to lower your monthly payments . That said , this usually only makes sense if you can lower your rate and save money . If you 're almost paid off , it 's probably not worth it . And look closely at the terms : Private consolidation loans can come with fees and variable rates . Federal consolidation loans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties , and are covered by terms set by federal law . <h> Watch out for financial aid and scholarship scams . Hint : You should never have to pay money to get money . <p> Figuring out how to finance college can be confusing enough , without having to worry about scholarship fraud . But hundreds of thousands of students and parents collectively lose more than $100 million to these types of scams annually , according to FinAid.org . Rule of thumb ? If it sounds too good to be true it probably is . No legitimate service can guarantee a scholarship to students , and you should almost never be asked to pay any more for your application than the price of postage . Luckily , there are a lot of resources available to help you verify offers . Start with the Better Business Bureau , the Federal Trade Commission , and the National Consumer Leagues Fraud Center . <p> When you land a raise or a higher paying job , take a minute to revel " then consider contacting your lender and switching your student loan repayment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan is made up of level monthly payments over the shortest amount of time so you pay less in the end . On the flip side , if your income has decreased for any reason , an income-sensitive option can lower your monthly payment to reflect that change . You 'll pay more interest over time , but it can ease the burden during the tough time and give you peace of mind . <h> Taxes <h> Related : <h> Do n't wait until the last second to file your taxes . The earlier you get started , the better . <p> Filing your taxes early instead of at the eleventh hour wo n't save you any money , but it will prevent anxiety " and , if you 've got a refund coming , you 'll get your money sooner . If you 're not ready to file , and you think you 're likely to owe , plan ahead and set some cash aside now . At the very least , make sure you have the paperwork you need to file . <h> Itemizing your deductions is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise , keep it simple . <p> There are people out there who meticulously keep receipts for every charitable donation and every paper clip purchased for their home office . But itemizing does n't make sense for everyone . A rule of thumb : If your donations , business expenses , and other deductions ( not including student loan deductions ) do n't add up to more than the standard deduction , itemizing wo n't bring tax savings . In other words : If you do n't have much to deduct , do n't stress about tracking down that lost receipt " you do n't need it . <h> Deduct your student loan interest . You deserve the break ! <p> Paying for your education can really break the bank , but the good news is that you can deduct up to $2,500 in student loan interest from your taxes ( assuming your modified adjusted gross income is less than $75,000 a year ) .

Enter that number into the Adjustments to Income section of Form 1040 or 1040A . This lowers your adjusted gross income " which means your tax liability goes down . <h> If you usually get a big tax refundor the other way aroundit might be time to adjust your W-4 . <p> It may feel like a win to get a sizeable refund from the government every April , but it just means that you 're overpaying to begin with . Withholding less from your paycheck will give you extra cash on payday . On the other hand , if you withhold too little , you could find yourself owing a whopper at tax time . For this coming year , take a good look at your W-4 and figure out if you should make any changes . <h> Lower your tax bill " with a little help from your 401(k) . <p> Saving for retirement is n't just about planning for your future " it can also help you at tax time . Reduce your tax bill by putting aside some money in your 401(k) " and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if your employer offers a matching contribution , contribute at least enough to get the full match . Otherwise , you 're basically turning down free money . <h> Spring cleaning applies to your financial records , too " it 's a good time to deal with that overflowing pile of important documents . <p> When you get the itch to organize your closet in the spring , channel some of that energy to your financial records . That does n't mean you can dump everything into the shredder , though . Keep for seven years : W-2s , 1099s , tax returns , and receipts for anything you 've deducted . Shred : all non-business-related receipts that you 've stashed in your desk drawer , plus utility bills and monthly credit card statements . <h> Moving for a new job ? Those expenses might be deductible . <p> Moving , even for a great new job , can be a pain . But , depending on your situation , you might be able to deduct some of the costs of moving on your tax return . These can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . To be eligible to claim , you need to work full-time for at least 39 weeks in the 12 months after your moveand your new job has to be more than 50 miles from your old home . Just remember to track your expenses . <h> A new baby is great newsfor you and your tax bill ! <p> The first time you look at your little one , taxes are probably the last thing on your mind . But children do give you certain tax benefits that you 'll want to take advantage of . The first step is getting your newborn a social security numberit 's required if you 're planning to claim her as a dependent . Then , when tax time rolls around , look at claiming the Child Tax Creditup to $1,000 . Single parents may also qualify as " head of household " , which can mean a larger standard deduction . You should also check to see if you qualify for any additional deductions or credits , such as childcare , or the Adoption Credit if you adopted . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can " whether that means credit cards , or other lines of credit " sometimes even that 's not a viable option . So what happens if you truly ca n't pay ? Because everyone 's situation is different , be sure to talk with a tax advisor about your options " which might include arranging an installment plan . Free tax help is available through the IRS at www.irs.gov , and many communities offer in-person tax assistance through Volunteer Income Tax Assistance ( VITA ) . ( Call 800-906-9887 for VITA site locations . ) But whatever you choose to do , you absolutely must still file your return . No exceptions .

@@49276558 @2776558/ <h> Mortgage Basics <h> Get the facts before you buy <p> Your mortgage is most likely the biggest loan you 'll ever take out . Before you talk to a mortgage broker , make sure you have at least a basic understanding of common terms and types of mortgages . Here are some questions and answers to help you get started . <h> What is a mortgage ? <p> Legally , a mortgage is a lien on a property or house that secures a loan and is paid back in installments over a set period of time . Basically , your mortgage is your promise to pay back the money you 've borrowed to buy your home . <h> What is the term of a mortgage ? <p> The term of your mortgage is the amount of time you have to repay the mortgage loan . A 30-year fixed mortgage is a common term . However , shorter-term mortgages , say 15 years , are also available . A longer-term mortgage may mean lower monthly payments . A shorter-term mortgage means you 'll pay the loan off faster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortgage ? If you have a 30-year mortgage , you can always pay more toward the principle each month if you choose . This way you can work toward reducing the amount of time it will take to pay off the loan , but still have the flexibility of paying less when you want . <h> How much is a down payment ? <p> A down payment is the part of the purchase price of a property that you pay in cash up-front " and do n't finance with a mortgage . Most down payments are 20 percent of the purchase price . You can sometimes buy a property with a smaller down payment , but you may be overextending yourself and your mortgage will probably be more expensive . In this case , you will also need to purchase mortgage insurance . <h> What are closing costs ? <p> Closing costs are additional costs necessary to transfer ownership of a property and to complete your mortgage transaction . These may be paid by the buyer and/or the seller , and may include a loan origination fee , attorney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining title insurance . Closing costs will vary according to geographic location . <h> What are points and who pays them ? <p> Points are a percentage of the loan amount paid at closing that may affect your interest rate . For instance , on a $90,000 loan amount , 1 point would be equal to 1 percent or $900 . If you pay points , you might get a lower rate . Sometimes , in exchange for a higher rate , the lender may pay points to offset your closing costs . <h> What mortgage is best for you ? <p> The best type of mortgage for you depends on your personal financial situation and how long you plan to stay in your home . Here are the two basic types of mortgages : <p> A fixed-rate mortgage has an interest rate that remains the same for the life of the loan . Your monthly loan payments are locked in for the entire term of your loan , meaning your interest and principal payments wo n't change . <p> This loan may be right for you if : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable period of time " 10 years or more <p> You want the security and comfort of having a set monthly mortgage payment <p> You 're uncomfortable with the risk of fluctuating interest rates <p> Special considerations : Fixed-rate loans generally have higher interest rates than adjustable rate mortgages " at least to start . On the other hand , you have the security of knowing that your interest rate and payments wo n't change . <p> An adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) has an interest rate tied to a financial index that changes over the life of the loan according to a specified adjustment period . <p> For instance , adjustment periods may be described as 1/1 , 3/1 , 5/1 , 7/1 or 10/1 . The first number represents the initial period of the loan during which the interest rate does n't change . The second number refers to how often the rate can change after the initial period of the loan . So a 3/1 ARM would have a fixed interest rate for the first three years . After that the interest rate " and your payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right for you if : <p> You 're expecting to sell your property before the end of the initial fixed-rate period <p> You 're expecting to refinance your property before the end of the initial fixed-rate period <p> You expect interest rates to be lower in the future <p> Special considerations : ARMs are usually priced lower than fixed-rate mortgages , so your initial monthly payment may be lower . On the other hand , after the initial fixed term , your monthly payments can increase if interest rates go up . <p> Be careful of interest-only ARMs . With this type of mortgage , no payment is made to the principal for a specific period of time ( usually 5 " 10 years ) , meaning you 're not decreasing your loan balance . Your initial payments may be lower , but can increase if the interest rate increases . And once the interest-only period is over , your payment will definitely increase " even if the interest rate remains the same " because you 'll have to pay both principal and interest . <p> When it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop around .

But there 's one event you may not be aware of that I think is well worth noting : the annual Get Smart About Credit Day sponsored by the American Bankers Association- ( ABA ) Community Engagement Foundation. - <p> Officially celebrated on October 20th and now in its 14th year , this national program helps bankers in local communities offer events and classes to teach high school students and young adults about the importance of using credit wisely. - <p> To me , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age " because many Americans are awash in debt . According to the Federal Reserve , as of July 2016 revolving debt for American households totaled $969 billion ; student debt was up to $1.4 trillion . Those are pretty eye-popping numbers ! - <p> While your own debt may not be in the stratosphere , I think it 's important for everyone to periodically test their knowledge of how to control credit and debt . So here are ten questions to ask yourself to make sure you 've got a handle on your own debt situation . <p> Do you know the difference between good and bad debt ? Not all debt is equal ; some can work for you , some against you . To work for you , debt should ideally be low cost and have potential tax advantages . That 's good debt . Think home mortgages and equity lines of credit , even student debt , which has the added benefit of enhancing career opportunities and earning potential . On the other hand , credit card balances and auto loans are definitely in the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are n't tax deductible. - <p> When was the last time you checked your credit score ? Your credit score ( or FICO score ) plays a big part in your ability to get loans " mortgages , car loans , new credit cards , even your ability to rent an apartment . It can range from 250 to 900 . With a low score , you 'll likely pay a higher interest rate , if you can get credit at all . A score of 760-800 or higher will generally get you the best deals . You can get a free credit report annually by going to annualcreditreport.com and , while the three major credit bureaus ( Equifax , Experian , or TransUnion ) charge for providing your credit score , most credit card issuers offer your credit score for free . <p> Have you taken steps to raise your credit score ? There are five simple ways to lift your credit score : pay your bills on time ; keep your credit card balances low ; establish a long credit history ; minimize new credit requests ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt to credit ratio ? Also known as your credit utilization ratio , your debt to credit ratio represents the amount of credit you use relative to the amount of credit available to you , for instance , through your credit cards or other credit lines . To get your ratio , divide your total credit balance by your total available credit . A high ratio can negatively impact your credit score " and your ability to get new credit . The ideal credit usage is between 20 and 30 percent . <p> Do you pay your bills on time ? Paying your bills on time accounts for about 35 percent of your credit score . But credit score aside , late payments can also mean added fees and interest . Even if you ca n't make the full payment , make a partial payment . <p> How much is your debt costing you ? If you do n't pay your credit card balance every month , interest can get out of hand . Consider this example : Paying only $100 a month on a $3,000 credit card balance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus it would take you approximately 38 months to pay it off ! Use an- online calculator- to- do your own math . <p> Do you have the right credit cards for you ? Credit cards come with all kinds of perks and incentives . Do n't be taken in . Choose the perks that work for you " whether points , cash back or travel rewards " and ideally stick to one or two cards because carrying balances on too many cards at the same time can also ding your credit score . Most importantly , look for a low interest rate and no annual fee . <p> Is a HELOC right for you ? If you have enough equity in your home , a home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) can be a smart tool for accessing extra cash or consolidating debt . Plus , you can deduct the interest on up to $100,000 of home equity debt secured by your home , whether in the form of a regular loan or a revolving line of credit . <p> What 's your debt payment plan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on paying it down . If you have multiple cards , start with the highest interest card while making minimum payments on the others . Work down your list . Keep on top of other debts with on-time payments . Make it easier on yourself by putting as much as possible on auto pay . <p> Should you go on a cash-only diet ? If you want to break yourself of the credit card habit , try using cash only for 30 days , especially for nonessential expenses . It 's an eye-opening exercise that may help you think differently about how you spend your money . <p> Credit is a powerful and convenient tool when used with care .

Since it 's likely that you have different levels of discretionary income , this might make everyone feel more comfortable . <p> You could also consider buying a small physical gift , as well as make a charitable donation . There 's no right or wrong way to go about this , but you should all agree upfront so that everyone feels equally included . <p> Make it personalIt 's one thing to write a check to a charity in someone 's name and another to choose just the right charity that represents an individual 's interests .

This could be particularly helpful if you plan to make this type of gift-giving a yearly event . <p> Of course you can always write a personal check to the charity of your choice in the name of your friend . Organizations are usually more than willing to provide some sort of acknowledgement that you could then include in a personal card.And just for the record , if you make a donation to a qualified charity , it may be tax deductible but only if you itemize your deductions .

I 've heard something about an Earned Income Tax Credit but also hear that the qualifications are complicated . Is it worth pursuing for my daughter ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> You 're right that the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) , specifically designed to help lower-income working families , can be complicated . There are income qualifications and filing qualifications as well as eligible child qualifications . But do n't let that stop you . It 's absolutely worth the effort to sort out the details for your daughter . According to the IRS , over 26 million people nationwide received nearly $59 billion in EITC dollars in 2009 . If she 's eligible this year , it could mean a significant amount of money in her pocket . <p> The best resource for understanding the requirements is probably the IRS Earned Income Tax Credit Assistant at IRS.gov . By answering a few questions and providing some basic income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But before you go online , it 's a good idea to first understand some of the basics . <p> What the EITC is The EITC is a refundable credit for people who work but do n't earn high incomes ( generally speaking , less than $50,000 a year ) . The important distinction here is that unlike most other credits , the EITC is refundablemeaning that not only could your daughter 's tax bill be reduced , but she could actually receive money back . <p> Who is eligibleThree factors will determine your daughter 's eligibility : her earned income , which includes wages , tips , and self-employment income ; her adjusted gross income ( AGI ) , which includes earned income plus income from other sources such as investments ( investment income can be no more than $3,100 ) ; and the number of qualifying children she has . <p> Earned income and AGI for 2010 must each be less than : <p> $43,352 ( $48,362 married filing jointly ) with three or more qualifying children <p> $40,363 ( $45,373 married filing jointly ) with two qualifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one qualifying child <p> $13,460 ( $18,470 married filing jointly ) with no qualifying children <p> Another consideration is filing status . Married couples must file jointly to claim the credit . If your daughter is unmarried and filing as a single taxpayer , there 's no problem . If she 's married , but her husband did n't live in her home for the past six months , she could possibly file as head of household and still claim the credit . <p> How the children qualify So far , that seems reasonably clear . But the rules become a bit more complicated when it comes to defining a qualifying child for the EITC . In most cases , to qualify a child must have a valid Social Security number and be : <p> Younger than 19 ( 24 if your child is a full-time student ; no age limit for a permanently disabled child ) . <p> The taxpayer 's child by birth or adoption , or a stepchild or grandchild . Siblings and children of siblings ( nieces , nephews ) may also be considered , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the taxpayer 's household in the U.S. for more than half the year . <p> You do n't mention how many children your daughter has or the custody arrangement . If her children live with her for more than six months of the year , her situation may be quite straightforward . But if she and the children 's father share custody and there 's the possibility that they could each claim the children , they will have to decide who will claim them . In a situation like this with two children , the parents could decide to each claim one child . How much you can claim If you 're already thinking this is n't worth it , think againbecause the amount your daughter may be able to claim is significant . Depending on the amount of earned and adjusted gross incomes , qualifying taxpayers filing returns in 2010 can claim a credit for as much as : <p> $5,666 with three or more qualifying children <p> $5,036 with two qualifying children <p> $3,050 with one qualifying child <p> $457 with no qualifying children <p> Plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , increasing the benefit .

How can I convince her to get going ? - - A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> I wish I had enough space in this column to share with your daughter the myriad stories I 've heard from women about their retirement worries . At 29 , your daughter may feel she has lots of time to save , but just talk to someone 65 or 75 who 's struggling with limited retirement income , and the need to start saving early comes through loud and clear . <p> In fact , there 's been a fair amount of press recently about how women are falling behind in retirement savings . There are lots of explanations : women put others ' needs first ; or they believe they can rely on their husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to investing . But the hard truth is : we need to take care of ourselves . <p> Statistically , women live longer than menand according to a report by the Department of Health and Human Services , A Profile of Older Americans ( 2012 ) , almost half of all women 75 and older live alone . Yet , a publication by the U.S. Department of Labor ( DOL ) , Women and Retirement Savings ( 2013 ) , reports that only 45 percent of American working women participate in a retirement plan . Another hard reality is that women still earn roughly three-fourths of what men earn , which means their Social Security benefits are less . <p> To me , all this adds up to a clear wake-up callone that women would be smart to heed as soon as they start working . <p> But knowing you need to do it and actually getting started are two different things . You might open your daughter 's eyes with this information , but the way to really get her going might be to give her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details Help your daughter focus on her 401(k) options . First , does the company offer both a traditional and a Roth 401(k) ? Contributions to a traditional 401(k) are tax deductible , which would lower her taxable income now , however she 'd pay income taxes on withdrawals come retirement time . With a Roth 401(k) , there 's no upfront tax deduction , but withdrawals at retirement are tax-free . If it 's available , a Roth can be a good choice for a young person who will likely be in a higher tax bracket come retirement . <p> Next , have her find out if there 's a company match and how much that is . As an example , let 's say your daughter 's company matches 50 cents on the dollar of her 401(k) contribution up to six percent of her salary . At the very least , would n't she be able to contribute that six percent in order to gain an additional three percent ? - <p> Do the math- The longer your daughter waits to contribute to her 401(k) , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much money she already may have missed out on may be a good incentive to reprioritize . She should go over her fixed and flexible expenses to see where she could cut back . With some real numbers in front of her , it will be easier to figure out what percentage of her salary she could direct toward her 401(k) . She can start small and then increase the percentage as her salary increases . <p> Also , since a 401(k) contribution automatically comes out of her paycheck , she 'll quickly get used to living on a slightly smaller monthly income . <p> Have confidence The next step is for your daughter to get her savings working . Over the years , researchers have shown that women are less confident than men about investing and are more risk-averse . The DOL 's Women 's Bureau states that women tend to invest more conservatively than men . But while men may profess to be more confident and more comfortable with investment risk , this is n't necessarily the wisest approach " and can actually be detrimental in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what constitutes smart ' risk , which means looking at what you want to accomplish and your timeline , and then investing in a diversified mix of investments for the long term . <p> At 29 , your daughter can confidently take some smart risk . She has the time to ride out market ups and downs . You might review the investing choices in her 401(k) with her , and discuss the relative merits of each . Encourage her to choose a couple of diversified funds and watch what happens . <p> Do n't waste another minuteor dollar Your daughter may feel she ca n't afford to contribute to her 401(k) now , but I say she ca n't afford not to . She should consider that if she starts saving and investing now , she could stick with saving just 10 to 15 percent of her annual salary for the rest of her working life . However , if she waits , she 'll be facing the prospect of having to save 20 percent , 30 percent " or more . And if she does n't save at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure future in which she wo n't be able to comfortably afford even the basics .

@@49276570 @2776570/ <p> I 'm turning forty this year , and finally ready to start saving for retirement . If I contribute the maximum to my 401(k) every year , will I be okay ? - <p> A Reader <p> Dear Reader , - <p> First , congratulations . Sometimes making the first move is the hardest of all , so I applaud your decision . Also , you ask an excellent and often overlooked question . It 's understandable for us to assume that the government-allowed maximum 401(k) contribution ( in 2014 it 's $17,500 for those under 50 , or $23,000 for those 50 or older ) would be sufficientand sometimes it is . The reality , though , is that there is no magic number that works for everyone . To get a more reliable assessment , you have to take a deeper look . <p> First think about how much you 'll want to spend each year Just like at any other time of life , there is a huge range in retirement lifestyles . However , when we look at national statistics , we can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend . This makes a lot of sense when you consider that although some costs such as mortgage payments and work-related expenses may go down , others such as travel , entertainment and health care may go up . So as a general guideline , I always recommend planning to spend just about the same amount in retirement that you 're spending now . <p> Next , crunch your numbers So is saving $17,500 a year enough ? Here 's a way to do a quick estimate . <p> Say that you 'll want to spend $80,000 a year in retirement and that you expect to receive $30,000 in Social Security benefits . Your portfolio will need to generate the $50,000 difference . <p> The " 4 percent guideline " states that you can safely withdraw 4 percent of your portfolio 's value in your first year of retirement , increase that amount every year for inflation , and have a 90 percent level of confidence that your money will last for thirty years . <p> The corollary of this guideline is that your portfolio should be roughly 25 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , $50,000 x 25 equals $1.25 million . That 's the amount you will need to have saved on the day you retire . <p> Now it 's time to pull out the financial calculator . If you 're starting from zero , want to retire in 25 years ( when you 're 65 ) with a $1.25 million portfolio , and estimate that you can earn an average return of 6 percent , you 'll need to sock away about $21,500 a year . In other words , the government max of $17,500 is a little shy of your goal . <p> Of course your situation may be very different . You may want to retire earlier ( or later ) , or anticipate earning a higher or lower return . And we have n't factored in variables like your current savings or the impact of inflation . <p> However , this can give you an idea of a good first step . At some point , though , it would be a good idea to do a more precise calculation , perhaps with the help of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he or she can talk to you about your expectations and priorities , run different scenarios , and craft a personalized plan . <p> Be sure to count in an employer match Many employers will match a portion of your 401(k) contributions , in effect bumping up the amount that you can save every year . For example , if you currently earn $80,000 a year , and your employer matches up to 5% of your salary , that could mean an additional $4,000 per year of savings .

Property values in your area may have risen since you first took out the policy , so double check that your current coverage would actually pay replacement costs if your home was damaged or destroyed . <p> And remember , a homeowner 's policy generally covers possessions up to a specific dollar amount . If you 've accumulated a lot of valuables such as jewelry or art , you can get extra coverage up to the appraised value of the items .

Actually , the phrase long-term care may be a bit of a misnomer : someone with a broken hip , for example , may need this type of assistance for just a few months . Obviously , for short and simple problems , a family member can often provide the required care ( though that often results in an onerous burden ) ; more serious and lengthy issues require daily , in-home caregivers or care in a nursing home or an assisted-living facility . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> Will I need long-term care ? <p> Statistically , the answer is yes : you will probably need this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that clearly increases the probability . According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , at least 70 percent of people over age 65 will require some long-term care services at some point in their lives . <p> However , the statistical probability that you 'll need this type of care does n't mean you need LTC insurance . If you 're quite wealthy , you may choose to pay for your care out of pocket . Others may have children who can help either physically or financially . And finally , if you have a low net worth , you may qualify for Medicaid assistance . 132747 @qwx542747 <p> What does long-term care cost ? <p> Long-term care , particularly if required for a truly long time ( from many months to years ) , can be expensive . Costs vary dramatically depending on where you live . For example , according to the 2009 Genworth cost of care survey , home care services range from about $32,000 to over $50,000 per year . Nursing home care can range from about $44,000 to well over $100,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial security at risk , you may want to consider LTC insurance ( most health insurance policies and Medicare do not cover this type of care ) . It 's not cheap , but it may be worth it , especially if you purchase it when you 're relatively young . <p> According to the 2009 National Long Term Care Insurance Price Index , the average annual long-term care premium for a single person age 55 with a $150 daily benefit for three years is $1,590 . This rate doubles to $3,042 for someone aged 65. 132747 @qwx542747 <p> How do I buy long-term care insurance ? <p> If you decide to purchase LTC insurance , you need to shop around . LTC insurance premiums vary widely , so do some research to help gauge costs . The earlier you buy it , the cheaper it 's likely to be ( although you will of course be paying premiums for a longer period of time ) . But cost is n't the only consideration . Make sure you understand : <p> The coverage ( does it cover in-home care ? nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much will the policy pay you ? how long will it last ? ) <p> The waiting period , if any , before benefits kick in <p> The policy 's inflation protection ( health care costs typically rise faster than the general rate of inflation ) <p> How benefits are paid ( cash or reimbursement ) <p> A good agent who is truly representing your interests ( not the insurance company 's ) will be a tremendous help in purchasing LTC insurance , so it 's worth your time to find an agent you can trust .

In fact , you may be able to significantly lower your interest rate , depending on factors such as your credit score ( the higher your score , the better the deal ) , income and savings . <p> 2 ) Loan termsWhen you consolidate , you can either lengthen or shorten the term of your loan . <p> Repayment schedules with the Direct Consolidation Loan program range from 10-30 years . When you lengthen the term , your monthly payments may go down , but the amount of interest you pay in the long run will most likely go up . Increase a 10-year loan to 25 years and your monthly payment could go down about 40 percent ; however , you could end up paying almost twice as much interest over the life of the loan . Of course , you do have the flexibility to pay it off more quickly . <p> With a private lender , you may be able to considerably shorten the term but you 'll be tied into a higher monthly . <p> 3 ) Extra benefits Are there any extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments for direct debits or interest rate discounts when you pay on time . Take that into consideration . <p> Likewise , be aware of federal loan-repayment and forgiveness programs . For instance , federal Direct Loans qualify for income driven repayment plans where payments are capped at 10 or 15 percent of discretionary income . After 20-25 years of consistent , timely payments , the balance of the loan is forgiven . While not all federal student loans qualify for this program , a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan does . <p> Also , do you qualify for a loan forgiveness program such as the Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) , specifically designed for public service workers such as teachers , nurses and those in the military ? PSLF offers loan forgiveness after 10 years of payments . <p> Private loans may not qualify for these programs . If you combine your loans into one private loan , be sure to check that out . <p> Before you decide One potential benefit of having multiple loans is that it may provide you with more flexibility for repayment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years you 're in a position to write down your balance . By paying off a discreet loan , you would eliminate that payment entirely , reducing your monthly outlay . However , if you have consolidated all of your loans , you will be committed to the same monthly payment regardless of the remaining balance . <p> Another strategy would be to make additional principal payments to your highest interest loan while you continue to make the minimum monthly payments on your lower interest loans . That way you can pay off the highest interest loan first , and effectively lower your overall interest rate . <p> Weighing the pros and cons As you can see , consolidation is not a straightforward decision . You have to think beyond simplicity to how a new loan might affect your finances over time . Make sure you understand the consequences . <p> With this in mind , I suggest you do a little more research . Two good resources are the Department of Education ( www.ed.gov ) and Finaid.org . You might also want to check with your financial advisor who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your decision . <p> Realize , too , that student loans are getting a lot of political attention , so whatever you decide to do now , keep your eyes and ears open for any new opportunities in the future . 132771 @qwx542771 
@@49276588 @2776588/ <p> I was laid off and am seeking employment . I am 60 . Would you advise using my IRA funds in an emergency if my unemployment benefits end ? What would the penalties be for doing so ? <p> A- Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> The technical part of this question is easy to answer : There are no penalties for withdrawing money from your IRA once you 've reached the age of 59 -+ . ( Note to those younger than age 59 -+ : If you withdraw IRA funds early , you 'll likely face a 10 percent penalty in addition to the income tax on the amount of your withdrawal . There are some exceptions " for example , if you 're disabled or have extremely high medical expenses " but early withdrawals are typically penalized . ) So at age 60 , you can take as much money as you like out of your IRA , though of course withdrawals will be taxed as ordinary income . And if it 's truly an emergency " if you need that money to survive " by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about your IRA assets as a last resort . After all , our IRA is designed to help you retire comfortably . At age 60 , assuming you 're in good health , you may be need money from that IRA for another 30 years . So the longer you can postpone tapping that asset , the better . <p> Accordingly , I would use up any existing taxable account assets you have " like traditional brokerage accounts or mutual fund accounts outside your IRA " before starting to make withdrawals from your IRA . If you have investment gains , you 'll owe taxes as you realize them , but they may be subject to preferential long-term capital gains tax treatment . <p> But let 's say all your investment assets are in your IRA and that you will need some cash when your unemployment benefits stop . First , cut all unnecessary expenses . Second , consider taking part-time work or looking for an alternative job to help tide you over until you find a new job in your chosen field . The goal , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA . <p> And when you do make withdrawals , keep them to the minimum . You do n't need to take a year 's worth of money out at once . The goal should be to keep as much housed in your IRA as possible , to minimize your tax burden and to maximize your potential for future tax-deferred gains . ( For example , if you had to make a withdrawal between now and the end of the year , take out just enough to cover this year 's living expenses . That will reduce your tax liabilities next April . ) <p> Remember , too , that you 'll be eligible for Social Security in just two years when you reach age 62 . The traditional advice is to postpone taking Social Security as long as possible so that you can benefit from a considerably higher monthly benefit . In fact , your benefits will increase until you reach the age of 70 , after which it no longer makes sense to delay . However , if you have trouble finding work , and you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking Social Security benefits when you turn 62 " which will reduce the need to withdraw money from your IRA . <p> By the way , now 's a good time to look at the structure of your IRA portfolio . A proper answer is beyond the scope of this column , but you should speak with a retirement investment professional to help ensure your IRA can provide some potential for growth and help you meet your current living expenses . ( In fact , that 's good advice for anyone nearing retirement : What does your portfolio look like and how does it match up with your needs over the near term and over the course of your retirement ? ) <p> Bottom line ? At age 60 you wo n't have to pay a penalty for withdrawing funds from your IRA . ( You will , however , have to pay income taxes at your ordinary rate . ) But think of your IRA as a last resort .

@@49276590 @2776590/ <p> I hope to retire in about five years and am working on reducing my overall debt , including my mortgage . Should I put off retirement until I 'm completely in the black ? - <p> A Reader <p> Dear Reader , - <p> This is an excellent question , especially in light of a 2014 report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute ( EBRI ) indicating that 44 percent of retirees have concerns about their level of debt . To me , keeping control of overall debt is an important part of financial planning no matter what your stage of life . But a flat statement about eliminating all debt in retirement may be too simplistic . That 's because the amount of debt you can comfortably handle is very individual and depends on your bigger financial picture . <p> Start by looking at assets vs. liabilities plus cash flow The basic question is whether you 'll have enough retirement income to cover your debt payments . To figure that out , start with a simple net worth statement , listing your liabilities and your assets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in perspective . <p> Next , do a realistic estimate of your monthly retirement income and expenses . Add up your expected income from all sourcesSocial Security , pensions , real estate , savings , etc.and subtract your estimated expenses . Do n't forget to factor in recurring expenses such as taxes and insurance . And do n't underestimate potential healthcare costs . If you have considerable retirement savings as well as other sources of reliable retirement income that will cover your expenses including any debt , then carrying a mortgage , for instance , may not be an issue . <p> Qualify the type of debt you have Total debt is important , but so is the type of debt you have . Debt that is low cost and potentially tax deductible , such as a mortgage or student loans , may actually work in your favor . But high-cost consumer debtthings like car loans and , especially , credit card balancescan really derail you if you 're not careful . <p> This is the type of debt you should try to get rid of no matter what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're carrying multiple balances , prioritize your payments . Tackle the highest interest balances first , increasing payments if you can , while paying at least the minimum on your other balances . Work your way down the list until everything is paid off . <p> Consolidating balances on a low-interest card and maximizing that payment is another option . But beware of the potential high cost and hidden fees of loan consolidation offers . <p> Once you have your credit card debt under controland hopefully eliminated for goodstart upping the payments on a car loan . <p> Do the math on your mortgage Carrying mortgage debt in retirement can certainly be a budgeting challenge , depending on the percentage of your monthly income your payment represents . But in certain circumstances , if you have a low-interest , tax-deductible mortgage , it could actually make economic sense to keep it . <p> For example , if you have a fully deductible 5 percent fixed loan and your combined federal and state tax rate is 30 percent , your mortgage is really only costing you 3.5 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equivalent to a risk-free 3.5 percent return on your money . On the other , you might be able to invest those funds elsewhere at a potentially higher return . <p> So it really comes down to dollars and cents . If your monthly mortgage payment is going to represent a big chunk of your retirement income , you 're probably wise to try to pay it off in advance . However , if you 're confident you 'll be able to cover your mortgage in retirement without sacrificing other essentials , or if paying it off would dangerously deplete your savings , it could make more sense to just continue making your regular monthly payments . <p> Consider your feelings Numbers aside , if you 're convinced that being debt-free in retirement will give you the greatest sense of security , then that should be your focus . Get rid of consumer debt first . Make additional payments on your mortgage , as you 're able . And give yourself a realistic retirement timetableone that will allow you enough time to plan and save for a comfortable future . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

Is that true ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Great question . According to the 2012 Health Confidence Survey1 sponsored by the Employee Benefit Research Institute , 27% of workers said they 'd retire earlier if health insurance were n't an issue . So you 're in good company ! <p> And the good news is that you 've heard correctlyas of October 1 , many states and the federal government began offering health insurance plans , with coverage beginning in January 2014 . <p> In many cases , insurance premiums may be more affordable relative to the cost of current policiesespecially for those of us who are 50-plus . And subsidies are available at certain income levels , potentially bringing the costs down even more . Plus , and perhaps most importantly , you ca n't be turned down because of a pre-existing condition . <p> So , yes , the new healthcare law may make it easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of things to consider before you do . <p> Research your options The first thing to do is get the basic information from either your state 's exchange or the federal exchange . You can go to healthcare.gov to get started . You 'll find details on the types of plans offered , what they cost and how to enroll . Plans are categorized as Platinum , Gold , Silver and Bronze . All cover certain essential benefits , but premiums and out-of-pocket costs vary . <p> As you research the plans , keep your retirement budget in mind . Figure out how much you can afford to spend on premiums each month and how much you could handle in out-of-pocket expenses to cover deductibles , copays and coinsurance , as well as anything that may not be covered . <p> As an example , using the calculator developed by the Kaiser Family Foundation ( kff.org/health-reform ) , a Silver policy for an over-21 nonsmoker making $60,000 a year would have an annual premium of about $3,000 with maximum out-of-pocket expenses of $6,350 . A Bronze plan would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan would have higher premiums with a lower out-of pocket maximum . <p> Costs do vary depending on where you live and your age ( premiums for an older person ca n't be more than three times that of a younger person ) , but this gives you a general idea . <p> Manage your income to get possible subsidies Your income also comes into play . If your modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) is below certain levels , you may qualify for subsidies in the form of a premium tax credit . For instance , a family of two with an MAGI of up to $62,040 would qualify for a subsidy . <p> Your MAGI is made up of your household 's adjusted gross income plus added income such as Social Security , interest or foreign income . As a retiree , you may be in a position to control your MAGI with a bit of smart money management . <p> For instance , if you postpone taking Social Security until age 65 when you 'll be eligible for Medicare , you 'll lower your income as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payout . ( Health insurance aside , it 's generally a good idea to wait at least until your " full retirement age " or perhaps until you turn 70to file for Social Security benefits in order to get the maximum payout over time . It 's important to do the math ! ) Or perhaps you can minimize withdrawals from your retirement accounts to keep your taxable income lower . <p> When it comes to selling investments in taxable accounts , you could offset capital gains with capital losses . <p> This type of income management may sound simple , but it involves an honest assessment of your complete financial picture to determine how ready to retire you really are . This brings me to my next point . <p> Do n't stop at health insurance Health insurance is important , but it 's only one piece of your retirement plan . <p> Before you say goodbye to your employer , make sure you : <p> Have a realistic budget for everyday as well as periodic expensesand a reliable income stream to cover them . <p> Pay down consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Set aside enough cash to cover at least one year of spending . <p> Decide what to do with your 401(k) . <p> Review your investments to make sure they still match your goals and your feelings about risk . <p> Retirement is n't a point in timeit 's an ongoing experience . The new health insurance options may bring some costs down , but it will be up to you to make your money last . If you have n't done so already , talk to your accountant or financial advisor to make sure your timing is right . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

It 's easy to open and let 's you make fairly high annual contributions . It also gives you the flexibility to vary contributionsor skip them entirelyaccording to your yearly business needs . <p> A SEP-IRA can be ideal for a sole proprietor . Annual contributions can be as high as 20% of net self-employment income for an owner , up to $52,000 in 2014 . However , there are a few caveats if you have employees . <p> First , all contributions are made by the employer , not the employee .

As the employer , you 're only required to make a small matching contribution ( 1 to 3% of employee compensation ) . <p> While your obligation as an employer is less , the contributions you can make for yourself are also significantly lower than for a SEP-IRA or Individual 401(k) . That 's because the business owner is subject to the same contribution limits as employees . - A regular IRA : Still a smart personal choiceThe good news is that you can contribute to both a small business retirement plan and a regular IRA and potentially get a tax deduction for each , depending on your income . So I encourage your wifeand you , tooto contribute the maximum to an IRA each year .

There 's no doubt we 're living longer .

A lot depends on your own health and family history . However , to me , planning for the eventuality is key . <p> This was brought home recently by a colleague who shared her story .

So while your daughter may be used to asking you for money , she might actually be quite ready to take on some more financial responsibility . - Learning about money is a hands-on experience . To really understand how to make good choices , kids have to have some money of their own . I 'm a big proponent of giving kids a sense of financial control early on . An allowance is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a regular allowance for your daughter , now 's definitely the time . If she 's already getting an allowance , you might want to evaluate whether it 's enoughand then insist she use it to cover certain things , including some of the " extras . " - You may be surprised how quickly she learns to manage her own spending . <p> As an example , a friend of mine increased her son 's allowance so he could pay for lunches at school himself . It was n't long before he was packing his own lunch and saving that extra money for other things he wanted ! - Create a budget togetherFirst sit down together and list the things you expect your daughter 's allowance to coverlunches , movies , video games , maybe certain clothes . This would be the perfect time to suggest that savings also be listed as a budget item . Now add up her current allowance for the month plus any extra money she might get from gifts or a job . Have her do the math . Is she coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide together on a reasonable amount that will cover her expensesand make sure she understands that it 's up to her to prioritize her spending to make it work . <p> For an added lesson in budgeting , let your daughter plan a family trip or outing . Give her a set amount to work with and have her research and estimate expenses . Help her be creative in making choices that fit within the budget . Set up a real savings goalTo me , learning to save is one of the most important money management lessons . And there 's nothing like a goal to bring it to life . So while you 're talking about budgeting , also have your daughter write down a real goalsay a special evening out or a new phone . Having something concrete to save for will make it easier for her to set aside a certain amount from her monthly " income . " To encourage her , you could offer to match a portion of her savings . <p> As a further inducement , help her open a savings account at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See if your bank manager has a little time to talk to your daughter and perhaps give her an online banking demonstration . Following the growth of her savings online could be a real motivator . <p> There are also plenty of online savings calculators that can help your daughter figure out how long it will take to reach her goal . That 's a great lesson in itself ! <p> Let mistakes teach the hard lessonsIt may be a clichT to say we learn from our mistakes , but when it comes to spending , they 're a pretty effective lessonas long as we 're allowed to fail . So as hard as it may be at times , do n't always come to the rescue when your daughter finds she 's overspent . Instead , help her identify " spending leaks " and talk about ways to fix them . Suggest an online monthly budget planner to help her see clearly where her money is going . <p> Do n't hide your own money concernsMany parents avoid talking to the kids about family finances , but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to show them the money . Without burdening your daughter with details , share with her how you budget , what you save ( especially for her education ) , and the choices that are necessary to make ends meet . Knowing that you also have to prioritize may be an eye-opener . <p> At 12 , your daughter is on the cusp of even bigger financial decisions . It wo n't be long before she can consider things like a part-time job and a car . Use these milestones as opportunities to discuss credit and debt , saving for retirement , even investing . Far from boring , she may find these ideas exciting as she anticipates and experiences greater financial independence . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765 
@@49276602 @2776602/ <p> My partner and I got married in Massachusetts two years ago and are currently living there . We 're both anxious to take advantage of the benefits the recent Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage provides . What should we be doing ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Great question . Marriage represents a fundamental shift for any couple . And now that the recent Supreme Court ruling has opened the door for same-sex married couples to enjoy literally more than a thousand federal benefits previously only available to heterosexual married couples , it 's up to you and your spouse to take advantage of them . Many of these benefits are financial , making it easier to save and plan for the future . Of course , there are still a lot of issues to be clarified , but there are a number of things you can do right away to make the most of your new benefits . <p> It 's significant that you live in Massachusetts , one of the states that currently recognize same-sex marriage . At this point it is n't clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize same-sex marriage will be able to receive federal benefits , and if they do , how their state laws and benefits will align . Hopefully this will be clarified soon by the IRS , the Social Security Agency , and other federal agencies . In the meantime , however , you and your spouse are in the fortunate position of being able to plan your future with an eye on your new financial opportunities . <p> Decide how you want to file income taxes In the past , you may have filed your state income tax return as married , but had to file separate federal income tax returns . Now things are simpler . As long as your state recognizes same-sex marriage , you can also choose between filing a joint or separate federal income tax return . This does n't mean that your combined tax bill will necessarily go down ; in fact , it may go upespecially if you both earn a substantial and similar amount of money . I 'd have your accountant run both scenarios to see which is best . <p> Also run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The federal government generally allows you to amend your tax returns for the three prior years . If filing jointly works in your favor , it may be possible for you to amend your past returns and get a refund . The government has n't yet made a definitive statement on this , but why not be prepared ? <p> Review your health insurance options You can now be included on your spouse 's health insurance plan tax-free . Previously , same-sex married couples were treated as unmarried and had to pay income taxes on insurance benefits for the spouse . No more . <p> If you 're both working , check with each of your company 's HR or benefits departments to see which would give you the best coverage at the lowest cost . This is potentially a huge savings . <p> Another plus is that you 're also now entitled to family medical leave to care for a sick spouse or other family member . <p> Check your beneficiary designations Under the new ruling , your spouse is now the automatic sole beneficiary of your retirement assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 've made other beneficiary designations on your 401(k) or other employer retirement plan , contact your benefits department to update your beneficiary forms . <p> While you 're at it , double-check the beneficiaries on any IRAs or insurance policies . These things can easily be forgotten , so use this opportunity to bring everything up to date . <p> Consider your Social Security benefits Another big plus is that you 're now able to collect spousal and survivor Social Security benefits . The spousal benefit allows you to collect a Social Security benefit based either on your own work record , or up to 50 percent of your spouse 's benefit , whichever is greater . A surviving spouse can collect up to 100 percent of a deceased spouse 's benefit . Even some divorced spouses are eligible for some of an ex-spouse 's benefits . <p> While this may seem far in the future depending on your age , deciding when to file for Social Security merits careful consideration . There are a number of strategies spouses can use to maximize their combined benefit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other 's earnings record may factor in to any decisions about the financial viability of one or the other of you deciding not to workfor instance , to care for children . <p> Update your estate plan Some of the most significant benefits have to do with gift and estate taxes . Your gifts to each other wo n't be subject to gift tax . You can also leave an unlimited amount of money to your spouse without paying any estate tax . <p> Plus , if you inherit an IRA from your spouse , you can basically treat it as your own , and postpone taking required minimum distributions until the year you turn 70+ . This can potentially allow your assets to continue to grow tax-deferred until they are withdrawn . <p> These provisions may give you peace of mind that your spouse will be covered if something should happen to you , but that does n't mean you do n't need to put basic protections in place . So be certain that each of you have a will , a durable power of attorney for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life insurance needs In the past , some same-sex spouses have used life insurance to protect each other financially . But now , with the ability to gift and bequeath unlimited amounts of money to each other tax-free , you may no longer need as much . It 's worth reviewing your policies . <p> Talk to an advisor From retirement planning to estate planning to filing taxes to a myriad of employment , military and veteran 's benefits , marriage changes thingsfor everybody . For same-sex couples , there 's even more to think about , especially for couples who live in states that do n't recognize same-sex marriage . My advice is to consult an accountant or financial planner who is familiar with financial issues for same-sex couples . Best to do everything you can to take full advantage of what 's now available to youwithout taking anything for granted . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765 
@@49276604 @2776604/ <p> I was out of work for 14 months and had to dip into my retirement savings to make it . I am working again and want to " catch-up . " What strategies would you suggest to help ? Also , since I ca n't put that money back in the 401(k) , what sorts of accounts would be best to look at ? <p> A Reader- 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Fourteen months is a long stretch of unemployment , and it 's unfortunatebut entirely understandablethat you 'd need to tap your retirement account to stay afloat . I 'm glad to hear you 're working again , and elated to hear you want to get back on track with your retirement saving . <p> As your question acknowledges , you ca n't just put withdrawn money back into a 401(k) ( unless of course you borrowed from it ) . And unfortunately , as you learned , when you make what the IRS calls an " early distribution , " you have to pay a penalty in addition to taxes . So your savings have undoubtedly taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up ; following is a run-down : <p> #1 : Maximize your current 401(k) contribution Obviously , you want to take the full advantage of the retirement plan at your new jobwhether that 's a 401(k) , 403(b) , or another plan . As you probably know , 401(k) and similar plans are just too good a deal to pass up , given the fact that contributions are generally made with pretax dollars , and investment gains and income are untaxed until you start withdrawing the money when you retire . For 2012 , you can contribute up to $17,000 , plus an additional $5,500 if you 're 50 or olderwell over the $5,000 you can put into an IRA ( $6,000 if you 're 50-plus ) . If your company offers a matching contribution , then your 401(k) plan is even more appealing . Saving more is the easiest ( and most effective ) way to help build wealth . <p> #2 : Contribute to an IRA If you have n't already , you can also open an IRA . However , since you participate in your company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions to a traditional IRA if your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) is less than $58,000 ( this deduction is phased out for single filers with AGIs between $58,000 and $68,000 and for those married , filing jointly with AGIs between $92,000 and $112,000 . ) Or you may be eligible to open and contribute to a Roth IRA , again depending on your income . <p> #3 : Invest in a traditional brokerage account There 's no rule that says retirement assets must be held in a retirement account . You can always save and invest in a traditional brokerage account . Your investments are n't tax-deductible , of course , but there are no limits to how much you can save , and you can construct a tax-efficient portfolio to help reduce the drag of taxes on total returns . ( Talk to a good financial advisor for details . ) In fact , some people relish the flexibility of a brokerage account because it offers essentially unlimited investment options and you 'll never be forced to take a distribution . <p> #4 : Invest more aggressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution , you can consider investing more aggressively in an attempt to earn a higher return . Depending on your current holdings , your appetite for risk and your timeframe , it may be appropriate for you to shift a part of your portfolio from bonds or cash into stocks . But this requires a thorough understanding of the risk you might be assuming , including the potential for negative returns , and an appreciation of the importance of a long-term time horizon ( say , 5 years or more ) . Also realize that the potential return of a portfolio heavily weighted in stocks ( say more than 60 percent or so ) may well not justify the risk . So if you decide to go this route , I suggest working with a trusted , objective financial advisor to create a portfolio that has the potential to generate some extra performance and still offers a high degree of diversification . I realize this may be a daunting prospect , especially given the recent recession , but it can be an option you 'll want to consider . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you know that dipping into your retirement plan is something to be done only in an emergency . So I encourage you to do what you can to ensure you wo n't be in that position againby starting to build an emergency fund that is highly liquid ( like a money market account or laddered CDs ) . Then add to it every month until you have at least six month 's or even a year 's worth of living expenses .

If you set aside cash to cover a minimum of three to six months of essential living expenses in a designated account that 's easy to access , you 'll know you can survive . It 's fine to have a chunk in savings , but it 's even better to know that you have a certain amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the right insurance <p> If you do n't have health insurance , that 's number one . Yes , you may think you 're young and healthy and insurance is expensive , but consider that a single hospital stay could wipe out your savings . At the very least , get a high-deductible policy that would cover a catastrophic health event . Comparison shop , check out what 's available on your state 's exchange , but whatever it takes , make sure you have it . <p> Next , look into liability insurance. - Regardless of how conscientious you are , things can go wrong. - Best to be safe and purchase a comprehensive policy that covers general ( legal ) , professional ( your work ) , and product liability. - <p> And finally , research disability insurance . An emergency fund will cover you if you ca n't work for a short time , but what happens if you 're unable to work for an extended period ? Social Security offers some coverage , but it 's limited and the rules to qualify are quite strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into . It 's not inexpensive , but if you intend to keep working independently , I 'd recommend at least exploring your options . <p> Consider a health savings account ( HSA ) <p> While we 're talking about health insurance , I 'd like to suggest opening a health savings account . An HSA is available if you have a high-deductible health insurance policy . Current minimum deductibles are $1,300 for self-only coverage , $2,600 for a family . <p> An HSA makes sense because you can make tax-deductible contributions up to an annual maximum ( $3,400 for a single , $6,750 for a family in 2017 ) " and then use that money to pay for qualified medical expenses , tax-free . If you do n't use the total in any year , the money stays in the account and grows tax-deferred . You can withdraw funds for any reason penalty-free after age 65 , but you 'll pay ordinary income taxes on that type of withdrawal , just like with an IRA . Which brings me to the next important point . <p> Open a retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your savings , retirement should be at the top of your list . As an independent contractor , you have a few choices for retirement accounts : <p> Traditional IRA " Contributions may be tax-deductible and earnings grow tax-deferred . You can withdraw funds penalty-free after age 59-+ , but you 'll pay ordinary income taxes on withdrawals . The annual contribution limit for 2017 is $5,500 ( $6,500 if over age 50 ) . <p> Roth IRA " If your income ( in 2017 ) is under $133,000 for single filers or under $196,000 for married filing jointly , consider a Roth . You do n't get the upfront tax deduction , but earnings grow tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free after age 59-+ . That can make sense if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket come retirement time . Contribution limits are the same as a traditional IRA . <p> SEP IRA " A SEP is easy to set up and allows for higher annual contribution limits " up to the lesser of 25% of compensation or $54,000 ( 2017 ) . <p> Independent 401(k) " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution limits than a SEP . <p> I ca n't get into the details here , but an advisor at your financial institution could help you . You can also find information at irs.gov . At the very least , open an IRA and contribute the annual maximum . Start now in your 20s to put away just 10 percent of your annual earnings toward retirement , gradually increase that percentage 1-2% a year as you earn more money to target 15% and you 'll be in pretty good shape . That percentage goes up dramatically the longer you wait . <p> Become an investor not just a saver <p> Do n't stop with saving for retirement . Put that money to work by investing it in a diversified portfolio . An easy way to start is to buy a few shares of a broad based stock mutual fund or exchange traded fund ( ETF ) . There 's a lot of basic investing information online , but always be sure to ask questions and pay close attention to costs before you make a decision . <p> Keep up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , but for the record , as an independent contractor you 're responsible for all self-employment taxes for Social Security and Medicare . The 2017 self-employment tax rate is 15.3 percent . You pay this by filing quarterly estimated taxes . Fail to file and you 'll pay a penalty . ( Hint : Put the dates on your calendar ! ) To keep your tax bite lower , itemize your business expenses and keep good records . <p> Be your own CFO <p> As an independent worker , you 're your own boss but you also need to be your own CFO . That means carefully managing personal and business expenses both for the present and the long term . If you do that , you 'll know you 're on track for a financially secure future . That 's the ultimate freedom . <h> Subscribe : 132730 @qwx542730 <p> Investing involves risk including loss of principal . <p> ( 0517-ZSKL ) 132750 @qwx542750 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765 
@@49276625 @2776625/ <p> Can you put money in an IRA or a Roth IRA if you do n't have wage income ? <p> A Reader- 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Individual Retirement Accounts ( IRAs ) were introduced in the mid- ' 70s to help employees save for retirement and reduce their taxable income . So it stands to reason that to make a contributionand get the tax benefityou 'd have to have income from a job . And , in fact , contributions to both traditional and Roth IRAs can only be made from what the IRS determines to be " earned income . " However , wages are n't the only form of earned income . So let 's start by looking at the definition . <p> What 's considered earned income You do n't have to work for someone else to have taxable earned income . You can also work for yourself . Compensation from either type of employment would be considered earned income . But the complete definition is a bit broader . According to the IRS , taxable earned income includes : <p> Wages , salaries and tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minimum retirement age <p> Net earnings from self-employment <p> In terms of an IRA contribution , the amount of your earned income is also important . The maximum contribution you can make for 2011 is $5,000 ( $6,000 if you 're over 50 ) . But if your taxable income is less than the maximum contribution , you can only contribute up to the actual dollar amount of your earned income for the year . In other words , you ca n't contribute more to your IRA than you earn . <p> What about unearned income ? Because there are other ways to make money , it 's probably equally important to understand what 's not considered to be earned income . Things such as interest and dividends from investments , pensions , Social Security benefits , unemployment benefits , and child supporteven though they may factor significantly in your monthly bottom lineare n't considered earned income for tax and IRA contribution purposes . <p> The Spousal IRA exception Fortunately for married couples , there is one way to make a contribution to an IRA if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account designed specifically to allow a working spouse to make contributions on behalf of a nonworking spouse . Under current laws , if you 're married filing jointly , you can contribute the maximum into an IRA for each spouseeven if one of you has no earned incomeas long as the working spouse has income equal to both contributions . <p> So let 's say both you and your spouse are over 50 and want to contribute the maximum of $6,000 to each of your IRAs . Whichever one of you is working would have to have earned income of $12,000 or more to cover both contributions . <p> Another good thing about the Spousal IRA is that , should the non-working spouse go back to work , he or she can contribute to the same IRA . That 's because , once opened , a Spousal IRA is an Individual Retirement Account like any other . <p> Making retirement top priority no matter what Even if you do n't qualify for the tax advantages of an IRA or other type of retirement account , if you have income from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for retirementand save consistently . Open an investment account or other type of savings account , earmark it for retirement and direct a percentage of your income to that account each month . Ideally , you could set up an automatic transfer from your online checking account into your savings account to make it easier on yourself . Then , should your earnings situation change and you find you 're able to contribute to an IRA or participate in an employer-sponsored plan , you 'll be ahead of the game . <p> Important Disclosures All opinions expressed here are subject to change without notice in reaction to shifting markets , as well as changes in tax and estate planning rules .

And according to the 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey1 put out by the Employee Benefit Research Institute , you 're not alone : 26 percent of respondents said they have less than $1,000 saved . Those numbers are certainly concerning . But on the positive side , your question means you 're ready to take action " and that 's what you need to do , starting right now . <p> To retire at any age , you have to save , save , and save some more . Starting from scratch at 42 , you should ideally save 20-25 percent of your yearly salary . Chances are you ca n't sock this much away immediately , so you need to break things down into a workable strategy . Then , of course , you have to commit to actually following it . Here are some ideas . <h> Get a handle on your spending <p> If you do n't know what you 're spending , you ca n't save effectively . Try this to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . <p> Divide your expenses into two categories : nondiscretionary ( the must haves ) and discretionary ( the extras ) . - Put savings at the top of your nondiscretionary expense list . <p> If you need to cut back in order to save , focus on the extras such as dining out or entertainment . A good way to stay on top of those expenses is to go on a " cash diet " for 30 days for all your out-of-pocket expenses . It 's easier to spend when you just hand over a credit or debit card . Using cash makes you really focus on your purchase . <p> Even small changes in your spending habits can make a big difference . Think about it . Spend just $5 a day less on lunches or coffee and you could save over $1,800 a year . <h> Pay down your debt <p> And speaking of credit cards , make paying down any nondeductible consumer debt , such as credit card balances , a priority . If you have multiple cards , pay off the one with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off debt , you can put that money into savings . <h> Put money in a 401(k) or IRA <p> You say you have n't saved anything . Does this mean your employer does n't offer a 401(k) or that you just have n't contributed to it ? If you can take advantage of an employer-sponsored retirement plan like a 401(k) , do n't waste another minute . Contribute as much as you can " certainly up to any company match . This is one of the best , automatic ways to save . And if your contribution is pre-tax , it wo n't even affect your take-home pay that much . <p> If a 401(k) or similar plan is n't an option , open an IRA or a Roth IRA , if you 're within the income limits ( phased out between $117,000-$132,000 for singles ; and $184,000-$194,000 for married filing jointly ) . Currently , you can contribute a maximum of $5,500 a year . That 's only about $15 day . Can you carve this much out of your daily budget by , for instance , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Retirement accounts like these are effective because earnings grow tax-deferred ( tax-free in a Roth ) . This can make a significant difference in the potential for growth over time . At your age , you still have time ahead of you " but the sooner you get going , the better . <h> Think differently <p> So often , as soon as we get some extra cash , we think about how we want to spend it . Now 's the time to change that thinking . Instead of spending : <p> Try saving all or at least a portion of any annual salary increase . <p> If you get an annual bonus , earmark part of it for retirement . <p> Invest any tax refunds into your IRA . <p> By putting this extra money aside , you 're not really depriving yourself . You 're setting yourself up for something better in the future . It 's all in the way you think about it . <h> Be realistic about retirement <p> You say you want to retire at 65 , but people today are retiring later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build up a bigger retirement nest egg . Others decide to keep working part time to supplement their savings and because it keeps them active and engaged . <p> There 's no magic number or formula for a perfect retirement . There 's only one common denominator " the need to save . So start now and stick with it . It wo n't necessarily be easy , but the amount you can save today will ease the burden of having to save much more down the road . Ultimately , this will help you at whatever age you choose to retire . <h> Subscribe : 132730 @qwx542730 132766 @qwx542766 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765 
@@49276630 @2776630/ <p> A 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement plan " if you 're lucky enough to have one " can be considered the backbone of your retirement savings . Contributions are easy because they automatically come out of your paycheck ; you may get an upfront tax deduction ; and annual contribution limits are sizeable " $18,000 for tax-year 2015 , plus a $6,000 catch-up for those age 50 or older ( both up $500 over 2014 limits ) . - That means , depending on your age , you could contribute up to $24,000 in 2015 . Plus , if you get an employer match , that 's extra savings in your pocket . Add tax-deferred growth of earnings , and what 's not to like ? <p> But as positive as all this is , there 's a good case for having an IRA in addition to your 401(k) . An IRA not only gives you the ability to save even more , it might also give you more investment choices than you have in your employer-sponsored plan . And if you have a Roth IRA , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But the type of IRA that makes sense for you personally will depend on your filing status and your income , so there 's a bit more to consider . <p> Tips for choosing the type of IRA that 's right for you <p> There are two types of IRAs : a traditional tax-deductible IRA and a Roth IRA . For 2014 and 2015 , the annual contribution limit for both is $5,500 with a $1,000 catch-up if you 're age 50-plus . <p> However each IRA does have an income ceiling that will determine whether one or the other is right for you . <p> Traditional tax-deductible IRAFor someone who does n't have a 401(k) or similar plan , a traditional IRA is fully tax-deductible . Upfront tax-deductibility plus tax-deferred growth of earnings are two of the pluses of this type of IRA . However , if you participate in an employer sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k) , tax deductibility is phased out at certain income levels . For tax-year 2015 , the levels are $61,000-$71,000 for single filers , $98,000-$118,000 for married filing jointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get any upfront tax deduction , but you do get tax-free growth plus tax-free withdrawals at age 59-+ as long as you 've held the account for five years . And there 's no restriction if you participate in an employer plan . However , there are income limits that determine whether you 're eligible to open and contribute to a Roth . In 2015 , the limits are $116,000-$131,000 for single filers , $183,000-$193,000 for married filing jointly . <p> There are a couple of other things to consider when choosing between IRAs , the main one being whether you believe you 'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket when you retire . That 's because withdrawals from a traditional IRA are taxed at ordinary income tax rates at the time of withdrawal ; qualified Roth withdrawals , as I mentioned , are tax-free . Also there 's no required minimum distribution ( RMD ) for a Roth , but with a traditional IRA , you 'll have to begin taking an RMD at age 70+ . <p> A Roth 401(k) " another option worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA , if your employer offers a Roth 401(k) , you might also consider adding this to your retirement savings strategy . There are no income limits to participate in a Roth 401(k) , and you can have both types of 401(k) at the same time . Having both does n't mean you can contribute more than the total annual 401(k) contribution limit , but you can split your contributions between the two , giving you a combination of both taxable and tax-free withdrawals come retirement time . <p> Making your 401(k) and IRA work together <p> The goal of all this is to give you the greatest opportunity to save , with the greatest flexibility . So my thought would be to first contribute enough to your 401(k) to capture the maximum company match . Then , if you 're eligible " and especially if your 401(k) has limited investment options " open either a traditional or a Roth IRA and contribute the annual maximum . Next , if you can , put more money in your company plan until you max it out . And if you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kudos ! ) , put that money in a taxable brokerage account . <p> The bottom line is you ca n't really save too much , only too little . So use all the savings and investing vehicles available to you , including both an IRA and your 401(k) , to save as much as you can , as early as you can " and , at the same time , get the maximum tax break .

@@49276632 @2776632/ <p> Last week I wrote about teaching basic money skills to young kids . That 's important , but it 's even more crucial for teens to understand things like budgeting , saving and making smart spending decisions . In an uncertain economic world , these kids are going to have to take care of themselves financially . Are they getting prepared ? Read on for an eye-opening assessment of financial literacy in the U.S.and some ideas on how you can help your teen down the right path . <p> A recent financial literacy test administered by the Program for International Student Assessment ( PISA ) should be a wake-up call for American parents . In this first-of-its-kind international assessment released in July 2014 and given to 29,000 15-year-olds from 18 countries , U.S. teens fell below half of their peers . <p> We 're not just talking about math skills , we 're talking about practical everyday financial skills like understanding an invoice , reading a bank statement , calculating interest , or being aware of income taxes . It 's rare for kids to learn these financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in math ) , so it 's up to us parents to supplement our kids ' educations with some important financial lessons . <p> Give teens real financial responsibilities To really get teens ' attention when talking about finances , you have to give them something real to work with . For instance , the concept of making smart spending choices only has teeth if teens have to cover some of their needs and wants with their own money . <p> An allowance is a great way to provide this experience as long as it 's tied to specific expenseswhether that 's lunches , gas , clothing or entertainment . This helps kids learn to budget and prioritize . You might take it a step further by sharing your monthly budget and then helping your teens create their own budget with an online planner . <p> The same goes for saving . The best motivation is a concrete goal . As an example , a friend of mine was always willing to help her kids pay for something special provided they were willing to come up with half the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that saving be a line item on their budget . <p> And do n't forget about college , probably the largest savings goal of all . Even if your son or daughter wo n't be contributing to their education , they should be aware of how much college costs and the tradeoffs you 're making to pay for it . <p> Teach money management basics with checking and savings accounts Managing a checking account is a basic skill you only learn by doing . As soon as teens have money to handle , help them open an account ( preferably one without fees ) , and make sure they can write a check , use a debit card and balance their account . Show them how to use online banking tools to keep track of spending and account balances . <p> You might also suggest linking savings and checking accounts to make savings automatic . These are things we adults take for granted but that even the most advanced math student has to be taught . <p> Establish good credit habits early Misuse of credit is a leading cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtual necessity today . The answer ? Teach your kids to use credit responsibly . <p> Teens under 18 ca n't get a credit card unless it 's prepaid or they have a co-signer , so their first taste of using credit will be controlled . But it 's crucial that they understand how credit worksand how quickly interest and fees add upso that they make smart choices when they 're on their own . An online cost-of-credit calculator can be an eye-opening lesson in how things can get out of control . <p> Stress the importance of paying the entire balance on time each month and make your teen responsible for paying it . Also , stress that bad credit habits lead to a bad credit report , which can follow you for years , making it difficult to borrow for more important things down the road . <p> Use a first job as an income tax lesson A first paycheck can be exciting . It can also be a big shock when teens see how much is taken out by the government . You can forewarn them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , Social Security withholding and Medicare taxes . Go over the Form W-4 at the start of your teen 's job , then reinforce the lesson when the first paycheck arrives . <p> Come tax time , you can take it further by reviewing the W-2 or 1099 together , and helping your teen file a first tax return if necessary . <p> Introduce basic investing with a goal As your kids learn more about managing their money , introduce them to investing . Once again , make it real by suggesting that you invest together toward a long-term goal such as college or a post-graduation trip . Consider opening a Custodial account you control until your teen hits 21 . <p> You could then each contribute to it and make investment choices together . Be sure to talk about ways to control risk , including diversification and appropriate asset allocation .

So in the spirit of the season , here 's my annual ' financial shape-up ' column . <p> But before you read on , here 's something to think about : it 's not about how many resolutions you make , but how many you 're actually able to keep . Just as it 's easier to stick with resolutions to shape-up physically if you have concrete and realistic goals , giving yourself some attainable financial goals will help you developand stick witha financial program that will produce results . <p> Keep these goals front and center as you take these recommended steps to a more financially secure 2016 . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in making positive changes . Look at what you own and what you owe to find out if you 're in the red or the black . An online worksheet can help you easily add up assets and subtract liabilities to get a snapshot of your current net worth . If you have net worth statements from previous years , review and compare them to help understand your financial trendsand decide where to make changes . <p> 2 ) Look at last year 's spending . Is your money going where you really want it to go ? It will if you spend mindfully . Basically this means making spending decisions in the context of your goals . So if one of your top goals is to build your retirement nest egg , do you need to spend less to save more ? Does taking that big vacation mean dining out less often ? Whether or not you need to reprioritize spending , having an awareness of patterns will help you make better decisions throughout the year . <p> 3 ) Make a 2016 budget . Now that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your budget for 2016 . Track your spending for a month to see where your money is really going . Do you need to make adjustments " a little more here , a little less there ? Take a fresh look at your essential and nonessential expenses ( an online calculator can help ) . If during the year you have to spend beyond your budget , decide then and there how you 'll bring things back into balance . Do n't let overspending become a habit . <p> 4 ) Get on top of debt . Not all debt is bad ( for instance , a mortgage ) , but there 's really nothing good about carrying a credit card balance . Systematically pay down balances by focusing on higher interest cards first . Once you 're at zero , resolve to charge only what you can pay off each month . <p> 6 ) Review your insurance coverage . Certain types of insurance are essential : health , car , homeowners or renters insurance . Make sure you have adequate coverage for these important things . You might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peak earning years ; an umbrella policy if you have significant assets ; and life insurance if you have dependents . But be cautious about insurance you probably do n't need . To me , money for things like life insurance for children , flight insurance , or even rental car insurance is better spent elsewhere. - <p> 7 ) Check your progress towards retirement . This is a big one . Whatever your age , you should be saving regularlyideally , automaticallywhether it 's through an employer plan , an IRA or both . Use the New Year as a motivation to review your retirement goal and see if you 're on target . If not , ramp up your savings . If you 're just starting to save and you 're in your 20s , 10 to15 percent of your annual salary should do the trick . In your 30s , you should earmark 15 to 25 percent toward retirement . In your 40s and older , you 're looking at 25 to 35 percent . <p> 8 ) Rebalance your portfolio . This is the ideal time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do a 2015 year-end review , start 2016 by looking at your asset allocation and making changes to keep your investments on track with your goals and timeline . Take advantage of online tools and quarterly reports available from your broker . If your investments have grown beyond your comfort level in managing them , seek out a financial advisor who can partner with you throughout the year . <p> 9 ) Create/review your estate plan . You may not need a complex plan , but do n't put off creating at least a simple will , particularly if you have minor children . Review beneficiary designations on your retirement accounts and insurance policies , especially if you 've had a life change such as a new baby , marriage or divorce . An advance health care directive is also a necessity to protect both yourself and your loved ones . <p> 10 ) Keep the dialogue going ! Lastly , make money an ongoing topic of conversation . Talk to your spouse about your plans and decisions .

You might be surprised at how amenable they are . - <p> Gym memberships and other things you do n't use " We all have the best of intentions . Of course , we 'll go to the gym several times a week . No way will we miss a performance at the opera . But be realistic . Unused gym memberships are a classic waste of money . Likewise , unused season tickets .

What do you recommend ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> As I 've said many times , I 'm all in favor of one generation helping another . That usually is interpreted to mean parents or grandparents helping the kids . But as people are living longer and experiencing longer retirementswith the corresponding drain on their nest eggsI think it 's wonderful when kids can turn the tables and help their parents . It 's especially great if it 's not a huge strain on the kids ' finances . <p> So it sounds like your mother is one lucky lady .

That will give her the confidence that you 're doing okay . <p> The next logical step is to talk about her finances . What are her income sources ? Does she have enough to cover her essential expenses such as housing , food and insurance ? What trade-offs does she have to make ? By looking at her budget with her , perhaps you 'll see places where she can make different choices so that she does n't have to skimp in one area or another . <p> Helping her manage her money better will give your mother a greater sense of independence .

Pinpoint one area where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is living on a tight budget , she may be denying herself something that you feel is essential to her well-being and safety .

The formula is : <p> As we saw from the tax rate schedules , you pay a proportionately larger amount of taxes on higher amounts of income .

This includes your state income tax rate plus your federal income tax rate . So , if you pay 20 percent in federal taxes and 5 percent in state taxes , your combined rate is 25 percent . This number is especially important when calculating your return on an investment .

@@49276653 @2776653/ <h> Key Points <p> A credit score is a tangible way to measure a person 's attitude toward financial responsibility . <p> Building your credit score might be a smart romantic as well as a smart financial move . 132742 @qwx542742 <p> Imagine this scenario : Over a wonderful dinner , you and your sweetheart have discussed the future , what you each want out of life , your dream house , the possibility of a family , and everything seems to be pointing to your happiness . Then the love of your life graciously offers to pick up the tab , hands over a credit card " and the card is n't accepted . And then a second credit card gets the same response . Oops . Should warning bells go off ? Or at least a caution light ? <p> I 've always believed that finance and romance should go hand-in-hand and that couples need to be as open and honest about their financial feelings as they are about everything else . In fact , a study released last summer by researchers at the Brookings Institution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for couples down to a very quantifiable number : your credit score . The study proposes that matching high credit scores can indicate not only financial compatibility but also a strong romantic match . <p> So as Valentine 's Day approaches , I thought I 'd give my readers ' love lives a potential boost by talking about the best way to boost their credit scores . Because if there 's one thing that can dampen the romance in a relationship , it 's not being able to get that loan or that mortgage " or even that perfect job " due to lousy credit . <h> Five steps to better credit <p> Before we get into how to build a better credit score , let 's talk about why it 's important . Your credit score is n't just about your ability to borrow money . It can affect many aspects of your life . Some companies use credit scores in making hiring decisions , landlords can use credit scores to screen rental applicants , and some insurance companies use your credit score to help determine your premium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit report for seven years , so mishandling credit today can haunt you for years to come . <p> What can you do now ? If you do n't know your current score , you can purchase it from one of the three major credit bureaus ( Equifax , Experian , or TransUnion ) . Or better yet , some credit card issuers will provide credit scores for free , so be sure to check with your provider first. - To put things in perspective , the top score is 850 ; the median is 725 ; and 760 or higher will typically qualify you for the best deals . Then , whatever your score , take these steps to keep it as high as possible : <p> Pay your bills on time " Paying your bills on time and in full where possible is the best thing you can do . This alone accounts for about 35 percent of your score . <p> Use credit cards with care " How much and how often you borrow makes up 30 percent of your score . Keep your credit card balances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Increase the length of your credit history " The longer you have credit ( and use it wisely ) , the better your score . Your history accounts for 15 percent of your score . <p> Minimize new credit requests " Applying for multiple credit cards or loans in a given period of time can lower your score . New credit requests account for 10 percent . <p> Hold different kinds of credit " About 10 percent of your score depends on the type of credit used . A consumer with revolving debt ( i.e. , credit cards ) , a car loan , and a mortgage , and who keeps up payments , will have a higher score than someone who uses just one form of credit . <h> Why couples should talk about this <p> I believe the way people handle money says a lot about them . It can indicate a sense of responsibility or lack of one . It can suggest how trustworthy a person is . And it can reveal attitudes about planning and working toward a goal . Ultimately , how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things are relative and difficult to quantify , but a credit score is pretty tangible . Of course , your score can be affected by things out of your control . For instance , if you lose your job , you may end up being late on your bills .

@@49276655 @2776655/ <p> My 22-year-old son graduated from college this spring . Now he 's struggling to find a good joband I 'm struggling with how to help him transition into the real world . How can I help him get his footing ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> This is a tough one for us as parents . After paying for a high-priced education , it 's hard to see our kids in low-paying jobs that do n't relate to their ultimate career aspirations . However , according to a 2014 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , 44 percent of recent college graduates hold jobs that do n't require a bachelor 's degree . <p> To put this in perspective , it 's important to realize that this has been pretty much the norm for the past several decades .

It 's great if you 're in a position to help your son financially , but be sure to make your support specific . Here are a couple of thoughts on how to do this . <p> Let 's say your son is living at home ( according to a 2013 Pew Research report , 56 percent of kids 18-24 are ! ) and finds a part-time job . Start by discussing his expensestransportation , food , clothes , entertainment , credit card balances , student loan payments , possibly even rent paid to you to cover his share of household expenses .

Then , you could consider supplementing his paycheck to help cover his essentialsproviding you can afford to do so . <p> Or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how you 'll help support him . Ask to see his budget so you know exactly where your money is going . You wo n't be helping him achieve independence if you pay for everything . <p> Give him an incentive to save Saving is one of the hardest things to do on a small salary , but one of the most important no matter how much you make . So encourage your son to open a savings account where he can sock away money for an apartment , a car , or other goals . Also talk to him about the importance of an emergency fund . As an incentive , you could offer to match a portion of his savings . <p> Once he has earned income , encourage him to take advantage of his 401(k) if his company offers one ; otherwise have him open a Roth IRA . Again , you might offer to match his savings , or contribute a certain amount with the proviso that he adds a percentage of his own income every month . <p> A colleague of mine did this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pleasure of seeing her not only saving regularly , but managing a growing retirement account and handling her own investing . Which brings me to the next point . <p> Show him the money It can be hard to talk about money , but now 's the time . Show your son how you invest and manage your portfolio . Talk about your approach to risk and return . Give him some facts and figures to make it real . <p> Online tools are a great way to introduce investing concepts and basic portfolio construction . There are a number of websites that provide investing basics as well as tools and calculators that demonstrate how even a small amount in a diversified investment can grow over time . <p> Then help your son choose his first investment . With some seed money in his IRA , investing can come aliveand hopefully inspire a life-long interest . <p> Use your connections With the majority of resumes submitted online and competition in the thousands for even the most entry-level jobs , a personal connection is invaluable . If you have professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's area of education and interest , do n't be shy about approaching them for help in his job search .

And we parents have to understand our kids ' challenges and the time it takes to land a job . <p> Keep talking openly with your son about his goals as well as your expectations .

@@49276665 @2776665/ <p> My 20-something son is all for using Apple Pay for his purchases . While I 'm no technophobe , these types of easy payment systems make me nervous . Am I just being old fashioned ? <p> A Reader 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Thanks for giving me a chance to weigh in on a topic that is understandably on a lot of people 's minds right now . There 's been a great deal of talk about Apple Pay as well as other payment methods such as Google Wallet and PayPal and how these systems are changing the way we pay for our purchases . <p> Like you , I find the technology intriguing and I 'm all for ease and convenience . That said , I do have some concerns , not around the system itself , but around how it affects people 's control " or lack of control " over their spending . <p> But let 's start by looking at the benefits. - <p> Ease of use is a plus According to recent press , it appears that Apple Pay is ahead of the pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set up on your iPhone 6 or Apple Watch , it does n't require a special app or a separate account , and it 's free . <p> And it could n't be easier to use . Once it 's set up , your mobile device carries a digital version of your credit and debit cards plus your fingerprint . When you put your device near what 's called a Near Field Communication payment terminal , an image of your credit or debit card appears . Rather than the old-fashioned method of swiping your card , you simply touch the Home button thumbprint and Apple Pay communicates with your bank. - <p> It 's more secure than carrying multiple cards While a lot of folks may initially worry about security , Apple Pay may actually be a far more secure method of payment because you never physically hand your card to someone else . Just think " no one sees your card , your number , your security code or even your name . Plus , each communication with your bank triggers a unique number for that specific transaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your phone is another worry . But there 's a Find Your Phone app to suspend or permanently remove the ability to pay from the lost device . Alternatively you can contact your bank to suspend the service . To understand more about Apple Pay 's security measures , contact your bank or go to apple.com for the latest information . <p> Tech aside , you 're still stuck with the bill No matter how easy it is to pay for something , we 're still talking about credit and debt . And it 's pretty well known ( and well documented by behavioral economists ) that people tend to spend more when using credit than when paying with cash . <p> Credit cards remove us one step from the awareness of what we 're actually spending . Signing your name to a $100 charge does n't carry the weight of handing over a $100 in cash . So my concern is , if we do n't even have to take out the card and can just pay with a single touch , are we even farther away from understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help avoid going overboard on credit card spending is to link Apple Pay to a debit card in addition to or instead of your credit card accounts . Although it 's not the same as paying with cash , knowing you 're depleting a cash account can help prevent running up an over-sized credit card balance . <p> In other words , no matter how compelling the technology , I believe there 's a bit of old-fashioned money management wisdom that needs to hover nearby . Because , while we 're making it easier than ever to run up debt , it remains just as hard to pay it off if you 're not mindful of your spending . Using a payment method like Apple Pay can feel like a game , but the rules of budgeting , the difficulty of living within one 's means , and the importance of saving must n't get lost in the fun . <p> I suggest having a few more conversations with your son . Get onboard with the technology . Learn what you can from him . But in return , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that he understands the need to control spending and debt , how interest can add up , how misuse can impact your credit rating and how this can affect your future ability to borrow . Encourage him to set goals and begin saving for retirement . <p> Past technological advancements from bank debit cards to online investing have helped us simplify and take greater control of our time and our finances . I believe that digital payment systems like Apple Pay can do the sameas long as we realize that it 's not just the technology that 's important , but how we use it . And using it wisely is the key . <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765 
@@49276667 @2776667/ <p> My girlfriend and I are both financially stable and each of us owns our own home . We 've decided to move in together and are planning to live in her house . Can you give us some money management tips on how best to handle our finances at this point in our relationship ? - 132745 @qwx542745 132741 @qwx542741 <p> Moving in together is a big emotional step . It 's also potentially a big financial stepwhich can impact a relationship positively or negatively , depending on how open each partner is about money . <p> In a situation like yours where you 're each financially independent , you may not be too concerned about who 's picking up the tab for dinner , but shared daily living expenses as well as bigger issues regarding things like mortgages , large purchases , vacations and future plans could cause problems . <p> There 's no single recommended way to handle your finances . The details will vary for each couple . The most important thing is that you agree upfront on how to handle them . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd make a date to talk through how financially close you each want to be . <p> Start with the living arrangements Since you 'll be moving into your girlfriend 's house , and assuming she has a mortgage , the first question is how you 'll contribute to the monthly payment . Will you initially pay the equivalent of rent ? If so , how will you determine what 's fair ? <p> The issue here is that , by paying rent , you 're contributing to the mortgage without having any ownership in the property . If you continue to live together long term , at what point would you want a share of ownership ? And what percentage of ownership ? It 's easy as time goes on to say " our house , " but for it to legally belong to both of you , the title needs to be in both of your names . Otherwise , you could quite literally be left out in the cold should the relationship end . <p> On your side , what will you do with the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If you sell , you could possibly invest some of the proceeds in your girlfriend 's house , therefore increasing your share of ownership in her home . There again , the title would have to be legally changed . ( Note : If you decide to sell your house , think about completing the sale within the next three years . Otherwise , you will potentially forfeit your homeowner capital gains tax exclusion . Check with your tax advisor for details . ) <p> I 'm not trying to make it more complicated than it needs to be , but there 's a lot to think about . A home is often an individual 's greatest asset , so it 's important for the two of you to agree on these things sooner rather than later . <p> Discuss big-ticket items Living together often means investing in major purchases for your home from time to timeappliances , entertainment systems , furniture . Talk about how you 'll handle these potential costs . Will you share them equally ? Each pay for different items ? Again , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will make it a lot easier when the time comes if you have an idea in advance how you 'll handle these expenses . <p> Likewise with things like entertainment and vacations . There 's no harm in treating one another , but make sure you have a mutual understanding about the things you want to do . Agree on a savings and cost-sharing plan so that neither of you always feels obligated to cover for the other . <p> Drill down to the day-to-day Sharing a home also means sharing the ongoing costs such as utilities , cable , Internet , cleaning services , groceriesall the daily expenses that can add up quickly . Figure out how you 'll divide these costs . One approach is to come up with a monthly household budget , then each contribute an equal amount . If one of you earns more than the other , that person could offer to cover a greater percentage of the bills . Once again , the main point is to be fair . <p> To make things easier for both of you , consider opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if one of you is primarily responsible for handling the bills , you each have access to the account . A joint account would also allow you to comfortably put certain recurring bills on auto-pay . <p> Keep an eye on the future In the early days of living together , it 's probably wisest to keep the majority of your finances separate . As your relationship continues or should you marry , you can decide how much you want to share . Some couplesespecially those who join their lives when they 're already financially establishedset up a yours , mine , and ours ' system , allowing them to keep their accumulated assets separate while combining their incomes and sharing expenses . <p> Down the road , I would also suggest that the two of you meet with a financial advisor . An objective and knowledgeable third party can help you understand your options and create a framework that is fair to both of you . <p> I 'm a firm believer in financial independence for everyone at every stage of life . But that does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At this point , take it a step at a time . Just be sure to discuss each step in advance so you know it 's fair to both of youand that you 're both headed in the same direction . - <h> Subscribe : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765

@@49276696 @2776696/ <p> As careful as you might be in managing your money , there are certain mistakes that can sneak up on you . You might be tricked into thinking they 're no big deal , but even seemingly small mistakes can have some pretty disastrous results . Here 's my list of the 10 scariest money mistakesand what you can do to avoid them. - - 1 . Living beyond your means . When was the last time you put something on a credit card because you did n't have the money to buy it ? Or how often have you chosen a high-priced item when a lower-cost version would work just as well ? Do this regularly and you can easily end up with a stack of bills and not enough money to cover them . The solution ? Create a budget you can live with . Divide your expenses into two categories : needs and wants . Put dollar amounts beside each entry . Then , add up your income . Can you cover everything ? If not , you need to prioritize . Pay for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can handle with cash . You 'll enjoy them moreand you wo n't have to fear the bill . <p> 2 . Putting retirement last . Retirement does n't seem so scary when it 's far in the future , but when you 're staring it in the face with very little savings , it can make you turn as white as a ghost . So put retirement first " even before saving for a house or a child 's education . Contribute at least enough to your 401(k) to capture any company match . If you do n't have a 401(k)or even if you doopen an IRA and contribute as much as you can toward the yearly maximum . The earlier you start , the more time you have for your savings to grow . <p> 3 . Not having an emergency fund . Have you ever been faced with a medical crisis or a job loss ? These are emergencies that can really make your hair stand on end if you 're not prepared . Ideally , you should strive to have three-to-six months of necessary living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or short-term CD . In retirement , it 's wise to have at least a year 's worth of cash set aside to cover expenses . <p> 4 . Carrying credit card debt month to month . Let 's say you have a $5,000 balance on your credit card and you 're making the minimum monthly payment ( usually interest plus 1% ) . It would take 264 months ( 22 years ! ) to pay this balance off . Plus , you 'd end up paying $5,330.33 in interest alonefor a total cost of more than $10,000 for your original $5,000 purchase . Those numbers are pretty terrifying ! Always pay as much as you can each month to bring your balance down quickly . <p> 5 . Letting health insurance lapse . A 2011 study1 by the International Federation of Health Plans reports that the cost of a one-day hospital stay in the United States can range from around $1,500 to over $11,000 . Scared yet ? Now add in things like doctor 's fees , surgery , and special tests . A single illness or accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires everyone to have insurance . And from a purely financial standpoint , it 's essential . <p> 6 . Trying to time the market . Market swings can spook even the most experienced investors but try to keep your emotions under control . It 's nearly impossible to always buy low and sell highor to get in and out of the market at just the right time . In fact , you could lower your returns substantially by staying on the sidelines and missing just a few days of a market upswing . It 's best to take a long-term view and stay true to your goals no matter what the market is doing . <p> 7 . Taking on too much student loan debt . Defaulting on a student loan can result in financial damage that can last a lifetime . Penalties and interest add up , your credit rating goes downeven bankruptcy does n't erase the debt . So think before you borrow . A good rule of thumb is to limit the amount to what you can reasonably expect to earn your first year of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have minor children . A will is the one place where you can specify who will be the guardian for your children should something happen to you . If you do n't , the state will decide who takes care of your kids . That 's a scary thought. - <p> 9 . Taking Social Security too early , especially in a low interest rate environment . For every year that you delay collecting benefits between the ages of 62 and 70 , your monthly check will increase between 6-2/3% and 8% . That 's a pretty great return , especially when interest rates are hovering around 1% or less . If you do n't need the money , and longevity genes are in your family , it 's probably wise to wait . <p> 10 . Not talking to your spouse about your finances . Money differences are famous for tearing couples apart . So before either your bank account or your relationship is jeopardized , have an honest discussion about your expenses , credit and debt , savings goals and retirement . <p> Avoid these mistakes now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 132766 @qwx542766 132765 @qwx542765
