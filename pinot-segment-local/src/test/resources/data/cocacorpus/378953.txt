A National Theatre of Scotland and Live Theatre co-production of a play by Lee Hall , based on the book " The Sopranos , " by Alan Warner . <p> The successful tour comes to the West End , in a slightly revised version . 56978 @qwx466978 <p> ( seen at the Dorfman Theatre on 17th September 2016 ) . Based , apparently , on a 1998 novel , and not a trendy " improvisation " session - though it certainly feels that way at times . The strength of this show are simply the performances . A half dozen young female actors play everything from schoolgirls to male perverts , sing everything from church choral to Bob Marley and have an energetic delivery that is infectious enough to make the time mostly fly by . <p> The problem is the script . While jumping smoothly enough between stories while running riot in Edinburgh , it falters at the point where they must return . Either a long sequence was tacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended running time , or the source material itself was at fault , leading to over-confidence in the adaptation . Focus is lost in the final 30 minutes , dissipating everything achieved before - it 's a flaw , and a serious one that made this monkey wonder about the fine line between authenticity and pretention that appeared to be trodden . <p> The theatre 's programme makes it impossible to really single out individuals to name ( headshots with biographies , please ) , but suffice to say they do well , and if the effect is sometimes more " St Trinians " than intended , no matter , it adds to the fun . Some wonderful one-liners , knowing and disturbing moments that illuminate late adolescence and early adulthood are here in watchable spades . Do see it for the performances and first 80 minutes or so alone , is the monkey feeling . 
@@45560871 @5560871/ <p> ( Seen at the 2.30pm preview performance on 2nd March 2013 ) . Some actors have since left the cast . <p> This is the slickest transfer the monkey has ever seen . The production feels like it originated on the West End stage , rather than an import after a " bus and truck " trek across the USA . It is impossible not to admire the highest standards set in every aspect - staging , design , lighting , direction and of course performance . <p> Alexia Khadime brings a fabulous naivety to Nabulungi , a simple African girl bewitched by Mormanism and bewitching one of two amazing real Americans ( Jared Gertner ) in the cast . Getners partner in Mormonism , Gavin Creel , also justifies his transatlantic journey bringing an energy that never flags .

Simply because this show can be taken either way ... and it honestly cant decide which it feels more strongly ... <p> First review : this is where those " terribly witty at interpreting Fraternity Humour " chaps who wrote the clever revues at Harvard and Yale moved on to . A knowing and very adult romp . It imbues all who see and " get " the parodies with a wonderful veneer of sophistication ; thus transcending the strong language and very daring comedy , to take in several useful points about religion and world matters . <p> Laugh ? You 'll rarely stop at some inventive parodies of religious and maniacal dictators , victims and saviours ; and one inspired hospital joke that may have raised a Kenneth Williams eyebrow .

It may be a " one time show once you 've got the joke , you do n't  need to go again , " but you have to admire the post-modernity of it all . <p> Second review : just why is this foul-mouthed show is the toast of New York , is it all an elaborate hoax ? In the first 20 minutes audiences get the stage equivalent of a cute 5-year-old saying " bum " and getting a big laugh from the adults . The child thus repeats it ad nauseam , with rapidly diminishing returns , until his adoption can be arranged . <p> A ( when the monkey saw it , and estimated at least ) 99.5% white middle-class audience considered it fine to roar with laughter at US perspective stereotypical " victim Africa .

Its interesting to speculate on whether the writers might have taken on one Middle Eastern faith in the same manner ... given that during the show its tellingly the one religion they do n't  mention . A cowardly opting for a safer target , perhaps ? Oh , and just for the record , if there is a sequel about that other belief system , the monkey wont be requiring a ticket , thanks . <p> Simply , this musical will divide audiences into those seeing it as " a gay romp with Mormons and Villagers in Africa " and those willing to analyse just why they did feel so uncomfortable with what they were watching . <p> For the broadest minded or " South Park " fan wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical that will deliver solid belly laughs without requiring thought , this delivers perhaps beyond anything else in London .

They are normally allocated a fixed number of seats by the theatre , and can often obtain more if they need them .

This ensures rear rows of seats are raised slightly , improving , hopefully , the view . <p> In the Circles , the rows of seats are arranges on steps . The higher the steps for each row the better the view . Unfortunately , the higher the steps , the more vertigo inducing the view ! <p> The word ' rake ' also applies to the slope of the stage towards the audience . The angle allows the back of the stage to be seen more easily and makes for interesting viewing should anyone dance , as it causes them to slip !

Increasingly greedy producers are even pricing the first rows of the Upper Circle at the same as rear Stalls i.e. second price , pushing third price seats even further away up the back . <p> Auditorium ComfortLegroom is the space available , when sitting , for you to stretch out from the waist and feel your legs rest comfortably . This is no joke as the worst legroom grinds your thighs into your pelvis , and makes moving your legs to maintain circulation impossible . <p> Theatremonkey defines ' average comfort ' as being when it can sit in the seat for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comfort is good when the monkey could sit for the whole performance without needing to move . A rare occurrence . <p> In all cases ( except the Prince of Wales Theatre ) seats in the front row of all Circles will have less legroom as there is a wall rather then a curved seat in front of you . <p> London Theatres are mostly old and designed for when bodies were shorter . A healthy cornfed monkey at a modest Five foot Six ( but perfectly formed ) gets uncomfortable very easily . The comfort felt by a person of this height forms the criteria for the site opinion . Anyone over this height could face serious problems . Six-Foot persons should avoid the Circles in all older London theatres wherever possible . Particularly the Adelphi and London Palladium . <p> Auditorium ViewAn arch , the proscenium , usually surrounds the stage at the front of the theatre . The space occupied by the stage is the proscenium opening . The rest of the space either side is wall because , usually , the auditorium is much wider than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there is a wall in front of them . These seats are called ' outside the proscenium arch ' on this site . The view from Stalls seats in the front rows depend on how well angled they are towards the stage and where the scenery is placed . Since these are top price seats , 100% views only are acceptable , yet often not achieved . <p> In the Circles a safety bar or two , or three , often runs the whole width . Added to this is an even higher bar at the end of the aisle to prevent falling over if you should trip on the stairs . Theatremonkey naturally swings into his seat using these handy bars . For everybody , the view is disrupted as the bars line up to appear to run through anyone standing centrestage . This phenomenon is worst in the front two or three rows , and very few theatres discount tickets to allow for it . <p> Circles normally hang over the stalls and eachother . The result is often to cut the view of seats horizontally removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a rule the further back seats are in an auditorium , the worse the problem . <p> Old theatres often have their Circles held up by pillars . Seats placed behind these can be a bargain or a pain , depending on how thick the pillar is . Seats beside the pillar can also be a problem as the view may be affected but no discount is allowed . <p> Other interestingly positioned seats are found at the sides of the circle , or behind the set . These may be cheaper , again bargain or curse . Theatremonkey gives an opinion . <p> Bars and RefreshmentsThe alcohol serving type of bar is often small and crowded . Refreshments in London Theatres are usually tubs of Ice Cream and large bags of confectionery only . It is cheaper to buy outside , from supermarkets or chain stores beforehand . Very few theatres have restaurants . <p> Air conditioningNot always a feature of London theatres . Some are , others are air-cooled . Since heat rises , the front stalls are coolest in Summer . Avoid the highest circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the auditorium as these are the biggest heat-traps . A temperature of over eighty degrees was recorded once in the back of the Phoenix Theatre Dress Circle . The mythical bird could have been reborn there that night without needing a pyre ! <p> Toilets and RestroomsNumber of cubicles in each restroom is given on venue seats to buy / avoid pages . As a rule there is only one restroom on each level for each gender . Worse , ladies have the usual problem of insufficient cubicles . It is worth going upstairs to find quieter restrooms during intervals . Managers normally check restrooms before giving the signal for the second half to start , so do n't worry too much if the time is ticking away . <p> Those with any disability often do not have adapted restrooms available , and when they do it is unisex . This site finds it bad enough not to have ones ' needs met , but to be deprived of a gender too is pushing it . This is not equality .

How can you expect a musical about Opera to be anything but Melodrama ? ? ? ? ? ? Opera is an extremely symbolised art form and Phantom manages to capture it 's darkness and romanticism beautifully . If you want to see upbeat and twee dance numbers choreographed to perfection I can give you directions to the Adelphi ! <p> I noticed you also attacked the disco inspired title track . Please do n't forget this was written long before the rest of the show at a time when the aim of the project was still a parody rather the thick and heady romantic spectacle that it became . So if it 's slightly less Operatic than the rest- this is forgivable . Besides which , Phantom is a classic " OF IT 'S TIME " . Nobody accuses " Madam Butterfly " or " Carmen " of being out of date because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phantom " as a period piece and one of the last glittering relics of the golden age of London Theatre which the 1980 's undoubtedly were . <p> Listened to Les Mis recently ? proof that an orchestra and Europop are hardly mutually exclusive . <p> I find it bizarre that you would attack the staging and fly work of " Phantom " . In my opinion , " Phantom " was the last major musical not to be simply a product of technology . Given a big enough budget , landing helicopters , flying cars or video screens do not prove a challenge to the set designer , whereas " Phantom 's " " coups de theatre " are achieved almost entirely with VICTORIAN stage workings . <p> " Phantom " is a model of stagecraft which has sadly been lost to technology . " Phantom " is one of very few shows where you can actually feel lost in the action . Another limitation of Her Majesty 's theatre is that it is acoustically bad and offers dismal views . Get over it ! ! ALW had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten to it by " Les Mis " . I think we can all be glad he did n't wait for Mr. Schnberg 's work to move out or London Theatre would look very different today . <p> Finally the performances , I would say John Owen Jones is one of the finest Phantom 's of them all , easily outstripping Michael Crawford vocally . Whilst the current Christine is not the best , we have to remember that this is one of the most demanding roles musical theatre has ever created . Besides which , Christine is intended to start with a weak voice and gradually become stronger , reflecting her increased knowledge of the world and its darkness . If you dismiss her in the first scene . You do the entire show a disservice and are clearly not understanding the subtle symbolism of this ' sentimental melodrama ' ! ( ironic statement ) <p> And another thing , RAOUL IS SUPPOSED TO BE A WEAK CHARACTER . He lacks charisma in order to allow us to build up empathy with the Phantom . Try to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for letting me rant , <p> Will Cooper <p> Theatremonkey , you are great for a lot of things but your opinion of Phantom is just plain wrong . <p> I 've seen many shows and this is undoubtedly the greatest of them all . So what it the emotion is overblown ? It only emphasis 's the passion ! The songs are fantastic , the set is amazing and the storyline is exciting , maddening , and devastating all at once . She should have got the Phantom ! ! ! <p> I 've seen it several times now and ca n't wait to go again ! <p> One word of advise to first timers though , make sure you 're sat in the first seven rows of the stalls or the first three of the dress circle . These make lots of difference to the quality of viewing ! The last time we had the front row centre and the chandelier was terrifying ! <p> Becky Pontefract <p> <p> I saw " Phantom " on the 31st of May 2003 for the second time . John Owen-Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought that after hearing the original cast on my CD so many times I would be disappointed but I was n't . <p> The Phantom was sung just as well or even better than Michael Crawford , and Celia played Christine very well - she sang with a voice that was as it is supposed to be , clear and clean . <p> I was only disappointed by " Masquerade " . It looked like there was n't enough people to fill the stage and the grand staircase made a loud noise whilst being folded away , drowning out the orchestra . <p> &gt;My mum and I sat in seats 18 and 19 of row A in the Upper Circle . They were very good seats as the bar was only slightly blocking our view . The chandelier was amazing and just above our heads and I felt like I could almost touch it when it flew in front of me at the beginning of act one ! <p> I was rather annoyed when a man came to the front of the Circle and told everyone to lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lent back half the cast would have been beheaded by the bar . <p> It was a brilliant show and I want to see it again . For once theatremonkey I think you are wrong . <p> Eternally touching , a glorious ( although occasionally dated ) show , with a huge scale of emotions packed in . ' Wishing you were somehow here again ' in the grave is a richly powerful song , and the lead roles had voices which were shattering . They played Christine and The Phantom to perfection . <p> This is the third time I 've seen POTO , and each time the ending keeps the relentless pace , and the huge contrast of feelings - sensational ! If you like the theatre , a must see , regardless of the opinions and stereotypes ! <p> Beautiful , subtle , and heartbreaking ... <p> Alf <p> I took my mum and my boyfriend to see this show in October 2003 , for my mum 's 60th birthday . All three of us thought it was absolutely outstanding : John Owen-Jones was so powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( I was only sorry we did n't see as much of him as I would have liked ! ) , and Katie Knight-Adams looked beautiful and sounded wonderful as Christine . I was totally " involved " whilst watching this one , feeling exhilarated and frightened , then sentimental and even a little tearful at the end ! ! It really was entertainment at its best . <p> I can not recommend this show enough , and we will all definitely be going again . The only point from Theatre Monkey 's review that I do agree with is that Christine should definitely have got the Phantom ! ! <p> Jane <p> I recently went to see ' The Phantom of the Opera ' and thought it was excellent ! John Owen-Jones was particularly great as the Phantom - his voice was amazing , and the finale where he tells Christine and Raoul to leave him was devastating ! <p> Rachel Barrell was also excellent as Christine . The rest of the cast were generally good , although Oliver Thornton as Raoul unfortunately , was pretty awful . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired - some of the choreography and performances could do with being ' tightened up ' a bit , and the proscenium arch of the intertwined naked figures could do with a good clean - and some of the drapes need washing ! <p> I was sat in seat 21 of row A of the grand ( upper ) circle , and have to disagree with Theatre Monkey 's comments about there being a bar intruding on the view here . I had an absolutely brilliant view here . The balcony ledge only comes up to just under waist height , and there is a narrow bar which comes up slightly higher . I could see all the stage perfectly clearly without leaning forward at all ( and I 'm only average height - 5ft8 " ) . The bar only obstructed the view of the orchestra pit which was hardly a problem . In fact , I think it 's far preferable to have a ledge/bar below the view of the stage , than be behind a row of people who could be more of an obstruction . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this show - one woman sat behind me was munching crisps during the first act , whilst a man sat behind me was translating the show for his friend . <p> Despite some of the performances not being so good , and it starting to look a bit tired , ' The Phantom of the Opera ' is still a great spectacle and a thrilling piece of theatre . <p> Chris Rouse . November 2004 <p> After the upset and disappointment of " Sweeney Todd " ( 2004 ) .................... <p> .................... we went to see this , which was in a word ..... magic ! ! ! ! <p> I really can not praise the show enough . We sat in the Grand Circle in the front row and did n't find the bar an obstruction at all . although we are both over 6ft tall , which no doubt helped . <p> What a spectacle ! the theatre , the sets , the costumes , the effects , it was absolutely amazing from beginning to end . <p> The entire cast gave excellent performances , my personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! <p> I have to disagree with the other reviewers who have said Raoul was " awful " , he 's meant to be lame and drippy , that 's the idea ! <p> We loved it so much we went back a week later with my parents , this time sitting in the Upper Circle in seats D 12,13,14,15 , very good seats , with a better view than the more expensive seats we had first time round , again a wonderful performance , my only complaint is that the volume could be louder . <p> We 've booked again ................ totally hooked ! ! ! <p> You must see this show , at least once ! ! ! ! ! <p> ( second visit , 9th February 2005 ) <p> Managed to get 3 tickets in the stalls row M , seats 20,21,22 - checked out this guide and thought fair value was acceptable . <p> Yet again the show was fantastic , it just gets better every time I see it , you notice parts that you totally missed the first time round . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpfulness of the theatre staff , as my grandmother uses a wheel chair , we were approached on entering the theatre by staff and taken round to a side door , shown the disabled toilets and taken to our seats before the crowds came in . <p> Our interval drinks order was taken and a selection of gifts from the kiosk was bought round to our seats of which nanny bought ............ the lot ! ! <p> We all thoroughly enjoyed the show and when the crowds had dispersed the staff bought out our wheelchair and had a good old natter with nanny asking her what she thought of the performance . <p> Customer service at its best ! <p> I must say the seats were fantastic , I totally disagree with other reviewers who have said to avoid the stalls , by far the best seats we 've had seeing this show . I was worried that the stage would be high and we 'd get a crook neck from looking up , but the stage is low and the view was amazing , we could n't see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to the overhang , but that 's a small price to pay for such a clear and close view of the cast . <p> Ca n't wait to see it again , amazing ! ! ! ! <p> Jamie Coniam London <p> Saw this last night ( 30th March 2005 ) and unfortunately we did n't  enjoy this show . <p> Our biggest mistake with this show was not to note the seat numbers to avoid . We had 2 seats in row B of stalls ( front row ) , what a nightmare , No leg room at all ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> People next to us were really annoyed especially as these are top price seats ! <p> I have read other reviews and it appears most people love " Phantom " but we did n't  feel it was worth the visit . I appreciate it is an operatic production , but when all the characters sang different lines at the same time it just came across as a cacophony of noise . I was aware my Husband was uncomfortable all night and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Saying that I thought the set and costumes were well produced . Rachel Barrell as Christine and Oliver Thornton as The Phantom had amazing voices . <p> I suppose you either love it or hate it and unfortunately we fell into the latter . <p> Chris <p> I am a huge , huge Phantom fan and firmly believe that the show is the best in the West End but after seeing it last night ( 29th April 2005 ) I was hideously disappointed . <p> The show was appalling . It was quite painful to see it in front of me . Why ? Quite simply it was the cast . My first moan goes to Raoul ( who is currently played by Oliver Thornton ) . Now I have see the Phantom just over 10 times now - he is far below the standard of any other Raoul I have ever seen . I do believe that he single handedly ruined the show . His performance was a disgrace and how he got such a coveted part I will never know . His voice is much too weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raoul and decides to play him is insensitive and irritating . Because of this - for the first time , I did n't care what happened at the end of the musical . <p> Earl Carpenter as the Phantom showed potential , but is n't up to such a challenging role . His portrayal is very simple in such a complex work , and it seemed as if he was just bashing through the songs - like sight-reading . This was incredibly disappointing too . <p> The supporting cast were fairly anonymous too . None put in a noticeable or commendable performance and did n't help to arouse any emotions within the audience for how we should feel towards any character . They just dragged the whole thing out . None of them deserved to have such wonderful roles in such a wonderful musical . <p> In fact , the only positive to come from such an abysmal evening was Rachel Barrell as Christine . She was very impressive and did the musical justice - easily bettering Sarah Brightman for anyone who listens to the original CD . She played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rather a stiff price to pay to see such a good performer . <p> So for a show which is all about the relationships between the characters it failed . It was rather sad to see a show I love being massacred . I had no idea such incredible music could be ruined so easily . I left feeling cheated . <p> As for my verdict - it is still the best show in London and a must see ( many times ) ! But wait until this cast moves on . I wish they would hurry up ... <p> Alf <p> I went to see Phantom of the Opera just after Christmas time . I had possibly the worst seats in the house , due to late booking . ( Balcony ) Still , I did n't expect to miss half the show . <p> I was extremely disappointed . Not that I had a bad night , I did enjoy it , its just that it was nothing near as good as everyone made it out to be . <p> Yes- the show had an amazing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... what 's the point ? I was very annoyed that the whole thing was played to the Stalls , because not everyone can afford 50 a ticket . The only way I would go and see Phantom again is if I sat in the Stalls , but I 'm not prepared to pay 50 for a show I did n't rate that highly . <p> My main problem is that the music is boring . If a musical does n't have good music , it is pointless to me . The 3 or 4 good tunes are all played in the first half an hour , which leaves a good two hours of " musical mess " . So , I could n't see the stage properly , and I could n't just close my eyes and listen . <p> The whole show is hidden behind a huge chandelier , and some very talented singers . <p> Well , what can I say ? It was as fabulous as ever ! ! ! <p> Rachel Barrell is the best Christine I have ever seen , it was such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emi Rosum in the movie . Rachel is by far the best singer I have ever seen in the part , not sounding in pain or like she was struggling . Her character was a bit cold for my liking and sometimes quite aggressive , but still fab . <p> &gt;Then we move on to Oliver Thornton , well , what positive thing can I say ? Well , he was very good looking - that 's where the positives end . I do realise that the part of Raoul is not well , good , it seems the writers got board when they got to his part ! ! But come on , he could of tried to make his character a little less boring or camp . Still , it was a relief to hear a non-American accent ( both Patric Wilson and Emi Rosum needed voice coaching ) . <p> Erl Carpenter was good , but not in the league of John Owen Jones , who is fab . <p> The curtains need a good wash ( as an earlier reviewer noted , I think ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recast already ! ! <p> Edward Bernstone ( phantom fan ) <p> I somehow managed to miss seeing Phantom of the Opera until the end of May 2005 . I ca n't compare the current cast with any other but they did n't strike me as anything special . Earl Carpenter as the Phantom was rather subdued and did n't have the edge of menace I felt he should have had . I could n't decide if he was deliberately lisping at times in " Music of the Night " or if the mask was constricting his mouth . Oliver Thornton as Raoul was also weak but I found his character unbelievable anyway and the love affair did n't engage my emotions at all . Rachel Barrell as Christine sung with considerable volume ( but see below ) and was the best of the cast . <p> A feature of the performance I 'd never really been forced to consider before in the theatre was the amplification of the singers . It all seemed too loud to me and at times I found the level almost painful . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' Prima Donna ' threatened to bring the chandelier down without the help of the Phantom . It gave the whole performance a strident edge that I did not enjoy . <p> I was sitting in B21 in the Dress Circle which should have been fine as I 'm 5 ' 11 " but two people in front of me actually blocked a lot of the view ( they also rustled bags to show each other their shopping for large sections of the show ) . They were asked by the staff to stop leaning forward onto the front of the Dress Circle though , but they still obscured a lot of my view . A child near to me was given a cushion but still had problems seeing properly . <p> I did n't really enjoy this show much and wonder if it 's getting a little tired now . <p> Jon . <p> I took my mother to see this show as a birthday treat on the 25th June 2005 and it certainly did n't disappoint . The cast were fantastic and the show certainly lived up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back again this Christmas for my birthday ! <p> I booked seats M6 and M5 in the stalls , solely based on your seating recommendation , and they offered a perfect view of the stage plus ample leg room for the average sized person . I 'm 5ft 9 " . The acoustics were very good also . <p> As this was a birthday treat for my mother I was n't too concerned about the price and thought the 47.00 tickets a reasonable price to pay for such a great day out and such good seats at a top London show . <p> Many thanks to the Phantom cast , and Theatremonkey , for making a happy day extra special . <p> My partner and I went to see this show recently ( July 2005 ) , it was my umpteenth time and his first . I have to admit to not being a huge fan of the show , as , although there are many aspects of the production that I like , the show as a whole does not gel for me . <p> We purchased our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated in the circle on the second row and the seats were very good and we had a great view . <p> The show itself was very enjoyable but I did feel that it was starting to show its age a little and some of the characterisations are a little sloppy . We both had to agree though that Earl Carpenter , as the Phantom , was superb , he gave so much to his performance in the final scenes that we were both quite moved and I have never before been able to feel for this character . My partner really enjoyed the show and we both agreed that the staging is excellent . <p> All in all an enjoyable afternoons entertainment but not a show we will be rushing back to soon . <p> Messrs Colin and Asa Mccarthy-Burton <p> 18 years , and its still playing to sold out audiences every night ! Millions of people ca n't be wrong ! This show is and always will remain the best musical in the world . <p> This show is simply amazing ; the cast do a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show is almost impossible to describe , as it is so good . Earl gives the best performance of The Phantom I have ever seen and heard . I may even go as far as to say that Earl 's voice is more powerful and his performance is better than Mr Crawford ! <p> The set and special effects are also amazing . The costumes , especially the lavish " Red Death " . The thundering Overture sets the show off into a great whirlwind of excitement , and the show lives up to all of the hype associated with it . <p> Both the current London Christine 's are also amazing ; the passion with which they sing is brilliant . Oliver Thornton ( Raoul ) is n't the best in the cast but then again is n't the worst , his voice is pretty good and his acting is acceptable , but Earl outshines them all . <p> Please remember that the musical was the original and the movie came after , the movie was slightly different from the show ( the show being better ) . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and see this , or end up kicking yourself as you leave some other poor show and see the audience leaving " Phantom " totally amazed . You have been warned ! ! ! <p> ! ! ! LONG MAY PHANTOM RUN ! ! ! And perhaps come on a UK tour ? ? ? ? <p> Enjoy ! <p> I was visiting London from the US July 25 2005 , and luckily procured fantastic tickets for Phantom of the Opera . The production was inspiring as always ; I could never tire of seeing it . <p> The cast was excellent , and the Phantom 's performance was quite impressive and emotional . I was , however , very disappointed in the performance of the gent playing Raoul . While he had a great presence about him on stage , I did n't feel he fit the part , and as a trained tenor myself , I thought he should have been able to resonate his lower register better . In the trio with Phantom and Christine , Raoul 's voice did not project , and his interjections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family all the way from Brisbane Australia and me and my sister went to see " Phantom of the Opera " . Having loved the interpretation of the movie , I thought I should see the stage play , and I thought it was amazing ! No doubt there is a large amount of prima donna style ' drama ' , but come on ! The story is fiction about a masked musical genius living in the catacombs of the Paris Opera ! The melodrama is what makes the story so interesting . Really Theatremonkey , stop being bland and enjoy the creativity ! Andrew Lloyd Webber is a musical genius and Phantom of the Opera is not to be missed . The Phantom is such an amazing character , and is portrayed so well . The costumes are beautiful , the stage work is clever and creative , and the performances are bar none . <p> I will agree though on one thing . The poor Phantom should get Christine ! He 's cool enough , not stupid Roaul with his high pants and stupid hair ! Talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tut Christine Daae ! <p> Firstly , I would like to thank the Theatremonkey 's frequent updates of special offers , which is where I searched for a fabulous offer to see " The Phantom of the Opera " . I have long-awaited for a discounted ticket to this show . It was my first time to see it and thanks to theatremonkey , I got a full-priced ticket less 20 ! ( Central Stalls an ' all ! ) <p> Ok , enough of the money talk . I had expectations aplenty of the show , giving its 18-year run in the West End . They were definitely met . It was extraordinary . Very haunting and terribly tragic . The ambience of the whole show was carried away even after I left the theatre - a true sign of a successful theatre experience . I found myself humming to the melodies of Masquerade and Music of the Night as I was driving home ! <p> Earl Carpenter as the Phantom was so fitting . Even though I have not seen Mr. Crawford 's original display , I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most memorable . <p> This classical theatre should be running for many years to come . For someone who normally favours the more modern musical like myself , " The Phantom of the Opera " certainly took me by surprise . A " Must-See " . I truly understand this statement now . A " Must-See " indeed . <p> Karen . <p> We took our seven year old Twins to see Phantom for a birthday treat at the beginning of August 2005 , though my Wife and I had seen it four times previously . <p> The kids loved it and want to see it again for their next birthday , but personally Phantom had lost some of it 's magic . Earl Carpenter in the lead was very good indeed though not in the same league as Crawford who we had seen on two occasions . ( We wish we had seen our fellow Welshman John Owen-Jones to compare ) . A special mention to Oliver Thornton as Raoul .... absolutely terrible ! How he got such a prestigious part is way beyond me ! <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the view inferior to a good Stalls seat . <p> We 'll probably revisit next year if the kids demand ! ! <p> The Johnson Family Port Talbot , South Wales UK <p> My first West End show . When we bought the tickets I was n't that excited . I wanted to experience a West End show as even at only 24 , I saw it as one of those things you have to do sometime in your life . <p> The show starts with an elderly Raoul ( in a wheelchair ) buying a music box at an auction at the old opera house that had being previously haunted by the phantom . This is very important to remember for the rest of the show . After this scene the unmistakeable unique theme music begins , the sound in the theatre was amazing , better than any cinema . <p> At this point , I did n't know what was happening to me , the music caused the hairs on the back of my neck to stand up and I felt a shiver down my spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll make the last orders at the pub , to being totally enthralled . I was hooked from that moment on , from the start to the finish . I have since listened to the music from the original cast ( Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman ) , but in my opinion , Earl Carpenter ( Phantom ) and Rachel Barrell ( Christine ) are far more talented . As soon as Rachel began to sing her first solo of the evening I got that same feeling I did as the music began , although this time more intense . She has the kind of voice that you would never get tired of listening to . It was a pleasure to see her perform , other than being beautiful she acts astoundingly well and really feels the music . Overall the Phantom of the Opera is a must see , even for those who have never taken in a West End show before . It would be nice if a soundtrack was available of the current cast . <p> J Middleton of Sheffield <p> I thought I was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Her Majesty 's but thankfully I have now realised that I am not alone . I thought I must have been tainted having seen the movie far too much , and that it was just me who was mildly disappointed by the acting efforts of Earl Carpenter and Oliver Thornton . <p> It must have been eight months or so since I saw it and , as far as I can tell , since then only the Raoul has changed which , frankly , can only be a blessing . Rachel Barrell made a marvellously emotional Christine and kept her as the feisty chorus girl of Leroux 's original novel . She lifted the slightly flat acting of the Phantom wonderfully and kept Raoul 's head above water . I adored Carlotta . She was fabulously camp and over the top , as any good diva should be . <p> ' Phantom 's tragically dark tale is a mix of romance , gothic horror and mystery and Lloyd Webber chooses to focus on the romantic side of the story . The struggle that Christine faces in choosing between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , edgy Phantom , verses the safe Raoul . I know which one I 'd choose ... ; ) <p> The lavish sets and spectrum of colours explode onto the stage , especially at the start of the second act , and capture your attention and your heart . The beautiful sounds of Lloyd Webber 's music , combined with the wonderful lyrics of Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe , stay in your mind for weeks on end and , to be honest , it 's not really such a bad thing ! <p> I would definitely recommend ' Phantom ' to anyone . It is Lloyd Webber 's triumph and looks set to remain that way for a very long time . <p> My 7 year old daughter and I recently went to see the show ( February 9th 2006 ) and it was just brilliant . We sat in the Stalls in row D , seats 9 and 10 . In my humble opinion , the current cast is the best , though I have only seen it once before . <p> She loved the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chandelier might fall on our heads ! It was probably the best birthday I could give my little girl . <p> I was also impressed with the leg room , I 'm 6 foot and it was ample . <p> Christian Toime <p> I am utterly astounded at the few negative comments about POTO ( Phantom Of The Opera ) . I first saw this magnificent production in December 2004 and in May 2006 will be seeing it again for the 4th time . <p> The first time I saw it was a xmas present and I was n't too excited about it to be honest , I listened to the movie soundtrack that was also a xmas present and quite frankly thought that I was going to find the show quite hard going ! I could n't have been more wrong , from the very beginning I was hooked and when the chandelier swings into the audience with the spine chilling music the hairs stood up on the back of my neck . <p> &gt;My favourites are : " Masquerade " , " Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love all of it . The second time I saw POTO I realised I had missed so much the first time round , so knew I had to go again just in case I missed even more ! <p> Earl Carpenter has to be the best Phantom , how he packs so much emotion into it every night for so long I really do n't know , and Rachel Barrell is an excellent Christine- both deserve Oscars in my opinion . <p> I always sit in the stalls as I think you get the best views , but would n't sit on the front row again due to a stiff neck ! ! This show knocks spots off the movie and I am currently reading the novel , struggling a little with it as it is quite different . <p> The gentleman that previously wrote in the defence of Raoul lacking charisma is so correct in what he says , yes this is how Raoul is supposed to be ...... I think that those who slate POTO have no appreciation for this form of entertainment which is absolutely fine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not for you , there 's no need to rip it apart .... take note Theatre Monkey , Grrrrr .... <p> P.S. I own ; POTO compact mirror , a POTO monkey music box that plays " Masquerade " , a POTO mug and a framed POTO poster with all my tickets in ..... does that make me a sad Monkey ? ? ? ? ? .... My Lawyers are watching ! <p> I disagree with the negative reviews on " The Phantom of the Opera " , Earl Carpenter was excellent as the Phantom , even better than Michael Crawford ; and Katie Knight-Adams was excellent as Christine . <p> I loved the chandelier , although it was literally centimetres above our heads , some lady in the audience screamed and many of the audience gasped as it was unexpected . <p> Also , I was in front row ( Seat B10 ) - it is a restricted view because of the conductor - but he was not in my way at all , and B11 was affected slightly although it really was n't a problem unless your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that sound was n't loud , so you missed parts of the singing , and the final lair boat scene , I missed parts of that . Apart from that it was excellent , and am glad I got an excellent view sold at a restricted price even though it was n't affected in the slightest . Highly recommended . <p> Ashleah Skinner , London <p> I went to see this a few weeks ago with a very open mind as I normally prefer something light and breezy and did n't think I was going to enjoy it-but I did ! ! - and would recommend anyone to see it <p> Ms Christina Brooks N6 <p> Went to see " Phantom of the Opera " on Tuesday 27th June 2006 , it was BRILLIANT ! Far better than the film version . It had me in tears and goosebumps in parts . The main character 's " Phantom " and " Christine " were excellent and put so much into their performances . <p> We sat in stalls row " J " seats 3 and 4 and had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at row " J " so we were able to see the chandelier but any further back and some bits of the show would have been missed . The seats are a bit old and so are n't as comfortable as some other theatres that have been updated , but we had enough leg room . The theatre was lovely , like stepping back into Victorian times and the whole atmosphere was perfect for " Phantom " . <p> Ca n't wait to go and see it again ! <p> Sherrie <p> Saw the show for the first time on Monday 10th July 2006 , absolutely loved it ! Ca n't wait to go back and see it again . <p> My cousin and I were in London for a special few days break and chose this show to see out of all those currently on as we loved the music ( I have a copy of the original cast recording LP ! ) . We checked on this site for seat info and had seats K23 and 24 in the stalls and found them very good , saw everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the chandelier right to the top . Got the full effect of the chandelier falling too without being directly underneath it ! <p> We loved everything about it , the effects , the story , the acting and singing and I agree with other people , although we have no comparison with others , Earl Carpenter is fabulous as the phantom . Despite what theatremonkey says , to see the theatre sold out on a Monday night in July proves how good the show is . <p> My only gripe is actually about the theatre itself , something needs to be done about the seating , the seats are quite small . If you are a ' larger size lady ' like me you get wedged into the seat and literally can not move until the interval ( an American lady in front of me had exactly the same problem ) and then feel so stiff afterwards . Even for someone slim you also have to get out of the row to let people get past to their seats in the middle . My cousin is only 5 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room either . But that is only a little moan , we were so caught up in the show it did n't detract from it , we just had a good stretch in the interval and settled down again for the second half . <p> I saw Phantom of the Opera for the first on 13th July 2006 . I wanted to see the stage show after I saw the 2004 film , ( the best thing to do is to see the stage show then the film ) . As tickets for Phantom are expensive , I went on Lastminute.com to get tickets which offered me a 10 discount on each ticket . The problem with this is your not allocated seats until you get to the theatre . I had great seats in the upper circle ( H17-18 ) . The only tiny problem with view the seats is that you cant see the head when the Phantom enters ( 2 second obstruction ) , at the start of Act 2 and the chandelier blocks the phantom for a few seconds when he is at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is poor but manageable ( I 'm 6 " 1 and it was a small problem , but easy to forget about when watching the production ) . <p> The only understudy was Christine Daae which was played by Tabitha Webb . I think this understudy made no difference in my enjoyment of the production . <p> I had two problems with the production though . My first problem was Raoul . Great performance by the actor ( David Shannon ) , but I thought he looked much older than Christine ( maybe its because of the understudy ) so found it hard to believe that they were " friends " when they were children . The major problem is the sound . After nearly 8,200 performances in the same theatre , you would think the sound would be good . When the actors sang on stage is sometimes was hard to hear , and when the actors sang off stage or a recording was playing it was much louder , so they either make the sound louder when the onstage or quieter when they are off . To add more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The illusions in the show are great and they get better as the show goes on . <p> Phantom of The Opera is like Marmite , you either love it or you hate it . I LOVED IT ! ! ! <p> James F <p> Went to see Phantom on Saturday 23rd September 2006 . I did not think I would enjoy this , just booked it for my girlfriend 's birthday as I know she likes musicals , however , I will be honest and say I thoroughly enjoyed the whole performance . I thought the voices of Christine and the Phantom were absolutely superb . <p> As I mentioned this is not my kind of thing , but this is a MUST see for anyone , even if they think it is not ' up their street ' . <p> Loved it . <p> We saw the show for the first time on Saturday 7th October 2006 . <p> After consulting Theatremonkey ( thanks again , your website is always a great help ) , we booked four seats in Upper Circle seats E15 to 18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was the view of the top of the theatre , we had a great sight of The Phantom during his performance in ' The Gods ' . <p> The leg room was more than adequate , I am 6ft2 and had no trouble at all . <p> The only gripe is I had to move from side to side to see the centre of the stage , due to a tall gentleman sitting directly in front of me , but this must have applied to those sitting behind me due to my height . <p> The stage sets were fantastic , as was the whole production . <p> My only word of caution would be take a light jacket , the air conditioning is too good ! ! . <p> I could not recommend this musical less . It is dragging the West End back . <p> I sat in the Upper Circle . Terrible sightlines and no legroom . I was so far away from the stage that I felt like I could n't be further away from the action . Not that there was much action coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in the 80 's .... and it shows . <p> This was utterly disappointing . The score was unimaginative and bland , the sets looked dated and the ' special effects ' were clunky and distracting . <p> Do not believe the hype , this show may be in its 21st year , but that is surely musical retirement age . Go and see ' Mary Poppins ' or ' Wicked ' who are still in their gloriously fresh infancy . <p> Andy B <p> I have just seen " The Phantom of the Opera " at Her Majesty 's theatre in London ( November 2006 ) , sitting in row B seats 13 and 14 and would recommend this show to anyone . The seats were amazing and I was so close to the action , I did not have a problem with legroom or cricked necks . I could see every feature of the phantom 's deformity , saw all the fine detail , and felt that the singers were singing just for me , they tended to stand just in front of these seats to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could feel the heat from them , the chandelier was scary , I would recommend these seats anytime . <p> As for the show itself , it is hard to describe how wonderful it is , the music , the storyline etc . I am already planning another visit to the show , I know it wo n't happen , but hope the phantom gets the girl next time ! <p> Anne <p> Saw Phantom 1st December 2006 . After seeing John Owen Jones twice , and Scott Davies once , I thought Earl Carpenter did a pretty good job - though vocally John Owen Jones was better . I 've seen him with Celia Graham and they were superb together . The big disappointment was Katie Knight Adams , I have never seen someone sing and act so badly on stage ( and I have seen many shows ) . I ca n't believe she is hired for this job . She does n't look like a young girl at all but more like a witch , especially when she sings . She completely screwed up the last part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than usual I think due to her vocal limitations . She even lip-synced the duet ' Phantom of the Opera ' because suddenly her voice was completely different . Also with the notes at the end she was too late opening and closing her lips . At that time you heard her voice only over the speakers and not coming from the stage as before ( I was very close ) . I felt sorry for Earl that he had to work with such a bad performer who was overacting all the time . <p> A big compliment however for Wendy Ferguson as Carlotta , she was very very good . However , make sure you see Celia Graham as Christine when you book this show . <p> Saw this show on the 28th December 2006 , with Celia Graham as Christine , Earl Carpenter as the Phantom and Michael Xavier as Raoul . <p> This show , along with ' Les MisTrables ' , is one of the " crown jewels " of West End theatre . The spectacular staging always dazzles , and the score throbs emotion throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light comic relief throughout , as well as being key to the storyline . <p> For those who expect a traditional musical , do not go here . Phantom is a heavy gothic rock show dressed up as an Opera , and if you do not like Pipe Organs and electric guitar this show is not for you . Some scenes-mainly the hanging of sceneshifter Joseph Buquet - are not suitable for young children . <p> Earl Carpenter 's singing and acting is superb throughout , as he brings true emotion to the role . Some may find his higher-pitched singing rather light , as he is closer to Michael Crawford than his predecessor John Owen-Jones . Michael Xavier is a great improvement on David Shannon in the role of Raoul , Vicomte de Changy and Christine Daae 's lover . However , make sure you see Celia Graham in the role of Christine rather than the dreadful Katie Knight-Adams . Graham 's singing is beautiful throughout the show and she never misses a note , while reviews of KKA have been far less favourable . <p> Overall a superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the monkey has given it . <p> <p> To all concerned with the production and performance of this show . <p> I have collected , vinyl - CD - DVD and finally , as a 60th Birthday treat with my family , I sat in awe and watched the show . <p> Form beginning to the final curtain this production was excellent . Please pass this on to all of the cast ( company ) and production team . <p> Thank you all very much for a fantastic night out . <p> Dave Lorenz . Hull , UK <p> This is the fourth time I have seen Theatremonkey 's favourite show ! I got a half price ticket from the ' Get Into London Theatre 's offer website ( ended 17th March 2007 ) for the performance on 28th February 2007 . <p> I was seated in stalls row C seat 11 , right in the centre . I thought it strange that the three seats ( 10,11 and 12 ) in front of me were unoccupied . Maybe people did n't turn up , or maybe these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls were full . I was right behind the conductor , but as is written elsewhere on this site , he is n't very tall and from where I was seated was n't much of a problem . On the stage right in front of me was a wooden block which may have contained lighting . This obscured some of the action , but in the second half it was n't there . <p> I was so close I could easily see the microphones of the performers . I could also see how Christine and The Phantom enter the mirror , which spoiled the effect for me . Being so close has some advantages . The Phantom 's deformity can be clearly seen , and you see the performers ' expressions . Christine 's interaction with the Phantom when she gives him a ring and kisses him being especially moving . <p> The lady next to me had an exciting moment ( she went oohhhh ) when a male dancer was leaping around and his thong showed beneath his costume ! She was also excited by the falling chandelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to be further away . I found myself having to look from side to side on occasions and had to look almost straight up to see the Phantom in the chandelier . <p> On my first viewing ( from the Upper Circle ) I remember being amazed when the rows of candles appeared for the Music of The Night scene , but from row C this effect is muted , also the cloud which is so effective from further away obscures the action I reckon rows G and H would be much better , or probably the main green area of the Dress Circle . <p> I did n't find the seat very comfortable . The leg room was very good , but the back of the seat was n't very forgiving , it seemed a bit too straight . Not sure if I will go again , certainly wo n't if I have to pay full price . After seeing it four times it has lost some of the excitement and emotion I felt on the first three occasions . This was the first show I ever saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for anyone . The man next to me was entranced and said it was wonderful , exactly my reaction when I saw it first in 2000 . <p> &lt;later visit:I got another half price ticket , this time for the stalls , row N seat 14 for the matinee performance on March 13th 2007 . A line from one of the songs goes " Half the cast are n't here , but still the audience cheer " The same could be said of this performance r.e . the use of understudies . Strangely there was no announcement stating the changes in the cast , maybe because there were so many . Ramin Karimloo played the Phantom . Rachel Barrell played Christine and Andrew Thwaite was Raoul , and there was a stand in conductor as well . When I arrived home to look at the cast list I thought Rachel Barrell was an understudy for the understudy . In reality she is , but a little research told me she played Christine from September 2004 to October 2006 and received very good reviews , so hardly an understudy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ( above ) when I was seated almost right at the front in row C seat 11 . The sound was much better from row N. I picked up almost every word , the view was much better , especially the effects and scenery . Also being further back meant I did n't have to look from side to side when the action was spread out , and I did n't have to look almost straight upwards trying to glimpse the Phantom in the chandelier . I felt the seat was more comfortable as well , maybe as a result of me not having to crane my neck from side to side and upwards . In my review of two weeks ago I wrote about a wooden block at the front of the stage which appeared to contain lighting , from further away I can confirm it does contain lighting , and it does appear in the second act . It swivels when not in use and is flat on the stage . I 'm sure you all wanted to know about that . As the climax approached I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fine performances . The Phantom magic has returned for me ! <p> Went to see Phantom last night , 2nd May 2007 , after finding an excellent meal and a show deal on this site , ate well at the Mintleaf restaurant before the show . Good meal , and good seats ( A23 and A24 , front row of Dress Circle . ) <p> Really enjoyed the show , Earl Carpenter as Phantom and Rachel Barrell as a superb Christine . Not much legroom in the front row of the Circle ( I know , I know , you warned us ) but thoroughly enjoyed it , now seen it three times . When I went to pick up the tickets , there was a rehearsal going on which you could hear from the foyer . The box office clerk said they were running in a new cast and this made it even more enjoyable , queuing whilst listening to some good choral singing . <p> I would just like to add my review of a most wonderful and exhilarating performance of ' Phantom ' ( 9th June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under the Dress Circle but in the middle , the only bit we missed was the chandelier going higher up than we could see ; but we saw the Phantom on the top of the building . <p> I have always loved the music and have watched the recent DVD release a few times but NOTHING compares to the live stage version . The music and pure voices bring a lump to your throat and the way that the sets change around to create the different scenes is amazing . The walkway down to the Phantom 's lair was a really slick and effective trick , and had you believing they were really walking downwards . <p> I can not honestly fault anything at all and we are going again for certain - it 's the best show we have ever seen . If anybody sees just one show this year make it " Phantom of The Opera ! ! " Beats the DVD any day ! ! I have played the soundtrack every day since coming back , ha ha . <p> Went to see Phantom again last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I last saw it . However , really enjoyed it still produces the old goose bumps it has to be said the music is great . <p> We sat in the Royal Circle rows A and B ( could n't get 6 tickets together ) and although one or two parts of the performance are out of view when they go to the far side of the stage generally good seats . <p> The girl lead was very good , as was The Phantom although the same can not be said for Raoul he had a very weak voice and was totally overpowered by Christina ( not sure of the name of girl who played her - but the dark haired one ) . I am told by someone who saw the blond one , that they did not like her voice at all , so lucky me that I got the other one ! <p> Paid 25 for top price tickets from See Tickets so a good deal . <p> Lizzie still loves the Theatre ! <p> We were disappointed in this production ( August 2007 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They should have switched roles . <p> We were in Row B , which is the first row , I am only 5 ' 2 " and my knees were crushed against a low black wall between me and the orchestra , sit further back for a much better view . <p> I was disappointed when I found out the main actor would not be playing the phantom . Nic Greenshields was in the role , however ! He was brilliant and earned the standing ovation he received at the end . He was physically imposing , powerful , menacing and sensitive . His voice was beautiful in my opinion he was the best phantom I have seen . <p> I was sitting front row centre ( B13 and 14 ) and found these seats to be very good , experiencing no problems at all . <p> Still sorry he failed to get the girl ! <p> 16th November 2007 <p> There are few productions still running in London with just as much panache and zest as they had when they started , and I truly think that Phantom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lloyd Webber works , I must confess a soft spot for Phantom . The storyline is cringing to say the least , but romantic in the smallest sense , and the image that is associated with Phantom is one of love . Albeit unrequited . Notable strong points of the production include consistently strong leads , an engaging plot and characters that the audience can empathise with . On the downside , the set and staging is clever , but not used efficiently . It is too messy at times , and the noise created by the set and crew moving it into position is hideous ! ! <p> Her Majestys theatre is beautifully acoustic , and most of the stalls and dress circle benefit from almost no amplified sound , which is a rarity . Phantom is also a quiet musical , and does not rely on deafening the audience to be effective , apart from the natural crescendos within the score , and obviously the Phantoms theme tune The lighting is absurdly clever , as are most of the special effects . <p> This is a show well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even just for an ordinary theatre night out . Still a top show in the West End , and has the audience numbers to prove it ! ! Undoubtedly Lloyd Webbers biggest achievement , but not his greatest work . And would someone please get rid of the dummies used to make the stage look busier than it actually is ! ! <p> Sat in seats K9 and 10 ( Stalls ) , which provided a very good view , as did all seats in that row , but I think the seats should be down priced from Row N back , as they really are not worth full price . Seats are slightly uncomfortable , but legroom was good . Belonging to the 6 footer club , I have not yet had trouble fitting into seats at Her Majestys . <p> l think this is a great performance , I would have to disagree with the monkey saying it was ' ' lame . ' ' I always though opera was amazing but this performance truly wins . I was seated in row L seat 5 - totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks at the middle break were extremely expensive , but this is LONDON . Ladies and Gentlemen adjust your binoculars and prepare for an outstanding opera night ... <p> Cristopher H. <p> <p> I saw ' Phantom of the Opera ' on the 23rd July 2008 at the evening performance . The only reason I went was to see Alex Rathgeber , because I had read a review about him titled ' London 's Best Aussie ' . I had no interest in opera , only knew one song and only knew the story in brief ( and the Phantom was the only character I remembered ) before I went to see it . And after the first 10 minutes , I wondered if Theatremonkey had seen the right show . I totally disagree with Theatremonkey . I absolutely loved it . The whole thing blew me away . I do admit that the first 2 scenes I had n't a clue what was going on , but after the Phantom makes his first appearance it makes sense . <p> I sat in the GRAND CIRCLE in Row H seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise comfortable . The view of the stage is mainly good , however the corner of the stage ( Down-Stage Right in the correct theatre terms ) can not be seen from these seats , and anywhere in this part of the circle , so everyone leans forward and that just makes it harder for you to see . In fact , I would say about a maximum of 10 minutes through the whole show is spent watching people lean . However , with the quality of the show the price is still value for money . Some of the key moments happen on Down-Stage Right , but fortunately the singing and lines are so clear you can visualise it for yourself . <p> I enjoyed it very much , my whole opinion of opera has changed . Although ' pure opera ' to me is when it is just singing , no acting . You wo n't see me at those kind of things . Anyway , yes I loved it . ' Christine ' played by Leila Benn Harris was amazing and loved her to bits . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how creepy Ramin Karimloo 's ' Phantom ' can be , his singing is beautiful and will blow you away . And as for Alex Rathgeber , the review I read is not nearly complimentary enough . He was by far an amazing singer and actor . Truly stole the show at times . In fact we were so impressed we went to the Stage Door ( and missed our train , but it was worth it ) . Leila did not come out in time for us to see her , but Alex and Ramin did . Alex was very charming , the nicest actor I 've ever met . And as my friend said to him ' he has nice hair ' . And Ramin looks so different in person ( because the make-up is very professional ) , but bless him he 's actually so cute and you can tell he is so overwhelmed with all the fans . Unfortunately , my camera had no battery and was charging at home so I 'm definitely going back to get photos , which they very kindly pose for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't miss it , or the Phantom ' will appear inside your mind and haunt you till you get a ticket . <p> After waiting over 20 years to see ' Phantom ' I finally made it over to the West End last week ( 10th September 2008 ) . I was a little worried when I read about the huge cast overhaul that had been made a couple of days prior but I need n't have worried - I found the show magical , I sat mesmerised throughout the whole performance and had constant shivers running up and down my spine that started the moment they raised the chandelier at the auction house to the very end , it was wonderful ! <p> Ramin Karimloo made a wonderful ' Phantom ' , Gina Beck an amazing ' Christine ' ( what a voice ! ) , after reading a few reviews about ' Raoul ' being a bit drippy in a few performances I was expecting to hate whoever played him but was more than pleasantly surprised when Simon Bailey appeared . Kate Radmilovic and Rohan Tickell as ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piangi ' were fabulous . In fact the whole cast were just brilliant , I could watch this show over and over again if given the chance . <p> Seats were great , we had G15 ( aisle ) and G16 in the Stalls . Legroom was adequate for two 5 ' 10 " people , one with a larger than average bottom ( ! ) and long legs although some shifting was required occasionally . Terrific view of the stage and actors , it was great to be close enough to see the expressions on their faces . I would most definitely book these seats again . <p> Having read a previous reviewer mention the rather cool air-conditioning I came equipped with a warm cardigan - I should have left it at home , I was so warm and did n't feel any kind of cool air in the theatre at all - I left the theatre rather red-faced with the heat . <p> One thing I will point out , we treated ourselves to the ' RoyalBox Sharing CanapTs ' - what a waste of money ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 12 tiny little bite sized treats , they were gone in seconds ! We also booked drinks for the interval and reserved a table , or so we thought , but when we got there our drinks and canapTs had just been put on a table and two other people had nicked the seats around it , so we had to stand to eat and drink . <p> A wonderfully memorable evening and well worth the 20 year wait to see the show - may it continue another 20 years ! <p> JackieMc <p> Went to see ' The Phantom of the Opera ' for a second time on 29th October 2008 in the evening . I 'll keep this short as I have done a review before . The story is amazing as ever and the new cast ( different from the last time ) was just as good if not better . Gina Beck is a brilliant actress as is Simon Bailey and of course the much loved Ramin . <p> Sat in STALLS Row N seats 17 and 18 . Being only 10 more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these seats are much much better . They are more central and much closer to the action . The sound is perfect , the view is perfect and this time there was lots of legroom . You do n't miss a thing at these seats , and they made the show much more enjoyable . <p> Went to the stage door . All the cast is friendly and gives out autographs and takes photos . Very nice people ! <p> Get your tickets soon ( although I think as it 's been on so long , it wo n't be ending anytime soon and I can see why ) . <p> I recently saw Phantom at Her Majesty 's Theatre as an early 2008 Christmas present for a friend . We were allocated seats in the Grand Circle ; K22 and 23 . All I can say is if I ever did it again ( and I wo n't ) I would avoid these seats . <p> Our seats were on the back row at the aisle , and I have sat in similar seating at many other shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 minutes later , approximately 25 latecomers arrived separately in small groups and were seated in with ushers along the Grand Circle . <p> The latecomers were held back our side , and then began lots of standing by Ushers in the middle of the aisle waiting to place the theatregoers . Some problem was occurring and the management were called and then more waiting followed and hovering in the eyeline edge continued . None of it was discreet . <p> This went on with door banging by ushers for about 30 minutes whilst we sat waiting in edgy anticipation that everyone would get seated successfully - Phew is was a relief when they were . <p> Unfortunately by this time we felt completely disconnected from the scene on stage and this was seemingly the case also for the latecomers who commenced to chat quite openly . Although the disruption was palpable the show itself lacked heart and we had n't developed any compassion for the characters ... but it all looked very nice . <p> When we left and teemed out onto the street we saw an advertisement for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' we laughed out loud because that summed up perfectly our experience at Her Majestys Theatre . <p> Never again ! <p> I went to see this on Monday 5th January 2009 , my first visit . We had seats D22 and D23 in the stalls , tickets bought via the annual ' Get into London Theatre ' offer . <p> Legroom was ample and the view was fantastic , I think we saw everything there was to see , so did n't feel restricted in anyway . The theatre was quite warm for a chilly night , only felt cold when side door near the seats was open . <p> Ramin Karimloo was fantastic as ' Phantom ' , but personally I felt he was outdone by ' Christine ' played by Katy Hall , her singing was amazing . <p> I am now hooked and want to go and see it again . <p> M <p> My girlfriend and I went to see ' Phantom of the Opera ' last night ( 6th January 2009 ) . I had seen it once before , years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the recommendation of this website and one or two others , in seats 18 and 19 of row C of the Royal Circle - the very best seats in the entire theatre . They were dead centre , we had not a single obstruction and could see every aspect of the production perfectly . Legroom was ample , and so long as nobody in front of you leans forward , you need n't move for the entire duration of the show . The tickets were 40 each , reduced from 55 each as part of a Christmas offer ; I would have happily paid full price given the quality of the seats and of the show . <p> We agree with your view that the show is ' lame ' , although I personally enjoyed it having embraced that fact . I thoroughly enjoyed the show and the music was played beautifully . It 's not the greatest score in the world ( that title belongs to ' Les MisTrables ' ) , but it is successful in so much as it does all that it is designed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the music and the stage performances of the actors was excellent . <p> Sadly , I felt that Ramin Karimloo 's performance as the Phantom was weak vocally - it certainly did not live up to the hype I had heard . His stage presence was good and he certainly had a haunting quality , but I felt that his singing was a bit too ' pop star ' -esque for the role . Katy Hall as Christine was magnificent , her voice was excellent and she acted well in addition to singing well . The rest of the cast were very good , and it was a great evening . <p> I have seen ' Phantom of the Opera ' many many times . I have seen various actors and I have to say that the current cast , led by Ramin Karimloo is one of the strongest . <p> Ramin is different every time . He seems to live the role and somehow seems to keep him fresh every time I 've seen it . As for his voice , I do n't see how some can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky but it is what it is . But he has some much power and dynamics . It 's nice to hear the different levels he 's brought to the role . He does n't just over sing every thing . Yet he does bring an element of Opera to the role too . But always , he 's full of passion . For an untrained singer his natural vocal technique is outstanding . <p> He has brought a fresh take on the role and a vitality which is refreshing after some of the Phantoms I 've seen who seem to have just walked through the role . Even when I 've heard Ramin when he 's sick he still manages to produce a heart felt Phantom . He has two great Christine 's in Gina Beck and Robyn North . I think the connection between Ramin and Robyn is very electric and sexy . Gina is a sweet Christine too . Simon Bailey is a fiery Raoul and the tension between him and Ramin in the final lair is amazing . The managers are the best I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and it 's definitely worth the ticket price . The seats in the theatre are all fairly good . Obviously the restricted ones have their downfalls but at least you know that in advance . <p> So go see the show . Ramin is worth the ticket price alone . <p> We saw ' Phantom of the Opera ' on 7th January 2009 . We sat in the stalls row G seats 15 to 18 ( GREEN on the Monkey 's plan ) . I am 5 ' 11 " tall and my knees where jammed against the seat in front . The young man sitting behind me ( who was taller than me ) spent the whole performance with his knees banging against the back of my seat ! I could not say anything as we were all so cramped together - it looks like they have added an extra row of seats and pushed the other seats really close together . Great view of the stage and all the action but no enough leg room ! <p> I went to see ' The Phantom of the Opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were sat in the stalls row F19 and 20 . These seats are very good . You are close to the stage without being too close , you can see the actors faces clearly ; and the famous chandelier is just to the right of you a little bit when it goes up and down so it 's not very scary being under it . The only thing I could think of that annoyed me about sitting in these seats is that Gina Beck ( who plays Christine ) had her back to us in some of the scenes , so we could n't see her reactions to the other characters . <p> The show is still one of the best I 've ever seen and it 's amazing how long its been running . All the principles were on , which was great for me . Gina Beck was Christine and she was phenomenal . her voice went so high and I really liked her portrayal of the role , she did n't act too much like a scared young girl . <p> Simon Bailey was Raoul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes him look like a wuss . He has a strong voice and I think he will make a good Phantom in the future . Ramin Karimloo was the Phantom and vocally I thought he was quite weak . I have seen this show twice before with John Owen Jones and I think JOJ had the better voice . However Ramin was very moving in ' Music of the Night ' and his acting was the best I 've ever seen . He portrays the Phantom as autistic , and he had all these mannerisms that I picked up on straight away . He made me cry at the end , he was just so incredible - especially when imitating the music box and when Christine gave the ring back . I will be going back soon to see this wonderful show ! <p> Kirsty <p> I went to see the show in March 2009 and we sat in row C of the stalls , seats C11 , C12 , and C13 . The view was excellent as it was really close to the actors . Unfortunately , the conductor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the dry ice with the boat scene happened , we could not see anything as the dry ice completely cut off our view - and it became very cold for a while . Otherwise they were excellent seats . <p> 24th April 2009 : <p> Seats : Royal Circle row C 24 and 25 . Brilliant view , although little leg room - but that is because the theatre is old , so has to be expected . <p> Ramin Karimloo was spectacular as the Phantom . I did not expect to sob as much as I did , having seen the musical many times and knowing the storyline , but this man is exceptional . He brought back a vulnerability to the role that has n't been seen in a Phantom since Michael Crawford in my opinion . Go see this man in this role before he leaves . The whole cast were fantastic but this man is one to watch . <p> Emma <p> Saw " Phantom " last night for the first time ( 6th May 2009 ) . I am only 13 and have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' was special . I went with my friend , who is also 13 , and I loved it ; sadly , she did n't . She had fallen asleep after the first act . <p> I loved it . the special effects were among the best I have ever seen in a theatre , the music and the acting - I loved every minute of it . It started as soon as I entered the theatre ; it was a lovely , grand and majestic theatre - it made you feel like you were in the Paris Opera House . <p> Sat in Dress Circle row A22 and 23 and they were excellent seats . I never have a problem with legroom in the dress circle ; I find the D/C my preferred place to sit in the theatre to the stalls . However , I did find this seat a little bit tight myself , however not tight enough to decrease my enjoyment of the show . Loved every minute of it . 11/10 . <p> I went to see The Phantom of The Opera on the 1st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall seats from D7 through to D16 as there was 10 of us . I was responsible for buying the tickets hence I had checked reviews of the seats using TheatreMonkey , which I found was very useful . D7 through to D16 were fantastic seats , probably the best seats in the house . We were 3 rows from the front , and was very close to the stage . The music was fantastic , and the singing was mind blowing . We were right underneath the chandelier . I would recommend row D and above . It was worth the money . I ca n't wait to see Love Never Dies ! " <p> Catherine . <p> TheGreatHumbug : <p> Myself and three of my friends booked tickets to see Phantom for the 5th of January 2010 , and should have taken the adverse weather as the first sign that we should have stayed at home . <p> Firstly , I should say that our seats were perfect . We were front row of the Dress circle and the view could simply not have been better . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressive the set looked even pre-show . Unfortunately , the problems only started after the show had begun . <p> After showing initial promise with some very impressive effects , it soon became apparent that the cast was not able to keep up with the set . They were outdone by every other department working on the show . It is , in a word , spectacular , by which I mean that it is all spectacle . Wardrobe , lighting , the set and the orchestra were all very appealing but the cast and direction completely floundered . <p> The staging was clumsy with actors spending much of the show wandering the stage looking as if they could n't find a mark and even when they did their delivery was sub-standard . I know this is musical theatre and that perhaps it requires more suspension of disbelief than other theatre , but in this case the only thing that could have suspended my disbelief was if you sentenced it to life . Phantom and Christine were unconvincing and overworked , while Raoul fell into the usual trap of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to be there . <p> Phantom 's 23 years have led to it becoming stagnant . It needs a reason to be kept going ; new energy and fervour . As it is , it plays like the West End 's granddad on life support , while there are young , vibrant shows out there in Theatreland . Come on Phantom , people need a reason not to pull the plug . <p> Thought I 'd drop you a line with regard to my most recent trip to London to finally catch " Phantom , " a show that I 've wanted to witness for a long time but not enough to fork out for the always-top price and **33;37;TOOLONG seats ! Anyway , only last week we plumped for two 40 tickets via See Tickets and rolled up to Her Majesty 's on Friday night ( 29th January 2010 ) . <p> Overall , myself and my fiancTe both really enjoyed the show . I left the theatre feeling like I 'd just witnessed a show that was easy to see quite why it 's been so successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the music - that , until Friday , was n't particularly appealing to me . The atmosphere created was a particular plus-point for me , and by the end of show I was hooked . That said , it did take some time for me to get to " know " the central characters - so to speak - but we were in the Upper Circle and I think you always get wrapped-up in things a lot quicker when sat down in the Stalls . <p> I 'm a big fan of the classic Universal Horror Movies so found myself quickly enjoying the general mood of the piece and the creepiness of the Phantom inhabiting all parts of the theatre . Even though I think you can tell that the show is now 20+ years old from a number of the effects , it still worked ; but after hearing so many chandelier stories I must admit to feeling a little disappointed when the thing " crashed " down - Hmmmmm . I was far more impressed when it came to life and was lifted up at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the old guy bidding for the music box was actually Raoul and I think if ever I watched this again it would have more impact as I did enjoy the unusual opening to the show . It was impossible to not be impressed by many of the sets ; I loved the opening of Act 2 on the grand staircase and what 's not to like about a moving gondola , dry ice and let's-pretend candles ! <p> Not being a big fan of the majority of music used throughout ( in particular when they were supposed to be actually performing in an opera ) much of it did nothing for me , and I found myself hoping many numbers would hurry along . That said though , the songs that we all know ( and love ? ) were used to very dramatic effect and quite simply ... worked . Much of the " romance " is over-the-top and dramatic , but as I do n't often watch shows of this nature it did n't really give me cause to be critical as I expected this when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical that I 'd rush out and buy the OCR straight after but more perhaps pluck a handful of the best ones from i-tunes ( or alternatively just nab my mother 's ' Andrew Lloyd Webber Collections ' ! ) . <p> Whilst I thought the cast was good , no-one really blew me away . I 've come away from some musicals raving about the likes of Kerry Ellis and Laura Michelle Kelly , but I 'm none the wiser about the three leads in Phantom , and to be honest have no interest in looking up their bio 's . That said , they were perfectly adequate ; and , of them all , I thought the role of Madame Giry was played brilliantly . <p> We paid 40 + booking fee for Seats B27 and 28 in the Grand Circle , and whilst I 'd never usually choose seats this high-up , I 'd read on good authority ( i.e. here ) that the Grand Circle is n't particularly high . Coupled with a very limited choice of seats , I went for these . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly identified as " Restricted , " as my aisle seat ( and much more so the seat next to me ) , often had a blocked view of the performance , especially when the action was Stage Right . It 's typical that much of the show seemed to take place here - with very little on the alternative side of the stage - so , with that in mind I highly recommend sitting to the right hand side of the theatre if choosing . As per usual , Row B suffers from your view being spoilt if people in front lean over ; I found myself envying the people sat in the central section in Row A as they paid the same price as me but are great seats . They 've got it right in so much as the seats get less expensive as you move toward the wall , but the seats on the aisle and adjacent to that should also be reduced . Plenty of leg room for the aisle seats , as lots of room in front , but was also adequate when moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show that 's rightly heralded as a classic - it has n't jumped to the top of the list of my favourites , but in fairness a show with as much music in this particular style is never going to rank quite as highly as some others . I 'll definitely be looking to check out " Love Never Dies . " <p> I went to see Phantom last night ( 18th June 2010 ) and thought I would submit a review of our seats . We were in E 10 , 11 and 12 in the stalls and they were very good . Probably the best view I have ever had at the theatre . Almost central , four rows from the front , right under the chandelier and with plenty of legroom for my 6ft 2ins frame . We paid top price for them but well worth the money . <p> Adam <p> I 've just returned home from the matinee of " Phantom " ( 2nd October 2010 ) , a show that I 've seen about 30 times , but not been for 4 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but my girlfriend wished to see it , so off we went . <p> I have to say I was more impressed than I was expecting . Scott Davies was back as the Phantom , a role he played a few years ago , and was mightily impressive . He was a constantly twitching , nervous character , rather like an alcoholic who is desperate for a drink but can not get one . I think Mr Davies must be one of the most experienced Phantoms by now , and his performance really shows that . <p> Sofia Escobar is a superb Christine , young and naive , and in fine voice . The management pairing of Barry James ( greatest Thenardier in my opinion ) and Gareth Snook are the best I 've seen , they work well together . Carlotta and Piangi I can not comment on - I find the characters terribly irritating . Will Barret as Raoul , well , sorry but he 's awful . Maybe he is quite new to the role , I 'm not sure , but he is instantly forgettable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Phantom - she should have stayed with the Phantom and told Raoul to clear off ! <p> That 's it really , one last thing - Scott Davies received a standing ovation when he came on to take his bow - this was the only standing ovation I 've ever witnessed for this show , I think it was mainly for his own performance as opposed to the show as a whole . <p> Saw Phantom this week ( December 2010 ) for the first time and was blown away ! John Owen-Jones was playing the Phantom and I was so impressed by his range , acting and general musicality . His voice is superb and he really made the show . Christine was also very good and played the character well . Her voice was brilliant and she had a hard task hitting all those high notes but she did it every time . I have to say that Raoul was no match for the Phantom but he did his best and , along with the rest of the cast , produced a great show . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting to see how a show can use the space . In this instance they use height and there were some exciting moments ! <p> Some people have thought that the show dragged but I think that is par for the course with musicals when they are a couple of hours long , and actually I was eager for the second half to start as I was really enjoying the performance . <p> I went with my mother and sister , neither of whom were particularly keen to see it , but we had time to kill so went for the matinee and were really glad we did ! We came out of the show on cloud 9 , so emotional and uplifted by the sterling performances and still singing the music of the night ! <p> We managed to get seats in the stalls , row M 17 to 19 and were very pleased as the visibility is great . Pretty central and close to the stage so you can really experience the show . There is n't much space as the theatre is small so it does feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansari <p> Brian McCann but as Phantom he ca n't ! <p> As a 45th birthday treat for my Wife we travelled from South Wales to see the Phantom ( for the umpteenth time ! ) in January 2011 . <p> We knew the night before via Twitter that John Owen-Jones would not be the Phantom due to illness but knew that we would be in safe hands with Scott Davies as the understudy . How wrong we were ! <p> Brian McCann ( named as swing on the website ) donned the mask and was completely ill-prepared for the role . He could n't have been more out of his depth if the boat had capsized in Act 1 ! He completely lacked stage presence , had no voice to speak of and overdid the histrionics to the point that the Phantom became a caricature rather than a sympathetic figure . <p> The rest of the cast were completely fine , notably Sofia Escobar who was excellent as Christine . <p> I feel sorry for anyone who has the misfortune to experience this particular Phantom . Its an iconic role that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems for Mr McCann . <p> Paul Johnson Port Talbot South Wales <p> McCanns masterpiece provides the perfect Phantom <p> Let 's get it clear : Paul Johnson of Port Talbot could not be more wrong in his summary of Brian McCanns performance as understudy Phantom . <p> My wife and I were very much looking forward to seeing John Owen-Jones as Phantom , after recently seeing his superb Valjean . Whilst a little disappointed that we were seeing the understudy , we came with open minds . ( 11th January 2011 matinee , Stalls G12 and 13 ) . <p> My praise is reserved for McCanns masterpiece performance , combining a slight subtle stature with an explosive , concentrated , resonant Phantom . McCanns Phantom is sensual , poignant and powerful , beautifully vulnerable , played and sung with aplomb . His performance moves you . It reaches off the stage , grabs you by the throat and begs you to empathise or at least sympathise with his plight . <p> ( I rank McCanns performance with some of the greats that I have been lucky enough to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Philip Quast , Kenneth Branagh , Steve Balsamo , and John Owen Jones . ) <p> Brian McCann should be proud of his performance . It was a privilege to see such a brilliant understudy and , whilst my wife and I will return for the matinee on 18th January hoping to see John Owen Jones , if Brian McCann happens to be playing again we know that we will not be disappointed . <p> ( And , no , we are not Phans or groupies . We simply want to catch JOJ as Phantom before the imminent arrival of our baby , as we will be unable to do much theatre afterwards . ) <p> PS : Paul Johnsons review referred to histrionics and caricature that werent evident on this occasion . I rarely feel compelled to correct a review , but such vitriolic bile is unjustified . McCanns Phantom has a depth and dimension beyond Johnsons shallow review . <p> Christian Ball , Kent <p> McCann as Phantom = Phenomenal ! <p> I was very shocked to read Paul Johnsons review of Phantom , notably his opinion/attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no voice to speak of ' is beyond me . I understand people have different tastes but this is ridiculous ! <p> I went to see the show on Sat 8th January 2011 and was overwhelmed by Brian McCanns Phantom performance . He has tremendous stage presence , his voice is flawless and the energy he put into the role was clear for all to see . I have seen this show about 4-5 times over the years and I for one was moved to tears by his performance . <p> Also , for the record , Brian McCann is a ' swing ' * in the programme - yes , but he is also listed as ' first cover ' ** for the Phantom , Scott Davies is the standby Phantom , i.e. , the ' alternate . ' *** <p> I hope to see Brian reprising the role in the future as Phantom himself , and not as his understudy . In my opinion , he is well worthy of it . <p> Amy London <p> ( Editor 's note : * ' Swing ' - performer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are absent . Usually highly talented and skilled as they need to learn many roles in the show very precisely and may take over at a moment 's notice . ** ' First Cover ' the first choice actor to take a lead role in case of another 's illness . *** ' Alternate ' An actor assigned to play a lead role on fixed dates when the lead actor is absent either on holiday or taking a ' rest ' day each week . ) <p> Two friends and I went to the matinee performance of ' Phantom ' on the 18th January 2011 . The first thing to say is that our seats in the stalls , Row F were fabulous , made even better by the fact that the rows in front of us were filled by school children which helped provide a flawless view of the action . <p> We had hoped to see the incumbent Phantom , John Owen-Jones after being mightily impressed by his latest performances in the ' Les Mis ' tour and the ' Three Phantoms ' concert but unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our seats to watch his alternate Scott Davies . <p> Having seen the show a few times before we had our own personal taste on how we like our Phantoms to be portrayed and were not sure how Scott would fare - we neednt have worried . Although , perhaps not the strongest Phantom vocally , Scott provided his audience with a performance that was powerful and innovative . <p> The day was made even better when regardless of the fact he would be performing later Scott spent around fifteen minutes at stage door talking and having pictures with us . He is a true gentleman and a real star in a profession where there are few . The rest of the cast were as usual fantastic . Needless to say when we see this production again Mr. Owen-Jones has a lot of convincing to do . <p> Ciara Hemming . West Midlands . <p> Went to see ' Phantom ' on December 8th 2010 - sat in M 28 and 27 in the stalls ( if my memory serves me ! ) and the seats are excruciatingly uncomfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - they leave you aching by the end of the performance . This theatre is in need of a massive refurb . These are probably the most uncomfortable stalls we have ever been in but the view is excellent and the small theatre itself ( looking from the stalls ) is lovely , very sweet and intimate but desperately need new updated seats ! ! <p> ' Phantom ' is one I have been putting off , as it is a ' must see ' but kept getting knocked down my list of priorities ... but as I was outvoted on this occasion , I went with an open mind but with no expectations ... as I was a bit apprehensive about whether I would enjoy it or not ... I was very pleasantly surprised . I really did have an excellent time and I would want to see it again . <p> Sofia Escobar and John Owen-Jones were incredible as the two leads , both with a combination of astonishingly good voices and great acting . Will Barratt as Raoul was very good , if not particularly memorable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I expected . My one criticism ( perhaps controversially ) is that on several occasions , especially apparent in Notes/Twisted In Every Way in Act Two , there are too many people singing different lines over each other to hear what anyone is singing individually . Unfortunately this just makes it confusing and far too abstract to be enjoyable or helpful to the storyline in any way . <p> Having said this , these low points do not take away from the rest of the musical that when they hit the mark are absolutely breathtaking ( such as Music of the Night or All I Ask of You - all versions ! ) . <p> Overall I loved it and found it very enjoyable , and I would recommend it . <p> Beth <p> 17th February 2011 , stalls Row G Seat 22 . This seat provided a great view of the stage action . I found the leg room really good for my 6ft frame , the seat padding seemed quite thin though but it was comfortable . For the ( access rate ) of 29.75 I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as the Phantom and the music is still as great as ever . I am still undecided whether Stalls or Royal Circle is the best position for this show though . <p> My criticism of this theatre and show is that unless you book early , the theatre 's seat allocations are actually not great ( because ticket agencies take their allocations apparently ) , especially if like me you are picky with were you sit with Theatremonkey 's advice at the ready ! <p> May 2011 . This was the first time either of us had seen this . <p> We were both absolutely blown away by the beginning when the music starts and the chandelier begins its ascent . It made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up and I went all shivery ! This show is an amazing visual spectacle and I would definitely go and see it again for that aspect of it alone . <p> The scene with the gondola , the dry ice and the candles was breathtaking and seamlessly done . <p> John Owen Jones stole the show for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of sympathy in the role . <p> I did enjoy the first half more than the second - I found a couple of the scenes in the second half overly long really . Also , I am not a huge fan of Charles Hart 's lyrics and the way words are sometimes crammed into songs , whether they fit or not ( and quite often they do n't rhyme which bugs me ! ) <p> That said , this is a great show and I do n't think you can be a regular West End theatre goer and not see it . <p> We sat in the Grand Circle , Row B16 and B17 . The head of the man in front of me obscured my view slightly and my partner ( who is 6 ' 4 " ) found that the legroom was not sufficient for him and he was a bit uncomfortable and had to keep shifting in his seat . It is a central position so good from that point of view and I would say it is probably one of the best places to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ! <p> Having read very mixed reviews of the front row seats at Her Majesty 's Theatre I was a bit nervous about going to see ' The Phantom of the Opera ' for the 5th time and this time in row B seat 6 . But I had no need to worry at all ! I 'm 5.4 and I had no problem with the leg room and the stage was n't very high so you could see everything even at the back of the stage . The only " problem " is that you 're so close that you have to decide where to look when a lot is happening at once as you ca n't see everything at the same time . For a first time goer I would recommend a seat further back but for someone who has seen the show at least once before it is absolutely perfect ! I just love being close to the action and to be able to see the actors faces and costumes properly ! <p> 9th July 2011 . <p> I shall focus on my experience with buying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obviously outstandingly amazing ! ! ! ) <p> I 'd been wanting to see the show for ages , but did n't fancy paying a massive amount for the tickets . Therefore I thought day seats would be perfect . I phoned the See Tickets box office number the day before I went ( as the theatre does not have its own telephone line ) to check that you could purchase day seats like other theatres in London . Having been told by the representative that yes you could in fact buy tickets on the door , at a cheaper price for the best seats in the house , we set off extra early , and arrived at the theatre at about 8.45am for the doors to open at 10am . A small queue formed behind us from about 9.30am , and at 10am , the doors opened and we were first to the box office window . After asking the very helpful woman behind the desk whether they had seats available , she informed us that Her Majesty 's theatre does not offer day seats , never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conversation had the day previously with a See box office member of staff , she hinted that this keeps happening and See continually give out wrong information , and that I should make a formal complaint to them about what had happened . <p> Not to be put off from seeing the show , we ended up paying 62.50 each for seats 13 and 14 in Row J stalls , as having got there early , queued up etc , we were n't prepared to have second rate seats . The view from here was brilliant , and absolutely fantastic for the chandelier moments , as well as enabling you to see the Phantom at the top of the rig ( which you would miss out on if further forward or under the overhang if further back ) . The leg room however was ridiculous , and I could n't have my legs directly in front of me . It would seem this row has been made smaller due to the premium seats in front of it , but having the asile seat meant I could stretch my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere else in this row , I would have had to change seats , as I physically would n't have been able to last the duration of the performance ( 34inch legs ... ) Thankfully , the overwhelming performance and amazing view made me quickly forget about the leg room , but feel this should be mentioned when you buy the tickets . <p> To return to the See Tickets ' incorrect information issue ' , I emailed them the next day outlining the problem I had encountered . I had to phone See again , and after much discussion over the phone , they begrudgingly gave me their complaints department email address ( something very difficult to find online ) . Multiple emails bounced between me and a specific person , wanting to know the date I phoned , the exact time , who I previously spoke to , the number I phoned from ..... ( all of which I was unable to provide ) This went on for a week , and finally they said they were unable to find any trace of my call , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doubt that I had indeed phoned , and that i was told incorrect information , and that they would refund me the full price of one of my tickets . Result ! After providing them with the booking reference number on the ticket , I have the money back in my account , and was actually amazed at their ability to help me out ( after being so notoriously bad ! ) <p> Thursday 20th October 2011 : 7.30pm . <p> After one emotional rollercoaster of a show ( ' Ghost ' ) I went on to my next , Phantom . Kleenex was my friend that day . I had booked row E seat 1 of the royal circle for that night 's performance as I had been wanting to see Katie Hall as Christine for AGES - and I was also pleased at the thought of seeing John Owen Jones as the Phantom , as I had previously seen the two actors in the ' Les Mis ' tour last year . However it was not to be ... When I got to the show and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phantom alongside Katie ; and I had one other understudy - Marc Vastenavont as Piangi . <p> Having seen Scott before I was a little disappointed , as I had n't been impressed with him on that occasion . However I decided I would give him the benefit of the doubt . <p> My view was very good . I could n't see the chandelier rise all the way up to the ceiling due to the next level overhanging , but of the stage it was very good . I just about saw Raoul and the managers in their box during ' Think Of Me ' . <p> Katie Hall as Christine was what I hoped . she was blo*dy brilliant . She is so young , which is how the part was written , and her voice was so powerful where it needed to be . Anna Forbes as Meg seemed to change the way she played Meg the last time I saw her with Sofia . With Sofia she seemed a bit more mature to compliment ; but with Katie she acted so much younger , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me straight away . He is a very strong Raoul , not foppish and weedy at all . I truly wanted him to kick the Phantom 's butt and get the girl , ha ha . The other principles were also very good . Barry James and Gareth Snook are a brilliant pairing when it comes to the managers , and Wendy Ferguson worked so well with Marc they also seemed to bring some comedy and personality in their roles ... <p> ... Which brings me to talk about the Phantom , Scott Davies . I actually started off really liking his performance . He seemed so active and young around Katie , he was bouncing around the stage . He sang brilliantly in the title song , and in ' Music Of The Night ' he acted and sung flawlessly . I was beginning to change my opinion of him . But towards the end of Act 1 , in the ' All I Ask Of You ' reprise he seemed to lose his way . When he tried to bellow ' you will curse the day ... ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he struggled to get the rest of the line out . It was such a shame . I hoped , given the intermission , he would have time to recover - but it was as if he had given up . The rest of the show he seemed very tired and bland . His voice cracked twice more during the second half , and I felt a little bit sorry for him because I can imagine that is one of the worst things that could happen to anyone on stage . He seemed to pick up a little in the final scene and I did feel pity for his Phantom as he told Christine he loved her and then his facial expression when she gave him back his ring . <p> I really enjoyed the show and everyone else was really good . However I do wish I had seen Mr Owen Jones instead . Maybe I will get a chance now the tour has announced Katie Hall as Christine and John Owen Jones to share the role of Phantom with Earl Carpenter . I wish this cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hope to see it again soon . <p> 18th November 2011 , 7:30pm I sat in the Upper Circle 's B36 , which is priced at 21 due to its very restricted view . You can see the full body of the actors and set from the centre over to stage left wings . From centre to stage right wings , you slowly are able to see less and less ... You will be able to see the top halves of the actors when they dwell in the stage right area unless they are very far upstage right or very downstage right . <p> However , this musical is one of the few shows that uses the stage space in a constantly varied way . It is never a consistent struggle to see the actors , since they are always moving around . The other great thing is that you are not distracted by backstage activity - very professionally/smoothly done with black masking and respectfulness to audience members . In this seat , you are sitting next to a spotlight operator , but the gentleman I sat beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6ft tall fellow , and felt very comfortable , since I was on the aisle . I 'd recommend this seat , even for a first timer , as long as they are not a grump , and are a theatre fan who does n't mind a really close view with a bit of a restriction . <p> I first saw ' Phantom ' in the West End over 20 years ago and can not believe I waited till November 2011 to see it again - twice ! For the first performance I sat in a premium-priced seat in the stalls and for the second right on the front row , ( I decided on this because I had the misfortune lately to end up behind some pretty tall people when sitting further back , which can somewhat ruin the enjoyment even in top-priced seats ! ) . I had worried I would be too near , but as the stage is not so high as it is in productions such as ' We Will Rock You ' at the Dominion Theatre was , for me it was PERFECT ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front row ) and wonderful to be so close and to see all the facial expressions of the performers ! <p> During the first performance I saw Sofia Escobar in the role of Christine DaaT and she was truly outstanding , with the most beautiful voice . During the second I saw Katie Hall . Having seen Katie in the 25th anniversary concert of Les Miserables , I knew she had a good voice , but had no IDEA just how powerful it really was since the part of Christine in Phantom is way more demanding than that of Cosette in Les Mis ! Katie 's vocal range is out of this world and I feel so lucky to have seen both Katie and Sofia and could not choose who played it better ! Killian Donnelly as Raul was very endearing - he has a nice voice and his acting was wonderful ( and what a lovely chap he is too in real life ! ) , but the true star of the show has to be the one and only John Owen Jones as the Phantom . He acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tears ! I first saw John playing the part of one of the students in Les Mis many years ago - he stood out even then ! So it is no surprise to me he has gone from strength to strength in his career , and the role of Phantom is surely one of the most demanding on any singer . John did not let the audience down once - he is faultless , and I feel so lucky to have seen him play the part . <p> The music was haunting , the orchestra was outstanding right from the start , and as the chandelier rises , you just know this is going to be something special ! Being on the front row , we were able to look down in the pit and thank the musicians in person at the end - WOW were they good and deserve appreciation ! Thank you to all the cast and crew of Phantom for unforgettable evenings and many happy memories - ca n't wait for the next time ! ! <p> Fiona in Florence . <p> 21st January 2012 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fantastic . Great views and right in the middle of the seating so good overall view and sound . <p> Booked these seats having reviewed them on this website beforehand and would like to add my recommendation as I was very happy . <p> Sarah , Hertfordshire . <p> I am demanding a refund for the two tickets I purchased through lastminute.com for the 14th February 2012 performance of Phantom . Buying through lastminute meant I could n't choose my seats <p> Our Valentines celebration was ruined by a ) the restricted view we had from our seats on the back row of the Royal Circle - H17 and H18 and b ) the intolerable heat . <p> The overhang of the upper circle blocks the view of the upper part of the stage from row H. The restricted view prevented us from seeing significant action . Particularly the graveside scene at the start of Act 2 , not to mention the spectacle of the chandelier and the phantom observing the scene on the rooftop . I deliberately did n't buy the cheapest tickets available as I wanted a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had anything other than the worst seats in the house . As we bent double to look at the action it was obvious that even one row forward in G the view was much , much better . I think it is criminal for the seats in the back row of the Royal Circle to be advertised and sold in the same price plan as seats with a far better viewing angle either elsewhere in the RC or in the stalls . <p> Not only this but the heat in our seats was intolerable . The size and space of the seats is uncomfortable enough to start with , but the added discomfort of the heat made for a very unpleasant and painful experience . This utterly detracted from the action unfolding in front of us as we were unable to focus or immerse ourselves in the performance due to the distraction of our pain . <p> I 'm not normally a grouch ! I really do n't  waste much energy crying over spilt milk . Que sera sera ! Live and let live ! Make the most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow the disappointment of what should have been a wonderfully enjoyable and romantic experience being destroyed so completely by such simple but effective factors has me utterly indignant . <p> Ed . <p> Very enjoyable , polished 5 star performance . <p> However , very disappointed with " Theatre Tickets Direct " . Beware of their " Best Available Seats " offer . Our seats were Royal Circle B34-35 right on the outside of the row , clearly without full view of the stage as stated in some correspondence . Its simply a way to sell second grade overpriced seats under the disguise of a special offer . Would have been happy to pay full price for better seats but no cooperation from " Theatre Tickets Direct " . I feel ripped off and will never touch this company again . <p> L. Kalberer , Blenheim , New Zealand . <p> Here I go with my review of my seating for ' Phantom of the Opera ' on Thursday 12th July 2012 . <p> I saw Phantom of the Opera on 12th July 2012 with a friend . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were phantastic ( ! ) There was plenty of legroom and the view was very good . I do n't think we missed a thing . It was great being so up close and personal to the actors and catching their eye on several occasions ; ) <p> I do n't think there is anything negative I can say about these seats , except that they are in the middle of the row and so you have to constantly stand up to let people pass . The most annoying part of this was that some people were late and so we all had to stand up to let them in to their seats during the show , so we missed a part of it , as did the people behind us ! <p> As for the show ... I 've seen it three times now and I 've never been disappointed yet . Special mention to Sofia Escobar who plays Christine Daae . She is superb . Such an angelic yet powerful voice , a beautiful face and wonderful stage presence . She fits the part perfectly . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first language , but you 'd never guess from her performance . Not sure who I saw as the Phantom but he too was good , as was the actor who played Raoul.

Was given M18 and N12 ( stalls ) for the matinee . When I left at 10:15am it looked like there were about 35 in the queue , but this is a two show day , half term and around Valentine 's Day , so may not be indicative of an off-peak day . Online there are still " premium " double seats available to buy for the same performance but unsurprisingly were n't selling these as day seats . I paid half in theatre tokens and half in cash . Morning ! Friday 17th February 2017 . Arrived at 8am and there were 4 people already waiting . Everyone after us arrived quite late about 9am . There were about 35 people waiting at 10am when they opened . Guy came out straight away and said they only had single seats . Managed to get 2 in the dress circle .

I got offered back of stalls or back of dress circle . The seats in stalls were separate but on the same row , and due to the fact today 's show was going to have a visual description in the dress circle , I decided to go for stalls , as apparently they drop down a screen with a visual description in the dress circle , and I thought I would find it annoying .

@@45560883 @5560883/ <p> " Les Miserables " is fantastic . I loved it , and it comes joint second with " My Fair Lady " in my " favourites " list . <p> My seat was dreadful though - row C in the Balcony - very high ! <p> I give les MisTrables 8/10 ! ! ! <p> E . Bernstone <p> We had to write a report on Les Miserables for my theatre school and ever since I wrote the report I 've wanted to go and see it . The review here is exactly what happens in the show ! <p> Edward Barber <p> Well , my dear theatre monkey , I have to say the ultimate of theatre experiences for me is Les MisTrables . I had the fortune to be taken for the first time on my 30th birthday , and I have n't looked back since . <p> I love it with a passion , it makes you laugh cry , sing and want to start your own revolt ! ! ! I have been loads of times . I did n't  enjoy it as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the scrummy Javert ) was played by am imposter ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Shock horror and double gasp ! ! ! ! But i am informed the REAL Javert is back on the 2.12.02 , phew thank goodness . <p> So if you see a young lady dribbling on the side lines that 's me , I would be there all the time if I could , but I think I would start to scare the cast . ( And i hear there is a stalking law now : - ) ) <p> Angie . <p> I 've seen " Les Mis " twice at the Palace and it is superb ! Even better , my favourite actor ever was starring as Javert the two times i saw it ! ... i think Jerome Pradon is absolutely brilliant ! He gives so much power and emotion to his performances ... so did every single actor on that stage ! <p> It 's amazing how much volume and great sound they can project from the stage ! ... and I counted only around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... it 's sad/emotional/funny/and so energetic ! 10/10 ! ! ! go and see it ! ! ! <p> Carys Boulton -x- <p> I recently went to see Les Mis at the Palace Theatre at an ' off peak ' Thursday matinee ( no longer running ) . ( well done to Cameron Mackintosh for this brilliant pricing idea- without it I fear " Les Mis " and " Phantom " may have gone the way of " Cats " as the pressure for available playhouses grew- ( " The Producers " , " La Boheme " , " Anything Goes " , " Mary Poppins " , " Sound of Music " et al ) <p> When I turned up at the theatre , having booked through Lastminute.com , I was disappointed to find that the seats were in row A of the stalls . At a reduced offer price of 20 these offered barely adequate value for money compared to the balcony and Upper Circles . <p> For admiring the strength of the performances , these seats were ideal- and the performances I saw were strong indeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourite role- Javert and Hans Peter Jansen is more than able in the role of Valjean- ( a transfer to " Phantom " for these outstanding vocalists would be amazing ? ? ? ? ) The Thernardiers were also brilliant up close . Even from the Dress Circle you miss most of their hysterical interaction , and its worth sitting in the stalls for this alone . <p> For me the star of the show was the young boy who played Gavroche . I normally see the use of children in musicals ( with the obvious exception of " Bugsy Malone " ) as risky as often they do not have the vocal strength or discipline which this exacting art form requires . On this occasion , however , I was very glad to be proven wrong . Young Gavroche provided one of the strongest voices on the stage and his acting was superb . His dying scene was a bit hammy , but the problem there lies in the libretto rather than the performance . The current Marius is however , fairly weak and I doubt that Jon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , row A was by no means perfect ; the grandeur and spectacle of this magnificent show was lost as a result being tucked up against the orchestra pit and staring up at the extended stage . On many occasions , the front of the stage seems crowded and oddments of furniture blocked the view of the players . Any action which occurred on the rear portion of the stage was lost as no more than head and shoulders of the actors were visible . The Barricade scene was the only one I could watch comfortably . The infamous turntable proves equally irksome from this angle , despite its invisibility , as its incessant , irrelevant motion detracts from ( and perhaps , my inner cynic suggests , negates the need for ) actual acting . Sound quality is good in this row , although , sitting on the left hand side of the theatre the horns were slightly unbalanced , often overmastering the strings . But now I 'm being VERY picky . <p> These seats offer fair value at Off Peak performances , particularly if your interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would not however , reccommend these seats to first time viewers as the view they offer is unlikely to get you hooked . <p> William Cooper <p> Wow ! Having wanted to see the show for seven years , I made it , and " wow " just about sums it up ! <p> The staging is beyond compare , and I think this is one of the few shows where the theatregoer benefits from a higher position , in the Dress or Upper circles . The way the barricades come together is truly awe-inspiring . <p> As for the show itself , my companions , not being such avid fans as I am , had some difficulty following the story . I strongly recommend a read of the programme to fill in any gaps . <p> The emotions in me were running high , I can tell you . I left the theatre in tears , and was halfway to Buckingham Palace before I stopped ( much to the amusement of my mum ! ) . It 's something you have to see to feel its true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the characters he writes are brought to life through the astonishing music and direction of this musical so truly . <p> Kyrsty Mewett <p> We took the monkeys advice and went to see Les Mis . WOW ! ! ! Amazing . We sat in the Palace Theatre stalls Row M seats 20 and 21 . Perfect view and sound . John Lee has made a great transition from Pop to Musical . A must See . <p> Andrew Robinson <p> The show was amazing , and the seats ( Palace Theatre stalls F26 and 27 ) were perfect ! ! ! you could see everything really well , the only bit I could n't see was one minuscule bit in " Red and Black " where Enjolras was blocking Marius a bit , but that was it . <p> I 'd heard that " Les Miserables " was going to be the best musical I would see . I was more skeptical , however I chose to see it over " We Will Rock You " and what a good choice it was . I thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch that this production embodies is found nowhere else and in no other production , although " Miss Saigon " does come close . The sheer volume of storyline is certainly not something to fear when thinking about going to see " Les Mis " - it is something to look forward to ! The sad yet sometimes uplifting storyline still provides a breath of fresh air from the now increasingly popular musicals made about famous Rock or Pop stars . <p> I give Les Miserables five stars and recommend anyone over the age of 13 to see it now ! <p> Ben Wooldridge <p> What a spectacle . <p> Unmissable ( particularly before it moves , ruining the west end by getting rid of greatest musicians in the world ) . Story is true , deep , complex ( although not hard work ) and songs are genuine and stand by themselves , not like many Webber works . <p> Actors are incredible , and voices are exceptional . <p> I came out not knowing which song to start humming , and with 2 completely converted friends . Pips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic . <p> In a beautiful theatre ( PALACE ) , one of the best few evenings out in the West End ! <p> I have seen Les Miserables in January 2003and it was very hard for me to not notice the cuts . it is not " the bits that restored a year a go " , it is lots of things from the original musical . <p> I hope the performance will still be good in the Queen 's theatre as it was at the Palace Theatre . <p> Shai Helfman Jerusalem Israel <p> <p> I 've seen many a West End musical but " Les Mis " remains my all time favourite . I love the complexity of the plot , the drama , the characters , the music and the fact that it never ceases to make me cry ! I urge you to go see it and take a box of tissues . I 've seen it nine times so far at the Palace and I 've enjoyed it from every angle - front stalls , back stalls , boxes , circles . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trip this summer just to recharge my batteries . <p> Debbie , Greenford <p> FROM THE QUEEN 'S THEATRE PRODUCTION <p> After seeing Les Miserables for the first time last night , I just wanted to share my thoughts of it . <p> I 've been wanting to see this show for years , but only got the opportunity last night . The show itself did n't disappoint , all the cast were perfect and I was particularly impressed with Jon Lee in the role of Marius . I was sat in row Q in the stalls , and even though I had a perfect view and adequate leg room , I could n't help but think how I would 've liked to have been closer to the stage . I felt slightly out of the action so to speak . The overhang does block a little of the top half of the set , but nothing to ruin the experience . <p> All in all , I had a enjoyable night out and it 's definitely one show that all theatregoers must see at some point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me feeling exhilarated and wanting to experience it all again , so much so that I went out and bought the DVD at the end . <p> Miss M. Billham Southend , Essex <p> I booked tickets to see " les MisTrables " a couple of months ago , without really knowing that it had moved to Queens Theatre . <p> After it was booked , I heard from all different people that it was changing theatres . People were saying that the move had totally changed the production and that it was n't going to be the same any more , however , they were all misinformed . I 'd seen " Les Miz " at the Palace Theatre before , and it was definitely just as good as that , if not better . <p> I just wanted to let people know that , although the orchestra has slightly changed , the musical was still just as fantastic as it had been beforehand ! <p> Absolutely fantastic . I first saw it about 18 years ago ( half a life-time ! ) and this time I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed Jon Lee who was really talented ) . The cast got a well deserved standing ovation at the end . <p> I 've seen the show five times ( 4 at Palace Theatre ) and on Saturday ( 24th July 2004 ) went to Queens . I was sat in row C of the stalls and found it to be AMAZING ! ! ! <p> Admittedly , I could not see the projections on the stage floor - e.g. the river/whirlpool - but I could see the characters ' faces and all of the action , better than ever before ( usually sit in Dress Circle ) . <p> I would advise to see the film before the musical ... just to get an understanding of the storyline . Its hard to follow first time round but as Monkey says " you either love it or hate it " ... I LOVE IT ! ! ! ! <p> The scenery is fantastic and the slightly different type of music makes a change without spoiling the quality . Well done I say ! ! ! <p> Happy theatre going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see " Les Mis " having been obsessed with it for years before seeing it , and I was amazed . The show has been rejuvenated ; while the music has remained the same , little touches to the action have changed the meanings of some of the lines , making many scenes much more poignant . I for one think that the move has done the show good - things have had to change , but the changes are definitely for the better . <p> The actors - Joanna Ampil makes a fantastic Fantine , and , though I do n't know which of the young actors it was , the Gavroche at the performance I saw was endearing . The cast all seemed so relaxed in their roles and that helped the story to flow believably from heartache to heartache . <p> We occupied the last two seats of row M in the stalls , and our view was uninhibited - even of the set on each of the boxes . There was plenty of legroom , and , unlike seats closer to the stage , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage ( such as the ' river ' during " Javert 's Soliloquy " ) . The only complaint I have is that the theatre should provide tissues with each programme purchased ! <p> Kyrsty Mewett Bognor <p> I saw my first West End production of ' Les Mis ' last night ( 17th November 2004 ) , and have to say that I came away vaguely disappointed . <p> The music is fine- yes , there are synthesizers used , but except for a couple of points where the music cut off , rather than dying away they did not detract from the music . The singing was good throughout particularly from Tim Godwin , as Jean Valjean ( the understudy ) . He has an amazing voice . However , there did n't seem to be much life in the show ... technically great performances ... but without the feeling . <p> The exception to this being Stephen Tate and Katy Secombe as the Thenardiers , who threw everything they had into the roles . ' Master of the House ' has always been one of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I 'll remember for a long time ! <p> If you 're only going to see one musical this year , I can not recommend this one . Get the CD instead ... There are better shows out there at the moment . If you 've already seen a number of shows though , it 's well worth going ... just make use of the Monkey 's ' Special Offers ' section to avoid disappointment . <p> Nathan <p> My partner and I were actually trying to get tickets for " The Woman In White " , but had no joy , so managed to get tickets for " Les Mis " at very short notice . <p> Overall , I think the show was very good , everyone gave it their all , which was great considering it was a Tuesday night ( 1st February 2005 ) . <p> I agree with the monkey that the story is a tad difficult to follow , it seemed to take ages to get going , so do read the synopsis prior to taking your seats . <p> The revolving stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit giddy by the end ! <p> Character-wise , we loved the Thernardiers , who were hysterical , total Chavs ! ! ! ! <p> The story all comes together in the end and you leave feeling uplifted . <p> We sat in the stalls , row S , seats 24 and 25 , pretty near the back , but had a great view of all the action . This is not a big theatre by any stretch of the imagination , and even right at the back we could see well . There is quite a big overhang , but it does n't seem to matter as there was no action at higher points of the stage anyway . <p> I 've read on the theatremonkey site ( readers ' comments ) that the lack of orchestra and magnitude of synthesizers is a flaw , but it sounded great , and the conductor was dancing round like a madman ! ! ! ... <p> ... though how much of the score required conducting rather than pressing " play " remains a mystery ! <p> Bravo , good night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show on the evening of 16th February 2005 . With it being half-term week I did n't want to run the risk of not being able to get tickets , so opted to pay full price ( 37 ) tickets in row D ( 17/18 ) of the Upper Circle . <p> Slightly disappointed by the view . Even though I could see everything ( despite the best efforts of those in row A to obstruct the view by leaning over the balcony ) it was n't the best angle to watch the show from . <p> The performances were excellent though . Every song sung with passion . As the poster says " every night is a first night " . <p> Despite the 3hr running time , it never dragged . My only disappointment was that it was not longer . I really did not want it to end . <p> This was my first time seeing the show , but it certainly wo n't be my last . <p> Tim Holloway Norfolk <p> I decided to see this show on a bit of a whim ( after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , as was n't sure it would be my " cup-of-tea " . Chose our seats with the help of Theatremonkey ( E 18 and 19 of the Dress Circle ) . <p> The view was perfect and the show totally blew me away - all the main stars were outstanding ( particularly the actors playing Valjean &amp; Javert ) , the story was really interesting , the set was so inventive/evocative , &amp; the music was hugely moving . <p> I blubbed like a fool through most of the 2nd act . " Bring Him Home " completely slayed me . <p> I 've since become a huge fan ( a bit late ! ! ) and have bought the 10th anniversary DVD and the symphonic album , and was desperate to see it live again . <p> Will be back for the matinee on 16th July 2005 , in Dress Circle G 9 and 10 ( again thanks to Theatremonkey 's reccs ) and ca n't wait ....... <p> ....... Just got back from my second trip to Les Mis ( 16th July 2005 matinee ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life ! ! <p> John Owen-Jones was STUNNING as Valjean - that has to be the most moving " Bring Him Home " I 've encountered to date ( either live or recorded ) , and yes , I did cry like an idiot again - as did most of the ladies AND some of the chaps around me ! <p> Special mentions too , to Kerry Ellis - a beautiful Fantine , Barry James and Claire Moore as the Thenardiers ( Barry was particularly good - as he brought out the character 's more menacing side , as well as the obvious comic one ) . <p> Only downsides - Julia Moller ( Cosette ) ' s voice was occasionally weak , and she was swamped in places in the ensemble pieces , plus I 'm afraid Cornell John was not convincing at all as Javert - not enough passion / a very clipped style of singing . <p> However , everyone /everything else was SO good , and there was an almost-total standing ovation at the end . <p> Want to go and see it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was my first venture into the Queens Theatre to see " Les Miserables " and I can safely say that this is one of the best shows in the West End for a long time . <p> I went on the 14th June 2005 and was sitting in the stalls in seat G3 , theatremonkey advises against this seat , though as a student I managed to secure it for the bargain price of 20 ( editor 's note , monkey ratings are based on paying full price , as this reader acknowledges ) . For what I paid it was an excellent seat . Good leg room and an excellent view of the stage . <p> The performance by the actors was worth of first night acclaim , notably Sean Kingsley as Jean Valjean and Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras . Though a point which maybe worth noting is that the cast changes on the 27th June 2005 . Though i am sure that the quality of performance will be maintained . <p> James T <p> We went to see the show ( for the 5th time ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although I was interested to see how the other cast changes worked . The show was fantastic - J O-J was incredible - he almost got a standing ovation at the end of ' Bring him home ' ! Special mention too for Kerry Ellis ( Fantine ) whose range was amazing . <p> The whole cast gave it their all - very refreshing - as I felt the last time I saw it ( towards the end of last year ) the cast were getting a bit bored . A few lines have changed , but nothing that detracts from the story . To an earlier reviewer , Nathan ( see " reviews " page ) - go and see it again - you wo n't be disappointed ! <p> We had seats K11 to 13 in the stalls . Good view of the stage , could n't see the whirlpool clearly , but I 'm not too bothered about that . The legroom was surprisingly good . <p> Ali <p> Sat stalls row E seats 19 and 20 , amazing show , we sat slightly too far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this show and the view would have been more comfortable from further back . However as these tickets were booked at 25 ( expired offer - ed ) each rather than nearly 50 ( thanks theatremonkey ! ) I ca n't complain ! <p> Tamara <p> I went again last night ( 11th July 2005 ) to see " Les Mis " ( my 5th time ! ! ! ) and it just gets better every time ! I love the way that each time you go , the casting completely changes but no matter what they do - it seems to work ! Kerry Ellis absolutely blew me away last night , I was in floods already in the first half and it was downhill from there ! Had to go and get a stiff drink afterwards . John Owen Jones was also incredible , the best Jean Valjean I 've seen in the show . I was concerned at first as he was quite young in comparison to previous actors but he left them in the shadows . <p> Just incredible ... you 'd think after 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm crazy and still wo n't see it for the first time ! - but I think it improves each time and this one was a cracker . Amazing cast , amazing show . Only criticism was for Cosette , in comparison she was very weak and I found her punctuation of words very off putting . Otherwise though , nothing bad to say and as they could see from the standing ovation at the end ... I think everyone else agreed ! <p> Shame about the smaller theatre but it still works ... long may it continue ! ! <p> Emma <p> I saw this show some time back so the cast has probably changed . It was very clever and very professionally done however for me it was too heavy going . You will need to enjoy a bit of opera type music to enjoy this one . It is not everyone 's cup of tea . It would be unfair for me to say I did n't enjoy it because how can one say which is best - a cup of tea or a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't go again but that is because of the opera type singing - I prefer something more light hearted - but for professionalism and getting it across it ca n't be faulted . <p> Ms Christina Brooks <p> ( This review contains no ' spoliers ' ) <p> I saw this production at Queens Theatre , London . <p> pThis play will have you sucked in as soon as the orchestra strike up their instruments at the opening of the show , until they take their final bows at the end ! <p> I sat on the second row ( row B ) in the stalls . The view was fantastic and you really felt like you were in there with all the action . The set and effects of the show are simply fantastic and the whole set and stage literally revolves - with no scene change hindering the performance . One minute we are sat in front of a barricade , the next minute we are in a wedding hall . The lead Jean Valjean was played by my favourite actor - John Owen Jones - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phantom Of The Opera " ) with over 1400 shows . He is the youngest person to play Valjean but by no means the worst ! Javert was also played with immense characterisation which , when the two collided , produced an incredible atmosphere . <p> This production is definately worth seeing and is very good for if you are studying GCSEs or A Levels ( British examinations ) . The only real problem I found was you eventually get cramp from sitting throughout the 1.5 hour halves , but this should not stop anyone ! <p> Best scene : Probably just before the interval - very powerful <p> Worth seeing : YES ! ( row B is worth the money ) <p> Stuart Spendlow <p> I attended the performance last night , ( 4th January 2006 ) ... Have you ever wondered what would happen if the revolving stage breaks down ... well , last night it did , only for the second time apparently . This occurred quite early on in the show . The staff tried valiantly to make a repair , but then the manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did , however , put in on in ' concert ' form ( for those who stayed ) . <p> I must say I was very impressed ! ! All the performers adapted superbly ! I assume they occasionally rehearse this , but it still must be unsettling . It also makes the plot harder to follow for those that have not seen it before , but for us , it was quite a nice change ! Gavroche was played by one of the female cast members , presumably due to children 's working hours ! <p> John Owen-Jones was excellent as usual . The last time I saw the show , at the last cast change in July 2005 , I felt that Cornell John , playing Javert , seemed very uncomfortable , possibly as he was having to sing in a different way to how he was used to . I must say that he has grown in to the role beautifully .... his voice , especially in ' Stars ' , was very smooth and sure - vocal honey ! <p> Nice to see the supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit lost in the scenery ! Special mention for Jenna Boyd , playing various roles - great voice , and some lovely facial expressions ! <p> Seats - stalls K 6 to 9 ... we often seem to get row K - good view of the stage and performers , and any visibility problems were , on this occasion , negated by the concert format ! The theatre have also invited the audience back to see ( hopefully ) a full performance ( on dates to be arranged ) at equivalent rates - quite thoughtful , I feel . <p> Ali <p> ( it was a very unusual performance - so many changes .. glad we did n't leave , unlike quite a few ! ! ) <p> I 'm a complete Les MisTrables addict who has long ago fallen in love with the story , the music , the lyrics and the staging . I ca n't get enough of Les Mis . My wife and I come across the pond a few times a year for a London theater run and we always make it a point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That said , I must admit that since the move from the Palace Theater to Queens , Les Mis has fallen on hard times . The smaller stage creates lots of tight moments when the full ensemble cast is on stage ; some scene transitions are often noisy and distracting ; and I swear that the sound system drops some of the voices - at least from where we sit in stalls . But MOST noticeable has been the heavy reliance upon a synthesized musical score which does not do justice to the breadth and pulse of the music . When we last visit in March 2005 for a Saturday night performance , all of these problems are painfully evident and even the audience response is restrained . We leave feeling unfulfilled and fearful that Les Mis is slowly sinking towards oblivion -- this despite very strong performances by the leads . <p> So imagine our joy and delight during a January 2006 visit to discover that others must also have been hearing and seeing the same things that we observe . The changes are subtle , but by performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to it 's former glory and driving power . Staging has been reworked to reduce the clutter and allow the actors to move a bit more freely on a still tight stage . A few introductory lyrics have been added here and there to create smoother segues between certain scenes , AND they 've revitalized the musical score , bringing back the orchestral feel . The result is a Les Mis that pulsates and embraces the audience with the feel and seething , bubbling emotion that Les Mis is so well known for . <p> The cast has turned over a bit since we 've last seen Les Mis , but the main characters give mostly strong , stirring performances which touch the audience deeply ( Valjean , Fantine , Eponine , and Enjolras are all especially strong while the new Javert is still feeling his way into the part but he should do just fine with time ) . The audience responds with applause and excitement throughout the entire Friday night performance . We leave feeling fulfilled and reassured in knowing that Les Mis is on the mend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hope that lots of folks take advantage <p> Barry and Carol Liimakka USA <p> Went for my return visit on 31st January 2006 - this time in Row G 10 to 13 of the Dress Circle - seats had a good view , obstructed only by the very tall man in front ! I see from a previous comment that one reader feel the sound quality was poor in that area , but we did n't find this the case . There were several empty seats , and some people had been upgraded to the Dress Circle , presumably from the Upper Circle . I am a little concerned that the show may go the way of Cats , Joseph , and many others when the audience numbers start to fall . <p> The show itself - fantastic as usual ( and the revolve worked ! ) Does John Owen Jones ever have a bad day ? Jeff Nicholson was understudying Javert - great performance . You never feel with this show that the understudies are a ' second best ' - they are well worth seeing in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , , , I believe there is a cast change planned for June - hopefully I will be able to get back before them for another Les Mis ' fix ' <p> Ali <p> Last Saturday ( 18th of June 2006 ) my girlfriend and myself went to see " Les Mis " at the Queens Theatre . Unfortunately as it was a last minute ticket buying and being impoverished students I broke with tradition and had to settle for the upper circle seating . The view was n't that bad really , the only bit of action that was missing was the balcony in the Cafe , or at least that 's all I think we missed . The chairs in the Upper Circle could do with a bit of oil as people were squeaking though all of the solos which is very irritating and I 'd wish they 'd install rollercoaster style bars in front of the chairs to stop people leaning forward and spoiling everyone 's view as well as to stop people walking out without a simple excuse me ... <p> After becoming addicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Royal Albert Hall we were n't expecting the singing to be of quite the same quality , however we were pleasantly surprised . The cast was excellent especially with Phill Cavin as Jean Valjean ; even the orchestra was acceptable , with its new electronic players , pulling you in with the first chords . Shaun Escoffery as Enjolras also demonstrated high quality singing , even though his voice was lost occasionally . However I was deeply deeply disappointed with the Javert , Cornell John . <p> His performance was dire , the only time I 've never clapped for a performer , and thanks to him the rest of the cast lost their deserved standing ovation . Looking and listening around the auditorium a lot of people agreed . He did n't seem to appreciate the role and interact with the other characters , singing only it seemed to the audience , singing in the same flat tone no matter what his mood and when it came to the soliloquy I 've never wanted a Javert to die sooner , he displayed very little of his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little stupid but a recording I did of a friend singing " Stars " three years ago was is in my opinion better than the pathetic Cornell did it , even though my friend has had no proper singing training - and I can also reassure you that my friend is a lot better now . You could question that Cornell John was having a ' off night ' ( well afternoon ) but that 's no way for a professional to treat a paying audience . <p> Overall it was enjoyable but I cant wait to go and see it again from a better vantage point and with a different cast , or a different Javert at least , as the rest were excellent . <p> Glad I 've gotten that off my chest and apologies to the complete strangers I 've bored with my rantings . <p> Laurence <p> Having seen this show in 2002 after spending several years waiting to see it , I became a bit of a " Les Miz " addict . Having seen it twice at The Palace , where the toilets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped , even for me at 5ft 8 " I was pleased when I heard it was leaving to go to Queens . My daughter and I took my parents along to Queens , as my dad had loved the musical score for years . We sat in the rear stalls and were very disappointed because we could not see the projections properly , it cut off the top of the barricade and the sound quality did not seem to match the wow factor it had had at the Palace . I wo n't mention the ' sing a long ' Americans we had behind us , who I had to speak to an usher about in the interval ! <p> Determined to give my fave musical another chance , I promised myself tickets in the front stalls . I was delighted when I saw the recent TFL offer ( until September 2006 ) for 25 tickets and booked my daughter and I into seats C4 and 5 of the Stalls on the 23rd August 2006 - matinee . Although they were end of row we still felt like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was going on on stage and the power of the music . <p> In the interval I got talking to a woman who was seated at the rear of the circle and she had brought her son along . She had seen it years ago when it was at the Barbican and then again at the Palace and told me she did n't feel the acoustics and impact was fantastic as it had previously been . <p> Simon Bailey playing Enjolras was great and John Owen-Jones as Jean Valjean blew our minds . <p> To sum up , Les Miz still is one of the most amazing musicals I have ever seen . The cast were fantastic and we were so absorbed in it all I found a tear trickling down my cheek during ' Little Fall of Rain ' and the finale ' death scene ' -as I like to call it ! Les Miz has something in it for everyone . If it is your first time , make sure you get great seats - front stalls are the way to go , no closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme if you are unsure of the storyline , it will help you untangle the events . Let yourself get carried away in a story that will capture your heart and your imagination . Remember the Kleenex too , I was n't the only one shedding a tear-6ft rugby looking guy in front was obviously touched as well . <p> Jessica and Niamh ( 27 and 10 London ) <p> My wife and I having been to the show before , thought we would take two of our children ( 12 and 14 ) to see Les Mis . We had seats K10 to K13 in stalls ( Oyster card promotion ) . Seats were ideal , great view , good leg room . Kids thought it was fantastic , we all ended up in tears , a truly wonderful show , and the seats positions come recommended . <p> P.S. If you treat yourself to an ice cream at the interval , watch out for the stubborn strawberries in the tub , mine did n't  want to come out easily with the stubby spoon , a little extra effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Ill be honest , I could n't tell her for laughing . <p> Andy , Claire and family . <p> " After my recent disappointment with Wicked and the less than ecstatic reception I gave to Daddy Cool I am pleased to report that the performance of Les MisTrables I attended at the Queens Theatre last night ( Tuesday 26 September 2006 ) was about as good as musical theatre ever gets . It was my third viewing ( once at the Palace well into the run , and once at the Queens Theatre soon after it transferred ) and I certainly got a lot more out of it this time . I was gripped from the start ( maybe because I was familiar with the story from the previous viewings ) and it was n't long before I could feel the tears beginning to spring . <p> At the Palace , despite sitting close in the stalls , I found the sound muddy and unpleasant , but last night , in C row of the stalls , the amplification was exemplary , being loud enough to be exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear voices and the orchestra . John Owen-Jones as Valjean was simply sensational , and Jeff Nicholson as Javert , covering for Hans Peter Janssens , was splendid . All the other performers were magnificent , and after a run of almost 21 years , the show is in tip-top condition . Three cheers for Cameron Mackintosh , and of course all the rest of the production team , the writers and composer , and I suppose we had better thank Victor Hugo as well ! " <p> 30th October 2006 ... <p> Had n't seen this since the last cast change - I was very much looking forward to seeing Hans Peter Janssen as Javert . I think there may have been some changes in orchestration , nothing much , but it just sounded a bit different ( could n't say how it was different , not having a clue about music ) ... there also seemed to be some new interaction between cast members in the ensemble pieces . <p> The cast were excellent - John Own Jones was , as always , outstanding . <p> HPJ was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Javert 's relentlessness , which makes his ultimate downfall even more of a contrast . <p> Bayla Whitten was on as Fantine - very very good , although I felt she missed some of the low notes in ' I dreamed a dream ' ... Sabrina Aloueche was perfect as Eponine , looking exactly how I see the character - possibly the best Eponine I have seen so far . Gina Beck as Cosette was exactly how I see a sheltered young lady would act , and she has a lovely voice <p> Strong performance from Jon Lee as Marius - whilst singing ' Empty Chairs .... ' he gave the impression that he was about to burst into tears ! Simon Bailey was great as Enjolras - strong singing and some nice ( new ) interplay with Grantaire . <p> The Thenardiers - well , a bit of a disappointment for me - Tracie Bennett started off a little weakly , but improved , but Chris Vincent was , IMO , a real let-down - he was very ' camp ' ... I have always felt that although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , he should have an underlying air of menace - he came over as menacing as a tulip ! <p> The ensemble are , yet again , more than excellent - in fact , I often watch them rathert than the principles , just to see the way the interact . <p> Seats were D16 and 17 in the Dress Circle - excellent ... and booked through a highlighted special offer 29.00 - thanks ! ! <p> Ali <p> My first impression of The Queen 's was how small it was , must be one of the smallest theatres in the West End to stage a musical . I managed to get a half price ticket for seat 13 row D , first time I have been so near to the stage , and to be honest would n't have wanted to be any further forward . Leg room was very good . <p> The conductor was like a jack-in-the-box , also he was weaving around like a boxer . It must have been very off-putting being in the middle of the rows in front of me . Actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine what it must have been like for those in the front row . To be fair to him , his moving about shows that no matter how many times he has performed , he is still very much into the music and the occasion , though . <p> I was looking forward to seeing John Owen-Jones but an announcement saying the part of Jean Valjean will be played by , but I did n't catch his name . Maybe John Owen-Jones wanted to watch Wales play Australian at rugby ! Anyway the understudy playing Valjean was excellent , wish I knew who he was . ( Jacob Chapman - editor , with thanks to the Queen 's Theatre ! ) . <p> Hans Peter Janssens as Javert was captivating and even managed to make you feel sorry for him in his death scene . I first saw Les Miserables in 1999 but was in the gods , did n't think it was very good , but have since grown to love the music and was able to follow the story very well . Naturally there were the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me who five minutes before the interval got up and disturbed everyone . I bet she wanted to be first to the " ladies ' " , and on several occasions the man she was with was talking to her in an overly loud voice , at one stage I looked behind and went shhhh ! Some people just do n't know how to behave at a theatre . <p> Being close to the stage I was , for the first time , able to see clearly the actors ' faces and could make out a lot of the words as well , also being so near you can smell the gunpowder and really do feel as if you are in the battle . In some songs there were two or three actors singing different words at the same time . There 's probably a technical name for this but in any case it came across very well . I 'm not one who is able to analyse in great detail , but I know what I like and I loved Les MisTrables . It has lots of memorable songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " into the witches hat ! <p> 4th November 2006 , afternoon performance . <p> Saw ' Les Mis ' again on Monday 4th December 2006 . Was in stalls row F seat 18 , off centre so bobbing conductor not really a factor . John Owen Jones was excellent , his rendition of " Bring him Home " was particularly memorable and is one of the few places in the performance where an audience can show their appreciation , and there was a lot . I was n't sure if there would be a full house on a Monday , but the stalls were packed , and a spontaneous standing ovation when John OJ made his bow . <p> This was the first stage musical my husband and I had been too , a joint present from our son , it was fantastic . We have seen the different programmes on the TV , but being in the theatre was so different . The singing , the story all came over so much better live . We are hooked , more live theatre shows as and when we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set dressing for scenes . Excellent View - lack of leg room . I 'm " broad " and width wise was O.K. and seat comfortable , but at 5 ' 11 leg room was cramped as you have the wall in front so ca n't even get your feet under as you might with seats in the stalls . <p> Ice Cream at 3 for a small approx 100ml tub ! ! ! I did without . <p> Jon North Yorkshire <p> Saw ' Les Mis ' last night ( 16 May 2007 ) for the first time since its move from the Palace Theatre . <p> We sat in the middle of Row R of the stalls after buying ' best available ' tickets off Lastminute.com for 29.50 + 1 booking fee . Legroom was ample , view not the best - the dress circle overhang obscured some of the ' higher up ' action , and we felt a bit distant from the stage . That said , good value for what we paid , would have been miffed if the tickets had been full price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the actual performance ; I have very fond memories of the numerous times I saw it at the Palace theatre . John Owen Jones was a solid Valjean , although wavered occasionally with some of the difficult notes . Javert was played by an understudy whose name I did not catch ( he was very tall ) - and again a decent performance , but nothing spectacular . Joanna Ampil &amp; Gina Beck put in good performances as Fantine and Cosette - and I thought Sabrina Aloueche put in the best performance as Eponine that I have seen since Lea Salonga played the role - fabulous voice . Simon Bailey as Enjolras was also one of the better players of the role I have seen - he had a strong voice and did justice to ' Do You Hear The People Sing ' . <p> John Lee is simply not right for the part of Marius - he sung his parts far too abruptly , and did not bring out the emotion expected from ' Empty Chairs ' . The Thenardiers did not draw out the comic aspects as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be because Mr Thenardier was understudied for that performance ) <p> Also the ensemble seem to have gone really downhill since the Palace theatre production - weak singing voices , lack of slickness as a group , and terrible use of the microphone for the leader of the French army - they really need to pull their socks up ! <p> In all it still remains a very enjoyable evening out , and no doubt will continue for many years to come ( the auditorium was full , even on a Wednesday evening ) <p> Saw ' Les Mis ' last weekend ( 7th July 2007 ) , with the new cast and loved it ! ! Have n't seen it for ten years , but its still as marvellous as ever . What a fabulous show , everyone was superb , did n't feel anyone let the side down - go and see it ! ! ! Kathryn , Kidderminster . <p> Got the middle seats in Row R through the TKTS booth for 27.50 + 2.50 booking fee . As others have mentioned , this does suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the entire production when an actor is obscured . You should n't panic when you ca n't see the ' 1815 ' projection which starts the show and is projected so high you ca n't see it ! <p> Whilst quite far back , the fact that Les Mis tends to use the entire stage ( both horizontally and vertically ) means that you can take in the full effect of the scenery even if the singers seen a little way off . No problem with legroom either . <p> Interestingly , when I booked at TKTS I could see on the screen that they had better unsold seats but that these were held back for potential full price sale . Its not the case that TKTS can get you the best seat that remains . <p> Last night ( 9th August 2007 ) I took my girlfriend to see the show for the first time ( I 've now seen it over 10 times ) . Ticketmaster website offered Dress Circle F 5 and 6 but I wanted more central so called them up and got Dress Circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever had in either theatre for ' Les Mis . ' As the website says , the top of the stage is obscured from row H backwards , and so the Upper Circle bordered the stage perfectly at the top . The safety bar mentioned as an obstruction for rows A to F was not a problem as it only encroached onto the front 2 yards of the stage . We were able to see absolutely everything without so much as moving or straining . Legroom was ample - I 'm 6 ' 1 " and my girlfriend is 5 ' 10 " and neither of us were uncomfortable at all . The cast were very good - John Owen-Jones is the best Valjean I 've seen in the West End , and the girl playing Eponine had an amazing voice . Enjolras was average , as were the Thenadiers and Marius 's voice was not strong enough . However , I 'm just nitpicking - it was magnificent ; probably the best performance I 've seen . This cast is better than the last one - I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one was awesome . A good time to go and see it if you were planning to ! <p> Ashley <p> I always have mixed emotions when I see a show for the second time . I 'm torn between the excitement of returning to something I 've loved and then worry that it wont be as good as the time before , or that my previous perception wont allow me to see it with fresh eyes . <p> On Saturday 20th October 2007 , I felt all of the above when I went to see the evening performance of ' Les MisTrables ' at the Queens theatre in Shaftsbury Avenue . It had been some 17 years since I had last seen the show . Walking past the Palace Theatre , currently adorned with banners for ' Spamalot , ' with its impressive entrance on the junction with Charing Cross Road reminded me of the emotion I felt at the time . <p> On arrival at the Queens Theatre we were unlucky enough to have side seats in the Upper Circle . With such a restricted view the show was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was conscious of the fact my husband had never seen the show before and I did n't  want our inability to see half of the performance to spoil this . We were in luck . Half the people on our row did n't  arrive so within ten minutes of the show opening we could see the full stage . <p> ' Les MisTrables ' is one of those shows that can never disappoint its audience . But this time it was n't without fault . Understudies Jennifer Hepburn and Peter Saul took on the Fantine and Valjean roles . They did the characters justice , although Sauls performance of " Bring Him Home " , did not bring me close to tears or even a prickly neck like it usually does . My husband said he felt it lacked emotion too . <p> Two of the actors could not be understood properly . Hans Peter Janssens as as Javert and Melanie LaBarrie as Madame Thenardier sounded muffled and , given the fact that everyone else sounded clear I can not blame our position in the theatre . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some members of the audience around me were complaining they could n't understand what was going on and blamed the fact they could n't make out what Janssens and LeBarrie were saying . <p> Other than that , apart from a few notes off-key from Claire Marie-Hal and the three or four times props could be heard dropping in the darkest parts of the stage , ' Les MisTrables ' was as impressive as I remember it . The red flag during " Do you hear the people sing " , Javerts suicide and the barricade scenes still had the magic that had enthralled me at the Palace . <p> However one actors performance stood out . We werent told which of the actors played the character of Gavroche on that evening but whoever it was got the best round of applause of the evening . He was cocky , clearly spoken , perfectly timed and tuneful . <p> Everyones entitled to an off day so although this time ' Les MisTrables ' did n't  enthral me as much as I had expected , it would n't stop me wanting to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best yet ! <p> Melissa Roberts <p> Saw ' Les Mis ' Friday night , 12th November 2007 . Seats B21 and B22 in the Dress Circle- though did n't pay full price . Was just as previously described on this site . We were just 3 seats in from the end of the row which curves . Not a problem as only a tiny bit of stage front left is obscured . However in row A below they lost bottom half of stage due to the wall in front , and consequently leant forward on the wall which did n't help our view . Luckily my friend had an empty seat in front of her . Determined not to have my night out ruined I asked the guy in front to sit back in his seat and to give him credit he did manage to sit back for most of the show . For this reason I would n't recommend the last four seats at either end of row B and would avoid anything but the middle 16 seats of row A. No point paying top price for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better view from the stalls . Seats comfortable enough given the length of the show and plenty of legroom ( I am 5 ' 8 " ) . <p> As for the show , to my mind it was every bit as good as when I last saw it at the Palace . All the cast were superb but , for me , there were two stand out performances . Cassandra Compton was born to play Eponine - a beautiful , powerful voice and great acting . Highlight of the show was Stephen John Davis understudying Javert . He was amazing - superb singing and dramatic acting which was moving without going over the top . The three hours flew past and we are already planning how soon we can return . <p> Sharnie <p> Last night ( 12th November 2007 ) I took two Italian visitors and one young Turk to see ' Les MisTrables ' , sitting in the Dress Circle in F4 to 7 . The seats were perfect for sight lines and comfort , but alas on this my fourth visit , we all found most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very loud were we were sitting ( louder and shriller than it seemed from the front of the stalls about a year ago ) and it felt as if the entire thing was going like a speeded up movie . <p> I like to see energy and attack from the cast of a musical , but last night the revolving stage was relentlessly spinning , and every performer seemed intent on getting out their words as quickly as possible , with a result that my three non-English speakers were totally at a loss to understand what was going on , and even I was unable to catch many of the words . Of course it remains a magnificent show , and once things settled down a bit and the pace became less hectic we all enjoyed it a lot . A couple of the performances were less good than I have seen them before , and some were brilliant , but overall the whole cast was very strong - if only we could have got more out of the first half-hour or so ! <p> Surely it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakneck speed and at such a high volume : all the women were particularly ear-splitting in the ' Lovely Ladies ' scene , but nobody was without fault in this respect . The audience , particularly those seeing it for the first time , deserves to be able to appreciate exactly who the principal characters are , especially Jean Valjean , Fantine and Javert , and we need to understand and take in their words in the early scenes . <p> Just returned from my VIP ' Les Miz ' experience ( 17th November 2007 ) and want to leave a review for the show . <p> This was the first time I have seen the full show , I had seen the 10th anniversary concert and loved the music . I had so looked forward to the show . I was not disappointed , the whole event was wonderful . Our seats were close to the front ( B15 and 16 ) and offered a wonderful view . I was worried that we would be too close and would end up with sore necks , but no . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly and saw all the action clearly . <p> As for the show ........ The cast seemed fresh and energetic , the leads , Val Jean and Javert were amazing and the supporting cast was magnificent . The stage and scenery were very good and the music was wonderful . I want to go back as soon as possible . <p> The VIP package I had booked just enhanced the whole event , drinking champagne in the interval and carrying the remainder ( in plastic cups ) into the stalls was amazing . It did seem somewhat ironic that we were watching a show about poverty whilst sipping champers ! ! ! we did giggle a bit when returning to our seats ! In fact my sister said " let them eat cake ! " . We behaved during the show though ! ! It was too good to miss ! <p> I last saw the West End production of ' Les Mis ' in Oct 2006 ( for the fourth time ) , and it was , altho ' still great , seeming more than a little tired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March 2007 and thoroughly enjoyed the experience . The production was a little rough / amateurish in places , but the enthusiasm of the cast more than made up , plus the privilege of seeing Lea Salonga ( playing Fantine ) and Jenny Galloway ( the definitive Mme Thenadier IMHO ) . Drew Sarich as Grantaire and Norm Lewis as Javert were also standouts and I could only hope all these actors would be persuaded to come over / back for the West End production . <p> Arrived yesterday ( 12th January 2008 ) for the matinee ( L13 in the stalls - absolutely perfect view , altho ' sound a little muffled / distorted in places because of the overhang from the Royal Circle ) to discover Drew Sarich was playing Jean Valjean . <p> The whole West End production seems to have been given a very welcome shot-in-the-arm . Lots of previously-chopped bits added back in and the atmosphere of the staging beefed up . <p> Drew was magnificent as Jean ValJean - his acting superb , singing amazing . His " Bring Him Home " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! A bravura performance . <p> Understudy Jennifer Hepburn as Fantine was a revelation - the first time " Come to Me " has actually brought a lump to my throat . <p> Cassandra Compton as Eponine was perfect . <p> Chris Vincent as Thenadier and Gary Watson as Marius also excelled , altho ' Chris was let down by Melanie La Barrie as Mme T. She was very weak and seemed to have no enthusiasm for / totally underplayed the role , until the wedding scene . <p> Also VERY disappointed with Hans Peter Janssens as Javert . He swallowed his words most of the time and the whole of the first half of both ' Stars ' and ' Soliloquy ' were lost . A work colleague I was with , who had never seen the show before , had to ask me in the interval ( and again at the end ) what he 'd been going on about ...... <p> These little gripes aside , the refreshed production and the performances of the whole , very strong , ensemble ( special mentions for little Cosette and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , bless ) led to a thrilling / highly emotional afternoon . I was still tearful on the walk back to the tube afterwards . <p> I think it was actually the best overall performance of Miz I have had the pleasure of so far , but , of course , I will be back ... <p> Matinee 23rd February 2008 : <p> Seats R15 and 16 of the stalls offer a pretty good view with good leg room , although sound not great in places because of the extended circle overhang and no speakers under . The very top of the set was chopped off from view in the initial Paris scene but nothing missed after that . <p> The cast were all a little slow to get going this time around and it took a few numbers for the production to really get into gear . <p> Drew Sarich as Valjean was , once again , the stand-out performer , although even he was a little lack-lustre at the start . <p> Joanna Ampil as Fantine was , sadly , not a patch on her understudy Jennifer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still not right , IMHO , as Mme T. Think the problem is that previous actresses have played her as such a huge/almost pantomime-dame type character , and Melanie is trying to put her own , more subdued/sympathetic mark on the character - but to fight against 20-odd years of characterisation is n't working : - ( <p> We had the understudy for Thenadier ( sorry - did n't catch his name ) , and he was n't too bad at all . <p> Hans Peter Janssens was markedly better as Javert , although still swallowed his words in places - but ' Soliloquy , ' particularly , was very moving . <p> Cassandra Compton as Eponine was , once again , a standout , plus HUGE praise this time around for Marius and , particularly , Enroljas . <p> The company , as always , did a great job , and the **33;182;TOOLONG production is continuing to pay dividends . An almost-complete standing ovation by the end . <p> Cathy from Worthing <p> This is an astonishing performance . Our seats were fantastic , although we could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls seats F17 , 18 and 23 . We were very happy about them , although I think we were a bit too close because we could n't see the river in ' ' Valjean 's Soliloquy . ' ' I was very impressed about the leg room , and therefore excited because the monkey had given them a green rating ; seat 23 was great as well , I do n't see why the monkey gave it a red rating . <p> Now , moving into the performance , we watched the 10th Anniversary DVD and it was great , therefore we had high expectations . We thought they needed a stronger voice , the rest was great . The theatre had a great combination on modern and gothic design which made it unique . So if you want my advice : do n't watch the DVD . <p> Cristopher H. <p> I took my 9 year old daughter to see ' Les MisTrables ' on Thursday 24th April 2008 . <p> Regret to say we were quite disappointed . I thought that the lead Jean Valjean ( do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice lacked power , maybe he was having a bad day . Javert was brilliant , as were many of the other members of the cast . I think the lead should have the most powerful voice , and sadly , this was not the case . <p> I had seen the show 10 years ago , when Stig Rossen played as Jean Valjean , and for me , that performance set the benchmark against which I compare all other musicals . <p> We sat in the Dress Circle , seats E7 and E8 , they were fine . <p> I am a big fan of ' Les Miz . ' I went to the show last Wednesday matinee ( 7th May 2008 ) . It was my fifth time I have seen the show - in Sydney ( 2 times ) , Singapore and London ( Palace theatre ) . This time is in the Queens theatre . <p> The show still can move me , and it gets better , even than last time I saw in 2003 at the Palace . <p> Overall the cast are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the show more energetic . Lot of changes in setting , song cutting / add some swing on the stage are for the good . Really love and still enjoy Les Miz . <p> Phongpan P. Visitor from Thailand <p> On leaving the Queen 's Theatre last night ( 30th July 2008 ) , I wondered when it became the case that an inability to sing , act , or convey any sense of emotion resulted in you getting the lead in a West End musical . Because that 's exactly how Drew Sarich 's Jean Valjean came across - clearly a student of the ' when you ca n't sing , shout ' school of acting . Joining him was fellow shout-a-lot student Allyson Brown , whose Fantine was wooden as a board , with a singing voice flatter than Suffolk . <p> The majority of the other leads were mediocre at best - Jimmy Johnston and Jackie Marks as the Thenardiers , Jon Robyns at Marius , Leanne Dobinson as Cosette , and Nancy Sullivan as Eponine . Earl Carpenter 's Javert was OK , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star performance of the evening for me was David Thaxton 's Enjolras , whose rendition of ' Red and Black ' and ' Do you hear the people sing ' had the goosebumps out in force . <p> But that aside , the whole production lacked any sense of passion , emotion or talent - the things that made me a die-hard ' Les Mis ' fan in the past . I 've seen the show around 20 times now , but until Sir Cameron sorts his casting out , I wo n't be going back in a hurry . <p> On seats - we sat in E1 to E3 of the dress circle , having purchased ' Best available ' tickets from Lastminute.com , at 35 + 1 booking fee per ticket . Whilst this was reasonable value , I would n't buy these seats at full price . E1 in particular had a slightly restricted view , and you could n't catch some of the action going on in the far right of the stage . <p> I saw ' Les Mis ' in London on the 16th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say I was horrified by his performance . He stuck out like a sore thumb and brought the quality of the whole performance down a great deal . This was due to one reason - the way he sang . I have read some reviews already and they have been saying how brilliant he was . Yes , the tone he produced was at times magnificent , but the way he sang his words made him stick out . While the entire cast where singing with English accents , on he would march and let rip - destroying the moment by singing with his awful American twang . <p> However , in saying this I must commend the rest of the cast . Javert was spectacular and his " Stars " was one of the best songs of the night . " Baby Maria " Leanne as Cossette was a joy to watch and , although her tuning slipped up in a few places , this was quickly rectified . <p> I would like to know if anyone else has seen Drew Sarich and thought the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Eoin Belfast <p> I went to see ' Les MisTrables ' on the 16th August 2008 . I was n't sure what to expect , having read the detailed overview of the story online , I thought I 'd get thoroughly confused . And having not enjoyed plays set in the past , I thought I would be bored . Well guess what ? I was n't confused at all , but I was bored ...... for the first ten minutes , but after that I loved it and enjoyed every minute . It 's a slow starter , but as soon as you get to the song ' Lovely Ladies ' it starts to get much more West End standard entertainment . I now see why this show has lasted so long , it really is a great keeper . I hope it has many more years . <p> It 's lovely to see Jon Robyns as Marius ! Seeing as he 's just come from the comedy ' Avenue Q ' to something serious like this it shows he really is very talented . The good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upper circle , we did n't feel detached from the action because it feels like you are still very close and you can see every facial expression without binoculars . It 's a heart warming piece and I love the way they skip through time gaps very subtly . The set is very well done and I did n't really know what to say . I just love it ! It 's better than ' Phantom of the Opera ' that 's all I 'm going to say ! <p> Sat in the Upper Circle in Row J seats 7 and 8 . Perfect view , perfect price , very comfortable ( I did n't have to fidget once ) . However the arm rests are quite small and as both people on either side of me used them , my arms had to hang and I got pins and needles in them ! Maybe it 's just me , but just in case you 're prone to pins and needles , it 's something to look out for . <p> 3rd January 2009 , 2.30pm performance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MisTrables ' as that is covered many times over from numerous other sources . My review will concentrate on the actual visit to the theatre , the cast , the cost and the value . <p> I visited the Queens Theatre on Saturday 3rd January 2009 for the 14.30 Matinee performance of ' Les MisTrables . ' I purchased the tickets at 10pm the night before directly from the theatre website ( Delfont Mackintosh ) . I specified that I wanted to sit in the Dress Circle and used the seating guide on this website to keep refreshing until some good review seats came up . <p> I managed to get seats G20 and G21 in the Dress Circle priced at 56.50 a good value price , especially consider just how last minute these tickets were purchased . These seats are in the good zone as per the seating plan on this website and I would agree with that analysis . We could see the entire stage and all the associated special effects . Picking up the tickets was fast and simple from the box office alongside the theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priced at 5.00 excellent value for a larger than A4 thick bound , high quality brochure featuring pictures from the show . Its worth noting that the alternative was a programme priced at 3.50 but this did not contain as many photographs and was more for the cast listing &amp; advertising . I also visited the bar beforehand a standard size box of Malteasers cost 2.50 and a ( very ) small Coke cost 1 ( I 'd estimate it was about 150ml half a normal can of coke ) . <p> As you can see , prices are reasonable for a West End theatre . <p> The performance itself was very well received ( anticipate about 5 minutes of applause for those whose hands ache after 1 minute ) , although I did find that some of the cast used the premise " If you cant sing , shout " , as others have mentioned . The front of house theatre staff were very friendly and approachable . Toilets on each level were very clean and tidy and well maintained . <p> I think the most I would pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing yourself out of a deal also , its important to check the seats you 're allocated ( before you buy them ) as some parts of the auditorium did have restricted views . <p> Brian S , Northampton <p> 26th February 2009 , 19:30 performance . <p> Brilliant show ! My eighth visit to to the life of Valjean , and I love every visit as if it were my first . Cameron Mackintosh is a genius : ) <p> We got ' best available top price seats ' from lastminute.com and I nearly fell over when I received them and discovered I was the centre of row A to the left of the gap where the Conductor is : ) <p> Although you did have to look upwards a bit , having sat all around the theatre the front row was astounding . The only bad thing I could say about it was the amount of spit Javert sprayed all around the stage as he sung - it was at times a little off-putting . The cast are amazing at the moment , not the best I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mis ' never fails to blow me away : ) Loved it . <p> Louise Robinson , Lancaster <p> I went to see ' Les MisTrables ' for the first time on Thursday 23rd April 2009 ( 19.30 show ) and have to say it lives up to the hype . While a bit slow to get going ( as others have mentioned ) , I suppose the scene setting with Jean Valjean , his fellow prisoners and the Cardinal , etc. is essential to the plot and theme - but the action really gets going when the story moves to Jean Valjean 's factory and thereafter . <p> As this was my first visit to ' Les Miz , ' I ca n't compare to previous casts or shows , but it certainly did not disappoint . If I was to give a brief review of the main performers , David Shannon ( Jean Valjean ) and Earl Carpenter ( Javert ) were absolutely outstanding . Jon Robyns as Marius was good although I would say sounded a little " nasal " at times - I am by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person 's opinion . <p> I was slightly disappointed by Allyson Brown 's rendition of ' I Dreamed a Dream ' as Fantine - I do n't know whether this was a result of the recent Susan Boyle/Britain 's Got Talent effect , but I would say it was a little over-cooked - concentrating a bit too much on the dramatics rather than holding the tune . Her performance elsewhere was excellent elsewhere though . I am not suggesting at all that Susan Boyle is by any means comparable with the calibre of performer on the London stage , but I thought maybe Allyson Brown might be overly aware that the audience were probably awaiting that particular song with anticipation and made too much of it . <p> Nancy Sullivan was excellent as Eponine and Leanne Dobinson was a treat as Cosette - I understand from her biography in the programme that she was one of the unsuccessful Marias in BBC1 's ' How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria ? ' and , while I was not a regular viewer of that programme , I was very pleasantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally , Jimmy Johnston and Jackie Marks were excellent as the ThTnardiers - Jackie Marks particularly standing out for me as an amazing voice and fantastic comic turn . <p> Regarding seating , I paid full price for P7 in the Stalls and was a bit disappointed . The overhang of the Dress Circle did not detract at all , but unfortunately I had my view pretty severely blocked on the right hand side of the stage by the gentleman in front . He did n't appear to be a giant and by no means was sitting particularly bolt upright , but his head pretty much blocked the bottom right hand quarter of the stage - particularly pertinent in the Fantine death scene . I 'm not particularly short at 5ft 6ins , and so can only conclude that the staggering of the seats is a bit off , as I 've never really had this problem in other theatres before . I would certainly choose my seats more carefully next time , and there will be a next time as all in all I adored the show ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th and 11th June 2009 , and the fact that I saw it two days in a row ( and am thinking about seeing it a third time very soon ) should already tell you that it 's worth seeing ... <p> On the first night I sat in the Stalls , G21 , which is probably the best area to watch it . If you want to forget you 're sitting in a theatre , these seats are definitely worth the price . On the second night , I purchased my ticket only four hours before the show started and chose to sit in A35 , Dress Circle for 20 , and let me just tell you that the seat is perfectly fine , I could even see more than the ones to my right on seats A29 to 34 . Yes , you miss the first ten seconds of two entrances , but that really is all - and you still feel part of the show ( maybe even more than on the more expensive seats on Dress Circle and definitely more than everyone on the Upper Circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please be aware that I 've been a Les Mis fan for ten years now , so my opinion might be slightly biased because of my experience with other productions . <p> The wonderful thing about this show is that you actually get the impression that everybody involved is trying extra hard and giving more than usually just for you . After seeing the show on two consecutive evenings , you can really see the beauty of that and appreciate their work a lot more - the jokes , the tense and emotional moments are never rushed , it really does still feel like a first night . <p> That being said - do n't expect any kind of breaks to " come up for air " ... there are no spoken parts , everything is part of the songs , of the music ( which you do n't really notice at first ) , and do n't expect to applaud after every song like you do in most other musicals ... I remember that there were only four times the audiences found the time to applaud during first act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there was simply no moment where a disruption would not have destroyed the atmosphere . <p> As for the actors , there are highs and lows , but you probably wo n't notice them if this is your first time - and even if you do , it does n't affect the overall experience at all . I had the opportunity to see both the regular Jean Valjean , David Shannon , and the understudy , Jonathan Williams , and I loved both performances - maybe Williams even a bit more , his Valjean is more peaceful , calmer , whereas Shannon underlines the struggle the protagonist is going through in the first third a lot more . You wo n't be disappointed by any , and vocally they were truly perfect . " Bring him home " was especially wonderful - up to seeing Williams on stage I had never quite gotten the beauty of that song , but his performance was truly eye-opening . Great acting by both , too , the transformation from the strong , youthful man of 45 years in the beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simply outstanding and therefore rightly awarded with spontaneous applause ( at the transition from " Red and Black " to " Do You Hear The People Sing " ) : David Thaxton as Enjolras , a role that is never quite given the recognition it deserves . Thankfully , after years and years , the West End finally has found an actor who can handle this very demanding part vocally and acting-wise ( giving it more depth than most other performers do ) , who is memorable and believable as the noble , charismatic and strict revolutionary student leader . He basically " outsings " the unfortunately rather weak Jon Robyns as Marius and seems to be fully taken up with his role . <p> Another surprise is Nancy Sullivan as Eponine - bratty and tragic with an extraordinary voice and a very well performed death scene . <p> I really enjoyed Earl Carpenter on the first night , he was cold , calculating , severe and controlled , but on the second night his voice could not quite carry the tunes , he was a bit weak which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong character . Leanne Dobinson as Cosette was fine , a bit to hasty with some of her lines but her voice was wonderful . <p> Allyson Brown as Fantine delivers a very raw performance . It works if you have read Hugo 's novel and know the " book " Fantine , but there were some cringe-worthy moments in " I Dreamed A Dream " while Fantine 's death was , overall , perfect . <p> The Thenardiers , as played by Jimmy Johnston and Jackie Marks were great , just the right amount of cunning , hilarious and evil , and the good thing is that even at the second viewing , the humorous elements did n't seem to be hackneyed , another indicator of the show 's and actors ' quality . <p> The rest of the ensemble is very strong , their performances are great and they give the many choral scenes just the right impact . <p> The orchestra is alright , for my taste the pace is a bit too quick , but you wo n't notice it if you 're not familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty fast . The stage design is absolutely breathtaking , very simple yet effective , you really get the impression of early 19th century France . <p> I have talked to quite a lot of " newcomers " and they were all in awe , blown away by the sheer intensity of the show . Needless to say I 'm in love with the show - if you 're going to see one show in the West End , then go and see Les Mis ! <p> After enjoying the two performances on the 10th and 11th of June 2009 , I managed to get one more ticket for the evening performance on Saturday , 13th June 2009 ( which was completely sold out ) , seat H25 ( good view , but as the monkey 's diagram rightly indicates , not one of the best seats for that price . I was just lucky to get a ticket at all ) . <p> Before the show started , it was announced that Mark Dugdale , understudy for Enjolras , would perform instead of David Thaxton . Needless to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have gathered from the first part of the review , Thaxton 's Enjolras is clearly one of the highlights of the show . <p> So first things first - Mark Dugdale , who normally performs as Courfeyrac , did a good job with this vocally and physically quite challenging role , and still ... having seen Thaxton twice made me really miss the power and charisma he brings to the stage . Then again , the fact that I found myself missing David Thaxton is in no way a criticism of Dugdale , who was still one of the strongest singers on stage that night , but just another testament to Thaxton 's outstanding performance on the other nights - he elevates the material he is given . <p> Of course , the Saturday evening performance is the most exhausting for the cast , because they have the matinee on the same day and there are only two hours between the end of one show and the beginning of the next . Some voices - Earl Carpenter 's , Jon Robyns 's ( who is great as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empty chairs at empty tables " ) in particular - seemed a bit strained , but on the other hand I enjoyed Allison Brown 's performance much more that night than on the 10th or 11th . <p> Now that I 've seen David Shannon again I can say pretty safely that I liked Jonathan Williams 's ( understudy ) performance as Valjean a lot more , but Shannon is still doing a great job , especially as the old man in the Finale . Nothing new about Leanne Dobinson or Jimmy Johnston and Jackie Marks , but once again I just loved Nancy Sullivan 's Eponine , easily the strongest of the actors that night . She manages to create this tragic character without making her pathetic , and " On my own " was simply heartbreaking ( best solo of the night ) . <p> The ensemble was great as always , even after three performances in four days , the choir still manages to send shivers down my spine , also thanks to the stage direction . " At the end of the day " , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing " , " One day more " and the final " Will you join in our crusade " are still as effective and haunting as they were when I first heard them . <p> So , overall , the weakest performance of the three , but still better than any other show I 've ever seen . And maybe it 's just me nit-picking - the audience was enthusiastic , immediate standing ovation at the last notes . <p> And therefore I still stand by my first advice : Go and see the show . Now . <p> I went to see ' Les MisTrables ' on the 24th July 2009 . I had booked my seats through lastminute.com for 15 each , so I had no idea where I was sitting until I went to collect my tickets . I assumed , because of the low pricing , I could expect a seat up in the rafters - but this was not to be the case . On collection from the box office I discovered we had seats A2 and A3 in the Dress Circle . These seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be so , based on the view that you get . You can not see much of the stage on the far side unless you lean over the bar which is what my friend and I did , along with the other people in our part of the row . The seats were quite comfortable , and for me personally were worth the 15 I paid for them ( however , I am easily pleased lol ) . <p> I had a mostly new cast that has just started in the show a month before . David Shannon as Valjean was good at portraying a man very hard done to , and who was desperate for redemption . Earl Carpenter was equally as good as Javert , the policeman with strong resolution to capture Valjean and to put him away . I was impressed with the two of them and they are a good match for each other vocally . <p> Nancy Sullivan is great as a very bratty Eponine and she does well as the poor girl who is so blinded by love for Marius she would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tear to my friend 's eye . Alistair Brammer is the new Marius and vocally he is perfect . However his acting and his chemistry with Eponine could use a lot more work . ' A Little Fall Of Rain ' looked very uncomfortable and he looked awkward when trying to hold Eponine close to him . He was however very good with the new Cosette , played by Katy Hall . <p> This girl is a sensation as Cosette . Having seen her once in ' Phantom of the Opera ' when she was an understudy , it 's hard to believe such a powerful voice could come out of such a young and gifted young lady . I actually liked her interpretation as Cosette which is a first , as the last time I saw it I found the character very annoying , whiny and I wanted to beat her over the head with a sledge hammer lol . But not this time , I was actually wishing there was more to see of Cosette . <p> Martin Ball and Lorraine Bruce were the new Thenardiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Thenardier as wicked but funny . Martin Ball however just did not convince me as Thenardier at all , I missed the comedy from his lines and he was n't even very scary or menacing , just a flop really . David Thaxton is a very convincing Enjolras and I liked his passion especially in ' Do You Hear the People Sing ' . <p> Rebecca Searle as Fantine is good singing her songs but not the best I have seen . She puts a lot more emotion into them rather than singing so in ' I Dreamed a Dream ' half the time it was quite beautiful , the rest of the time it sounded like a demented , desperate banshee in pain . Just my opinion of course , but I do prefer Jo Ampil as Fantine and she is literally just 10 paces away from ' Les Miz ' in ' Avenue Q ' ( at the Gielgud theatre next door ) lol . The ensemble work really hard as well to ensure the show is absolutely perfect and they fully deserved the standing ovation they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see again and I know I will be making a return visit soon . <p> Kirsty <p> I ca n't add anything about the afternoon show on 2nd December 2009 , except that it was superb as always . Row L stalls give the perfect view and plenty of leg room . <p> If I was asked for my ' desert Island discs ' my absolute first choice from any of the Musicals I have been to , it would have to be ' God on High ' and yesterdays show did not disappoint . It still sends shivers down my spine every time I hear it . <p> It was the third time I have taken a group there making five coach loads altogether and no doubt given 2 or 3 years years more we will go again , and again ! <p> January 2010 , Stalls L25 . Got this seat on a last minute student standby . Cost 27.50 . Was a very good seat . I thought at first I might have had some problems because it was the furthest seat to the side but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show was on top form was only my second time seeing it and really loved this cast . I think if I 'd been paying full price ( which will never happen : P ) I would want to maybe be a bit more central and maybe a little bit closer . <p> Due to several scheduling conflicts and people not being able to go I have seen ' Les MisTrables ' twice recently ( February 2010 ) . The first time we sat in the upper circle in Row B18 and 19 . The seats cost quite a lot of money for their position and the barrier in front completely cuts off the downstage right corner of the stage where an awful lot of the action happens . The barrier also makes the people in row AA lean forward which causes a domino effect for everyone behind . <p> Apparently they 're not classed as restricted view seats because the producer feels they give a good clear view of the stage , which is not true at all . My view was further hampered by a very large man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage and spent all of the time leaning forward as the people in front of him were doing the same . <p> The second time our seats were in the dress circle Row D24 and 25 . I was rather worried about these seats , as they were on the same side as the previous ones and I did not want to miss parts of the show again but they proved to be brilliant ! There was no one sitting to our left which made everything a bit more roomy and the view itself was fantastic . The dress circle is always my place of choice to sit and we had got the tickets through an offer at Time Out so they were great value for money . I even had a very tall man sitting in front of me and I could still see everything . <p> We could see everything perfectly , which is a bonus for me as I am terribly short sighted but I felt very close to the action . So all in all they were very good seats . <p> I think the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels more intimate than it did at the Palace . <p> Felicity . <p> Just wanted to write and say how bloody wonderful I thought ' Les Mis ' was on Saturday ( 20th March 2010 ) and to recommend the dress circle E20 and E21 as full price seats . We had a fantastic view and loads of legroom . Amazing . <p> Natalie x <p> Tuesday 25th May 2010 : We had seats D6 and D7 in the Dress Circle , which are marked as good ones on the theatremonkey map , and I can see why ; stage view was great and I did n't miss anything . The show was very full . <p> Now , I had very high expectations for this show having read all the reviews , and frankly it surpassed all my expectations . The songs , dancing and set are fantastic . This show has plot depth but is not complicated as the theatremonkey says ; I would find it hard to believe someone loses the plot with this one . Just absolutely great and I will definitely by returning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday 28th May 2010 : Just wanted to recommend seats D13 and D14 of the Stalls at the Queens Theatre . I got the seats for 40 but would have paid full price for seats of this quality . The seats are central to the stage and as a result you do n't miss any of the action . <p> The only thing I did n't like with these seats was that you were stuck in the middle of the row so it was a problem getting out of the row to get to the bar or the toilets in the interval , without having to ask at least half of the row to move out of their seats first . Lots of legroom in these seats ! <p> I went to a Wednesday matinee of ' Les Mis ' a couple of weeks ago ( May 2010 ) . I booked tickets through Ticketmaster . There was a half price offer , so I got 32.50 tickets for 18 ( including booking fee ) . I got seats G14 to 19 in the upper circle , but when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls N 17 to 22 ( my old favourite , the ' upper circle trick ' - and the main reason why I booked Wednesday afternoon tickets ! ) . I thought these seats were really good , I can see from the plan that theatremonkey rates them red , but I disagree and think they should be white at worst . You do n't miss anything because of the circle overhang as it lines up with the top of the stage - it certainly does not cut off the top of the set . These seats feel close to the stage but is far enough away to appreciate the whole of the sets . A few rows back I imaging you would miss some stuff on the top of the barricade though . Leg room was fine . <p> I loved the show , I 've seen it once before and enjoyed it just as much this time . It has a lot of really great songs , some of my favourites from any musical ( and just a couple of annoying ones , I had ' Castle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while afterwards ) . I think " One Day More " is worth the ticket price alone ; I love it on the soundtrack , but on stage it is incredible . <p> The actors were good , although Marius seemed a bit of a wimp - I did n't really believe he would ever do any fighting ; and I 've always thought Cosette was a bit of a loser , I much prefer Eponine . <p> I went to see ' Les Miz ' on Wednesday 25th August 2010 matinee . And I have to say that , for a 25th Anniversary cast , Cameron Mackintosh probably has one of the strongest ensembles he 's ever had . I will come to the principals shortly . <p> I had BB8 in the stalls . Like a previous viewer , I am very short at 5ft 2 . Yes , there is n't a lot of legroom - but it did nothing to hamper my concentration and enjoyment of the show . I would recommend this seat or any on Row BB again , and in fact have booked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeny tiny little gripe ( which actually is n't worth mentioning ) is that on the front of the stage there are small wooden blocks that sometimes stopped me from seeing any actors faces when they hit the deck , ha ha ! <p> Now to the actual show . The set is very impressive and never fails to amaze me with the revolve and the barricades . I have seen the tour version as well as the London version and , although I do like both just as much , in terms of staging London wins hands down . <p> Like I said , the ensemble is the strongest I 've ever seen for any show this year ( bar the new ensemble for Wicked ) . They put so much effort into their characters , no matter how small the role . Stand-outs for me were Chloe Hart as the Factory Girl and Jay Bryce as Lesgles . I could n't keep my eyes off these two in the big numbers . <p> I had an understudy for Valjean , Jonathan Williams . At first I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the ' Soliloquy . ' He puts so much passion and emotion in to his acting and singing , and his chemistry with Norm Lewis is fantastic . <p> Speaking of Norm Lewis , what a treat ! he is going to be fab in the concert . Sometimes I found him a little wooden , like he was just singing the songs rather than acting in the show , but his ' Stars ' was very impressive and he did look very intimidating over Jonathan . <p> Lucie Jones as Cosette is a little too ' pop ' for my liking , and although adequate , is not the strongest I 've seen in the role . Sam Barks as Eponine can also hit the notes in her numbers when needed - but I found her to be a little bland at times , I just did n't feel her unrequited love for Marius . I think she could get better as her run progresses and she develops more into the role . Alistair Brammer is very good as Marius , I liked him a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He acts they shy young lad very well , and it got a few ' ahhhs ' from the women sitting behind me . <p> Both Martin Ball and Lorraine Bruce are a very strong Thenardier couple and have great comedic timing , they work so well together . Rebecca Seale as Fantine also impresses , and her version of ' I Dreamed A Dream ' certainly won over some people still under the ' Susan Boyle ' effect . <p> All in all it was a fantastic show . I will be returning later in the year , and hope I enjoy it as much then as I did on Wednesday . Long Live ' Les Miz ! ! ! ' <p> Kirsty <p> What a show . This is a classic that lives up to it 's hype . I have waited years to see the show - I do n't know why I waited so long , I enjoyed every second ! <p> Take a bleak grey and black stage , add great classic songs and a splash of colour , and you have a hit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes a good set designer to turn shades of black and grey into a set that is interesting , and the multi function of the gantry and barricade was excellent . <p> The singing was superb , and I found myself caught up and humming along , laughing and crying in equal measure ( not something I 'm prone to , but I got caught up in a couple of moments at the end and yes , my eyes were wet ) ... <p> It was a full house and the seats ( dress circle row L seats 7 and 8 ) , were not a bad view but not great . I could n't see the first line of the words on the back drop , and when people stood on the top of the gantry I could only see legs . Even Gavroche , the boy , had his head missing . <p> Would I see it again ? Absolutely 100% yes - but only if I had better seats . It would be worth waiting to get the seats of your choice , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mrs J Hockley Romford <p> Many years after seeing ' Les Mis ' I finally got to go back and see it again in December 2010 . <p> I have to say that I was disappointed with the cast performances . Fantine , Marius , Cosette and a few others were poor , unable to hit the notes and project their voice . Javert is an interesting choice , and I 'm all for more diversity in the theatre , and he does have a crisp clear voice . Jean Valjean was played by the understudy , who took a while to warm up , and was OK but not great . <p> I think that the music and songs carry the show and , as someone who is a big fan , you can still enjoy it . Perhaps because I know the music and songs so well I was more critical whereas if it was my first time perhaps I would be raving . <p> We managed to get seats in row M of the stalls , 7 to 9 , only as seats were being re-released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I enjoyed being able to see faces and was happy with the seats . I think anywhere in the stalls would be OK as there are not any beams to obstruct your view . <p> Nadia <p> 13th January 2011 . What a show . Having seen the show a couple of times before and not completely understanding it , I am slowly coming to terms with the storyline . This cast are amazing and the big numbers really have stuck in my head from seeing it . There are so many songs that are done really well . Lucy Jones was off the night I went . ' One Day More ' and Norm Lewis singing ' Stars ' where probably my highlights , although I am a fan of Samantha Barks . <p> I was sitting in Stalls seat K13 which was a brilliant seat and offered a clear view of the action , you can see all the facial expressions of the actors . This seat is comfy and leg room was very good ! My one gripe and its a small one is because this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was moving all over the place ! Quite distracting ! However for the access rate of 20 it was a brilliant show and an excellent seat . <p> At the interval I looked to see what the 15 seats where like and I definitely think for me for this show there is no comparison - pay the extra 5 to get a top price seat ! <p> Having seen ' Les MisTrables ' many times , it with some trepidation that I accepted tickets marked as " red " on Monkey ! Theatremonkey has become my Bible for bagging myself super seats ... and has never let me down ! This time however , Stalls seats K24 and K25 are marked as red , but in my view ( no pun intended ! ) the seats were excellent ! ! I have sat in most areas in the stalls and would happily sit in these again ! The view was unrestricted if VERY slightly side on ( seeing as these seats are the very end of the row not as side on as you would expect due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in front of us and still could see perfectly and there was adequate legroom . <p> Samantha Barks is an outstanding performer , and I am so glad that I got to see Killian Donnelly again in the role of Enjolres before his departure in June 2011 . <p> Now ....... to book again to see Alfie Boe and Matt Lucas ... that is the question <p> Sarah Louise <p> Went to the Saturday Matinee of ' Les Mis ' on 30th July 2011 with my wife and eldest daughter ( 11 ) . Paid full price for seats 14,15 and 16 in row G of the Dress Circle . Great seats , plenty of legroom and a central , uninterrupted view of the action . Would n't have wanted to be any further back , though , as the overhanging upper circle cuts off the top of the stage after row H. Daughter said she could n't see the performers ' legs from her seat - but not too much of a problem as not a single one of them sang through their legs . <p> The show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely chosen by God to sing this part and Matt Lucas ( Thenardier ) was superb . The rest of the cast were faultless . I saw this a few times at the Palace over the years and I 've also seen touring productions and two school productions but I 've never seen it as good as this . My daughter pronounced it ' AWESOME ' which is high praise indeed from a monosyllabic pre-teen ! <p> One moan ( there usually is ) , the toilet facilities at this theatre are abysmal . The queue for the ' ladies ' in the dress circle was ludicrously long . My wife and daughter joined it at 2 o'clock and got to their seats at 2.25 . I gave up queuing for the gents after about 20 minutes , but did manage to get in three hours later after the show ! <p> I was at the Wednesday evening performance on 24th August 2011 . Sadly , Alfie Boe was not performing due to illness , but the alternate Jean Valjean , Jonathan Williams , was excellent . Obviously the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing , but by the end of the evening , Jonathan had won us all over and he received cheers and a standing ovation at the end . <p> Matt Lucas gave his own unique interpretation of Thenardier ! He was very funny , often improvising , and he can even sing ! There were no other understudies that evening and the whole of the new cast gave a superb show . It seemed like a first night , so enthusiastic was the cast ! <p> Our seats B22 and 23 in the Dress Circle were excellent . We had a clear view of the stage as the people in front of us in row A did n't  need to lean forward ( or were just being courteous ! ) and leg room was pretty good too for a Circle seat . You perhaps miss a fraction of the action on the extreme left hand side of the stage but it was certainly nothing to worry about . <p> September 2011 . I have finally been to see ' Les Mis . ' It only took me 26 years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We sat in V22 and 23 , right at the very back of the stalls . A better view than I expected ; you cant see the top of the stage , but apart from the stuff on the barricade you do n't  miss too much , and you are not having to keep moving to let people in and out . I am a dedicated box user , and this private little row was alright by me . <p> Now I have to say that I am not a fan of the serious type of musical , I like my musical entertainment to be quite light hearted , and I cant abide this singing the entire score malarkey . So having got that out of the way . <p> Gosh ! ! Isnt it good . <p> I thoroughly enjoyed every minute , it was much better than I expected . The story is gripping and full of powerful emotion . I understand what all the fuss is about , and I am sorry that I have waited so long . I feel that I am extremely privileged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost as if the part was created for him , he was just perfect . The rest of the cast left nothing at all to be desired , note perfect all the way through . Matt Lucas was a bit of a surprise too . I am a fan , but did not expect him to be quite so good , the part is ideal for him , but you do n't  expect the class clown to fit so well into a production like this . <p> I stand corrected , I was wrong , sometimes the hype is correct . <p> I have seen ' Les MisTrables ' many times and can never wait to go again ! Alfie Boe is vocally faultless as Jean Valjean and Hadley Fraser as Javert just gets better and better . One surprise for me this time was during a couple of matinee performances when the show 's director , Chris Key , played the role of Jean Valjean ( due to Jonathon Williams being unwell ) - Chris was truly superb ! Whilst not so strong vocally on the high notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and he does have a beautiful melodic voice . I loved his rendition of " Bring Him Home " . <p> Craig Mather and Lisa Anne-Wood are perfect as Marius and Cosette , both giving very strong performances . I also saw Fra Fee in the role of Marius . He has a good voice , but I felt Craig and Lisa-Anne emitted more chemistry between them and make a beautiful couple , exactly as Marius and Cosette are meant to be . Enjolras is one of my favourite characters - the song " Red and Black " never failing to bring shivers , along with all the scenes at the barricade - and the gorgeous Liam Tamne excels in the role with his strong acting and wonderful voice . I enjoyed seeing Matt Lucas as ThTnardier back in August but this time it was Cameron Blakely in the role . Cameron was flawless and gave one of the best portrayals of the rogue that I have ever seen . Along with the wonderful Katy Secombe as Madame ThTnardier , the couple never failed to raise laughs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Eponine ) and Caroline Sheen ( Fantine ) also did a pretty fine job and a special mention has to go to Adam Linstead who plays Grantier to absolute perfection , ( Adam also appears as the Bishop of Digne ) . In fact , all cast members give strong performances , the orchestra is constantly outstanding , the powerful score fills you with endless emotion and the entire show has never once disappointed me . <p> Sitting on row B of the stalls at a couple of performances was a thrill too - I could see all the facial expressions and felt I was really a part of the action ! I hope to be able to see the wonderful Ramin Karimloo as Jean Valjean - a part in all honesty that I would never have imagined him doing . Good luck for the future to Ramin and to all the cast and crew , past and present , of Les Mis ! <p> Fiona in Florence <p> I saw ' Les MisTrables ' the third week of November 2011 , at the end of Alfie Boe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a number of times , and picked this time specifically to see Alfie Boe in the role . I 'd been so impressed with his work as Valjean in the 25th anniversary concert at the O2 ( which I 've only seen on DVD ... not lucky enough to be there ) , I wanted to see him live . So , I had high expectations---which made me a little nervous ! <p> I should n't have worried : the evening was everything I thought it would be , and more . First , I think it 's impossible to use enough superlatives to describe Alfie 's performance . As another reviewer said , it 's as if the part of Valjean was written specifically for Alfie . ( And I 've seen several Valjeans over the years I thought were outstanding , notably John Owen-Jones in the 25th anniversary production at the Barbican . ) However , since Alfie 's run is now over , I want to applaud the overall quality of the entire cast . I 've seen productions over the years in which I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak - not here ! The entire cast seemed a notch above other casts . I want to specifically note that Hadley Fraser is amazing as Javert -simply stunning vocals , with a huge presence on stage . He will be playing Javert until at least June 2012 , I believe , so go see him ! I was also impressed by the performance of Craig Mather as Marius : this is his West End debut , and I thought he was terrific . Adam Linstead as Grantaire also stood out ( he has a dual role as the Bishop , as well ) ----excellent performance , which just made you want to keep an eye on him at all times . The rest of the cast was very good . As I said , it was a pleasure that the cast was so strong from top to bottom . <p> This was my first time seeing ' Les Mis ' at the Queen 's Theatre : when I first went in , I had the feeling it was too small for such an expansive production . However , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed right . I popped for great seats this time : stalls F15 , right in the centre . The seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom . At first I thought row F might be a tad too close , but again , I revised my opinion as soon as the show started . Row F turned out to be one of the best seats in the house ... the sound was great , and you could clearly see the expressions on the actors ' faces . I thought the seat was well worth the price . <p> As you can tell , it was an outstanding evening , and a performance I will remember for many years . <p> Alison . <p> Fantastic . Although the Queens Theatre was smaller than I realised , it only added to the feeling that I was part of performance . Ramin Karimloo was amazing , wonderful singing and acting . The rest of the cast were equally fabulous and I would recommend anyone to come to ' Les MisTrables ' . I shed a few tears as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast gave the best performance they could as if it was the first night . <p> There were five of us in our group and we sat in the stalls P4-8 , although the overhang is there , in no way did it detract from the performance . We could see everything on the stage and we were close enough to feel part of the performance . <p> Some day we will go back to see it again . <p> Mel Cawkwell <p> January 2012 . We have just returned from a trip to see ' Les MisTrables ' at The Queens Theatre . That show just keeps on being brilliant does n't it ? We loved it . <p> We had tickets for Row AA13-15 in the Upper Circle . These are listed as having a ' slightly restricted view ' . We were a little concerned when booking as we were n't sure what exactly constituted ' slightly restricted ' , but they were 10 cheaper than others in the row and they were right in the centre of the row - and at the front - so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a restricted view insofar as you have to lean forward to see the very front of the stage . There is a lighting rig just in front of these seats which is why they are sold at a reduced price , however , I looked at the people sitting in the dearer seats on either side and they were also leaning forward so we felt the 10 saving per ticket was worth it . Granted on a couple of occasions we may have leant forward very slightly more than the others in the row , but I really did n't feel it was a problem . You also can not see the orchestra pit from these seats ( because of the lighting rig ) , not sure if this would be an issue for anyone other than those with relatives in the orchestra ? ? I am sure the rows behind us must have had a restricted view to some degree too ( especially with row AA all leaning forward on the balcony wall ) , however I do n't know this for a fact . The balcony wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rest arms/elbows on , and is n't too high . <p> My husband said his back was aching a little from leaning forward throughout , but I loved the show and was so engrossed that I did n't feel uncomfortable ( we 're in our 40s ) . My mum was with us too ( in her 70 's ) she did n't complain that her back ached , but did say she kept getting pins &amp; needles in her hands from leaning forward on her elbows . This was n't an issue , she just moved her arms now and again . I imagine the seats may not be suitable for those with any kind of back problem . There is no extra legroom for being in the front row . None of us have long legs , so this was n't a problem . For theatre goers with long legs , it may prove uncomfortable by the end of the three hours ! <p> The seat/bottom part of the seats themselves are angled very slightly downwards . I 'm not sure why this is , unless is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be obvious . If you sit back in your seat , you probably lose the front third of the stage . For those familiar with the show , you can see from the about drain/manhole cover and beyond ( depending on your height I guess ! ) . <p> I would be happy to book these seats again , we felt they were good value for the price . <p> Les MisTrables - 13th January 2012 . <p> Sat in L1 of the Grand Circle , very good view , excellent sound and at only 20 quite a bargain . <p> This was my 7th viewing and my 4th at the Queen 's Theatre . <p> The current cast led by Ramin Karimloo is very good and he is the best Jean Valjean I have ever seen . The only weak link was Eponine and as I do n't really like ' On My Own ' I was not to bothered . She was fine with ' A little Fall of Rain ' which as ever brought tears to my eyes . But Mr Karimloo 's ' Bring Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to give the orchestra some added punch . <p> Not surprised it 's in it 's 27th year and by the fact there was not an empty seat to be seen I might suspect that this will be around for a few more years ! <p> Taljaard <p> January 2012 : Superb show , amazingly staged . I saw Ramin last year as the Phantom and he was equally good as Jean . Its such a superb ensemble performance though , so many of the cast have to be amazing singers . It may well run for another 25 years . <p> Stalls Row A Seats 10 and 11 : Managed to get these through GILT for half price so a bargain . Its a great view at the front , so close to the action . If you are shorter , the conductor may slightly get in your way at times if you sit in the middle of row A but otherwise fine . So if you can get hold of tickets for a discount then there is no reason to be put off by being in Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight backed ones , which are not as comfortable as the traditional curved back styles . <p> Stalls Row J Seat 15 : Was lucky enough to pick up one of the Premium 85 seats half price at the last minute . It is a great view from the middle of stalls but is it worth paying the extra 20 for these Premium seats I hear you ask ? Well if you were paying full price I would say it is not worth paying the extra , most normal seats in the stalls offer a great view and I do n't  believe you would really get much different view a few rows further forward or back from the premium rows . If you are paying full price I would just try and get somewhere in the middle stalls either side of the premium rows , if you manage to get a discounted ticket then pretty much anywhere in the stalls is worth it . Leg room is ok but for the 6ft plus like myself I would say it is about average ( the straight backed seats affect it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst and not a massive problem . <p> Myself and partner went to see ' Les Mis ' last Monday ( 6th February 2012 ) with GILT discount tickets . <p> They were offering upper circle seats 17 and 18 in Row AA . I consulted your seating plans and noted that these were additional rows without any feedback so I thought I would let you know that these were excellent value with a clear view of all the stage and the only real need for leaning forward was early on in the performance when Jean Valjean was being beaten up by the policeman for being on parole ! <p> It 's true that I usually sit on my coat to give myself extra height ( being only 5 ' 4 " ) but partner was delighted with his view and said he 'd book those seats again . The four seats to his right ( from memory 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 ) might get a bit hot in the summer being directly behind lighting rig but I do not think lights would interfere with viewing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that is one perk of being short ! <p> I was keen to see the production again with Ramin Karimloo. so we went to the matinee on 18th February 2012 , and were not disappointed . The HOUSE FULL sign was up , which was good ! <p> We sat in seats C18 and 19 in the stalls , having followed the recommendations on this site . Excellent seats , not too far forward , fantastic view of all the action , and we felt really involved in it all . Every cast member gave it their all . Ramin - what can I say ? Possibly the best Jean Valjean I 've seen ; he moved me to tears with his beautiful voice , and the cheers and standing ovation were well deserved . <p> The actors playing Javert , Marius , Enjolras and the Bishop were all stand-outs in an amazing cast . It 's not light subject matter by any stretch , but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves . If you have n't seen Ramin , but can get a ticket , I would recommend it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday night February 23rd 2012 . Got discounted tickets from the TKTS booth in Leicester Square , ( 66 reduced to 36 ) . Seats in Dress circle G1 to 4 . <p> I 'm not going to go on about the show as I 'm sure enough has been said about it by now because it 's been on long enough ! But I will say that I did n't like it . Very dramatic , and well staged with strong performances from all the cast , but these ' all singing no dialogue ' musicals are just not for me . <p> The seats we had ( G1 to 4 ) in the Dress Circle were right on the edge of the row and I noticed were red on the all seeing , all hearing , and all knowing Theatremonkey seating plan , so was slightly worried . I have to say that there was nothing wrong with them at all ! Yes they were slightly to the right hand side but I had a very clear view of the stage and did n't miss anything . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of action on the right hand side of the stage would create the ' little red mark ' but I thought the seat was fine. * <p> The Queens Theatre ( which I 've never been in before ) was another credit to Sir Cameron , as it was clean and well thought out ( with the ticket buying public in mind ) and the seats were very comfortable too . Everyone of his theatres that I 've stepped inside has very much impressed me and long may he continue . <p> *Theatremonkey ratings are indeed based on paying full price ( plus any agency fees if applicable , up to 25% extra ) . Discounted seats always get at least 1 grading higher . Editor . <p> Les MisTrables : Evening performance , 1st March 2012 . <p> Seat : Dress Circle D18 - 39 from the TKTS Booth . <p> A premium 85 seat sold to me at 36 plus 3 booking fee . If I 'd paid full price , ( not that I would , premium seats being just a rip off in my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe the theatre has been refurbished and all new seating installed . I found the seat a bit uncomfortable and I 'm only 5 ' 6 . It 's the first time I 've ever sat in a Dress Circle seat and had the rows in front ( and I 'm talking row C as well as B and A ) leaning forward . D18 is just off centre ; the view is generally fine , but I did have to sit bolt upright to see over the heads of those in the front 3 rows . A tad uncomfy for a show of this length . <p> I 'm also not a fan of there being no centre aisle ; when your dying to go to the toilet before Fantine 's death in the long first act it 's not good to get out of a central seat without disturbing a lot of people . I managed to wait till the end of the Act but it was touch and go ... I really must remember that 2 pints of beer and a bottle of Coke is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've not see this show since its move to the Queens and have mixed feelings . <p> It looks squashed onto the stage here , not how I remember it at the Palace - and it seems there is a smaller cast . The cast were great - with one exception . I went to this performance knowing Ramin Karimloo was not on , but the actor playing Valjean was excellent - as was Javert , Fantine , Marius and Cosette . <p> The let down was Alexia Khadime as Eponine . Now , Eponine is one of my favourite characters - with probably my second favourite song in the entire show , ( the first being ' One Day More ' ) . Her voice is horrible , at times it was painful - especially when she riffs her way through ' On My Own . ' I could n't wait for her to die this time around ... ironically she sang this very well - but it 's the first time I 've never ' teared up ' at this point of the show . Oh , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Cristina Fray ) sounded more British Royal Family than French Lower Class ; her pronunciation would have shamed many minor and some of our senior Royals . Very irritating ! ! <p> On the whole I liked the new orchestrations , but as a Les Miz purist I 'll stick with the the OLC and Symphonic recordings . <p> Apart from that I enjoyed the show very much and have rediscovered it after a long absence . Will I go again ? Well I 'd like to get back before March 31st 2012 to see Ramin , but , while Alexia Khadime is playing Eponine I seriously doubt that I will . <p> I went to see the matinee performance of ' Les Mis ' yesterday ( 21st March 2012 ) . It was my third visit , I wanted to go again because it 's a couple of years since I saw it last and I wanted to see Ramin Karimloo . He was fantastic as expected , especially singing ' Bring Him Home , ' the applause went on forever at the end of the song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have commented on Alexis Khadime as Eponine . I saw her in ' Wicked ' and thought she was amazing , when I went to see it with someone else as Elphaba it was really disappointing . But I agree with others , she did n't really suit this role . She sang ' On My Own ' very well , but it just did n't seem to fit . Marius was played by an understudy with big eyebrows but not such a big voice , he was struggling a bit . Everyone else was great . <p> I was sitting in the upper circle , A29 . I mostly bought it because I was hoping the performance might not be that well attended and they would close the upper circle ... but no such luck this time , I guess it does n't always work . This is not a seat for someone who wants to be comfortable ! However , if you can get yourself into the right position , sort of twisted and leaning forwards ( ! ) you can see two thirds of the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be slightly better as a few things happened at the front of the stage on the left ( is that one stage right ? I can never remember ) whereas not much happens on the other side that I can remember so I think you might miss a bit less ? For 10 you really ca n't complain , and I would probably get it again if funds were low ! Having said that , I moved during the interval as there were a few empty seats behind me . I ended up in B26 , which was actually a pretty good seat , just missing a tiny bit of the stage . I heard lots of people in row AA complain that they could n't see the front of the stage , and in row A that they could n't see because AA were leaning forwards . <p> I do n't think I will ever get tired of this musical . I 'll let you know how I get on in another 2 years time ! <p> Catherine . <p> I just wanted to give my thanks to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give my opinion about my visit to the show . <p> After much deliberation I booked seats A4 and A5 in the dress circle for the matinee on 31st March 2012 , knowing that it was Ramin Karimloo 's penultimate performance in the role of Jean Valjean , I have to agree in part with other readers views that these seats would be normally best avoided due to the very side on seating position . I would however disagree with the very tight leg room ( I am 6 ' 1 " and found it no worse than any other theatre or football ground which I have been to ) . <p> The fact is that you are unable to see the very extremities of the stage ( My partner and I were on the right hand side as you look towards the stage and could n't see a very tiny part of the singing action at one point ) ; however this is compensated for by a reduced ticket price ( and an indication that you have to possibly lean forward on the tickets ) . I would certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The performance itself was the usual high standard with Ramin outstanding as JVJ but also very strong accompanying this was Hadley Fraser as Javert and you can not fail to mention the comedic contribution of M and Mme Thenardier ( who were also very good ) . All in all another outstanding performance of this wonderful show .

@@45560885 @5560885/ <p> " I was intrigued by the concept and staging . My husband enjoyed the acting . My son was a bit bored with plays within plays . as I was not able to explain what the plot was when he asked . I had n't realized from the synopsis that I 'd read that the set up was another play within a play . In spite of the double play I think he enjoyed it , and I know both he and my husband got a huge kick out of how high I jumped during those couple of surprising turns . " <p> As a part of studying AS Theatre Studies ( a U.K. examination for 17 year old students ) we have to see several live productions . As a class we went to see The Woman In Black and I have to admit we were all rather skeptical when we read reviews on how the audience screamed with terror . <p> However these reviews were certainly correct ; as someone who is not easily scared it certainly had me screaming with fright ! <p> This play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone in my class can remember ever part in graphic detail . I just thought that these comments might inspire others to go see this spectacular play . <p> I have seen " Woman In Black " twice , and still find the play as spine tingling as ever ! <p> My school went on a trip to the Fortune Theatre to see it on Wednesday 10th July and to our teachers amusement none of us could bear to walk down the street without screaming ! <p> One thing which was annoying was the speed of the play at the beginning , my teachers felt that the play could move more fluently at the start . <p> All in all my school enjoyed this play and we are all recommending our families to go ! <p> Wow ! <p> I was going to leave it at just that one word , but i could n't resist adding more ! I went to see it with my school , and I can honestly say the whole audience was blown away . <p> The acting was superb , and the set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you did n't know where you were half of the time . Currently in the West End , Timothy Watson and Robert Demenger play , both extremely talented men . <p> Upon returning for a second visit I was still equally as shocked , and moved ! Everyone simply has to see this play ! ! ! Just one word of advice , watch out in the stalls ! ! ! <p> Danielle Klentzeris , Cardiff . <p> The scariest time of your life , that is IF you live through it ! ! ! <p> Like Wow ! ! ! I totally agree with Danielle . <p> This production seriously comes back to haunt you when you 're ever left in the dark or ever hear that haunting melody : Swan Lake . OR even worse hearing the thud , thud , thud freaks you out ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Louisa Wilkes , Cardiff/Hollywood . <p> I went to see the show last night and it was absolutely amazing ! ! ! Even after reading the reviews on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed it could n't actually be that scary , but believe me it was ! It is an absolute must , thinking about it now , makes me shudder ! Fantastic ! <p> Holly Tate Surrey <p> <p> It was amazing . <p> Like so many others I went to see it with my school . My teachers take GCSE drama in year11 every year . Those in the year above said how scary it was , and we all thought , " yeah right how is the theatre scary " . But it so was ! Everyone was screaming and jumping out of their seats . It was extremely cleverly done and everyone really enjoyed it . Definitely worth going to see . It was fantastic . <p> All reviews of this play follow a strict clichT whereby the reviewer expresses their cynicism prior to the performance , contrasted with their terror during , and surprise after the show . And who am I to break with such traditions ? <p> I went in to the Fortune Theatre expecting an afternoon of entertainment rather than to be frightened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre would , by nature play second-fiddle to film . However , I was wrong . The show is so edgy , so tense as to be entertaining only in hindsight . <p> The first half comprises a semi-gothic , even half-comic melodrama designed to strip away any mental preparation the audience may have made for the shows horrors which come with tremendous force after the interval . <p> The second half is spent firmly gripping the armrests in anticipation of the next burst of unbridled terror accompanied by a nausea-inducing flood of adrenaline . Whilst the actual shocks last no more than a few seconds in total , the suspense is so carefully managed as to leave you wanting to escape from the theatre for at least 45 mins . <p> Imagine the scariest theatrical production you could ever imagine , multiply this by a gripping horror film and add a night you have spent alone wishing it was morning . This concoction of utter horror still can not come close to the pure theatrical genius of the Woman in Black . ( and this is pure theatre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One warning - You 'll be sleeping with the light on and running away from shadows for months afterwards . Best to go for a matinee so you do n't emerge onto a Dark Russell Street to torment you further ! <p> Only sit in the stalls if you are of extremely sound mind . Here the terror is most intense . <p> William Cooper <p> My weekend started with seeing " Our House " on the Friday . Returning to London on the Saturday for a day out , we went to the TKTS office to see what shows would be on offer for the evening and so we got 2 tickets for this play . <p> I 've always been more of musical person that plays when I 'm paying out 20+ for a ticket but at 18 each and the fact that I 'd seen a musical already this weekend , along with the fact that my girlfriend had said before she wanted to see this , we got the tickets and thought we would see what it was like . <p> Seated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this site many years ago , so maybe it has its real ghost ! ! ! ) as we went to our seats we knew we were in the show well almost with seats this close to the stage . No seat is every far away . My seat in D1 was just a little restricted in the fact of seeing the far side of the stage but this did not spoil it all . <p> It starts maybe a little slow but that 's all part of the story and how its told , and what makes the outcome ..... well if you go and see it you will understand . <p> Anyway the basics , there are two men on stage and they take you thought the story of the Island and the Woman in Black , if you are seated in the stalls you see more that you would in the circle due to what happens in the stalls ... that I wo n't say now ! And well it can spook you , I do n't get spooked by horrors etc but my girlfriend does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a few twists and I think this is a play that could get " musical preference " people like me to see other plays . Normally the only time I would see a play was if it was a comedy . <p> It 's been running in London for many years now ; go see it - its worth a view and the TKTS office often had tickets for it . <p> Alun Moss . Basildon , Essex <p> Saturday 14th June , Evening performance . <p> I last saw this play about 3 or 4 years ago , and have booked to go see it again next week ( July 03 ) for the 6th time , and ca n't wait ! <p> It is simply a delicious , juicy night of chills and jumps ! It is brilliantly devised , with two actors re-telling a story , and I love the bit where the ' actor ' tells the ' student ' , " I 'll play you , and you play all the other characters " or words to that effect . <p> With just brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice etc , and sound effects that just make you believe you 're " there " , the entire event is totally satisfying . You will want to go back with a friend , not , as another reviewer put it , for moral support , but more , I suspect , to take wicked pleasure at seeing them jump and grip the seat , or even your arm ! And the theatre itself is just so beautifully spooky when you enter first ! <p> If you are any way unsure about going to see a play instead of a musical , then this is the one to go to . Even on my 5th visit I jumped , as I had forgotten some of the scary bits . Enjoy it ! ! ! ! ! <p> KC , Ireland <p> I 'm sorry , I thought " Woman In Black " really sucked . It was too predictable . The creaking chairs made the sound effects useless , and what was even worse was that at school I had to put up with several days of people going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes Pip Donaghy went a little overboard . <p> Shanta Kumar <p> <p> " It was 9:30 on a Christmas Eve ..... I walked down the long hallway .... <p> This was a most wonderful production and the ending was a thrill , we are going back in November 2003 and taking my 14 year old niece and we plan on taking her to this play .... <p> FOLLOWING THAT SECOND VISIT ! <p> .... I did take my 14 year old niece to the play and she really loved it , it 's a thriller but not really scary - I saw about three years ago and really wanted to see it again.p&gt; You can almost always get tickets at the TKTS half price booth we had seats in 5th row Upper Circle , the seats are rather small with no leg room but otherwise OK . <p> They have different actors than when I saw it before but I still really enjoyed the production and since I had forgotten a few things I still jumped a few times when I heard the SCREAM and when the door opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilling and well done performance which is as good as many other ( but " sexed up " ) productions in the West End . The two actors succeed in thrilling even ( first giggling ) school classes in matinees within 20 minutes . <p> I agree with all of you ! <p> I went to see it with my GCSE ( an English school examination for those aged 16 ) drama group set 1 and set 2 . I 've heard from my teachers who have seen it before that it was scary but it did n't really sink in , until I got to the theatre . <p> Even outside before the show I was scared . Overall , it was the most spine-chilling most amazing play ever ! I HIGHLY recommend EVERYONE to go and see it ... PLEASE go and see it ! ! <p> Ashleigh Barretto <p> Sat in box - lovely ! But speakers are in your ears . <p> Lots of loud noises at unexpected moments , although gripping story , and well acted by the three cast members . <p> Woman seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pulls in the screams and gives a shiver - yes , but as soon as it finishes ( very well ) it loses all its magic . <p> See it if you want a scream , and by all means it is a good production ( in a hideous theatre ) but think very carefully , there are far better things on . <p> Alf <p> Saw this show last night ( 13th March 2004 ) and was amazed . This show had us riveted to our seats ( apart from the screams when I must have jumped about a foot each time ) . We could n't wait for the interval to end to find out what happened next . <p> We sat in Row K in the stalls and had a great view . We got the tickets from a ticket booth recommended by Theatre Monkey and paid just 22 each no booking fees it was definitely good value for money . <p> Five stars for this show would recommend it to anybody . <p> S Allum <p> Well ... <p> I was absolutely terrified ! Loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waking up at 2.30am seeing her white withered face floating around my room but never mind ! ! ! <p> Only problem was the loud tourists ( I wo n't say where they were from ) constantly moving around and leaning forward throughout . Thankfully they were shut up accordingly the moment things turned freaky-deaky ! ! ! <p> Mark <p> For those who like a good scare , horror movies and camp fire ghost stories " Woman in Black " will bring the experience to a whole new level ... by inviting the object of your fear into the room with you ! <p> The show is deeply terrifying but also incredibly gripping and well written . I believe the play itself is captivating even without the scare factor . <p> The atmosphere of this ghost story is added to by your surroundings in the ageing Fortune Theatre and by the intimacy of the performance due to the small stage and auditorium . With a combination of that and strong acting from a 2 man cast it is n't long before you are drawn in and feel like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems that it takes just as long for the story to become terribly dark and disturbing . <p> This show does n't rely at all on sudden mood changes or loud jumpy snippets of action ( although there are some shocking moments ) but tension , intriguing , yet , chilling script and the art of good old fashioned story telling ... with a twist . <p> Even if you are n't the ghost story type it 's definitely worth seeing , though not for the faint of heart ! Out of the 20 college friends I went with to see this show first time around 5 still claim to have nightmares about it while the other 15 came away dying to seeing it again ... and most of us did . <p> Some of the atmosphere can be lost with the touring production due to location , so I recommend you see it in London ... I will definitely be going again ! <p> TwistedPixie <p> ( from the Nottingham Touring production ) <p> A truly terrifying thriller . <p> We saw this production in Nottingham as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish national school examination taken at 16 ) course . We will be using this production in our exam . <p> Within the opening few minutes of the play , the audience is ' indirectly spooked ' in preparation for what is about to happen . Throughout the whole play the audience is bother scared and gripped to the amazing story . <p> This play features just two cast members ( and a ghost ) and uses a minimal set ( a technique similar to that of Brechtian ) . <p> As soon as the audience sees the spectres face , they acquire the impression that she is staring at them individually as they experience the dreadfulness of her expression . <p> The play also uses all the doors in the auditorium for a full 3D effect . The Woman makes her first appearance at a child 's funeral . A child she has a strong connection with ... <p> Saw " Woman In Black " on Saturday 15th May 2004 . Fantastic ! Saw it 10 years ago - forgotten how good it was ! The spooky atmosphere " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it ! ) added to by the screams from the audience - I did n't know whether to scream along or laugh ! Poor seats though - row A upper circle - the safety bar was a real hindrance to a good view . This is one show where they really should ban the eating of goodies with noisy wrappers - the rustling really interrupts and spoils the building of tension which is paramount to the production 's success . <p> ( from the Torques Touring production ) <p> OH MY GOD ! <p> I saw this show in London about two years ago and got NO sleep WHAT SO EVER for two nights ( and very little for weeks after that ! ) . It is the scariest thing you could ever ever ever see ! I was astounded . <p> I was with my school for a week during " project week " it was all we talked about for days afterward . Then I went back to school and other people , who had n't  seen it , could n't believe that a person could be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , a movie ! I TRIED my VERY VERY best to persuade them that in many respects it is WORSE in a theatre because you are THERE . You are DIRECTLY involved with itit is LIVE ! But none believed me <p> ... SO imagine my JOYOUS SURPRISE when the self same play ( featuring the understudies from the London show ) came to TORQUESa mere trip down the road . Now , none of the friends I wanted to take do drama at GCSE - and neither do I - but we managed to blag a bus ride to the show with the drama groupneedless to say my friends who thought theyd find it laughable where totally scared out of their witsas the " Daily Express " says : " it is a truly nerve-shredding experience.GO AND SEE IT ! ! ! " <p> Also PLEASE visit my site **26;246;TOOLONG as there will soon be writing about the show and a link to the official website ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> What an absolutely fantastic experience . Got half price tickets in row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well played that you forget it 's just two actors , playing actors ( it all makes sense when you see the show , honest ) . This is all happening in front of you . It 's not a play . It 's real . <p> There IS a causeway . There IS a pony and trap , There IS a dog . And there IS a Woman in Black . <p> The first half slowly draws you in . You think it 'll all be okay . Apart from a couple of frights , it 's not been too bad an experience . <p> But by halfway through the second half you are too scared to watch anymore . You want the lights to come on and for you to be able to go home . You want to be safe in your bed . Lock all the doors and windows and you 'll be okay . <p> But unfortunately that does n't happen and things just get worse and worse , until you no longer want to go home . You 're too scared to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring . Staring right through into your very soul . <p> Mummy help ! ! <p> Tim Holloway Norfolk <p> How this production has lasted 16 years on the West End is simply incomprehensible . It is difficult to decide what disappoints most throughout , what really does feel like , the two hours it lasts . <p> An entirely visually uninspiring grey backdrop opens the play , which looks untouched since opening night in 1989 , and is revived only somewhat by the silkscreen effect during the second half at Eel Marsh House . The stage direction is no better ; at one point the movement of the protagonists from a street scene to an office is signified by a contrived series of movements across the stage , as might be expected only in a school play . <p> In Act II , the method employed to instill terror in the audience is the repeated playing of dangerously loud screams , which does build anticipation . However this is only the anticipation felt of wanting to leave the theatre . <p> This tourist aimed production is an unfortunate letdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real theatre that can be found in the West End . " The Woman in Black " could indeed be described as ghastly , but for all the wrong reasons . <p> Tom Brown , London <p> I saw " Women In Black " the other day as part of my drama G.C.S.E ( a British school examination , taken at age 16 ) , and it was great . I heard stories about being scary , but trying to be macho I decided to sit near the aisle , big mistake , the whole macho idea went out the window and I found myself jumping out of my seat but unlike a horror movie you ca n't pause it or hide behind a pillow , it 's like you 're in the horror movie , the two lead actors were fantastic and the way they used the prop basket for a number of things was very effective . <p> A brilliant show which I would love to see again to scare the pants off me people ! But next time I might bring a pillow . <p> I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats 11/12 . Nice seats and view . Plenty of leg room . Just our luck we choose one day out of an 18 year run when the theatre seemed to be over run with feral teenagers on a school trip , though . <p> Furthermore , the play was so dull it encouraged them to heckle continuously ' this is n't scary ' etc , etc - all the way through . <p> I will admit , all the reviews I read beforehand , including plenty on this site , did lead me to believe it would be a chilling nail biter . No doubt the teens were also expecting something more . However , it was about as scary as a ghost train . With The Woman in Black looking like she 'd be more at home haunting the fairground on Scooby Doo . <p> Very poor . <p> KJ Hailes <p> The play was freaking scary ! ! ! ! My heart was pounding by the end . Scary stuff . <p> You are dead right about Upper Circle Row A. We sat in A13 and A14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gap in the safety rail . Legroom was ok for me , but I 'm 5 foot ; it was cramped for my taller friend . <p> We moved to the Dress Circle box at the interval , and though views to the sides were limited we had a much better view , much closer to the stage , and plenty of room to stretch out . <p> This play is absolutely brilliant . A spine tingling story with excellent acting , from beginning to end , it exudes imaginative flare and is simply unforgettable ! I even scared myself witless the night after , just thinking about it ! The story is very cleverly portrayed using only a few props . Its a very riveting production and I was certainly immersed in it right till the scary end ! <p> Definitely not to be missed . <p> Abhi <p> We went on 9th August 2006 . I never thought I would be interested in a show with just two characters and hardly any scenery , but I was engrossed for the whole time , and would definitely recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are some " scary " moments which will make you jump , so if your of a " nervous disposition " then maybe give it a miss . <p> Now for the theatre . We took up one of these " Theatre and Meal " deals from Lastminute.com . Okay , so not bad for 20 for the ticket and the meal - but this was the first time we had tried this out , and I think I would pay the extra to sit where I want - but that 's me ! <p> " The Woman in Black " was paired with " Rock Garden " in Covent Garden , choice of two courses , i.e. either a " starter and Main " or " Main and dessert , " from a set menu . They did try and " up sell " the drinks as these were extra , trying very hard to sell my wife a glass of Criquet for 10 a glass . Apart form that it was fine . <p> We were given C7 and C8 in the Upper Circle . Good view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a couple of sequences that were at the very very front of the stage which we could not see . Legroom was a bit cramped and I am not even that tall . <p> Bar prices reasonable and all and all value for money and a great show ! ! <p> I was sat in the Stalls , row G ( seat 10 ) in fact , to watch this play and the view of the stage was very good . Also , there was plenty of leg room in the seats so having to endure aching legs whilst watching the play . <p> I can not think of enough words to show how much I enjoyed " The Woman In Black " , the most impressive aspect is that you do n't really realise that the cast consists of two central characters . <p> I loved the way that humour was used at the start to draw the audience in , then as the play continued the suspense increased until you wondered what was going to happen next . <p> Paul Shelley and Damien Matthews deserve a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kipps and the Actor . <p> A must see if you like suspense ... just take a friend if you are especially nervous ! ! <p> The classic approach to ascertaining whether you will find this thriller scary and moreover entertaining is to ask which you found scarier : " An American Werewolf in London " or " The Blair Witch Project . " However , despite being very much in the former group of the two I was terrified in a couple of parts and at one point in the second act yelled out a very manly scream . Anyone who went on 9th November 2006 ? - That was me . <p> The fact that there are only two cast members does not detract from the production as the casting was fantastic - both actors ' performances were best I have seen on stage for a while . It was not difficult to feel that at least half the audience had seen it before . The tension rises before the scary points and you can cut the atmosphere with a knife but this does not spoil the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B14 / B15 in the dress circle and found the view to be very good although not excellent as you would expect . The metal bars are in actual fact very low and it is only in a couple of points that they affect the view as the action nears the audience . At some points though you are glad to be away from the action - theatre goers with a heart condition should not sit in the aisle seats in the stalls ! <p> A consequence of its 20+ year run is that if you are an avid theatre goer you have probably already seen it . - Twice . If not , book now ! If on the other hand you are just starting off then still see it - only determined macho-driven men like me have a chance of not being scarred by this production . <p> Benjamin <p> Decided to watch this play again after enjoying it so much last year , so attended on 29th August 2007 and sat in seats ( Stalls G10 and G11 ) which offered a good view of the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , I did prefer last years production more . <p> However , this performance may have been affected by one person messing around with their mobile phone and a couple of others needlessly chattering during the play . Noise like this spoils the atmosphere needed for this play to work . <p> If you like a play with a few scares then pop down to the Fortune and see this play . Remember to take a friend if you 're easily frightened ! <p> I have to say that my wife and I , after reading various reviews , were looking forward to watching this play . <p> As it turned out , what a let-down . Apart from the fact that the play barely comes alive only after the interval , there is more scariness in a ghost train ride at a fairground then there is in this production . <p> We were that bored that we even contemplated leaving at the interval ! <p> David <p> Got given tickets for my birthday to go see the show as I 'd seen it a few years back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to take my boyfriend to see it this time ... and see if it could scare him ! It did n't , but he must of been lying . <p> The only suggestion I have is , and I do n't mean to sound like a scrooge , but the theatre should really put a ban on little screaming girls ! It ruined it for me and my party , made the play seem really immature . <p> Wow . This is a very powerful play ! It was very good , the second Act is extremely scary ... Oh-my-god that scream is horrible ... and the woman in black is so creepy ! <p> I would still suggest everyone to go and see it . I could n't sleep with the light off for a few nights , and I just had a nightmare about it last night ! ! BUT , it is a brilliant play from a drama perspective - will have to go and see it again before my drama exam . <p> After many years of wanting to go to ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child ! ) , but always finding something else to see , safe in the knowledge that it would probably run forever , I finally took my 15-year-old niece to the Fortune Theatre yesterday ( 6th September 2008 ) . Unfortunately , the years of waiting were not rewarded by a great theatrical experience . <p> First of all , we had bought half price tickets from Leicester Square and got row F11 and F12 of the Dress Circle . I have never felt so much like a sardine in a theatre ! At 6 ' , things can be difficult but this was outrageous , especially considering these are classed as top price seats . I also had to contend with someone 's head blocking the middle of the stage and a Pringle-munching heathen next to me , but the worst thing by far was the legroom . If the theatre really thinks that these seats are comparable to being in the stalls , then it is seriously deluded . You also miss out a bit on the scares - for example , I am still unsure as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , I think some of the Dress Circle should be marked in red as it really is substandard . <p> As for the show , I can see why it 's so popular with school groups as it 's a clever , well-staged and easy to follow piece of theatre that plays a little bit like a textbook of ' how to produce effects on a tight budget ' . But as someone who 's a fan of modern horror , I have to agree with a previous reviewer in that the shocks are ghost-train style ( and a mild ghost train at that ) , the story takes you from A to B with no real suspense or twists , and the overall effect is one of musty relic rather than edge-of-your-seat thriller . <p> This show is incredible ! ! My boyfriend and I went to see it one Saturday night ( my " punishment " for making him see a musical the last time ) , knowing nothing about it other than what we had read on Theatremonkey , and we were beyond thrilled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever been so scared in my life ( and my boyfriend has the nail marks in his hand to prove it ! ) ; the actors , all two of them , not including the woman in black , were just awesome in their many roles . <p> The theatre itself added to the atmosphere ; it 's so old it 's almost crumbling around you ! ! We heard that it 's currently under renovation , but I hope that they do n't update any of the features . We were sat in D12 and 13 in the dress circle and although the view was brilliant , there is no space to speak of . At all . The poor woman in front of me was subject to my foot in her lower back on several occasions , just as I was from the man behind me . After a while , you get kind of used to it , but nothing can prepare you for the numb bum ! ! I could n't comment on the seats in the stalls as I did n't see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone above 5 ' 10 as my boyfriend had some real problems cramping himself in . <p> That said , numb bum is a small price to pay for a show as fantastic as this ! ! <p> This play was recommended to us so we were looking forward to it and anticipating being scared out of our seats . What a let down . We were very disappointed - and confused about why on earth it 's been running for so long . It 's slow to warm up - in fact it never really did - the story is predictable , the theatrical effects pedestrian , and the characters fail to inspire any empathy . <p> We 're glad we 've seen it because we were curious . But we 've seen two plays recently at the Almeida Theatre in Islington . The seats did n't cost quite as much , the actors were household names , and there was much more ' theatre ' involved . We enjoyed both plays far more . <p> Swamp-Pokey <p> The Woman in Black certainly lives up to it 's reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no overtures or bright lights and certainly no stunning costumes or lavish sets . Do n't get me wrong , it takes skill to select appropriate costumes and stage a set to give the effect of minimalist dinge , appropriate to the story , but it relies heavily on 2 actors weaving a magical spell on a very small auditorium . and quite simply , they do it fantastically . There are long monologues and humour and perfect timing , the accent range is excellent . <p> We went to a matinee on Saturday 29th August 2009 . The theatre is quirky in that you go down a flight of stairs to the stalls and the effect is rather like being shrunk into a Pollock 's toy theatre . Although we had considerably more leg room than in most theatres ( we were in row D seats 13 and 14 on the aisle ) , if I must make a criticism it is that you do have to look up all the time - so do n't sit so close if you have neck problems <p> The actors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turning off of phones and an actor appeared on stage whilst everyone was still fumbling in their bags , as there is no safety curtain to be raised at the beginning ) . <p> Once it gets going it is a riveting play , full of suspense , screams and jumpy bits . There is a smoke machine or 2 and , whilst very effective , it does cause rather a lot of coughing from the audience . The line is something like ' I cant see the house at all ' and certainly anyone in the front 5 rows could n't see the stage or even the person sitting next to them . There were several coughs carrying on for about 10 minutes , take a scarf to cover your face if you are asthmatic . <p> We were on the aisle and characters do appear there from time to time , but having been told it was good to be on the aisle I am not sure why . SPOILER ALERT I did n't jump and was n't grabbed or anything , but I have to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder from time to time to see if the ' woman in black ' would appear in the aisle as I had heard she does appear here and there , but again , I need n't have worried - and saved myself the distraction from the play . <p> I love all theatre , and on this occasion I took my mother in law who has a preference for musicals ( it was her suggestion to go to something different ) and she loved it . The play lasts about 2 hours and is well worth a look . <p> Jos Hockley London <p> 26th January 2010 : This is my third visit to see this play in London , I purchased my tickets on a 2 for 1 deal on a website . <p> Funnily enough it 's probably been my favourite visit , that 's purely down to the superb audience reaction to what was happening on stage . I can only imagine the " screamers " must not have seen it before because as the tension built up so did their scream factor . I had one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered me deaf in the closing moments . But that made my night , not ruin it as I loved that some people had immersed themselves so deeply into the story that they did n't care they may look silly due to their reactions . <p> The performances of both actors were fantastic , an improvement on my last visit a couple of years back but I think that may have been more due to some idiot messing about with his mobile phone during the performance . <p> My brother and I were sat in the stalls , seats J7 and J8 which gave an excellent view of the stage and there 's plenty of legroom so comfort is n't a problem . <p> If either yourself , a partner , a relative or a friend like a good scare then book to see The Woman In Black you 'll have a great night out , it 's been playing in the West End for 21 years now so it must be doing something right . <p> We got half price tickets , thanks for the link theatremonkey , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sat in the Stalls J 1 and 2 on the aisle . J1 is listed as red in the seating plan but I found no problem with it , the view is not obstructed in any way . Row J is a good place to sit as it is not too close to the stage so you are not looking upwards all the time . The leg room is very good in the stalls , I am 6ft 4 and often have problems but it is very good here . It is a nice small theatre and you feel very close to the action . <p> I found the show itself to be very well acted by the two performers . It uses a clever form of story telling to weave through the piece using two performers . The stage , while small and fairly basic in set up , is well used ; and includes two further sections behind the front curtain . I think the scary element of the show is overplayed a bit though , reviews like ' You will be scared witless ' go a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments that will scare and make people jump ; but no easily scared person should be put off by the way the show is marketed . It is certainly no horror show or scare fest or anything like that . This is a very well written and acted atmospheric play that is well worth a visit . <p> I went and saw the ' Women in Black ' on Saturday 11th July 2009 . <p> We sat in Stalls , Row F , seats 12 and 13 . These seats gave an almost central view of the stage and were close enough to experience some the action . At 5ft 8 I found the seats gave me adequate legroom but anyone taller might have a problem and although the rake of the seating is hardly noticeable , the stage is high enough for even the shortest of people to see over heads in front of them . <p> Sad to see that the sofas ( at the side of the stalls ) have now gone ! <p> Wasnt quite sure what to expect from this show , but knew it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . I normally go for musicals , so this was also something very different for me . <p> Was initially surprised by the format only two actors and the first half was a bit slow . I got to the interval wondering where this was all going and having doubts about why this had been so popular for 20+ years and then , curtain up and away we go ....... <p> What a contrast to the first half I actually think that was all part of the plan a slow build up leaving you with no clear idea of where this was going ; we were lulled into a false sense of security . This was the 3pm showing and so we found ourselves sharing the theatre with quite a few school children but , that did not detract from performance the many screamers actually fuelled the fear . <p> This is a good , old fashioned ghost story which was very well acted by Julian Forsythe and Christopher Naylor I would highly recommend the show to anyone . <p> Sat in stalls seats C3 and C4 which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and to the side ; only problem was that you are looking up so , if you suffer from neck problems as I do , probably best to sit a bit further back . <p> I saw this play as part of a theatre course and found it was very good . Well , the first act ... I spent most of the second act with my face in my friends lap . I have a panic disorder and would not recommend it to anyone who has one or is easily set on edge . <p> The second act was sheer hell as the audience screams a lot , and this was very unhelpful . I wish could have appreciated this play fully as it was amazing for what I saw of it . Great to see with a large group of friends . <p> Saw ' Woman in Black ' today ( 12th July 2011 ) , stalls C17 , great seat ! School groups very well behaved - it was a delight ! <p> Woman in Black : Monday 14th November 2011 , 8pm performance . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it a wonderful piece and it did n't  disappoint on second viewing ! The Fortune Theatre is a gorgeous little gem - tucked beside Drury Lanes Theatre Royal it is the tiniest place Ive ever been too and as a result the production works well in such a small space . No fancy effects , no glamorous props , no fantastic set pieces just simple and highly engaging storytelling that , unlike some of the bigger shows , expects the audience to fully engage their brain , mind and imagination into the evening . Scary enough depending on how much you are prepared to buy into the evening <p> I had seat A7 in the Dress Circle ( normally 45 Mon-Thurs / 47.50 Fri-Sat ) for 22.50 via an online ticket offer . The view from these seats is incredible you are almost eyeballing the actors ! ! The bar that the monkey notes in his review really did n't  affect my view at all . Monkey is correct , however , about the legroom which is truly awful . Sat down , wedged my size 11s between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chair and did n't  move ! However , the seats have been recently refurbished so my bum and back were OK ! BUT I would most definitely sit here to see it again at half-price , of course ; - ) <p> It is a great play in a little ( little being the operative word ) gem of a theatre . A masterclass of old-fashioned storytelling .

Sitting in the stalls normally is not my first choice - I prefer the Dress Circle - but for " The Lion King " I think the stalls are great as the action part takes place in the stalls aisles ; so in many ways you are in fact in the show " in the thick of it " , as they say . <p> When in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means a neck ache during and after , but with the " Lion King " the Row A is set back a little due to the fact that the Orchestra pit is large and comes out a good few feet . <p> Theatremonkey seating plan says A9 is not good due to the view of the conductor but seated just one seat to the side of this I could not see this as being a major problem . The head of the conductor is in view for all Row A and B seats in the centre section for some part , but it 's not too bad . <p> The show is great - follows the Disney film ( very good ) - and the cast really do come across as if they are the animals playing out the parts on stage . The effects and technical ability of the " Lion King " shows that it 's backed by and had a lot of money put into this show by Disney . <p> Value ? - Yes sort of , I think so . After all , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and some shows without the major name of Disney are 55 for a Saturday night now . <p> It 's been going 5 years now and still playing to packed full houses , If you ask me , " should you see it ? " I 'd say yes and take your children too if they will not be scared by the larger animals on stage . <p> Over-hyped , over-priced and over here . Frankly , it is enjoyable , even delightful as a 25 show to take your children , nieces and nephews out for a special treat . The show became annoying because it was completely aimed at the younger audience one or two risquT jokes brought knowing laughs from audience members over 6 years old but there was not much there for adults . <p> Having said that the animals and staging are brilliant . The best scenes are when there are groups onstage singing and dancing . The worst scenes are of the boring Simba - young and old . In fact , Simba gets worse with age . The young Simba could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact the sound quality was consistently poor when individual characters were speaking or singing on stage .

It was my first ever trip to the theatre and I had a great time . The show was a bit slow in a couple of places but the effects/costumes etc made up for it for me . <p> I took my sons aged 9 and 10 to see The Lion King at Easter 2005 . Fantastic show . Great music , superb opening scene and excellent singing . Not a dull moment . Fantastic special effects . We sat in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packer Kent <p> Three generations of my family were blown away by this terrific production ! ! ! ! The costumes , the music and the performances were all awesome , far more than we could have hoped for . <p> Our seats were perfect in the centre of Row F Royal Circle , 17 , 18 and 19 . <p> The amazing effects of a buffalo stampede on stage and the birds flying all over the venue , actors joining us on the Royal Circle , elephant sized elephants walking down the aisle , giraffe sized giraffes too , and a stage set that moves around so smoothly , I need to see it again to try and take all that in ! <p> I paid top whack for the seats to treat my 70 year old mum and 14 year old son but in total with travel and hotel it came to just under 400 and I would say even THAT was worth it . <p> It should be made compulsory to go see it . <p> Pam Coombs Stockport <p> I had bough the tickets for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had the tickets for 6 months . I had seen the show and loved it and he was eagerly looking forward to it as we had enjoyed our foray into the World of Disney in Florida last year . <p> Our tickets were just off the aisle in the stalls centre block on row E , well what a fantastic view we had ! ! Lots of legroom and a perfect view . The opening number is breathtaking with the rising sun and all the animals arriving on stage and down the aisles . The costumes and staging are so good that the opening number is quite moving . <p> To turn an 80 minute childrens cartoon film into a full-blown musical is an achievement in itself , but to do it in such an inventive way , and for it to still maintain its own identity , is all down to its creator , Julie Taymor . The staging is so imaginative and its great that they did n't  revert to the " cuddly animal outfits " as they could so easily have done . <p> We both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole production is very colourful and the animals superbly represented . All the performances were excellent and there were some lovely voices on stage but special mention goes to the actress playing Rafiki as she was very funny and portrayed her character very well . <p> We both agreed that this was an excellent show and we had had a marvellous time revisiting our childhoods ! ! We would definitely see the show again and are planning to take our 3 nieces to see it as they would love it . <p> Messrs Colin and Asa Mccarthy-Burton <p> Wow ! Outstanding , the costumes , rhythm , energy ensured that we had a fantastic time ! The African chants added atmosphere and the performance was mesmerising . No complaints . <p> I went on Wednesday 10th May 2006 to see " The Lion King " and it was fabulous . The costumes were very vibrant and the singing was excellent . My view from Row C in the Dress Circle was great and at one point I also had a cast member singing near me ! ! ! The acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a must see show and I was sad when it ended . Full of little surprises here and there , the show is the best I have ever seen ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Richard Sellens <p> We sat in seats 33 and 34 , row A of the Upper ( top ) Circle . These are marked as partially restricted view ( lowest price ) because they have a rail in front of them . We just leaned on the ( dirty ) rail , and the view was perfect , though high up . Not worth it to buy any other seats in the same level at a more expensive price because we had the same view as everyone else . From reading the reviews , it seems as though the viewers who sat in the stalls had a better impression of the play than I did at the top . From up there , we could see layers of dirt and dust on all the wall stucco ornaments and the whole thing looked very shabby . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show itself was good , though the singing was not spectacular . <p> I think I had my hopes up for a spectacular show and was let down a little by my expectations . All in all a good night out , though I will not be going to see it again . <p> Roxana Surrey October 2006 . <p> We have just seen the Lion King . Oh dear what a disappointment , the theatre monkey 's review is about right . Only worth seeing for the visual effects . Incidentally , do they ever dust the decor at the theatre ? <p> Richard of Newbury <p> We saw the Lion King last week ( February 2007 ) , and it was just terrible compared with the first time we saw it about two years ago . Visually the costumes and the scenery looked great , and we could n't see any problems with dust or general upkeep of the theatre as other reviewers have mentioned ( at least where we were in the stalls ) . <p> It was the performance itself that was really lacking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it impossible to warm to them , even when we were able to hear what they were saying . The quality of the singing surprised us too , particularly Simba 's Dad and uncle . The big ensemble songs left us amazed last time we saw it , but we got the feeling on this occasion that the whole cast was simply going through the motions . <p> We had real problems hearing the words in a lot of the songs and even during the spoken scenes the actors were either too quiet ( usually ) or deafening . I asked one of the ushers if there was a sound problem and she said that this was how it usually was . We wondered whether we were alone in this , but after speaking to our neighbours in the interval they too said they had trouble making out the words . <p> It was a real shame as we were all looking forward to seeing this show again . It shows how much a show can change , and at almost 200 for the four of us we felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd recommend ' Mary Poppins ' or even ' Sound of Music ' over this experience . <p> Tom <p> We have just got back from London after seeing ' The Lion King ' on 10th April 2007 . I found this production almost faultless and do n't agree with any of the negative remarks posted here . I 'm very particular about sound quality and performance , but apart from Mustafa 's voice being a bit quiet in parts , this was an absolutely excellent show - full of colour , enthusiasm , fun , movement and great songs and was well worth the money . <p> The techniques used to bring the animals to life are superb and the whole production was very atmospheric . I recommend getting seats as close to the front as possible to really appreciate this show . We were in Row H of the stalls which was perfect . You do n't need a great book to create a great show and ' The Lion King ' is a fine example of this . It 's a fantastic show and great fun for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I took two coaches to Lion King about 4 years ago and we sat in the Stalls about 1/3rd back from the stage which was perfect . It was electric , vibrant , and exciting . Most of the group really liked it , some thought it the best show they had ever seen . We liked it so much we had to take our grandchildren . It cost an arm and a leg but we had stall seats on the left side and the look on our six year old grand-daughters face at her first London theatre show when the elephant walked past was worth the ticket price on it 's own . It was even more magical than the first time and the perfect days outing for us , a day that will stand out in our memories as one of the best ever . <p> Yesterday ( June 2007 ) I saw the show again , sitting in the back of the Dress Circle . The seats in row L are comfortable and there is sufficient leg room for even me at 6 ' 2 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see faces or expressions and the public involvement with the action is only for those in the stalls so you feel deprived in the circle . When you are quite close in the stalls you can make yourself look at the characters heads and believe in them . From the back of the circle you are mainly aware of the actor working the character which is not the same . At times I lost attention and even felt a little bored , however I put it down to the thought that you ca n't repeat a perfect experience and we did not have the best seats as we did before so there really was no comparison . <p> However on reading some of the comments on this website it seems many other felt the same as me in that some of the singing was not great ( rather on the harsh side ) and the jokes have been gone through so many times that they have lost their humour . I got the feeling they were just going through the motions yet again . <p> Perhaps it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or twice in our case ) and perhaps it is mainly the repeat customers who do n't enjoy it as much as the first time . I do n't think it lends itself to repeats in the way that Les Mis , Chicago , or The Sound of Music do . <p> I do have enough people who want to see Lion King to take a coach party again , so perhaps I should just book it and let them make up their own mind but I do think it has perhaps run it 's course - though I hope my group will prove me wrong . <p> Went to the 30th of June 2007 evening performance of ' The Lion King , ' and after all the praise I had heard for it was extremely disappointed . We were in Upper Circle row M seats 36 to 39 and the view was fine . <p> The lad playing Young Simba was dreadfully out of tune at some points and was drowned out by the audience at some points . A lot of the other actors/actresses were drowned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely amazing voice . <p> Found the effects pretty bad after all I had heard . Not sure if something went wrong during Mufassa 's death but it just looked stupid , if you had n't seen the film you would n't have known he fell from a rock . He ran up to it and just stood there and lifted his arm up . Scar then appeared and Mufassa just ran into the middle of the thing and fell . Must say the costumes were very clever , although did n't like the Timon costume as I felt the bright green distracted from the puppet . <p> Good for young kids , but just not my thing . <p> Saw ' The Lion King ' on Saturday 21st July 2007 , matinee performance . This is the third time Ive seen the show and thought it was still magical . The performances were great all the lead characters were spot on . No problems with sound at all . <p> We sat in the stalls Row A seats 13 , 14 and 15 . I felt a little sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head in her way . The main issue with being so close is that you miss some of the " low-down " action e.g. when the characters are lying down or crouching . I also saw the stage hands 3 or 4 times which was n't good ! ! If I went again , I would sit in the centre stalls about 6 to 10 rows back . <p> Terry Hurley <p> Saw this on Thursday 23rd August 2007 . Sat in seats J11 and 12 in the stalls . Excellent seats . Great legroom , superb view and you are next to the aisle in the centre block which means the animals parade past you at various points in the performance . Once again Theatremonkey 's green seat recommendation is spot on . There really is only one place to see this show and that is from the stalls . <p> One moan - 4 bottles of beer ( one each before the performance one each for the interval ) 16 ! ! Obscene ! How can they justify charging that ? Having already paid 55 each for seats that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ End theatres continue to rip off their audiences with drink prices . <p> Also another word about the theatre - we both thought it was in top condition although I have never sat in either circle so I ca n't comment about them . <p> What can I say ! Took a friend of mine who has never seen a West End show and she was blown away by the costumes and the sheer ingenuity of the animals . <p> This was my seventh visit having seen it in London and on Broadway . This was the best performance I have ever seen of this show . The whole thing was flawless . From the start when Africa is brought vividly and brilliantly to life , through the songs with wonderful singing and the African chants which add so much to the show itself and finally the end when Simba reclaims his kingdom - for the first time was in tears at the end . The company really were on top of their game . In particular the actress playing Rafiki was incredible - both presence , performance and voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them - Timon in particular . Saw the understudy for Scar who was excellent . <p> The opening when you see the giraffes for the first time and the moment Mufasa 's face appears during ' He Lives In You ' during the second act made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end . It was as mesmerising as always . The advertising says there is nothing else like it and that is so true . A fantastic theatrical experience . <p> Saw the show on Thursday 20th December 2007 . Seats H7 and H8 were fine . <p> Really enjoyed the imagination on display , costumes etc , and the " African " songs and singing . But why does the theatre employ a deaf sound engineer ? Without exception the sound system distorted the singer 's voices in every single song , particularly when they get to the bit where they like to belt the number out ( and every one of EJ 's songs has a moment like this ! ) . Worst of all , this means that you can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a pity ! <p> One reader notes that , " I just ca n't get over the way you are processed through the souvenir shop at the Lyceum ( for the Lion King ) .

As others have mentioned , the whole thing is looking so tired , they really need a cast change or something . It was such an amazing show when I first saw it a few years ago as it really did leave you spellbound ; now , I 'm afraid , only leaves you housebound ! ! <p> The actors say their lines far too fast - which means you miss some of the jokes - and they all have an air of ' oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ' The audience were n't responding to any of the jokes ( probably due to reasons already mentioned ) and could barely raise a hand to clap after each of the musical numbers , which I think is a crying shame and in such contrast to what I 've seen before . With tickets hitting 60 , I feel that audiences going along now are not getting the value for money as those in recent years . It 's time for an overhaul ... and soon ! ! <p> One other point , which I could n't fail to notice , was the actor who played Scar obviously had problems . He kept spraying everybody within 20 feet with spittle and when he was up on his ledge above the stalls ( thankfully the other side of the stage to me ) almost drowned the entire first few rows of the stalls as gallons of the stuff was pouring out of his mouth . It was absolutely vile ( I say with a rather sinister smile on my face ) . <p> We were sat in row B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close for this particular production as you get to see all the workings close up and all the fed up tired looking faces of the cast and all the puppets which are falling apart ; as well as a chance of getting a shower thanks to Scar ( I wondered why the conductor was wearing a shower cap ! ! ) Talking of the conductor , I 'm also glad I was n't sat further along the row towards the centre because my view would have been obstructed by the rather large head of the man himself , complete with Tina Turner hair do ! ! <p> I hope someone puts some life back into it again because this was once the ' cream of the crop ' and fear it will start sliding towards the pit of closure given the current climate in theatre land . <p> Sorry , I hate moaning about stuff ! ! <p> I would like to say that " The Lion King " was absolutely Brilliant ! ! ! ! , Real nice costumes , real good act ! ! !

I do n't get all the fuss is about . It 's not the most amazing thing I 've ever seen , but it still is good . I do n't think I 'd see it again , mainly because of the reason I think there is much better West End going on at the moment that I 'd rather see them again . However , having said that I do think the effects are incredible . <p> The whole cast dressed up as animals is beautiful and so clever , especially in the beginning . I think this is it 's good point , because personally the songs are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think does work . But I never liked the film , so maybe I hold grudges . I do think the costumes and scenery are the strongest of points . The cast is talented , but the songs do n't show off the best of their abilities . <p> Being based on Disney , it is almost childish where the song about ' No worries ' comes on . My maturity is showing . And also that reminds me , two kids starting running around during the middle of the performance . Fortunately the Usher had a word with the parents . However , after all my negative points , I did enjoy it . But my sister ( who saw it a few years ago ) was disappointed that it is not my favourite show , as it is hers . I only went to see it because she keeps going on about it . Everyone has to see it at least once to male their own opinion as it is a very mixed view show . It does have lots of humour in it , but again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the GRAND CIRCLE Row L seats 28 and 29 . I think the price is very very good for these seats , especially as they 're in the middle and you can see everything . Although in the stalls you get the cast walking right by you so you feel more included . But as I 'm not the biggest fan , I think these are the best seats as the view hardly changes in the grand circle where ever you sit and they 're the cheapest . The leg room is good , but be a bit careful if you 're 5ft 7 and above , because it can be a little uncomfortable . <p> So if I did n't put you off , get your tickets ( the cheap ones ) because you could be disappointed and I would n't want you to waste your money if that happened ! <p> I went to see " The Lion King " for the second time with my nephew and nieces on Sunday 23rd November 2008 , and it was absolutely fantastic . The costumes , acting , songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was expecting this time round , the current cast delivered what I 'll describe as a flawless production . The kids absolutely enjoyed it , and at one stage to my embarrassment and to everyone elses annoyance , they joined in the singing to the tunes of ' Ha Kuna Matata . ' <p> My only criticism was that the gift shop , which was a tad overpriced - what did I expect , you may ask ! Still we are living through a very unsympathetic recession . ; ) <p> Nevertheless a brilliant production and I can only recommend every man , woman and child to go and see this production and assimilate the beauty of artistry genius . <p> Also do n't  forget to take good company with you , it gives it that extra fun factor .

If you see anything on this list chalked on the main frame , scalpers are at work . <p> Best stuff goes in the first 15 mins , and the vast line moves rapidly . The booth accepts cash ( Sterling and Euros ) , MasterCard , Visa and Maestro / Switch , a British issued debit card . They do not take personal cheques , foreign currency ( except Euros ) or travellers checks . No arguments on seat locations either . It is first off the pile . Usually you get the first three rows of Stalls , or the ends of the first ten , and single people get the best deal the monkeysite finds . <p> REMEMBER : <p> Try the booth if you are flexible and always check it before buying anywhere else on the day . It is also worth checking the ' Never Get ' notice on arrival in London to rule out certain shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of available shows is also available online at www.tkts.co.uk , which will give some idea of what is on sale before you arrive , and which shows are never sold there . <p> Also note that on " film premier " days at the various cinemas on Leicester Square , you may have to approach the booth from another direction . Ask a police officer for advice and be prepared to walk around the " long way " ( often via an access road from Orange Street ) if necessary . <p> The booth is also equipped as a Ticketmaster Agency outlet , selling advance tickets for all shows and events at agency prices with booking fees . In Leicester Square it may be cheaper to walk to the theatre concerned to make a purchase . <p> In 2011 a " Loyalty Card " was launched . 6 purchases , stamped on a collectors ' card , will give you 3 off your next purchase . A draw for theatre tokens is also included with each card . Ask at the theatre booth for details . <p> Other Ticket BoothsThere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few genuine ones . <p> Many of the genuine booths are owned by the same companies that offer discounts online - and will often do a deal on tickets for that day , to get rid of stock the company have and ca n't sell . They will also usually have access to the same advance ticket offers that companies put online - useful if you are travelling without computer access . <p> Speaking to somebody - either at the theatre or ticket agency - will incur a booking fee , and sometimes the fee will be less online ( check both sources if you can ) . <p> The box office will always be cheapest if buying a " full price " ticket , though , as they impose the lowest booking fee . <p> Theatremonkey.com always lists the box office telephone number before any others . <p> A reader offers the following advice if you are buying your ticket over the telephone direct from the box office , by quoting an advertised special offer reference to them : " Always state your preferred seat locations first without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only when the price is stated should you then say that " I have a special offer ! " . This invariably means getting a prime seat at a cheap price . I 've often found that if you state the offer FIRST then you get offered " second best " seats . Well , I suppose they want to sell the prime seats at full price wherever possible ! " <p> Once , when offers were a new concept , this was a really strong tip . Now , phoneroom staff really hate it as it causes them problems . Producers have become wise to it as discounts became common , and now often impose specific allocations or say certain seats can not be discounted . Being honest and friendly goes far further than this " trick " now , the monkey finds . <p> Otherwise , expect to pay 1 to 8 or so booking fee PER TICKET ! ! ! for buying from theatres ' own telephone or online reservations service . This is taking liberties , but a personal appearance at the box office costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes purple and pays . <p> Shop around for lower booking fees - some legitimate ticket agents will do a " no booking fee " deal on a particular show for a limited period , undercutting the box office <p> Check if there is a charge for postal bookings . Sometimes this saves money . An innocently mailed cheque , correct for the full face value of tickets , but not accounting for any booking fee , is seldom returned - especially if a stamped , self addressed envelope is included . This little ' booking fee oversight ' saves Theatremonkey banana cash quite often . Sadly , it is now being cracked down on by some , alas ... <p> Otherwise , aside from theatres with their own booking fees , legitimate booking agents normally add a maximum 25% above face value as a booking fee . Some have access to really excellent seats at short notice and Theatremonkey has been known to try pleasing a favourite Monkeyess with tickets from this source . <p> Please be aware that if an event is cancelled , refunds may be limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' booking fee ' not refunded . This applies particularly to pop concert events . <p> WORTH KNOWING : Be careful of operators buying up of website names that LOOK LIKE , BUT ARE NOT the official theatre website . For example , the official site to buy tickets from the Prince Edward Theatre is that of the owners - delfont-mackintosh.co.uk . A search engine result , though , brings up sites like " **26;274;TOOLONG " ( example , not an actual or genuine site ) before the official one in the listing . Sites like the fictional " **26;302;TOOLONG " are owned by agents - either STAR members , STAR sub-agents or even touts / scalpers . Whoever , they are NOT the box office website and you 'll pay more than you would via the official site . Theatremonkey advises strongly that you check exactly who you are booking through . On its listings pages , the monkey always shows the official sites first , followed by legitimate agents . It urges all guests to take care , as this trend is trapping even the wariest in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts may be available via the official website / networking pages of the show or ticket agents . Worth visiting them and poking around a little - the offers are not always easy to find , and may be hidden behind such links as " booking information " or " news on the show . " <p> Sometimes these are backed up by advertising on Google search engine . It can pay dividends to visit Google , enter a search such as the show 's title and / or " London Theatre " and see what appears both in the results list ... and the sponsored advertisements at the side of the page . <p> Marketing websites:Sites like www.hotticketoffers.com carry the latest ticket offers for Londons top entertainment online , or sign up for emails . Working with arts venues and theatres they send out weekly ticket offers for on-and-off West End theatre , dance , music , comedy etc . <p> App Todaytix - www.todaytix.com allows tickets to be bought in 30 seconds or less , one week to one hour before show time . Tickets are sold at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booking fees in the industry . <p> PreviewsPrior to the Opening Night when critics do their worst , the first few performances are at reduced rate - about 5 a seat less , or sometimes half price / " two seats for the price of one " . The absolute earliest performances of new work are sometimes cancelled at short notice , and if they go ahead , shows can be radically altered before opening and full price performances begin . Minimise this risk by attending the last preview possible . You 'll get a refund or chance to change your ticket to another performance ( if seats are available ) , but it may prove inconvenient to you of course . <p> AfternoonsAlso worth knowing is that , increasingly , tickets for midweek afternoon performances are being sold more cheaply . Sometimes this is a reduction in price ; at other times the seating plan is " re-drawn " to place more seats in a lower than usual price band . <p> Dynamic Price DiscountsSome theatre chains , including Ambassador and Delfont Mackintosh have " choose your own seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have . They also use " dynamic pricing " to change the price of tickets according to demand . Sometimes , this ( in the monkey 's opinion ) pathetic policy will sell you a really bad seat at a high price . Sometimes , you win ... <p> ... Check about 4 days before you want to go how seats are selling . You may already see a few seats in the rear stalls for less than the original price ( check monkey plans for those ) . Take another check on the next two days , and more cheap seats may emerge . On the day of the show , from 10am onwards , keep checking as often as you can - and when you see something good in the stalls for the price you 'd expect to pay for an upper circle seat ... pounce . <p> A reader also noted , in September 2015 , that he was offered far better seats , cheaper , by phone , than what was available online . In fact , the seats were online at a higher price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premium price " tickets just there for show , wonders the monkey ? <p> Free Tickets and FriendshipCharity " Shape Arts " is dedicated to helping elderly and disabled theatregoers attend events . They offer a service to help those either physically unable to attend alone , or who simply would like someone along with them for company . <p> These " companions " are all volunteers and the charity always needs more of them . As a volunteer , all expenses are paid - ticket , petrol , parking and congestion charges are all met AND you get to meet interesting new people too . Extra drivers are always most wanted . <p> A newsletter is also produced 4 times a year which goes out to some 1500 members , individuals and groups . To be eligible members are deaf , disabled or over the age of 70 . The newsletter has listings of theatre , musicals , opera , dance , concerts and other events . <p> If you are interested in volunteering , call 020 7619 6166 ( choose option 4 on the automatic menu ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust also has a " link up " scheme putting partially sighted or blind people in touch with voulenteer companions .

It literally means what it says - turn up on the night and pay as much as you can for your ticket at the door . Most venues do n't permit advance booking , and will only accept cash at these performances . Note too that it REALLY is n't polite , unless you are genuinely that hard up ( in which case , no problem , these nights really are for you and the monkey wishes you well ) , to drop a mere penny or even single pound coin into the tin in return for your ticket . As a guide , a sum at around the " concession " price at a normal performance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , a little more than the usual ticket price is very welcome indeed . Often , your extra donation helps keep the scheme going . <p> One scheme that does allow advance booking is the one at Theatre 503 in Battersea . They have a ' pay what you can Sundays ' scheme in operation . For more details , see http : //theatre503.com/ <p> Collect your tickets on the nightSome readers swear by this . If you opt to book direct with the venue ( rather than through a ticket agency ) by phone or online , and say you 'll collect your tickets from the box office counter ( the " will call " window to New Yorkers ! ) then sometimes you get a nice surprise . Box office staff sometimes " upgrade " tickets on a quiet evening , and as you are a customer of the venue rather than a ticket agency , you could be first in line ... Does n't work on busy shows , but if it 's quiet ... <p> Trade in for an offerAgain , some readers swear by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow audiences to exchange tickets for another date for a very small admin fee , they book direct with the venue ( rather than through a ticket agency ) by phone or online , and say they will collect tickets from the box office counter on the day . <p> They then keep an eye out for ticket offers . On spotting a good one , they can easily cancel the ticket , pay the exchange fee , and use the credit to re-book at a far lower price . By not having the ticket in their possession , they do n't have to return it to the box office first . <p> Showsavers / Theatrenet / Gr8tix / Hit The Theatre Venerable website www.theatrenet.com has discounts for those willing to register with the site . The same page can also be reached with the address www.showsavers.co.uk . <p> Gr8tix is the junior version of this company . It offers discounts for children and young adults . Offer types include " 2 tickets for 8 ( so the accompanying adult comes free ) " , " 1 free ticket with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free ) " , " member and accompanying adult come free " and also some tickets available to 19 to 21 year old students . Register online for them at **26;330;TOOLONG <p> Hit The Theatre is the first online site targeting youth aged between 16 and 28 . It offers cheap tickets to many productions , and has an ambassador scheme to introduce theatre to this audience .

There 's also a scheme run by them for young deaf people at AccessTheatre45 - free to join , offering three events a year at captioned or BSL interpreted West End theatre productions . Young deaf people can sign up via the website , and will then be invited to events via email and text . <p> Prompttickets.co.uk is a service run by Ambassador Theatre Group for students , offering a range of tickets for that night . On sale from 12 noon until 3pm daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other Clubs Subsidised companies like the Royal National Theatre , Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal Court , charge around 15 per year to have performance schedules mailed to your home . You get priority booking before the public ( essential for some shows ) , and discounted ticket offers . These include a chance to attend premieres at very low cost . <p> Whatsonstageare about the most comprehensive London Theatre resource on the internet . It often features very good ticket deals . The Whatsonstage Theatregoers ' Club ( click above advertisement for details ) offers an astounding range of benefits from cheap tickets to allocations at sold out shows to discounts at restaurants and car parks even when not attending a show . <p> The Ambassador Theatre Group run a scheme called ' ATG Theatre Card ' offering discounts and priority booking for 30 per year . Details at http : //www.atgtickets.com or on 020 8544 7424 . Delfont Mackintosh Theatre Priority **27;358;TOOLONG is another scheme run by a Theatre owner . A reader says , " I 'd also recommend that people get an ATG theatre card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some really great discounts and the card is only 30 pounds for a year ( 2014 ) . " <p> Newspapers including the Times , Sunday Times , Guardian and Telegraph run theatre clubs . Modest ( or even free ) membership fees allow readers to take advantage of special offers published in those journals . <p> www.mymail.co.uk run by the Daily Mail , often has exclusive ticket offers for club members . <p> www.theaudienceclub.com : Less than a pound a week entitles members to see a constantly changing list of fringe ( plus some West End venues ) for previews of productions for just 2 each . Get in before the critics ! <p> Actor 's fan clubs may also make offers , either on their websites , Social Networking pages or Twitter feeds . <p> " Amazon Prime " : If you have this with Amazon.co.uk , it offers a range of benefits including priority booking , access to lounges at some venues etc . <p> ShowPairs Twofers to New Yorkers . These vouchers give two tickets for the price of one . Pick them up in hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A range of stuff is offered , similar to Leicester Square , but with the luxury of advance booking . <p> Showpairs vouchers are also issued for " Meal and Show " deals - get two of those for the price of one , and as " buy one show , get one show free . " Also straightforward discount vouchers - a price reduction rather than " two for one " are sometimes made available too . <p> Visit www.showpairs.co.uk for more information . Note : This company can only offer vouchers to corporations with more than 20 employees . It does not deal directly with individuals . <p> GroupsPut together a group of 10+ and save up to 50% . The bigger the group , the lower the price and if not , negotiate . Theatremonkey does and it sometimes works . Extra special rates often apply for schoolchildren and Senior Citizen parties at midweek matinees . <p> Play the theatre and group booking specialist companies off against each other for prices , as both rates and seat locations on offer vary . It is your cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not careful . <p> The monkey has also found that the theatre 's own box office are likely to keep good seats back to sell themselves - so if location is important , it could well be worth trying them first ( and you should still get a reasonable discount , too ) . <p> Tickets For Troops If you serve / have served in HM Armed Forces from the 2001 Afghanistan conflict onwards , you are eligible for this scheme which says " Thank You " from the entertainment industry . Theatremonkey.com would like to be associated with that sentiment too of course . See **27;387;TOOLONG for details . <p> Local Coach TripsIf you can not put your own group together , some coach tour companies within fifty miles of London run public inclusive trips combining a ticket with transport from their local area . These companies often schedule well ahead and will have bought great seats at group rates in anticipation of a new hit show . The result is a package for less than the price of a ticket alone . They have fifty coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel a little way out of town ; see a new place in the day then join them for the trip . If staying in the West End just politely tell the driver you will not be returning with the coach to the starting point after the show . The Society of Ticket Agents &amp; Retailers website has a list of approved operators , and local operators often advertise in their regional newspapers too . <p> Parking : Not strictly a ticket saving tip , but many box offices allow you to obtain a car park space , at a discount , along with your show seats . The " Theatreland Parking Scheme " may be available at car parks near may West End venues . Call Q-Park car parks on 0870 442 0104 or see http : //www.q-park.co.uk for details . At this car park , parking under the " Theatreland Parking Scheme " allows a 50% discount in cost . Spaces CAN NOT be reserved at these prices , though . <p> If you choose the " Theatreland Parking Scheme " , you must get your car park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatre attendant will insert the car parking ticket into a small machine which updates the information held on the magnetic strip on the reverse , thus enabling the discount ) . When you pay using the machines at the car park , 50% will be deducted from the full tariff . You may park for up to 24 hours using this scheme and it is endorsed by the Society of London Theatre . <p> Complementary Seats Free tickets . Given to friends of the cast if lucky . Also dished out to Group Organisers ( see above ) , to the bitterest complainers to theatre managers , and to those in agencies , on mailing lists , in the tourist industry , nurses , police and armed services etc , etc . Check your place of work . Also given to those who invest in the play , but lashing out 1000 or so for two tickets seems a little extreme . <p> Reader Brin suggests that , <p> " If you can find out when an agency night is , then hang round the front of house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Find out where they are from , even talk to them , chat them up a bit and just ask if there are any spare un collected tickets just before the show starts . <p> You can do the same thing during the interval - there are lots of people who have been given freebies but leave at half time , just ask them for their tickets ! " <p> An interesting approach feels the monkey , and an interesting wheeze indeed . <p> Print Listings The Sunday Times and London Evening Standard particularly , carry adverts offering discounts on major shows at quieter times of the year - in London generally Midwinter to late Spring , excluding Bank Holiday periods . These range from 50% off to two for one offers by quoting a reference at the box office . <p> Sunday Times offers are found in the ' Culture ' section . London Evening Standard offers are found particularly in the Thursday ' Hot Tickets ' supplement ( inside the front cover is a notable position ) , and around the ' Theatre Listings ' section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra offers on Fridays and during school vacation periods . Also check the Evening Standard website " Theatre Club " . <p> Listings magazine ' Time Out ' also carries some offers , not just in it 's theatre listings section but scattered throughout the magazine and buried at the foot of feature articles . These are worth looking out for . It also runs a " Premiere Club " with extra offers for members . Look out for the " free " membership offer on the website . <p> Oyster CardsLondon Transport sometimes give holders of their ' Oyster ' electronic travel cards a chance to buy cheap tickets at www.tfl.gov . Other variations include combined meal/show packages where you get dinner in a decent restaurant plus a ticket for the price of a ticket alone . Again , details are on the current special offers page . <p> Gift Voucher PromotionsA number of companies , including the Society of London Theatre ( SOLT ) sell Gift Vouchers ( Gift Certificates ) which can be exchanged for tickets . <p> They often run promotions where you get an extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save 10% ! <p> To purchase , see www.theatretokens.com 24/7 or call Tokenline 0844 887 7878 Monday to Friday during office hours and all orders are dispatched by first class post on the following business day . They are also available through a network of retails including all participating Theatres , WHSmiths , Waterstones and many Tourist Information Centres . <p> Become a JudgeEvery year the Society of London Theatre appoint members of the public to the panel which makes the annual Laurence Olivier Awards . Panelists get a pair of free ( not always good ) seats to every opening that year . For a true theatre buff this is a big saving , but also a real commitment . <p> Use an AccountantSeriously . If you are self-employed and have anything to do with the entertainment or tourism / hospitality industry , you should be able to claim a tax allowance on tickets you buy , travel and eating at the show , even the clothes you wear ( and laundering ) , electricity used to book the tickets etc . A 20% discount for going about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out that the Royal Bank of Scotland " Royalties International " Account comes with the benefit of both hotel and theatre ticket discounts when you book using their services . Savings of up to 25% are possible . More information at www.rbsint.com or call 01534 285536 . <p> Other banks may offer similar discounts through their accounts - worth checking out , feels the monkey . <p> Restricted View SeatsAlways sold cheap - the price formula is : seat price reduced in proportion to area of stage visible e.g. 50% viewable = 50% discount off price of nearest full view ticket . Sometimes a pillar is the problem . This monkey though has got great , cheap seats half under the stage where eccentric set design has overhung the front row . <p> Restricted view seats are officially not sold anywhere except from the box office directly , usually over the counter to personal callers who can be shown the seats on the seating plan or even be taken into the auditorium to view them . This prevents a customer claiming ' we were not told these were restricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also kept secret and prices not generally displayed or circulated . Theatremonkey features those it can on the site , but advises double checking with the box office to see if extra seats have been added after the play opened . Producers sometimes do this when the final staging has been settled and the impact from each seat assessed .. <p> The best way to book a restricted view seat in advance is to call the box office or theatre chain call centre and ask for the seat by precise number . If you show you know what you are talking about , clerks will generally sell the seats to you in advance . <p> It may , however , take pressure to get these seats . Often box offices will deny all knowledge of cheap seats in the expensive parts of the theatre until all the really cheap , grotty tickets have been sold . Stand up to them and get closer to the stage for less cash , even if you do not see the whole of it ! <p> Theatremonkey feels it better to be close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ants from the balcony - but decide for yourself which you prefer . <p> The Premium Seat SwerveAs online booking becomes more sophisticated the official theatre 's own website often manipulates the price of remaining seats . This " dynamic pricing " means that a 20th row ticket , normally sold at the " standard top price " of 60 suddenly becomes a " premium " seat for 90 in case a Russian Oil Tycoon is trying to see a show that week , presumably . If only a few seats are left in the " top price " area , and all have been increased to " premium , " the monkey 's " Premium Seat Swerve " suggests that you have a look at official Society of Ticket Agents &amp; Retailers ticket agency websites . <p> These may have odd tickets remaining in the same area too ... and are unlikely to have increased the price to " premium . " True , many will charge a far higher booking fee than the box office ( 10% to 25% ) BUT the total bill will still be lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location could be better too . <p> Worth a try if the show is almost sold out , feels the monkey . <p> The Upper Circle Trick Buy the cheapest ticket in the Upper Circle or Balcony . On a quiet night the theatre will close them , and you will be promoted to the costlier seats downstairs . This works on less popular shows only of course ! <p> REMEMBER THOUGH : This is your money . If you hold a front row ticket with a good view in the Upper Circle , do n't be fobbed off with a rear Dress Circle seat with a lesser command . Argue and move . <p> Sometimes a theatre will refuse to sell a ticket in the Upper Circle over the telephone , claiming them to be ' unavailable ' . This often means that the staff have been told not to sell the tickets in order to push the more expensive seats first . Turn up on the night and you should be able to buy those ' unavailable ' tickets over the counter , and then be moved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance , simply telephone an agency . If they can offer Upper Circle seats at box office price , buy - you stand a good chance of getting moved to better seats on the night . <p> Reader Rich adds , " A cunning tactic , if you book through a company that enables you to see the seating plan , is to work out if a show is a sellout or not ! If it 's half full , buy cheap and get upgraded ! ) . " <p> Risky , but may work , feels the monkey . <p> In 2012 , another reader reported that she turned up to take her third tier Balcony seat , and was offered an upgrade to " best available " seats elsewhere for 10 per person . She declined , but wondered if it was common . Monkey has never had that happen , but notes it as an extension of the concept . <p> The Upper Circle Trick SquaredObserved by a reader in November 2011 : " We were in Balcony ( third tier , highest in the venue ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a decent view so offered value for money ... We saw somebody spin a yarn that they were ' scared of heights ' to get a move from the Balcony to the Stalls - that 's what happened with 2 people minutes before our performance began . They knew what to expect , booking Balcony seats , and had sat there for 30 minutes prior without any complaint ... Not bad for earning a free upgrade ! GRRR : ( " <p> The monkey agrees , and indeed alerted the venue to this ruse ... <p> The Moving Forward TrickIf the Upper Circle or Balcony is likely to be kept open , and your pockets are deeper , buy the cheapest seat in the Stalls or Dress Circle and move forward to an unoccupied seat . Having an aisle seat makes this easier . <p> Moving forward to unoccupied seats is frowned on . You may well be asked to move back , if the management have not specifically given you permission - but it does pay to ask an usher if you can move , about a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems less frowned on after the interval , but the foregoing still stands . <p> You may well end up stuck in your original seat , and at worst be surrounded by those who paid less and got moved downstairs via the Upper Circle Trick . Theatremonkey does not find this method pans out , though friends say it does , and it helps to pretend you do not understand English if asked to move . <p> In 2016 , a reader observed , " Unfortunately , quite a few of the premium centre stalls seats remained empty , and a few cheeky patrons snuck into row K a minute or two before the start ( with the online seating plan showing availability displayed on his phone screen ! ) " <p> All too sneaky for Theatremonkey 's liking , but not as sneaky as ... <p> ... Downright Dishonest - No responsibility taken if you try this stuff . Details are for FUN ONLY and are NOT ENDORSED OR ENCOURAGED BY THE WRITER or WEBSITE . <p> Walking in at halftime , after mixing with the smoking crowd in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not often checked after the interval , so drift into the theatre auditorium with the crowd , wait till the last second then head for a ( hopefully ) unsold and thus empty , seat . You do of course see only half the show , but it serves you right as this is straight stealing and you deserve your starring role next day in court . Strangely this trick works for sold out shows as people always leave at half time and scalpers unsold stock leave seats empty . <p> Fake I 'd Cards proving eligibility for discounts can be bought from mail order ads / manufactured on computer / produced using transfer letters . This is ' obtaining financial advantage by deception ' and carries a hefty prison sentence . It also breaches the goodwill of producers who make these offers , spoiling things for the genuine . <p> Joining an evening class at a local college often yields a student I 'd card . For a theatre studies student , monkey guesses it is OK to use , but square your own conscience if you are learning macramT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find the savings more than cover the cost of enrolment . They never show for a class ' cos they are always at the theatre . <p> My friend forgot is another criminal deception . You really are a student , your friend is n't . Ask for seats , and if a card is required , produce one , then make a great search for the other . Usually the kind clerk will let you have the ticket anyway . <p> Just asking for a discount , if you look student age or distinguished grey can sometimes get you a seat without a card even being asked for . Criminal , yeah , but in this case you were n't asked so a 50/50 responsibility maybe ? <p> My Mother is in there with the tickets can get you past the checks . You may or may not be sought out when you do n't reappear , and ejected . Theft again . So do n't try it . <p> Use an old ticket as few staff check all the details . If the theatre name and style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of the rest . A nasty deception . Do not do it . <p> Make a ticket For the computer literate . Scan an old ticket in , alter , and hey presto - three years for forgery on top of your prison sentence for theft and deception . Not worth it and do not try it .

She did not keep this opinion to herself and shared it very loudly with the lady next to her in full earshot of the cast ( small theatre ' in the round ' so it is essential to be respectful ! - you should of course be respectful at all times , but I think the smaller theatres make it all the more necessary ! ) . " <p> Scary , thinks the monkey ... who hopes it will not mutate into one of them ... particularly after the following tale from Monkey site regular Jake Brunger about " Beautiful Thing " ( Sound Theatre , August 2006 ) : " About 30 seconds before a show started an incredibly old woman walked into the auditorium in a big heavy grey coat - bearing in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost exclusively gay men , could n't stop muttering about her and how odd it was that a very old woman should come and see " Beautiful Thing " ( of all things ) on her own . Anyway , she takes her seat ( in the premium section ) and the show begins . <p> As the interval is about to end , there 's a commotion around the old woman with the two men in front and there are two ushers talking to her pointing at the side stalls . We assume that she 's not supposed to be sitting in the premium section . An old man , around her age , has appeared in the side stalls during the interval too , who was n't there in the first half . The woman , despite the fact numerous people are talking to her , looks squarly ahead and ignores them . Everyone else in the theatre is watching nothing else but this unfolding scene in the seats . Eventually , they get her to move , and everyone is laughing and a few people make boo-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been moved out of the expensive seats . <p> As soon as the lights begin to dim for second act , the old lady gets up from the side stall seat she 's been moved to and moves back to her premium seat ! Everyone is laughing , a few people start clapping , but the two men in front are absolutely livid and one of them runs straight out of their seats to fetch an usher - bearing in mind that actors and audience share the space to get to their seats at Sound , so everyone is watching what 's going to happen with this woman , no-one cares about the play ! Anyway , the guy comes straight back sits down and the play begins - but the actors must have been wondering what on earth was going on ! <p> Afterwards I could n't not ask the guys in front what the problem was - we were so curious - and apparently the old woman had leant forward repeatedly in the first act to ask him to stop laughing so much ! And it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! <p> It was just hysterical though - I was shaking with laughter for the first 2 minutes of the second act ! " <p> While the monkey applauds the attempt at fighting back by the people in front , it was worried that such resistance proved so futile ... <p> T-Shirt United : The people who wear shirts advertising the musicals they have seen . <p> Humour Bypass : Theatre programmes are dull little things . Sometimes directors insert something quirky to liven them up . The monkey has actually watched a seller abused because the reader mistook a joke for a misprint ! <p> Seat Squatter : Double bookings happen . When they do , give in and let us all get on with the show . The box office manager knows who is entitled to sit in a seat and their word goes . Abide by it , and do not abuse the person who gets the seat , the double booking is not the customer 's fault . <p> Iron Man Theatregoer : Been in that " Day Seat " line since 10.30pm the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Vic in 2014 , the monkey was told . They do it for thrill when the box office opens and they know they 've really EARNED that cheap ticket . " Hats Off " to them , says the monkey . <p> Himoff : Theatres have to employ stars to keep the shows going . You AND the rest of the audience will recognise them when they appear . Please restrain yourselves from an instant comment on their physical appearance and career - you can discuss it at the interval . In the meanwhile , please shut up during the actual performanceplease ! <p> Plot Losers : If you do n't know what is going on , wait until the curtain goes down before asking . Do not ask during a quiet passage of music or a dramatic pause . They are there for dramatic effect . Not for the hopelessly confused to catch up . <p> Snack food eaters : Why eat sweets during the show ? You just lose the plot ( see above ) and annoy everyone with the unwrapping noises . Unless you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Reader Zoe says , " The couple next to me arrived with 2 full packs of Haribo and a full box of celebrations . I had to endure both acts with the man next to me chewing loudly and his consistent noisy sweet unwrapping . I do n't think I have ever had to deal with it quite as badly and ' The Elephant Man ' is a sensitive and beautiful play , so it 's not as if it was muffled by an orchestra ! " <p> Reader Rosie noticed that , " At the beginning of Batboy ( Shaftesbury Theatre 2004 ) , along with the usual announcement to ask the audience to turn off their mobile phones , there is always the request for people to unwrap any sweets they have as the performance is about to start . Not only does this tend to get a laugh , it actually works - there 's very little disturbance ( except for laughter ) from the audience during the show ! " <p> Sadly , some people just do n't get the message . Reader Vincent writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average once a month , and have done so for the past four years . I 'm happy to report I have rarely encountered any problems on any score , and have found the front of house staff for the most part beyond excellent . <p> I do feel I ought to inform people of one notable exception . I was at a performance of One Flew Over The Cuckoo 's Nest at the Gielgud recently ( January 2005 ) , and after having splashed out on top-price seats , we had our evening ruined by the people sitting next to us who were noisily and consistently unwrapping individual sweets ( incidentally bought at the theatre , but do n't get me started on that one ! ) and talking rather loudly , all of which would have been very audible from on-stage . <p> After politely asking them to wait until the interval , they got very aggressive . Finding no ushers to be stationed anywhere near the front stalls , and being a duty manager in a theatre myself , I asked to speak to the duty manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able nor willing to do anything about it . The verbal bullying from the people next to us continued throughout Act 2 . <p> I wrote to the Really Useful Group , and received a similarly unsympathetic reply . I am still baffled , I know from experience how fussy and awkward audiences can be , and how they complain about the smallest thing , but I really thought this was a legitimate issue that needed addressing , and I found the level of customer service incredibly lacking . It 's not as if the Really Useful Group do n't have the power to deal with this kind of complaint , or indeed ca n't afford to offer some compensation for a ruined evening . <p> I know that if I or any staff working at our theatre had treated an audience member in that way , we 'd rightly have been disciplined " <p> The first example of a " snack food eater insider collaborator " wonders the monkey ... worse , one reader reports after-effects : " a gentleman next to me proceeded to belch his way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever - nice ! " <p> Hedda Wobbler : Something wrong with the neck , but no surgical collar . Consequently the head wobbles constantly - side to side and up and down ... just when you think you can see past ... off it goes in a new direction ... <p> At " The Elephant Man " in 2015 , reader Zoe says , " I am not sure what was going on in front of me but I had a woman who would not stop moving . The rake is really good in the royal circle and she kept leaning forward for no reason . I also noted she kept borrowing her partner 's glasses for brief moments so I wonder whether it was an eyesight thing . But the bobbing up , down and side to side was tiring for me having to dodge but also not to move too much myself to distract the people in front of me ! " <p> The Human Joystick : Does n't just lean forwards , but also sideways and backwards . Disconcerting to say the least . <p> Orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for the monkey - people tapping out a tune on the back of your seat . The monkey would add Cap'n Kangaroo Impersonators:Those behind you who insist on kicking your seat during the performance . The tall who are trying to shift around to get comfortable are excused ... to everyone else ... " get lost , Skippy ! " . Brin also spotted the species " Leg rest Larry " - people who use the seat in front as a foot rest , and , worst of all , " Vigilante Critic " - someone playing with a cigarette lighter during the performance ! He notes that , " I just could n't believe it , I called the fireman ( theatre safety officer , not the London Fire Brigade ) . <p> Wrong Door Drongos : There is a good reason why doors to the auditorium are marked with seat numbers . West End theatres are confined spaces . Those who make an error have to clamber over half the theatre to make the correction . Unless you happen to be a wildly attractive monkey / monkeyesse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your efforts . The monkey also criticises the stupid ushers who do not spot , and re-direct , these idiots . <p> A reader notes that : " An addition to the Wrong Door Drongos are those who forget how to count and the rudiments of the alphabet when trying to find their seats and they never seem to have their tickets to hand . I always put things like this down to people who a " too cool to read signs . <p> Some booking offices ( especially the Lyttelton at the National ) seem to have a knack of identifying the people who are going to arrive first and always give them the seats nearest the aisles ! " <p> The monkey absolutely agrees with the above . Selective memory protected it by " blotting out " these types when initially writing the article ! It was glad to be reminded . <p> Another reader , Gillian , has been able to conduct more extensive research into the matter and was actually able to recognise the scientific principles at work here . Her important results are as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowing who latecomers will be and selling them tickets in the middle of rows . <p> I believe this is actually a Law of the Theatre , known as ' Lloyd-Webber 's Law of Temporal Positioning ' . This states that " People who arrive earliest are always those with seats on the end of a row . People who arrive latest are always those with seats in the middle . " <p> Further to this , there is ' Mackintosh 's Corollary ' , which states " People who arrive after the performance has started will always have seats in the middle of a row . " <p> The monkey strongly feels that a Nobel nomination is warranted . <p> TV Refugee : The person who spends their nights in front of the television , but then suddenly decides to have a night out at the theatre . Great , theatremonkey welcomes you . Just please remember : you are sharing your viewing experience with two hundred or so others in your seating section . They would appreciate a little decorum ! <p> One reader reports that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen it all ! ! I was at Anything Goes on a Saturday in March 2004 . A man in row H of the stalls had a tiny portable television , it was ON - ( he did have headphones ) he was watching the rugby ! ! ! ! " <p> The monkey weeps , quietly , while with great concentration it bangs its head against a convenient wall ... <p> " The audience members who fail to see the significance of the first row of the upper circle being MUCH cheaper than any other rows behind it ... <p> If anyone 's had the misfortune to pay " only 15 for a front row seat " they will have soon realised because of the angle of the seats to the stage you can only see the top half of the stage - so how do they combat this ? By leaning over as far forwards as they can and blocking the view of every single other person sitting in the five rows behind them ! Surely there should be a sign telling them to remain seated instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after paying out the huge amount to see " Phantom Of The Opera " I was annoyed when this happened to me , but the very courteous and professional usher told the offending members to " stay seated or they would be asked to leave " . When the audience members complained that they could n't see the usher merely replied sweetly : " that 's why these good people paid the full 35 and you did n't . " It made my day ! " <p> Louise is right thinks the monkey . A bargain is only a bargain when you get a good seat cheaply . You mostly get what you pay for , though , because that is how theatres decide on pricing ! <p> Perching ( or , in monkey 's case , swinging ) on a seat is unfair to the people behind you , dangerous ( email monkey for the full joke ) , and uncomfortable . If people would only think before buying , they could save both money and inconveniencing everyone . <p> Front row ExhibitionistsA sub-species of the dipstick ( above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Acorn Antiques - The Musical ' - I was lucky enough to be on the front row and seeing actors like Julie Walters , Celia Imrie and Sally Ann Triplett from that view point was great , especially as it was a ( very expensive ) birthday present ! One woman sat two seats down from me laughed out loud throughout almost the entire show and it was very forced laughter - it appeared that she was trying to get the attention of Julie Walters . In the end , she did get it because Julie actually lost her place in the number and had to stop and make a joke of it . That woman spoiled the experience for me and I 'm sure many others , I am glad the show is on DVD so I can watch in peace ! " <p> Why do people leave their deathbeds to go to the theatre ? They arrive , snivelling through the performance , coughing at all punchlines/dramatic scenes , quiet patches and whenever they are SURE to be heard and annoy at the same time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of coughing at the theatre - even more than in Sydney . Perhaps its because at some concerts and plays I have been to here cough sweets are handed out free at the door . <p> The answer is simple . Dickens evoked the magic of the theatre wonderfully well . At that time the poor were also often rife with chest illnesses , yet they attended the theatre anyway . These unpopular figures are simply devoted historians , dedicated to sharing with us all the pleasure of theatregoing in a bygone age ... <p> Actually , the reason is probably that a ) they considered themselves fit to go and b ) they could not get a refund on the tickets . Oh dear ! <p> Reader Zoe says , at " The Elephant Man " ( 2015 ) , A row in front of a " hedda wobbler , " we had one of these . Coughing ... I noted a woman sitting in the central section constantly looking over before the show started at the coughing offender and roll her eyes ! <p> The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mewett as the ones who during the show say ' That did n't happen last time ' or ' She wore blue eye shadow last time , not green ' or other annoying little nitpicks like that . <p> The watch-losers:Another invaluable identification from Kyrsty who defines them as those who wander in ten minutes late and either make no attempt to stay out of the way of other audience members , or half heartedly crouch down when wandering to their seat , looking the whole time at the stage . Hey - we want to see it too you know ! <p> Reader Zoe says , at " The Elephant Man " ( 2015 ) , adds , " Fortunately they did n't block my view but it was so distracting and they missed an amazing part of the show . I wish more theatre 's would adopt the policy Wyndham 's Theatre had for " American Buffalo , " and not let in latecomers until the interval . It would definitely persuade people to leave with enough time to get to venues . I appreciate that public transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatres ' discretion however transport seemed fine the other evening ! " <p> Pongo Sticks:Identified by a reader who noted that : " The strength and amount of perfume on the woman next to me ! My partner and myself both left the theatre with headaches and feeling sick ! " <p> The monkey normally finds mothballs the worst , but it knows the perfume problem too ! <p> Cheapskate Child Hater:Reported by reader Andrew Arvidson at a performance of " Chitty Chitty Bang Bang " : " Shame on the curmudgeon who bought cheap seats to a family show and then hissed and growled and the young members of the audience who were expressing delight at the performance . While I 've been to shows were young children were a negative ( a very bored and vocal young lady at " Kiss Me Kate " springs to mind ) ; this was not such an occasion . " <p> If you are going to see a show aimed at children , well , what do you expect , feels the monkey ! ? <p> Trainee Hatcheck Staff:So keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their free time . When you arrive at your seat to find a neatly stacked pile of coats already on it , you know that you are seated next to a member of this community . Storing outwear and other belongings tidily is an art , so do excuse the resentful looks as they are forced to destroy their masterpieces ... a little understanding goes a long way in this world . After all , it could well have been their coursework for their hatcheck examinations that they were forced to dismantle ! <p> The Bog Trotters:Reader Lucy Bacon has spent many hours studying this species in the field , and reports a number of varieties : " The ' Lone Ranger ' - Someone who decided not to go to the loo before the show , decides halfway though the first or second act that they need to go and ca n't be bothered to wait , and therefore brazenly strides across the front of the auditorium to get to the nearest loo , fully aware that both the actors on stage and the entire stalls section can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' similar to the Lone Ranger but is more aware of their predicament and so stoops lightly as to not obscure our view , but does anyway . <p> And our last in this motley crew is ' Silver . ' Again similar predicament to the Lone Ranger but takes it upon themselves to squat incredibly low and try to run to the loos and back to their seats , I presume to prevent the entire audience seeing them , but they needed have bothered because we do ! Perhaps we could also remind theatre goers , that across the front of the stalls is not the only way to get to toilets ! <p> I 've witnessed all the above 3 audience members , I find that ' silvers ' tend to be teenagers and children , although it is quite amusing seeing older people do the ' stoop and sprint ' and it seems like Tonto 's are in short supply , perhaps because they are more likely to ' hold on ' till the interval than face the wrath of the rest of the audience . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectacular one at " We Will Rock You " who was so open about her clear bladder weakness that the member of the cast on stage at the time stopped what he was doing and watched her cross the front of the auditorium ! Cue lots of laughs and you would 've thought an embarrassed Lone Ranger , alas she used exactly the same route to get back to her seat , I guess some people never learn ! " <p> Flashbulb Harrys and Harriets:Identified by reader Adam , who reports , " After an otherwise fantastic night at the ROH last week though I think that you 're missing a category -the people who think that the best way to preserve a memory of the show is to take a photograph - with flash ! - DURING THE PERFORMANCE ! " Swan Lake " was beautiful , but I think the lighting was working perfectly well without the addition of camera flashes from the balcony . " <p> Totally agree , is the monkey opinion . It would also point out yet again that without specialist film , photos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out , and the flash can be EXTREMELY dangerous to the performers on stage . <p> Seat AnimatorsDiscovered by a visitor to Wembley arena , who says : " I thought it might be good to mention something about the Central Arena Seating which bugged me when I saw Dolly Parton on 25th March 2007 . Sitting in the second row of block A3 ( seats 17 and 18 ) we were joined by to teenage boys , which I was not in the slightest bothered by as you get everyone at concerts . Well the teenage boy that was sitting right next to me decided it would be good to continuously shake his leg up and down with the music ( which again is fine by me ) but in A3 , because the seats are detachable , all of our 4 seats were attached and with his shaking came constant rocking back and forth of the seating . So it might be worth mentioning this . " <p> Brings a whole new meaning to " shake , rattle and roll " thinks the monkey , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add those who kick the seats in the row in front to the list of folk who unwittingly animate the furniture ... <p> It gets worse , though , as another reader says , " My daughter and a friend went to see " Mamma Mia " recently and were behind two girls of about 12 who not only felt the need to sing along , with their arms above their heads , but one also chose to start redoing her hair in the middle of the show , arms up above her head ! " <p> Phony PhoneesIdentified by a monkey reader in a West End Dress Circle , she says : " I cant recall which show or which theatre it was now , except that it had a very steep rake in the Dress Circle . It could occur anywhere I suppose . <p> Anyway , there we were , sitting two seats from the aisle in the Dress Circle , and a couple arrived to occupy the two seats next to the aisle . They settled down , he with a bulky carrier style canvas or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour before the interval , a mobile alarm went off . It kept going . No one moved . ( Why is it that people think you wo n't know where it is coming from when you are right next to them ? ) The couple shuffled , and he muttered something to his companion . I looked at them , but they did nothing and stared ahead . The alarm eventually stopped . A few minutes later , it went off again . This time , I asked him to switch if off . He looked at me and said " It is n't my phone " . The phone in his bag continued to beep , on full volume . He said it again this time to his companion , which confused me . Then she turned to me in a fury and said loudly " It is n't his phone . He is just looking after it , so stop having a pop and shut up . " Notwithstanding my surprise , I told her " shoosh " , so that she did not disturb the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beeping ) . She started hyperventilating at my appalling arrogance , and continued to huff and puff throughout the rest of the half . At the interval , we rose , and politely excused ourselves as we waited for her to move her legs so that we could pass in the very small space , to get to the loo . We waited , and waited , and then she finally moved an inch or so . <p> There was no alarm in the second half , so one presumes that the carer of the borrowed/stolen/mislaid phone permitted himself to touch and interfere with the controls , or that it had done its worst and cared no more to torture us . <p> Is this unique ? Am I going mad or is it weird ? Is it the age thing ? Am I intolerant ( rising 60 ) of 20-somethings ? ( Probably ) . " <p> Not intolerant , felt the monkey , just possessing greater than average common sense ... and more manners ... <p> Middle Aged Snoggers Spotted by reader Kevin from Manchester , who writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me a very affectionate couple kissing each other throughout almost the entire performance of Cabaret at the Lyric in October 2007 . <p> Did I say kissing ? Sorry I meant FULL ON SNOGGING , tongues and all ! Cast your mind back to you teenager years and on the back row of your local flea pit cinema and this is what they were like ! <p> However , these were no teenagers , they werent even in early 20s or 30sThey were at least mid 40s possibly late 40s ! I can only assume that they were not each others regular partner and were on some secret randy rendezvous . God knows what mood they were in afterwards after watching such a raunchy show like Cabaret . <p> Age aside , the theatre is no place for tonsil tennis ! " <p> The monkey agrees . <p> The list is not confined to the audience though . The monkey also hates : <p> Box Office Bolshie : You are employed to sell tickets and disseminate information on behalf of the theatre . Kindly try to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seats , please look for a single seat in an otherwise full theatre , and please , please , remember we are paying your wages . So be pleasant . Most of you are resting actors and give monkey a wonderful performance . For the bolshies - try to do so too , it will keep you in practice . <p> On the other hand , there are some Box Office Angels too . Reader Simon Feegrade sfeegrade@hotmail.com was impressed by the service he received from the Trafalgar Studios/Ambassador staff in 2004 . <p> " I requested front row , but was told the RSC were being slow to release their unsold allocation , which included those seats . They reserved my 4th-row tickets without taking payment while waiting to see what the RSC released . From Thursday to following Tuesday , they held them , while giving me phone updates , before confirming the front row seats were available and only taking payment then . And they were helpful and courteous throughout . " <p> Chris Ellis adds , for the Cambridge Theatre in 2004 : " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost our tickets on the way to the theatre , but luckily had noted my booking reference . However , there was no hassle in getting replacement tickets quickly from the box office when we arrived , with only minutes to spare . " <p> great news that this species does exist ! <p> Sound Desk DJ : The desk at the back of the theatre is complex . It controls the sound we hear . Fine . It is also noisy and distracting for those sitting near it . Please techies , be quiet as you do your job . Oh , yes , and if it is not too much trouble , also remember that sound varies throughout the theatre , so try to balance it with the whole place in mind , not just the rear stalls . Study your acoustics if you would be so kind . <p> Lighting Desk JockeyTheatremonkey reader Mark Hannon passes on this one , especially for those wanting to see a play in a small or fringe venue : <p> " Especially in smaller ( around 250seat ) and the worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows need a welding mask to look at the stage as the lights are just way too bright ! <p> Sidebar ( those lights placed at the edges of the stage in the wings ) and Front Of House bar lights ( placed in the theatre pointing towards the stage ) rarely pose problems , but overeager overstage and backlighting leave fine performances unwatchable . <p> If we are in a darkened space , I feel that clear sightlines easily outweigh proximity to it . I 've seen a play set in a dungeon where the lights lit most of the auditorium ! <p> As for squeaks , do n't start me about cyberlights ! These are motorised so they can move during the performance , useful for musicals and Top Of The Pops ( a British pop music show ) . <p> Anyway stage lights are a minimum of 500watts and get very hot , very quickly . Normal oil burns off - at best it stinks , at worst it triggers the smoke alarms ! Specialist hi-temp greases ( copaslip , molyslip ) are available but expensive ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraping along with the rhythm ask who 's the cheapskate git with the maintenance job ! ! ! ! Very often the local hire shop for Amateur Dramatics companies is to blame , but if you pay for tickets expect your money 's worth . If nobody says nowt , guess what happens ? ! <p> Valuable advice , and an interesting insight too , thinks the monkey . <p> The Wandering Stagehands:Kyrsty Mewett noticed these - more in amateur shows than the West End normally , but easily recognised . These backstage hands wonder how near the stage they can get before being spotted . A LOT CLOSER THAN YOU THINK , says Kyrsty ! <p> Actor Switch Off : Every performance has a new audience . You may have done this show a hundred times . We will only see it once . Never sleepwalk through your part . If you are interested in what you are doing , we will follow . <p> " Is anyone looking at me " cast member : Kyrsty Mewett notes that they are more often in amateur shows , but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacks effort , does the wrong move , or does something amusing like flashing or changing the dance routine . <p> Long Run Blues : Some shows have been going so long that the cast was not even born when it first opened . This is no excuse for lazy direction , characterisation or technical staging . By all means keep things fresh , but do keep the newest cast up to the standards of the original , and a few pounds spent on refurbished scenery etc , where appropriate , never comes amiss . <p> Pits of a Pit Orchestra : The Musicians Union is voluble about keeping their workforce employed . If you want to be treated as professionals , behave like them . Commit to contracts , do n't rely on a friend filling in for you , and play like you mean it . Every night . Some of us do notice the missing instruments , wrong notes , bad timing , poor synchronisation with stage action and lack of enthusiasm you know ! <p> A reader also says , " A comment about how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do their job would be good . Reading books and chatting in the pit are also a large problem , especially when the front rows can hear them , but again the MD should be strong enough to stop this , and not try to be just one of the lads. <p> And for the monkey 's enthusiasm comment , how about playing each performance with the utmost professionalism , effort and musicianship , people are paying a great deal to see a cracking show with some of the UKs finest musicians playing , so prove that you are . That should appeal to the pit musicians that may come across the site ! " <p> The monkey could n't have put it better itself ! <p> One overseas visitor summed up audience manners when he commented that : <p> " I come to London from time to time and visit as many productions as possible . After three years without visiting , this time I 'm afraid I must say that the standard of service of many theatres I went to has fallen . <p> Ushers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My impression in those moments ( and there were some of them in 8 days ) was ... it 's all only ( ! ) about making money . Who trains them , who teaches them to love ( or at least know something about ) theatre and performing arts ? <p> Another impression is that audiences themselves spoil evenings with talking , phoning , making noise with ice cream , plastic material etc . And the irony is that the theatres themselves provoke this by selling food just in front of the audience ! I do n't believe it ! I would ban food in stalls and galleries . " <p> The shape of things to come , asks the monkey ? ... <p> One reader has a possible solution , though . He reports that , " I went to the Pizza Express Jazz Club ( Dean St ) . Before the performance there was an announcement - " the silence policy " was read aloud . It seemed to work even though people were eating and drinking . could this catch on in theatres ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader says , in January 2016 : " Having read this , I 'd like to add a few oddities . I have to mention that I am from Germany and have been visiting London at least twice a year in order to attend theatre performances for more than 25 years . I am now 45 years old . <p> 1 ) The curry eater Having seen a performance of " Bend it like Beckham " , I had the bad fortune to see behind a man who was wearing a massive turban ( you could not see over it ) . but that was by far not the worst thing . The family next to me was - in the middle of Act I - unpacking her bag ... and then started to eat a curry dish . No usher said anything . <p> 2 ) Thriller live - Horror Live Two weeks ago ( late 2015 ) , I went to see ' Thriller Live ' with my wife . This was really " Hell on Earth . " Not only that I think that the show is appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical ) , but my wife and I could spot a lot of youngsters sitting in the boxes and putting their feet on the balustrade . <p> That was by far not the worst behaviour . We had a hen night sitting behind us . Totally drunk females who had n't got the faintest idea how to behave properly . They were shouting swear words all the time , giggling whenever it was not appropriate and they were constantly drinking alcoholic beverages ( burping inclusive ) . The ushers did n't give a damn , not even when I told them during the break . They were more interested in selling ice cream than in anything else . <p> 3 ) In July 2015 I went to see " Baddies " . Being a teacher myself , I do n't mind school children in a theatre performance as long as they behave adequately . But there was one girl who shi*ted her pants and the stench was enormous . She did n't even bother going to the toilet - and when she finally stood up after the show you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's simply gross . <p> 4 ) Mates night out : About as bad as a hen night having next to you is having a " Mates night out " next to you in the audience . This happened to me a couple of years ago when watching " Rock of Ages " .

@@45560901 @5560901/ <p> For the larger Theatregoera page of advice compiled in association with reader Sam . <p> London theatres were generally built in the late 1800s and early 1900s , expected to last only a few yearsand cater for people far less well nourished and generally smaller than today . As a result , the tall and , er , broader person may well find seats and legroom less than accommodating . <p> Legroom ( and indeed all matters of seat comfort and view ) are discussed on a venue-by-venue basis on this site , indexed by clicking here . In the case of legroom it is generally the ends of rows without seats in front , rows with gangways in front ( but no partitioning walls / bars ) and boxes with movable seating that provide most . Sadly , aside from desirable seating on a gangway in the centre stalls or circle , the other options generally sacrifice some view for the comfort . This is minimised by taking row ends or boxes towards the rear of the theatre , rather than at the front near the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the distance increases the viewing angle - sometimes significantly though watch for overhangs cutting the top off the stage ! <p> For the broader proportioned , no theatre in London provides " extra wide " seating at present , and again any seat providing extra comfort will usually have some other drawback - a limited view or restricted legroom . A few have slightly wider seats as they are more modern , but since the difference is literally only around 5cm , it is n't much , alas . Theatres with very slightly wider seats include the Noel Coward ( centre balcony only ) , Queens ( stalls only ) , Prince Of Wales , Theatre Royal Drury Lane ( stalls and Dress Circle notably ) and the London Palladium . The Royal Court Theatre Downstairs has arm-rests that can be raised between seats if two tickets are purchased in the stalls . <p> Venues with some bench or chair / bar-stool seating without arm-rests include the Donmar Warehouse* , Pit* , Trafalgar Studio Two* , St Martins Upper Circle rows E to H and also Upper Circle row K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theatre . Barbican Theatre Upper Circle row AA and BB seats 1 and 11 are also wider , as are Noel Coward balcony seats B3 and C3 . <p> Note that venues marked * have limited legroom in most seats and access to centre of the row will be harder for many . Generally only the front row of the venue or the few seats without seats in front of them will be suitable . <p> At other venues , in general only those theatres with boxes containing movable seating are even partially accommodating . Do also be aware that sometimes these are also a way from the theatre entrances and restroom facilities making further difficulties for those with health issues . <p> One reader says of the Lyric Theatre , Shaftesbury Avenue : " It was hell ! I purchased seat number D10 in the Upper Circle for a performance of " Smaller " ( April 2006 ) . Oh the irony at even mentioning the name of the play ! Unfortunately , the seat I sat in was not the one I had paid for . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the non-existent leg room , but also due to the seats being extremely narrow . <p> As a slightly broader theatre-goer ( size 18 and 5ft 8 ) , I never expect to be sitting in a seat that is vastly wider than myself , but I do expect to be able to fit into the seat . Imagine my mortification to find that I could n't ! I initially tried by sitting sideways , but found this unbearable as there was no leg room and both seats either side of me was occupied . in the end I spent the first half of the play standing at the back , and managed to find an unoccupied aisle seat to sit in for the second half , which I still had to sit in sideways but was able to stretch one leg out into the aisle . However , I now find that I have bruises on my left leg which was unfortunately wedged against the seat in front . <p> As the two leads of the play are both role models for the larger lady , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this complaint . It is debatable whether Alison Moyet would be able to squeeze into the seat , while Dawn French would n't have a hope !

Unfortunately , I could n't afford these , so am in effect being punished for being overweight ! Is n't it about time theatres realised they need to update their seating arrangements for the 21st Century audience ? ! " <p> Another reader reports the following experiences , Royal Albert Hall : " We were in box number 25 with an amazing view . All the boxes appear to have the same chairs however ... These are free standing metal chairs . As a larger person I often find seats in the theatre " snug " but this was the first time that I have ever found a theatre seat that I absolutely could not fit in .

" <p> Apollo Victoria Theatre : " Good leg room and large seats in the stalls . Less good within the circle area in both areas .. but still acceptable .

The " Theatreland Parking Scheme " may be available at car parks near may West End venues . Call Q-Park car parks on 0870 442 0104 or see http : //www.q-park.co.uk for details . At this car park , parking under the " Theatreland Parking Scheme " allows a 50% discount in cost . Spaces CAN NOT be reserved at these prices , though . <p> If you choose the " Theatreland Parking Scheme " , you must get your car park ticket validated at the theatre 's box office counter ( the theatre attendant will insert the car parking ticket into a small machine which updates the information held on the magnetic strip on the reverse , thus enabling the discount ) . When you pay using the machines at the car park , 50% will be deducted from the full tariff . You may park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is endorsed by the Society of London Theatre . <p> Outside the West End central area , the Royal National Theatre , South Bank Concert Halls , Earls Court , Royal Albert Hall , Wembley Complex and the Barbican Centre have their own car parks . Of these , only Earls Court and the Royal Albert Hall require / allow pre - booking . The others have enough space to cope with their own audiences . <p> Read the playSeriously . If the play is unfamiliar , or contains difficult language , a few minutes reading the first two or three scenes makes it easier to get involved in the action . <p> Help the Box Office ClerkClerks get a rough deal ( cue violins ) facing the public every day . Help them when making a booking by listing ( before calling them ) , your a choice of dates and prices , and knowing which seats you prefer . And have your credit card to hand . If you are prepared , the whole booking thing is way simpler and less painful for both parties involved ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reader Simon Feegrade sfeegrade@hotmail.com was impressed by the service he received from the Trafalgar Studios/Ambassador staff . <p> " I requested front row , but was told the RSC were being slow to release their unsold allocation , which included those seats . They reserved my 4th-row tickets without taking payment while waiting to see what the RSC released . From Thursday to following Tuesday , they held them , while giving me phone updates , before confirming the front row seats were available and only taking payment then . And they were helpful and courteous throughout . " <p> Chris Ellis adds , for the Cambridge Theatre in 2004 : " An extra word of praise for the theatre staff - I lost our tickets on the way to the theatre , but luckily had noted my booking reference . However , there was no hassle in getting replacement tickets quickly from the box office when we arrived , with only minutes to spare . " <p> great news , and just shows how staff will try when they are treated well by us customers ! <p> Monkey has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerks have been splitting small parties by placing one or more members away from the rest on the other side of the aisle ! The monkey advises scrutiny of the seating plans to make certain this does not happen to you . <p> Helping Yourself : All Ambassador Theatre Group and Delfont Mackintosh Theatres have online seat selection , where you can pick your own seats for shows from all those available in their theatres . For venues which do n't offer that facility , a few ticket agencies , like Londontheatredirect.com have " live booking " which does the same thing - but with the agency booking fee on top , of course . <p> In those cases , there 's nothing to stop you using the agency availability plan , but phoning / booking online with the venue box office and saving the booking fees . <p> The monkey also notes that if booking a group by phone , it 's a very good idea to have a live availability plan on the screen in front of you , so you can tell the clerks which seats your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all will be available , but it should stop you getting the really crumby ones ... <p> If you are collecting tickets at the Box OfficeThe actual cardholder MUST be present and produce the credit card used to make the booking , when collecting tickets at the box office counter on the day of the performance . <p> One reader says , " I would offer a word of advice about collecting pre-booked tickets from the box office . We got there just in time ( about 2.30pm - the show was at 3pm ) before the queue really built up . We had to queue for 10 minutes , but as we left , the queue was outside and along the side of the theatre along Shaftesbury Avenue . It only needs one or two argumentative people in the line and everything snarls up . My advice . If you have to collect pre-booked tickets allow plenty of time . " <p> Wise words , feels the monkey . <p> Compare online availabilityA reader suggests that if you get offered good seats online but are still not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimize the window and hold those offered ( you can often keep for up to 5 minutes ) rather than " go back " in your browser . Then open a new booking window to check other availability . If you close the window the seats seem to get blocked for 5minutes and then when released there is no guarantee that you will get the same ones back . <p> That single seat online Many online systems that allow you to choose your own tickets wo n't let you leave a single seat - for example if there are 3 together and you want two . There are two ways around this : 1 ) if you have two computers or two DIFFERENT types of browser e.g. Windows Explorer and Firefox , hold that single seat on one machine or in one browser - put them in the basket , just clicking them is n't enough . Switch on the other machine / browser , go to the same page and you should now be able to buy the two seats . Then release the ticket on machine / browser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want a single seat out of two . Have the online page available and , just before you give the date you wish to book for and the clerk goes to check things , hold one seat of the 2 by putting into the basket . The clerk should see the other seat as a single and be able to sell it to you . Neither of these always work , but are worth a go , if the performance is quiet and there is not likely to be competition for either ticket ... you do need time to mess around a bit , though - might be cheaper to go make a friend in the end ... <p> Failing that , threats of action under the " Disability Discrimination Act " may also work ... or not , depending how authoritative and not like a chump you sound ... not a recommendation , just an observation though . <p> Ticket Insurance Most theatres now sell ticket insurance scheme " TicketPlan " . This guarantees you your money back if you , a close relative or person accompanying you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / died . They even notify the theatre of your non-appearance ; so you do not have to worry ! <p> You are also covered if your car breaks down en-route , or if public transport fails due to industrial action or breakdown ! With huge ticket prices , this is a great way to protect your investment . It is a useful option to consider where offered , feels the monkey , though one reader comments , in 2014 : " We 'd originally booked to see a show in January and paid the extra 3 insurance which promised to refund all your money whatever the circumstances . We both came down with flu , were highly infectious and our doctor did n't want us to go to the surgery and spread this , but the ticket insurers said we had to provide medical evidence before they 'd refund and were really unhelpful . When you look at what they want you to provide for each different circumstance it really puts you off .

With the high cost of theatre tickets in London you always worry that something will stop you going and you 'll lose your money .

" <p> Worth buying only if the ticket company are not good on exchanges then , notes the monkey - ATG and Delfont Mackintosh are best , it feels . <p> Pay for the VIP Treatment Many theatres offer a " hospitality " service - top tickets plus use of a private room / bar and refreshments . A programme and backstage tour can also be included . Ask the box office operators when you call ... but be prepared to pay 100 upwards for the fun ! <p> Guarantee Your Favourite Star Will actually perform that night A condition of sale printed on the back of every ticket states that no refunds are given for advertised actors failing to perform .

Use the correct door of you will have to fight your way along a row inside . In a full house this is hard and embarrassing if the play has started . <p> Leaving the Theatre Wait for the crowd to disperse , or sprint for it ? Theatremonkey says move fast , go first , but be clever . Human nature is to use the same door to leave by as you came in . Theatres limit entry to one door , since only one leads from foyer to auditorium and ticket checks are easier . Fire regulations , however , require numerous direct street exits . As your fellow audience members fight their way back to the foyer , look for any green EXIT signs and doors with bars marked PUSH TO OPEN on them . Use them . You will avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the theatre , you can walk comfortably outside , avoiding the jostling on the stairs . <p> One reader , Brin , has found that , <p> " I have seen usherettes standing in front of fire doors at the end of perf , then asking people to exit via other doors , I have even seen fire doors sealed with a security tag with an " Alarmed " warning , we both know that this is very naughty . " <p> Indeed , this is naughty . If it happens to you , do report it to the local fire department - they will be most interested ... as will the local court when it imposes a very spectacular fine ! <p> Souvenirs , Cast Recordings and Programmes Many productions , especially musicals , have a tidy range of goods for sale in the foyer . <p> Other stuff includes T Shirts , Sweatshirts , badges / pins , trinket boxes , watches , mugs etc etc . These goodies are generally only sold in the theatre itself , though www.DressCircle.com . Dress Circle Records carry odd items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have closed , check with them for details as obviously supplies are limited . <p> Decide for yourself if buying souvenir stuff is worth the cash , though to be fair , the quality is usually not bad - often pretty good . All the stuff looks like it is made by one factory , only the show logo varies . Unsatisfactory goods are rare , returns are handled by the theatre general manager , write to them to get a refund / replacement . They can also mail goods if you forget to buy on the day , but write first rather than telephone . <p> Cast recordings are usually cheaper from high street or internet stores . The mail order price in programme advertisements are usually high , especially when postage is taken into account , and the foyer price can also be outrageous . Around 14 is the going rate , 10 is a good deal for a single CD . <p> A fascinating outlet for Vinyl LP lovers - with around 500 UK and American original cast albums ( all listed on their website ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Saturday 11am until 4.30pm , they can be contated <p> Established 1948 , this shop is said to be the longest established independent record shop in the UK and has an extensive stock with a friendly and knowledgeable owner too . <p> Very few soundtracks and souvenirs are collectable . Only recordings and items from failed shows or surviving from the earliest days of a long running hit accrue really high value . They usually must have been circulated in limited quantities , and be in mint condition . Theatremonkey puts the free flyers advertising shows before they open as a better investment than most merchandise . Buy stuff for the memory , not the potential value . Memories are worth far more any day . <p> Reader Brin notes that , " I just ca n't get over the way you are processed through the souvenir shop at the Lyceum , it 's a major mine field if you have children , or even worse , some one else 's children who are just pester agents . The worst culprits I remember were the Moscow State Circus and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monkey . <p> Coats Theatremonkey of course has fur to keep warm . For everybody else the choice is CHECK IT or CARRY IT . <p> CHECK IT . At the Royal National and Barbican theatres check it every time . Big , free ( tip , say 1 per coat if the retrieval is the usual quick process ) and efficient cloakrooms are worth using . For your own safety though , take cash , credit cards and keys with you - the staff are very honest and security worries are few , but things do fall out of coats sometimes . Elsewhere , cloakrooms are small , expensive and understaffed , where available at all . So <p> CARRY IT . Stuck with your coat in the theatre DO NOT put it under the seat or in the aisle . At best it will get trodden on , mostly it will just get a number of interesting stains . At worst it will be robbed . Yes , during the performance , as your attention is distracted by what is happening on stage <p> Theatremonkey advises making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , take it off , open it as if you were to wear it , place in your seat , and sit in it as you would on the bus , just with your arms not in the armholes . This sounds daft , but it is better then sitting with the thing on your lap . <p> Order your interval drink in advanceMost theatre bars are small and quickly get crowded at the interval . Pick a less busy bar , generally one not in the Stalls ( fewer seats upstairs means fewer customers ) . By ordering in advance , your drinks will be waiting next to a number on the bar , or nearby shelf , as soon as the first act finishes . Enjoy them while watching the less well informed fight for attention , get served and down their beverage in about ten minutes flat while you peacefully sup away . <p> Brin , a reader , advises , <p> " The price of ice creams have shot through the roof , I have taken my own cool box before now . Drinks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way around the problem , feels the monkey . <p> Some theatres now allow you to use an app to order direct from your phone - details are in the theatre programme , and website www.Zervedapp.com . Do this BEFORE and NOT DURING the show , though , please , begs the monkey ! <p> Hiring Opera GlassesThese opera glasses , which enhance the theatregoers experience , are available for renting during the show performance . They are located between the pairs of seats in most theatres , however , sometimes you will also find additional opera glasses on pelmets at the rear of the theatre . <p> You will need 1 to hire the glasses which is done by inserting your coin into the slot on top of the holder when you will be able to release them for your immediate use . <p> Replace opera glasses by pushing them down gently into the holder before leaving your seat at the end of the show . BE CAREFUL not to do this DURING the show or you will have to pay again to release them ! <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to a member of staff or leave them on the arm of your seat , but , under no circumstances leave the theatre with them , as theatregoers have , in the past , been prosecuted for stealing ! <p> Keen theatremonkeys buy their own , but you have to see a lot of shows to justify the cost . <p> Other Interval TipsAs a rule there is only one restroom on each level for each gender . Worse , ladies have the usual problem of insufficient cubicles . It is worth going upstairs to find quieter restrooms during intervals . Managers normally check restrooms before giving the signal for the second half to start , so do n't worry too much if the time is ticking away . <p> Smokers need to go outside to do so . In 2013 the monkey noticed one theatre in the Delfont Mackintosh chain issuing laminated passes to smokers who could n't produce their tickets as they were leaving through a side door . So , take your ticket with you - or get a pass from the usher at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , gauge their concentration level or stick to theatre aimed directly at their age group . But make sure they get addicted to live performance as soon as possible ! <p> Even stuff seemingly ideal for children like " Shrek The Musical " or " The Lion King " require considerable intellectual investment . Sitting still for three hours is a lot to ask of any child , and 65 for a ticket is a lot of cash to invest in making them sit . Be sure they will get plenty out of the experience before taking them , or you could put them off for life . <p> Theatregoers are intolerant of children in general . So are theatres . Babies are not admitted anyway , and there are no changing facilities in toilets . <p> For older children , booster seats are available in some theatres , ask . Shorter adults may also benefit ! One reader says of the Queen 's Theatre in 2012 , " I had an 11 year old with me and emailed the theatre management in advance to reserve a booster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we arrived but a staff member was waiting for me at the top of the stairs with cushion in hand - top marks for great customer service ! " <p> BOOSTERZ Inflatable Booster Cushions are now available to borrow at some theatres . Raising a child 10 to 14 cm , this easily inflated - by pump or pure ' puff power ' - item can be loaned from ushers at the venue . For regular theatregoers , they can also be purchased , at just 7.99 each direct from the inventors at www.boosterz.co.uk , and the more you buy , the greater the discount ! <p> Sitting in a box or in the back row of the auditorium , on an aisle , is ideal as it will allow you to make a quick escape if your child turns fractious . Also , theatregoers will not notice a squirming kid behind them , and children are too well brought up to kick the seats in front ... are n't they ? <p> Remember the slumpWhen a tall person sits in front of you , blocking your view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the show the audience slump occurs . Ms Tall will relax her posture and sink down into her seat , clearing the view . This happens invariably , so if you can not move seat , it is an effect worth hoping for , cos it usually delivers . <p> Watch the BackgroundEveryone watches the main performer , and the person talking to them . Usually though , there are several other highly talented people sharing the stage , along with scenery and lights . Not only will everyone around the main players also be giving detailed performances worth watching , but stage designers being what they are , count on some wit in their designs . On leaving you can turn to your companion and say ' did you notice ? ' - the argument will provide a pleasant way to pass the homeward trip . <p> Annoy the ActorsSitting in the very front row the actors can , if they are not concentrating hard , notice you . Bad performances can be rewarded by a little discreetly annoying behavior on your part . Use your imagination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ruin it for the rest of the audience or you will be asked to leave . <p> Start a " spontaneous " standing ovationThe audience will often , unprompted , rise to their feet during the end of the show " bows " ( or the " who 's best " as a comic called it ) . This makes the cast feel great as they receive a standing ovation - moving an audience to stand up as a result of their skill . <p> If the show is mediocre though , it will not happen . So , just for fun , start one and see the surprise on the actors faces ! <p> What you do is wait until the " star " appears and begins the walk to the front of the stage to bow . Stand up clapping wildly and the rest of the audience will follow . As an exercise in group psychology , this one is unbeatable . <p> See a final matineeThe penultimate performance traditionally seems to see the cast let their hair down a little .

The heads will turn as the snobs rubberneck . <p> To be a critic , just look scruffy , old , board , drunk , and show up on opening night or a performance very soon after . Actually , only the last is compulsory . Write furiously on a pad at the interval . Some bozo will be aching to read over your shoulder , wondering who you are .

The press sees the show for the first time , and the audience comprises guests of the cast , producer , celebrities and journalists . For commercial productions , the general public is mostly excluded , unless the theatre has some particularly awful seats in the balcony to use , in which case they might just be sold to avoid an empty seat on this special night . Check with the Box Office . <p> State subsidised productions , at the Royal National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company are more democratic . Mailing list members can apply for opening night tickets ( at discount rate for non-musicals ) , and are given beat available seats . On occasion the audience is even treated to a little extra - the first night of ' Carrie ' saw a firework display for everyone after the show .

You get tickets to the opening night and an invite to the party , and very occasionally you get some of your money back too . High risk investment for those with deep pockets , and do not expect the largest producers to welcome you on board - they have their own lists which are closed to new backers . Others will welcome you ( watch out for Max Bialystock though ) . Contact Susanne at : The Society of London Theatre , 32 Rose Street , Covent Garden , London , WC2E 9ET .

The bigger the star , the less likely ( for their own safety and crowd security ) they will appear to sign autographs . Ask the stage door keeper POLITELY if the object of your desire will be able to sign . Either the keeper will have been briefed to take your programme or book to be signed and mailed back to you , or they may call down to the actor and ask what to do . Sometimes the actor emerges , or the keeper will take your programme in to be signed and bring it back ( who REALLY signs in this case is of course , unknown ) . You can though , just be told no . Please accept this and go . It is not the keeper 's fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking you to wait some distance from it and outside is not being difficult , just practical , as the whole team have to leave through this exit . Accept it and try to keep out of the way as you wait . <p> Better bets may be to catch the actor going into the theatre by hanging about on the street near the stage door about an hour before the show . Have a working pen , paper and a respectfully polite attitude . Actors are human ( OK I have never eaten with one ) and they are entitled to courtesy - if they are having a bad day in their life you are the last thing they need . On stage you get a performance you are paying for . Off stage is their personal time , your intrusion is into this and is on their terms , not yours . <p> If you are planning to collect an autograph , do take a working pen and something ( not a body part - this is not a rock concert ) to sign e.g. a programme or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a ballpoint and a thin felt tip / marker type . This is because in its ' experience ballpoint pens do n't work in cold weather , and felt tips will write on anything under most weather conditions ! <p> Do also remember : Stage door areas are often in dark alleyways . If you have to wait after the evening show , the streets around will often empty of people ... consider your personal safety at all times , please ! ! <p> Vocaleyes , an audio description service is also available at certain performances .

Ask the Box Office for details . These usually show you a bit of the theatre the public do not see . It always amazes theatremonkey how poor dressing rooms are , and the conditions thespians must often endure . <p> Best tours , Monkey and readers reckons are the Royal National Theatre and the Theatre Royal Drury Lane . Both are involving ; and Drury Lane in particular offers a few surprises along the way . One reader reports from the Drury Lane tour in February 2009 ( spoiler alert for some ) , " My wife and I went along on the tour as she had got me it for my birthday . We both did n't really know what to expect but as the few reviews that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well turn out OK ! We were not wrong with our earlier predictions and the tour turned out to be a real highlight of our day in London . <p> It would be unfair of me to go into the stories and things that you are told on the tour as that is what you go along for ! However , what I can tell you is that you meet a lot of characters from the theatres past . Brilliantly brought to life by two actors who you can tell really love their jobs ! Throughout the tour you meet characters such as David Garrick , Richard Sheridan and Nell Gwynne who tell you about their experiences with the theatre and also about their lives . <p> You get the usual warning of " as this is a working theatre each tour will be different . " In other words , do n't expect to go into the Auditorium . However , we were lucky enough on our tour to be taken across the back of the Balcony and to see some of the understudies rehearsing for ' Oliver ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ! The other places that you visit are the Royal retiring room , the original tunnels that had burrows to all kinds of places in London . We also had the chance to visit the underneath of the stage and see the workings . This was fascinating to think you were standing underneath the biggest stage in London ! One interesting fact I will share with you . If you were to take the Fortune Theatre and put it in the middle of the The Theatre Royal , you could still drive a car round the outside of it ! <p> All in all , this is a must for those people that are really into their theatre history . Even those who are not can still laugh along with the anecdotes of the characters and appreciate touring one of the most impressive performance spaces in London ! " <p> In December 2014 at the London Palladium , a reader says , " On the 12th of December I went on the London Palladium theatre tour which was fantastic , the tour guide was very informative and clearly loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this being the day after opening night for CATS the company were going to be taking part in a photo shoot on the stage . So we started the tour backstage and then moved onto the actual Palladium stage . I could not believe how little room there was backstage or how small the stage was compared to how it looks on TV . After the backstage tour we then did the auditorium and some of the back room areas that the public never gets to see , for only 12 and for 2 hours I would strongly advise anyone to book this tour . " <p> Delfont-Mackintosh theatres the Prince Edward and Prince of Wales also offer tours . See their website for details - **27;448;TOOLONG <p> Sociable and not just interested in theatre ? www.londonivc.com London IVC Theatre Club organises several sociable theatre trips each month .

" IPads at each table allow you to buy tickets as you sup ( the place is owned by Londontheatrebookings , a respected ticket agency ) , and the atmosphere is welcoming . <p> Gift VouchersA number of companies , including the Society of London Theatre ( SOLT ) sell Gift Vouchers ( Gift Certificates ) which can be exchanged for tickets . The monkey says , " Think . " <p> Theatre Tokens is a non for profit scheme run on behalf on the UK theatre industry and is administered by The Society of London Theatre . Theatre Tokens never expire unlike other similar vouchers and are available in 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 denominations . Change is also given in Theatre Tokens should the tickets be less than the Theatre Token you hold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , including London 's West End and the TKTS half price ticket booths for on the day tickets . <p> Theatre Tokens are available direct from www.theatretokens.com 24/7 or on Tokenline 0844 887 7878 Monday to Friday during office hours and all orders are dispatched by first class post on the following business day . They are also available through a network of retails including all participating Theatres , WHSmiths , Waterstones and many Tourist Information Centres . <p> Large agencies also issue their own tokens for purchase through their own companies . <p> The choice is baffling . As one reader reports in July 2007 , " I had a terribly problem getting tickets for " Billy Elliot . " I am leaving my job and was given a mix of theatre tokens and a Ticketmaster gift card as leaving presents ! Hurrah ! <p> However , when I phoned Ticketmaster to book tickets using the tokens and gift card I was passed from department to department for about 20 minutes only to be finally told that Ticketmaster DO NOT accept the Society of London Theatre Theatre Tokens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of phoning the Victoria Palace Box office and booking a seat next to the one that had been suggested to me by Ticketmaster . Thankfully the Box Office could sell me D26 in the circle and Ticketmaster still had seat D27 when I phoned back .. ! <p> A very difficult way of trying to get two seats together due to allocations and various odd rules . <p> The morale is - only ever ask for Theatre Tokens and go straight to the Box Office either in person or over the phone ! " <p> Another reader writes of an experience , " I recently received 50 worth of Theatre Tokens as a birthday present . I wanted to see ' Les MisTrables ' and pay with my Theatre Tokens through Ticketmaster , but I was told that because this is a popular show they wo n't accept tokens . I tried phoning back . This time , the chap stuttered and said that those tokens had to be used with a different agency for that particular show , and he gave me their number . I asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that he did n't know because they do n't keep that information around . Where was I directed when I phoned this mystery agency number ? The venue itself , who do n't allow any of Ticketmaster 's special offers ( meal deal , 2 for 1 etc . ) . <p> Ticketmaster do n't accept Theatre Tokens for popular shows . If you give them as a present , you are limiting the giftee to the unpopular shows , or preventing them from using the 2 for 1 offers . Steer very clear of Theatre Tokens . " <p> In fact , Ticketmaster do accept SOLT tokens for most shows - BUT users should be careful to use only the booking numbers listed in the gift voucher folder that comes with the tokens as they do n't accept them for all ... AND try and call weekdays 9am to 6pm when it is most likely the agency tokens office staff will be available to help ( often the general telephone team do n't know about tokens and can cause the kind of chaos the reader described above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redeeming SOLT tokens , calling Tokenline on 0870 164 8800 can help resolve issues . <p> Another reader reminds others , " We were given 2 Ticketmaster gift cards purchased at W.H. Smiths , unfortunately , we did n't realise that these cards are valid for 12 months only from the time of activation , by the time I came to booking some seats the gift cards were no longer valid . We wasted 130 . Is there somewhere on your website that could remind people to check the date and validity of their gift cards . The writing on the back of the gift cards is tiny and it may not be obvious . " <p> The monkey KNOWS cash is a thoughtless gift , but still , in this case , consider if the recipient is going to be able to redeem them easily ..... <p> ....... Luckily , it prefers bananas anyway . <p> Fringe Venue LightingTheatremonkey reader Mark Hannon passes on this very valuable advice to those wanting to see a play in a small or fringe venue : <p> " Especially in smaller ( around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front 2 or 3 rows need a welding mask to look at the stage as the lights are just way too bright ! <p> Sidebar ( those lights placed at the edges of the stage in the wings ) and Front Of House bar lights ( placed in the theatre pointing towards the stage ) rarely pose problems , but overeager overstage and backlighting leave fine performances unwatchable . <p> If we are in a darkened space , I feel that clear sightlines easily outweigh proximity to it . I 've seen a play set in a dungeon where the lights lit most of the auditorium ! <p> As for squeaks , do n't start me about cyberlights ! These are motorised so they can move during the performance , useful for musicals and Top Of The Pops ( a British pop music show ) . <p> Anyway stage lights are a minimum of 500watts and get very hot , very quickly .

Whether the joy of a Muslim wedding , all in spectacular green with beautiful traditional dance from bride Soraya ( Lisa Zahra ) and song ; or dramatic meeting with Amirs nemesis Assef ( chillingly controlled psychopathic performance from Bhavin Bhatt ) they never fail . <p> Telescoping to simple two-person conversation also brings out revelations . The best involve kindly family friend Rahmin Khan ( lovely avuncular work from Karl Seth ) .

Do sit on the left and as close to the front as is possible for this wonderful performance . Enjoy . " <p> " Row 2 seat 23 : Enjoyed a fantastic view of the performers on stage , really close up . I would say that I think you pay a price acoustically . The sound quality was nowhere near as good as when sitting further away . This is often the case on theatres I find but markedly so at the RAH I feel . I do n't mean the sound quality was bad by any stretch of the imagination , just not impressive . " <p> " Row 6 : Went to see ' The Who ' on 31st March 2007 . We had seats on the arena floor , section F six rows back . Fantastic view and atmosphere until the people in front stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offenders that they did not want to sit down they were allowed to get on with it . This meant that my wife who is five feet six had a guy of more than six feet six standing in front of her . I was told that if I kept on complaining to the stewards I risked being thrown out myself ! If this is to be allowed it would have been better if no seating was there as at least then you can move around . A similar situation occurred in 2006 at the Jeff Beck concert . " <p> " For the arena , in response to the reader who had the issue at ' The Who ' concert , I would definitely suggest buying a ticket for the stalls since the seats are raked and the chairs swivel , so even if someone were to stand up in front of you , you 'd have a good view nonetheless and would n't lose anything acoustically . Alternatively , the front of the circle ( Circle T or U ) if you can get the tickets ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all round . <p> On another note , the arena seats have now changed to a much better quality in both sightlines and leg room . For classical concerts they are now a perfect buy , for rock concerts , choose the stalls or the front of the circle . " <p> " I was not at the concert mentioned above , but I do go to a lot of rock shows , and would have been surprised if people had not stood up early on in the show . This is common practice . The unfortunate couples mistake was of course to go for seats in the Arena and not the Stalls . <p> Your comment that The Arena is only sensible when this is a standing area only is most pertinent . Maybe it should be more prominent . " <p> " I think that it is worth noting that row 7 of the outer blocks is adjacent to row 4 in the centre block and similarly other rows in the outer blocks are not adjacent to the row of the same number in the centre block . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website when you are selecting a seat for a performance .

These are a pair on the back row . Thought these were great , good view of the stage , My wife could see down the aisle , nobody behind to grumble when we stood up . Sound was excellent . We would sit here again if available , with the advisory warning that if everyone does stand up then the view could be limited depending on who is in front . This was fine for a concert like last night where the spectacle was n't important . A whole evening of not seeing properly might get tiresome .

Next come L2 and J1 then K1 and 2 . L , J and K are towards the rear of the arena , further from the stage . Sound can suffer for orchestral concerts in these blocks . <p> The stage often juts out in front of the first six seats in block G1 / last six in block O1 , placing you level with the performers . The rear corners of O1 and G1 are often sold as restricted view and are a bargain <p> Reader Comments : " Stalls . The stalls boast some of the best seats in the whole building in my opinion .

I particularly liked the fact that the row behind were the boxes , meaning that they were well raised above us , therefore no hassle from people complaining about their sight line ! ! !

" <p> Layout:Three tiers of boxes encircle the arena above and behind the stalls . Most are privately owned ( originally sold to raise money to build the venue ) and not open to the public unless the owner allows the box office to sell on their behalf . <p> The lowest level is the " Loggia Level . " Above this is the " Grand Tier " level . Above that are the " Second Tier " level boxes . <p> At the Loggia level , doorways and aisles between boxes 6 and 7 , 12 and 13 , 18 and 19 , 24 and 25 and 31 and 32 lead down into the stalls area ; which is directly in front of all Loggia level boxes . <p> When sold , seat numbers apply to allow a single ticket to be sold .

Boxes 1 and 2 ( 2 and 3 on Grand Tier Level ) can be combined to form a larger space if needed . <p> As a rule , boxes to the sides of the arena have more than the ones facing the stage , due to the curve of the front wall . <p> Seat 5 in the smallest boxes is a tall chair , with maximum legroom but will leave shorter persons hanging a little ... <p> Choosing Seats in General:Loggia level boxes 1 to 4 and 31 to 35 are closest to the stage . <p> Loggia level boxes 5 and 35 accommodate wheelchairs and command a fine view . Users should take these over block K. <p> The box office notes that in the 8 person boxes closest to the stage ( Loggia Level **29;477;TOOLONG ; Grand Tier level **32;508;TOOLONG ; 2nd Tier level 7,8,9,10,81,82,83,84 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage i.e. 1 , 2 , 5 and 6 actually have an awkward viewing angle of the stage .

Boxes 2 and 3 can be combined to form a larger space if needed . In the second tier it is 7 to 24 and 84 to 67 , with 7 and 84 prone to suffering metal rail problems . Boxes 81 and 82 and also boxes 83 and 84 can be combined to form a larger space if needed . <p> Other boxes offer good but slightly distant views . The sound is good in all and Theatremonkey likes these as a slightly more expensive , but comfortable , alternative to the balcony . Put another way , a box at the RAH is an experience not to be missed . <p> General Hazard Notes:Boxes 1 and 35 can have metalwork in the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All boxes that do n't face directly down the hall have side views , and within each box , some seats are better than others . 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments : " Put simply , unless you are booking as a full group of 8 for a loggia box , DO NOT book the back row . Your sightline will be obscured by any number of things , from the people in the front row , people in the stalls seats in front of you , and the pillars that adorn certain boxes around the hall . For the same price , and for sometimes even less , the stalls and arena seats can bought for a better view and experience . <p> In the grand tier , it does n't matter as much since the seats are on raised steps as they go up . However , for events in the round , avoid anything other than the front row as the people in front will definitely lean forward at certain sections and block your vision . <p> In the second tier , the same rule applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the front row unless you 're booking out the whole box . AVOID SEAT 5 AT ALL COSTS ! Seat 5 is incredibly awkward to manoeuvre in every box and you certainly wo n't get a decent view of the stage , no matter where the box is placed . There are boxes at the sides which have 8 seats per box and these ones have a good view on either row . If you want to book a second tier box as a couple or three , book one of these to avoid disappointment . <p> One more note on the boxes , at almost every event at the hall there will be corporate parties in the boxes , it 's how the building makes it 's money . These people can invariably be obnoxious , uninterested and loud . If you want to enjoy your concert and have a nice experience as well , I would highly suggest avoiding the boxes as you can find yourself in amongst less like-minded people who wo n't take kindly to being told off by you or a member of staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction either as these corporate boxes will be providing a lot of cash for the venue and the ' powers that be ' will claim there hands are tied . Proceed with caution ! " <p> " Grand Tier : Box 35 , Seats 3 and 4 : " Cirque du Soleil . " These are two of the four front seats in this box . They are good for any ' In The Round ' events and were perfect for the Cirque du Soleil show we were watching . Height is important for that show as much of it is performed above floor level . We had a superb view of everything . " <p> " We were in a box on the 2nd floor . A very good seat in fact . But the people in the box next to us were .... well , how can I put it politely ?

To add balance to the comment about the ' Hooray-Henries ' in one of the boxes passing around sandwiches at the RAH ... I had the opposite experience . I bought a single front-seat ticket in a box , and found that the slightly select nature of being in a box encouraged conviviality : we all shook hands and introduced ourselves , and before the concert started we talked about previous occasions we had heard the artiste , anecdotes , etc . Everyone was very considerate , shifting chairs to give those behind a better view , etc . It proved to be a very relaxed and pleasant way to enjoy a favourite performer .

As a larger person I often find seats in the theatre " snug " but this was the first time that I have ever found a theatre seat that I absolutely could not fit in . This was mortifyingly embarrassing ... the seats were very narrow .. even my husband who is tall but not fat , found them to be extremely snug . I decided to ask our box host ( member of staff ) whether there was a chair without arms - he was not sure but very quickly came back with a chair without arms . As the chairs were free standing it was possible to swap the chair and I was able to enjoy the show in comfort . I wanted to let you know that these seats may not be suitable for larger people .

" <p> Box 77 seat 5 : " I have to disagree with what has been said about the 2nd Tier boxes at the Royal Albert Hall . I was in Box 77 , Seat 5 , and found out that it was actually a tiny 5-person box with 2 seats in front ( the only two with unobstructed views ) , two seats behind them on a step , and Seat 5 , which was actually a chair on a platform that was placed behind the line of the box 's curtain and which had a view of only 1/3 of the stage when I was seated . The best I could do was stand up for the first half of the concert so I could see about 1/2 of the stage , before I went out to complain at the interval and was moved to a lower seat where I could actually see the entire stage . I found myself in a group of people complaining to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets a concert , only to end up with highly obstructed-view tickets , and eventually they did admit that the small boxes are mostly owned and populated by family groups who squash together at the front of the box so they can see . Not possible when you have five strangers in a box and the only unobstructed view is from the front row of two seats . Please note on your site that people need to be careful what seat they have in the 2nd Tier , and I suggest they use the RAH site to buy tickets as you can see which seat is where , unlike buying them blind through See , which stated I was in " Row 1 " . Anything other than Seats 1 and 2 in the tiny 5-person boxes is a highly obstructed view unless the people in the front row will let you sit on their laps .

I complained during the interval and was re-seated , however , I feel that when I booked my tickets I should have been advised of the obstructed view and that the ticket price for that seat should have been reduced in price to reflect that obstruction - I paid full price 75 !

These do not interfere with the view very much , but if such things really bother you , try row A - though there is still a low bar here - or choose the Stalls or boxes instead .

I 'd go for the end of an aisle or even the seats on the top of the stairs , last row . Does n't  make much difference in terms of sight and sound , but you can stretch your legs .

We could see the far half of the stage , and the bottom quarter of the backdrop . Half the orchestra were visible . Thankfully George spent 80% of the time sat or stood and the front centre which meant we could see him so long as the people on row 1 did n't lean forward too much ! <p> Legroom - non existent . I was wedged in and not going anywhere . A wall between the seats and the stairwell with a metal bar under the lip meant that I could barely move ! Much has been written about how slow paced this current GM show is - it 's a good job , as these seats were designed for sitting and listening , not getting up and dancing ! <p> Overall , these seats would be fine ( although still restricted ) if the event you are going to is in the central arena or you are happy not seeing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be OK . But for anything with a spectacle on the end stage , avoid unless you have no choice , and then only if you are desperate to go . In the scramble for tickets this was all we could get . A great place to watch the audience though ! " " Block P : " Cirque du Soleil " production " Alegria " ( January 2005 ) , the production was staged in the central arena . ( Roberto Trotta ) . " We had seats in the P-section of the Circle , marked " restricted view " and sold at 22.50 . I would like to point out that the view is really bad , for two main reasons : the first is a bulky metallic structure mounted over the back of the stage , which hinders the view to the performance . The second is that some parts of the show are carried out in front of a curtain which actually is seen from behind when one is seated in the " restricted view " places . As a consequence , large chunks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same situation applies even to the fully priced seats in sections Q and R ( and similarly to the corresponding sections on the other side of the hall , X and W ) , and would strongly advice NOT to buy any tickets in those sections , since the view is severely impaired and for this show they are really bad value for money . The same is true even for more highly priced seats in the boxes below . Quite apart from those considerations , the show is highly entertaining and enjoyable . I suspect that the standing places sold at 16 are not a good bargain , either . Although they are fully in front of the stage , I reckon that another metallic structure supporting some lights might be just on the line of sight , effectively cutting the view to a large chunk of the stage and to some of the most spectacular parts ... ( Have n't checked this for myself , though ) . ( Note that his comments apply only to this particular production , staged in this particular way on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it helpful to ask for more details when purchasing tickets for similar " in the round " productions at another time editor ) . <p> " P1 , restricted view : ( Jim ) . I noted this site 's comments about Circle Block P1 restricted view seats . I thought they might still be OK for a concert , especially as it was difficult to buy any seat at all for REM ( March 2008 ) . However I had a problem no-one predicted . The height above the stage was ok , the angle was ok but somebody had suspended a lighting gantry directly in the line of view . I saw virtually nothing of Michael Stipes REM 's singer when he stood at the front of the stage . Please add a comment about this to your site as it might prevent somebody else from having a frustrating evening .

This certainly was n't made clear on the RAH website at the time of booking . Our seats were : Circle , Block Q , Row 4 , Seats 30/31 .

" <p> " Circle T and U : My favourite seats in the entire venue are in the front row of Circle T and Circle U. These are a steal for ' Cirque Du Soleil ' events as the whole extravaganza will be visible from these seats , and not so much from down below . <p> It does get very hot up there , the hall ca n't build a traditional air conditioning system there on account of it being an ' English Heritage ' venue .

I think finding any seat in the circle with adequate legroom is virtually impossible but it was so much better than the seats in block P we had last time !

The stage is enormous and took up pretty much the whole of the stalls area .

One professional reviewer finds it " conscience stirring " and the reason for Anne-Marie Duff 's character Mary returning from London as intriguing . Other reviewers find the characters confused and confusing , without backgrounds and not easily identified . The " Wicker Man " feel is noted by several , as is the fact there are a few sound scenes where this is evoked . Sadly , the very long running time ( 30 minutes cut during previews , more to go , most suggest should happen ) leads to a meandering plot that most find inexplicable by the end .

I did n't guess that they 'd done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls , along with 30 or so other people . There were others sitting in the circle seats , but not many . It would n't have mattered if it had been just my girlfriend and I there to be honest because the ambience of the theatre is almost tangible . <p> I 'm over six foot tall and was glad that I had booked an aisle seat although we could have sat in row G or anywhere else if we had wanted to move . My girlfriend is 5 ' 4 " and said that she could have done with a bit more legroom . I would recommend that if you get a chance reserve seats in row G. <p> We would highly recommend this show even if you just go there with the intention to cross it off the list . You 'll be glad that you went . <p> Great stuff ! <p> I am *so* not a theatre goer . I ca n't help comparing plays to movies , and in that light even the biggest production invariably comes off looking like low budget fare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , have either held me in a near sleep state , dreaming of ways to make my escape , or in the worst ( read : artsy ) cases , wishing for the " break a leg " phrase to come true for one or more of the actors . <p> Still , being in London for the first time and considering the extremely high regard I have for British TV actors , who I know often have theatre backgrounds , I felt almost duty bound to go see a play . <p> Browsing the theatre guide , my eyes fell upon the small , blue add for " The Mousetrap " . Always having loved Agatha Christie 's whodunnits , I figured this one something of a safe bet . Anyway , having run for over 50 years , how bad could it be ? <p> Well , I 'm very glad I chose " The Mousetrap " , because not only was it the most enjoyable time I 've ever spent in a theatre ( admittedly not a major accomplishment ) , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not a large production by any stretch , the single set provided everything necessary . <p> The cast ( 7th April 2006 ) did a brilliant job with just the right amount of overacting for what was just as much of a comedy as a murder mystery . Whether that was how it was meant to be played in the 1950s I 've no idea , but it was great entertainment here and now . <p> I 'd recommend it to anyone who are really into whodunnits . Especially those who are n't too sure about this whole theatre thing . <p> KR Denmark <p> I sat in the Dress Circle , row C ( seat 10 ) to watch Theatreland 's most famous production . Plenty of leg room ensured no aching legs , however I was unlucky enough to have someone 6ft plus sat in front of me . As a result part of the stage was obscured , but this did not spoil the enjoyment . <p> I do n't want to give anything away especially as you are requested at the finale not to reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen The Mousetrap . <p> I will however state that the actors who took part in this production were fantastic , especially the actor who took the part of Christopher Wren who was extremely entertaining . <p> Go and see " The Mousetrap " , no visit to Theatreland whilst in London is complete without going to see it . <p> 16th November 2007 : <p> The cast make a good job of it but its not exactly a great play as its longevity would suggest . It has enough charm to fill the first act and the second enjoys sending you down the wrong paths , twisting and turning until the final Revelation - which you wo n't see coming but then also wo n't ever truly " care " about . <p> However its the experience as a whole - the utterly charming wooden theatre , the clockwork presentation of the piece and the entrance into the " club " ( of both being a part of this historical play and knowing the ending ) that makes it a wonderful cultural and historical experience , rather than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre . In short ; <p> " It exists in celebration of its own continued existence " <p> Seat information I 've gathered from 1995 and 2003 ( approx ) : Mousetrap seats : they are all cramped and wooden with little leg room and certainly no width ; and their sweeping arch means its a gamble if you get legroom due to the seat in front being curved . <p> The View from Row B aisle of upper circle was surprisingly the best of my 3 visits and was VERY cheap - though I was glad to be able to swing my leg into the aisle , and then swapped with the man on the other side for the interval so both legs got a stretch - worked for us both . The height gives it a slightly grander view and allows you to see the character rather than the actor - ( which in something so full of stereotypes - let 's you know where you stand ) <p> The rear Dress Circle was god awful - no decent rake , no leg room and very stuffy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were right in the thick of it , but somehow , seeing the actors so clearly took away from my enjoyment of this show - Up close it all looks more real and as such its downfalls are magnified and you do n't get the period feel with modern faces ; from a height its almost time travel , as though your looking down on a show from 50 years ago . <p> Matinees are packed with school - however school kids can control themselves in this sort of play in a way they clearly can not when watching something interactive and thrilling like the " Woman in Black " . <p> Aitchy <p> PS- the total weight of those tiny ice cream pot over the years equates to just under two and a half 747 jumbo jets ! <p> Took my sophisticated 12-year-old daughter to this and she loved it ! Wildly dated but still fun and the ending is a great surprise . Shes telling all her friends to go . <p> Sat in Upper Circle F3 and 4 which are directly under massive fan before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward because the theatre was half empty ( a popular Monkey ploy , I think I remember ) . We ended up in A 8 and 9 . The bar did n't  prevent us from seeing anything relevant in this production . <p> But if you were ever to add a section for recommended seats for menopausal women prone to hot flushes , F 3 and 4 and the equivalent on the other side of the aisle are probably more efficient than HRT ... <p> 14 November 2009 <p> Bought tickets online for ' The Mousetrap ' - great show , but thought I would share my thoughts on the seats I bought . <p> Seats D5 and D6 in the Upper Circle - paid 25 online but actually could buy for 20 at the theatre - if you buy one week in advance there is plenty of availability . <p> The seats had NO legroom and I am only 1.72 m ( 5 ' 8 " ) . Good view and could hear everything . The biggest problem was the heat . Everyone was peeling off layers , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during intervals . Would not buy these seats again . Noticed that Row A had much more legroom but restricted view with safety bar .

After 0 in the dress circle I have had row P centre in the dress circle , row W dress circle and row D in the stalls . <p> I have to say that from all of these seats I got something different from the show - but all were great . Row W of the dress circle - booked last minute - cheap - great overall view - took my cheap Argos binoculars for a closer view - but others in my party were still blown away by the show from here . <p> - only problem I have found with any of the dress circle seats - is the leaning forward person - if you have someone that does that - it is a real pain - but a polite word often does the trick . Row D of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal . Great as I 'd already seen the show - but maybe you miss out a little on the whole effect . I would book these / or closer again - as I saw lots of little things I had n't noticed from further back . <p> Dawn <p> A friend and I went to a preview on a Saturday afternoon ( 9th September 2006 ) and could n't believe the level of mobility within the audience . Not only were children getting up and moving around ( in some cases running ) or going out , but adults just seemed to think it was fine to wander about without so much as ducking down to avoid getting in the sightlines of the rest of us . I 've never seen such an inconsiderate audience . Add to that the childish wails from the far-too-small tots whod been brought along and were frightened by the bangs , crashes and lighting effects , and there was serious competition for the performers to contend with ! <p> We were seated in the Circle in Row T , seats 21 and 22 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very good ( my friend is 5 8 " ) and the view was fantastic central , clear and so well-raked that even with a couple of tallish people in front there was no problem at all . Very comfortable , although walking up and ( particularly ) down the fairly steep steps can be a bit heart-in-mouth , especially when being pushed by a crowd , as there is no handrail and the seatbacks are too low to grab if you stumble . Might be sensible to allow a few extra minutes if you 're at all concerned about mobility and have a Circle seat . Toilet facilities ( certainly for women ) totally inadequate ; the interval queue snaked down from upper level to the ground floor ... <p> The staging was highly dramatic and made good use of the vast , bowl-shaped auditorium , but technical glitches ( e.g. flying problems at the end of the first half ) spoiled what should have been some mega-moments . Singing ? Not impressed ; I thought there were some rather weak voices around , who did n't  seem entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ca n't remember so much as bar ; instantly forgettable . Choreography ? I presume there was some , but most of the action on stage appeared to be pretty random , relying on noise and movement rather than anything more polished . Story ? No idea what it was . Verdict ? 5 was about the right price ! <p> Although , they are high above the stage and a bit distant , for this price ( and 15 after previews ) , they are wonderful value . There are glasses , 50p if need be , but as most of the play is action on a grand scale , this distance is not a problem . Leg room is ok if you are 5 foot 6 or less . If you need to see every wrinkle and spot on the actor 's faces , pay 60 . <p> As this was only the third day of performances , entry was slow and badly organised . I think it was a full house too . There was no-one greeting and heading you in the direction of your seat . Signage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , programmes , witches hats and tee shirts though ! As usual , massive queues for the ladies toilets . Except for the latter , I 'm sure things will improve . <p> Stage setting , fantastic , especially the dragon . Lighting , brilliant , some of the best I have seen creating a wide range of settings and complimenting the staging brilliantly . <p> Music good , singing strong , especially the two witches . Costumes out of this world . Story , makes you think , but not too daunting . <p> Monkey will love this , may even be asked to join in certain scenes if they are short . <p> Problem , people arriving late and taking ages to find their seat and those who kept taking toilet breaks during the play . This is not the cinema . There is a different etiquette in theatres . It is called " consider others " . <p> Susan Richards . <p> I had 5 Wicked seats in the middle of row Q on Friday night ( 8th September 2006 ) - and what an absolute bargain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally clear view of the stage and you can really take in the enormity of the show . <p> I then went to queue for Wicked day seats on Saturday morning . I got there at 8.50am and was in a queue of about 50 people . All was calm ......... until the box office opened . I have never known such chaos ! The matinee people were called , so I jumped right to the front of the queue , only to be elbowed by an old woman . There were Americans shouting at the box office saying they were here from 7.30am etc , etc . Anyway , I got my tickets ! A bargain on the front row - although I 'd ensure you were as central as possible as many cast members block your view at a couple of moments towards the side . <p> Thankyou for your help on day seats - had to see Wicked again though ( not sure when I will get another chance ) Liam <p> I saw the show at the Saturday matinee performance , 9th September 2006 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who presumably all want to be witches , so there was considerable fidgeting and eating . Idina Menzel was fantastic and it is definitely " her " show - and she is received like a pop singer at a pop concert . At the moment Helen Dallimore seems uncertain as Glinda , particularly on her first entrance , but warmed up later and was giving a good performance by the second Act . <p> Miriam Margolyes and Nigel Planer were excellent and Martin Ball gave a good performance as the , rather underwritten , token animal in the show . There are the monkeys and a very badly designed lion cub as well , but his goat performance stands out . The chorus are great , lots of life and energy and jumping around , but there seem too few for the size of the stage . James Gillian and Katie Rowley Jones as Boq and Nessarose do their best with what they have , but there is not much in those roles to work with . Adam Garcia as Fiyero seemed to sleepwalk through this role when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if why he was there was a complete mystery to him . <p> The other major disappointment was the failure of Elphaba to fly . From pictures and videos of the New York performance I expected she would , during the " Defying Gravity " number . There were no announcements to apologise for the failure of equipment during my preview , so maybe she does n't . Perhaps other monkey reviewers will be able to clear this up for me . ( According to other reviewers there were problems with the equipment at this performance - Ed ) . <p> With certain reservations the set and costumes are great and I liked the Time Dragon who lies over the proscenium arch , waking up for the odd roar . Be warned that the glossy programmes seem to have pictures from the US productions , although I imagine pictures from London will appear once the show finishes previews . The key to this show is the performance of Idina Menzel , so my advice is to rush to see her before she leaves it in a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shock having a hit at last ! I have seen " Wicked " 3 times already and it 's " the business . " Twice in the stalls row E , which was great , and once in row P in the currently 5 priced seats which was okay - but not sure I would want to sit there again though . The front of the stage is a bit obscured by peoples ' heads , and in fact some of the action too , as the stage extends a bit and they use it quite often . But , great for 5 but in the main run ( 15 ) I do n't think they are really worth it , as with " Wicked " ( and Idina especially ) you just have to see her facial expressions to really enjoy her awesome performance . I can report that I absolutely hated Wicked , which I attended last night ( Tuesday 12 September 2006 ) and I stayed only until the interval . I thought the story was tedious and uninteresting , and the score was without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staging was disappointing . <p> After seeing the theatrical magic of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , Mary Poppins , The Lion King and even The Witches of Eastwick , I was expecting something imaginative and exciting , but alas it was neither . The best effect ( at least until the interval ) was the big dragon above the stage ! I genuinely get a big buzz when various spectacular things happened , like the car flying just before the end of the first act of Chitty , the wonderful things that came out of Mary Poppinss bag , as well as Bert walking all the way around the proscenium arch , and the three witches flying right out into the auditorium in The Witches of Eastwick ! There was nothing whatsoever in Act I of Wicked to compare with these sudden moments of theatrical brilliance ! I was expecting Elphaba to fly on her broomstick at the climax of the first act , but , despite the clever lighting effects , she just seemed to be standing on the top of a column or pillar and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme seemed to indicate that that was all that was supposed to happen at that moment . When we have seen spectacular flying effects in Chity Chitty Bang Bang ( for both the car and the child-catcher ) , Mary Poppins and The Witches of Eastwick , then it is an anticlimax to see Elphaba merely standing on top of a column in the centre of the stage ! <p> Its not really flying if Alpheba stands stock still atop her column ! Levitation , perhaps , but hardly flying ! Certainly not by the standards set in The Witches of Eastwick or Mary Poppins where the characters not only fly , but actually come right out into the auditorium over the heads of the audience . OK , so you could see the wires , but it was still thrilling . I could see some wires attached to Elphaba but they did n't  seem to be serving any purpose , because she did n't  move . <p> The audience of some 2,400 people seemed to be all under the age of 25 ( apart from me , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least when they werent all getting up and going to the toilet during the performance . I was amazed at how much they seemed to approve of everything they saw and heard . I guess I am just an old fogey who prefers good tunes and intelligent staging . How sad can that be ! Maybe I should just go to things I know and love like Guys and Dolls , Chicago and The Boy Friend ! <p> Paid 15 for seat 37 row L of the circle and OMG what amazing seats . Could see the whole stage and take in the amazing sets and costumes from there . As for the show ( 13th September 2006 , matinee ) WOOOOOWWW . It was completely faultless . <p> Sets and costumes were stunning . Singing pretty good , especially from Idina , it was only Fiyero who disappointed with a slightly weak " Dancing through Life . " <p> " Defying Gravity " was ' wicked ' as Elphaba flies into the sky , again amazing vocals from Idina . Overall this has to be the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets whilst there still are some before Idina goes . <p> On a small side note , leg room is insufficient for taller people ( I 'm 5foot 11 ) . <p> Saw the matinee performance of " Wicked ! " Wed 13th September 2006 . Sat in seats 18 and 19 Row M Dress Circle . Seats only 15 each ( in previews ) and EXCELLENT value for money . We had a clear view of the massive stage and set . I ca n't see any reason to pay top prices if you can get seats in this section of the circle . I did have a walk up to the rear of the circle to see what the 5 seats were like . A bit too high up for me but great at that price . <p> The show was magical . Lots of fun , very spectacular and damn good family entertainment . For a Wednesday matinee to get a standing ovation , it must be good ! <p> Only one complaint : the constant barrage of theatre staff trying to sell you things . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interval we kept having programmes and cd 's thrust at us . I refused to buy from one guy about three times and , on his final attempt to sell me a cd , he said ' Do n't worry , you 'll change your mind and buy one on the way out ! ' . <p> Paul Nicholls . <p> A previous review cites one of " Wicked 's " main shortcomings as that it is short on flying cars and general midair suspension . Quite frankly , Idina Menzel could stand on a plastic garden chair and still impress you . During " Defying Gravity " where the ' flying ' occurs , it is her vocal acrobatics which are meant to blow you away as opposed to any flapping around the proscenium arch on a highwire . In fact , any Peter Pan antics would have detracted from the wonderful moment for Elphaba 's character which occurs in the song ; whereas the simple raised flying effect ( which thankfully , was working fine on the evening performance on the 13th September 2006 ) really complements what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying fan , Elphabas winged monkeys are quite a treat anyway . <p> The show in my humble opinion , is wonderful . The presence of so many young fans that whoop and clap at every song , merely shows " Wicked 's " cult status . I personally thought that the audience reactions came in all the right places and did n't  really detract from what was going on on stage , although if I had of been in a matinee full of 13 year old girls I may have disagreed . I also do n't  really see any problem with an audience full of young people ; in fact I think its quite refreshing . At least we are n't all out jacking cars . Anyway , I think the audience reactions may settle a little once the die hard fans have been once or twice to drool over the Idina Menzels singing /Adam Garcia ( delete as applicable ) . <p> The whole look of the show was amazing and the chorus were wonderful . Idina Menzel was the best thing I have seen on stageever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have heard from a few people that Helen Dallimore as Glinda has seemed a little nervous . On our night she was n't . I thought she judged the tone of the character beautifully , and made Glinda , despite her foibles , quite endearing . I had to stop myself grinning every time she came on stage . Her English accent has become a contentious point amongst fans but I felt it worked . <p> Wicked is fun , fun , fun . Do n't  go if you want a serious night at the theatre . However , for all its knowing Oz references and silliness , it does actually examine the relationship between two friends , through all of its ups and downs , beautifully . Everyone can identify with Elphaba in some way ( even if the majority of us are not green ) and for many it really does strike a chord . Go see it ! <p> Hannah M <p> Went to see " Wicked " tonight ( 15th September 2006 ) , well to be more accurate I saw about 45 minutes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've ever seen . It 's also the first time I have ever walked out of a theatre . I could n't take it anymore ... The big tacky expensive sets , the corny musical numbers , the bad BAD acting and the smugness of it just drove me crazy ! All the characters are the usual boring clichTs you see time and time again , the outcast , the popular girl , the stern headmistress ... Oh I could go on but I ca n't put into words how naff it is . It 's like if musicals were restaurants , " Wicked " would be McDonalds . <p> I was gobsmacked that everyone was so into it , clapping and whistling and whooping at every lame joke . Agh ! It was like being at a football match being stuck amongst such ill-mannered people . The ushers were letting latecomers in the theatre even up to half an hour late . Not just those in the aisle seats either ! When we finally walked out , one of the ushers ran after us and said " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standoffish when we said we were leaving . Perhaps he was upset we did n't buy something from the wide range of crappy merchandise ! <p> Well , if something other than " Wicked " was on at the Apollo Victoria , I would recommend our seats . S44 and S45 . The aisle seats have loads of legroom , although the seats are very narrow for the ample of bottom ! <p> Natalie I saw the first preview on 7th September 2006 and saw the show again on the 14th . My word , they have worked hard on it during that week ! Not that the first preview was bad - but one week later the production looks totally ' match fit ' . <p> Idina Menzel totally nailed that performance on the 14th - ' Defying Gravity ' and ' No Good Deed ' were awesome . I know its something she 's sung maybe 400 times but she seemed to have completely relaxed into the London production and the reticence to go for the most demanding notes that was apparent in the first show - mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen Dallimore 's Glinda has come on leaps and bounds in that week . The comic timing is now spot on - ' thank goodness ' they 've reinstated ' unprepossessing features ' instead of ' unflattering features ' which just did not work in ' Popular ' . I think everyone in the UK is so used to the OBCR* that a dotty very English Glinda was a bit of a shock - but seeing and hearing the portrayal for a second time - it 's just great and its getting funnier . I think Helen is going to grow into that part even more over the next week or two . The only bit of comic timing she could improve is the line in ' Popular ' when she is telling Elphaba : - ' let 's start ' cos you 've got an awfully long way to go ' - it needs a bit more emphasis to indicate what a ' state ' Elphaba is in . I 've seen an illicit bit of video on the web where one of the US actresses rolls her hands over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> Nigel Planer seemed to loosen up as the Wizard too . There was more swank and panache than a week ago and the singing was more enthusiastic - he seemed to be really going for it and just more confident . <p> Miriam Margolyes and Martin Ball seemed to be at the top of their game in the first preview and to me they were playing Madame Morrible and Dr Dillamond just the same tonight - they seem ' home and dry ' and do n't need to tamper with anything . <p> Adam Garcia as Fiyero ? I saw lots of negative comments on the web about his performance and he still looks uneasy to me . He 's fine in Act Two where Fiyero is more serious - Captain of the Guard and all that - but its ' Dancing through Life ' that lacks a bit of swagger and well - sex . I do n't know if the choreography for London is exactly the same for London as for the US productions but it seems to me that it 's Fiyero 's moves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Glinda is obviously ' hooked ' - but he needs a few sexier dance moves - let him ' Tony Manero ' it a bit to get the sexy and dissolute prince 's character across to the rest of us . Adam is obviously great looking - let him use his attributes to the best advantage in the Ozdust ballroom . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with his ability - it 's the part that 's not quite right . <p> I 'm still not convinced that the sound is right - I have no idea how that is adjusted - or if it can be - but where principals are singing with the full company e.g. in ' One Short Day ' they are not quite prominent enough - Idina and Helen were not sufficiently ' picked out ' when singing the ' there are buildings tall as quoxwood trees / dress salons / and libraries / palaces /museums / a hundred strong ' . I was in E36 in the stalls - which is very much to the side of the theatre - perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have done with a more treble sound to the principal vocals from there and picked them out even more in the mix . But what do I know ? <p> All I can say is ' very well done guys ' - technicians and performers - everyone seems to be really believing they can pull this off now - I am really looking forward to seeing the show again at the charity preview and getting to have a chat with some of you at the dinner - if you have any energy left to make that ! *Original Broadway Recording <p> I ca n't rave enough about the day seats for this show ! ! Only 15 ( during previews ) for a front row seat ! I 'm the sort of person who likes to be ' up close and personal ' with the actors . I like to see their facial expressions , hear every comment , witness things you can only see from the front . I also like to loose myself in a show - envisage myself in Oz with no other audience heads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that you have to get the day seats ! <p> There is no restricted view like some theatre day seats . At the Apollo Victoria you can see the whole stage . The only effect you do n't get the full benefit of is the dragon fixed above the stage and green lighting that reaches up into the balcony when the characters arrive at the Emerald City . <p> Idina Menzel has to be seen ( and heard ) to be believed . In fact even now I 've seen the show twice I 'm not sure I can get my head around how amazing that woman is ! Her voice is incredible ! I 've never heard anything like it on stage before . She literally took my breath away during Defying Gravity . <p> I saw the show on both the 14th and 15th September 2006 . Whereas the 14th ran perfectly smoothly from start to finish , the 15th was riddled with mishaps . It was all handled very well by actors and crew alike and I did n't sense any upset from the audience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the 100% polished show - they are still rehearsing and ironing out the creases . That 's why the seats are cheaper ! ! <p> For me personally it enhanced my enjoyment - a small glimpse at the people behind the costumes when they slipped out of character for a few seconds , for example when an ensemble member in a big ' weeble ' type costume fell over and could n't get up again during ' One Short Day ' . A stage hand had to come on stage and help him up resulting in a very amusing finish to the song which was spluttered by a laughing Idina rather than sung ! <p> It was also fun to see Idina 's impromptu little jig for the audience after a piece of set broke down in the second act and the show had to be paused for 10 minutes . As she said herself " That 's live theatre folks ! " <p> The only negative I can come up with is the queues for toilets / bar / merchandise . They 're huge ! ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you 're sat right by the exit and you can jump up as soon as the safety curtain falls ! <p> This is a must see show for anyone with a love for musicals , an imagination and a heart ! If you 're a Harry Potter fan this is for you . It you like the more serious and believable shows do n't bother . <p> Wicked is big , glitzy , glam and above all ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC ! ! ! <p> Sarah Clarke . <p> Travelled from Dublin specially to see Wicked on Monday 11th September 2006 , and was not disappointed . Sat in the Circle Row D 5 and 6 . Good seats , but could not see all of the front of the stage without leaning forward . Idina Menzel was spectacular - what a voice ! Some " technical problems " after " One Short Day " meant a delay of about 15 minutes which was annoying as people thought it was the interval and began to move about . When it did resume it was only about ten minutes before the REAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all though , I have to say - " What a Show ! ! " We knew all the songs , from playing the CD for months on end , and will travel back again in another few weeks to enjoy it all over again and hopefully this time there will be NO technical problems ! Verdict : Brilliant - Do n't  Miss It ! Lynda <p> Saw " Wicked " at the evening performance on 16th September 2006 . Our party of 5 was in row ZA of the Stalls seats 19 to 23 . The seats were comfortable , with plenty of legroom ( tallest 5 ' 11 " ) . We found these seats to be excellent , I was worried about being so far back , but the steep rake allowed for an excellent view and even the children in our party could see the stage reasonably well with adults sitting in front . Binoculars were 50p but not really necessary . The biggest drawback was the heat . It was stiflingly hot . I ca n't imagine what it must have been like higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the longest I 've ever seen . Thank goodness for a cast iron bladder ! <p> I thoroughly enjoyed the show ( apart from the teenage whooping mentioned elsewhere ) . Idina was something else . Her live performance far excelled the CD recording . Shivers up the spine . Nigel Planer &amp; Miriam M were excellent . I would agree that Adam Garcia 's Fiyero lacked sex appeal . Stephen Schwartz was in the sound booth and kindly signed my programme . I saw the show in Chicago , and maybe I enjoyed the London performance much more as it was second time around , but I do n't think it was entirely down to that . This is a great blockbuster show and wonderful entertainment . The critics will probably hate it - too ' popular ' perhaps ? See it with Idina while you can . <p> Rebecca , Fareham , Hampshire <p> Just wanted to mention that seats R19 and 20 in the Circle are over the stairwell , and if you are sitting there you need to lean forward the whole time , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think these seats are meant to be sold , as they should have been empty on Saturday ( 16th September 2006 , matinee ) but two latecomers sat there for the first half . So definitely ones to avoid . Also theatre needs to sort out getting people in - the foyer was very overcrowded and the queues for the ladies were the worst I have ever seen , all the way down the staircase . <p> I sat in row E of the Dress Circle at a preview performance of Wicked , and whilst the view was very good indeed , the sound was very very poor . The orchestra sounded as if they were in another building and the cast could have been singing in French for all we could tell . the dialogue was not much better - you really had to strain to hear what was being said and a lady sitting next to me summed it up when she said that " This is billed as the untold story of the witches of Oz - I have sat through three hours and am no wiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preview but they HAVE to sort this problem out - at 55 a ticket it is not on . I do gather that the sound is better in the stalls but I can not confirm this . ( later ) ..... Well I said I would give it a second go , and indeed I did last night ( final preview 26th September 2006 ) - I was so hoping that after 10 days the show would have improved but alas it left me cold again . <p> I know they have been playing at night and rehearsing during the day but everyone apart from Miriam was as flat as a pancake . Again I sat in the front section of the Dress and again the sound was dreadful . The orchestra sounds hollow and flat - the singing is a blur ( no chance of hearing the words ) and the dialogue is lost . Now call me old fashioned but I do like to hear the script . What is interesting is there must be some amusing lines as the stalls laugh but the circle - no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being said . Have the sound staff not sat in the front dress to hear the level or do they know the show so well that the actual dialogue is now not important I wonder . <p> On my last visit I thought that the end of act one was ok but nothing special - was something not working ? Well , last night just the same - cherry picker and loads of black material . Now I like inventive ( i.e. " The 39 Steps " ) but at these prices one expects more than a lift - think what can be done - flying in " The Witches of Eastwick " , " Chitty " , " M. Poppins " - now whether you like the shows or not the effects there were stunning - Wicked is so LAME . <p> Typical American show - lots of gloss and hype - no substance and oh so clinical . <p> Michael <p> We have seen Wicked twice now and I wanted to comment on sound . The first time was from the back of the circle Row W at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was fantastic . We could hear every word clearly even from the ensemble and the songs really belted out to us . They seem to have additional speakers behind the audience there too ( very noticeable during the " Wizard head " talking for example ) . <p> This time we saw it on Monday September 18th 2006 from the front of the circle Row D and whilst the sound was adequate it was certainly not stunning . It was much louder and clearer in the cheap seats . Last night there was a more " muddy " sound with lyrics sometimes hard to understand . Individual voices were mostly okay but as soon as more than one person sang it was hard to follow lyrics . Whilst it is great to have a much closer view of the stage people should be aware that at the side block ( we sat in D38 and D39 ) there is a quite high horizontal bar on the front of the Circle that I found slightly irritating because I found myself having to look under it to see the actors when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that jut out . <p> I was a fan of the show from Broadway and I am very happy to see Idina Menzel here as Elphaba , she is simply stunning especially during her big numbers ( The Wizard and I , Defying Gravity and No Good Deed ) . Helen Dallimore is getting much better as Galinda , initially she was n't getting the laughs although she has a lovely voice and can easily sing the role . Last night it was obvious she has worked hard to develop her performance and I liked her very much . Adam Garcia is just badly directed I think , whilst he is improving he is still not that likeable as Fiyero , that role worked much better in the show with Norbert Leo Butz 's American slouch approach rather than an English upper class twit character that we have . The show looks fantastic with a first rate ensemble and overall it is an absolute treat for theatregoers . <p> I could n't attend the ' Clients evening ' ( performance for group bookings clients - ed ) on 13th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grand-daughter went instead . I asked my grand-daughter what she thought of it and she replied as only a nine year old would , with just the one obvious word . " WICKED ! ! ! ! ! " <p> Have just returned from " Wicked " ( 19th September 2006 ) and I loved it - it 's an imaginative story with good characterisation , extremely well sung and acted , cleverly staged , excellently dressed , beautifully lit , BUT and it 's a huge BUT - the sound was awful . Not being familiar with the words I found it very hard to know what was going on at times . We were right in the middle of Row G in the Dress Circle and the sound was truly dreadful - the only thing we could hear clearly was the percussion track which was very annoying at times and , of course , Miriam Margolyes who has the best speaking voice in England . If I 'd been able to hear better it would I think have been one of the best shows I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to find someone to complain to but with no luck . <p> Morvey We saw Wicked on one of the preview nights , 19th September 2006 . We had been looking forward to this for many months . First of all - the cast ... - overall - excellent ! Idina Menzel certainly lived up to the ' hype ' - great voice and fantastic expressions . Helen Dallimore as Glinda was good - managed to hit those high notes beautifully , although her speaking accent was a bit wobbly and inconsitant at times . Adam Garcia as Fiyero was a bit of a disappointment - great dancing , but zero charisma and a mediocre voice ( in my opinion ) . Nigel Planer is great as the Wizard , I loved Martin Ball 's Dr Dillimore . James Gillan and Katie Rowley Jones were a great pairing as Boq and Nessa . Both have wonderful voices and gave some of the most expressive performances in the show . The ensemble were outstanding - so much energy ! For me , Miriam Margoyles was the best performer - she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter - her voice , delivery and actions were both comic and quite chilling at various points in the story - she was made for this role ! ( although there was a couple of lines at the start of the first scene where she really sounded like Lady Whiteadder - I thought she was going to mention turnips ! ) <p> From the technical point of view , for me , the lighting and effects were fantastic , but I think the best was the costumes and the wigs ( wigs rarely seem to get a mention - shame ! ) . I know some other people have commented on the sound . we were in the Circle , Row E 31 to 33 - the sound was fine , possibly slightly quiet , but I had no problems hearing any of the show . having been to some shows where the balance of music / vocals have sometimes been disproportionate , I was pleased that the balance seems right here . Re . the seats - legroom is a bit tight , but the view was fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is well worth seeing , even at top price , for the sheer spectacle . We have already booked to see it again in October . <p> Ali <p> Wicked ? It was n't even good ! <p> I went to see Wicked last Tuesday night ( 19th September 2006 ) - I had no idea of the hype beforehand , it was a spontaneous decision - there was a spare ticket going and first saw the film and loved it when I was a small child . We sat in the stalls in the middle , of the front section . <p> Firstly the acoustics were bad , the music was highly forgettable - occasionally you could hear a few bars and think this is promising but then plummet into mediocrity again , the voices were for the most part shrill ( Helen Dallimore was very guilty here ) . Miriam Margolyes singing was non-existent . Adam Garcia and James Gillan definitely had the best voices in the cast . Idina Menzel was ok , certainly not inspiring . The choreography was dull and clompy . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story linked in cleverly to the film and the sheer enthusiasm of the cast - for the sake of the cast , I hope it runs . <p> I was n't the only person to feel the same way about this production - there were a number of people in the audience who like me were unable to clap and I counted at least twenty who walked out at the interval . However , always a perennial optimist I stayed until the end but wish I had n't I could n't understand the reaction of the audience who got up and gave the cast a standing ovation , stamping and cheering , ( perhaps I was seeing a different production ? ) , if I were being polite I would say that the whole production was very weak , however I could never describe it as " Wicked " only really rather bad . <p> We attended the preview show on Friday 22 September 2006 . We had seats in Q35 and 36 of the dress circle . Although we were a long way back , it was nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite spectacular . We had no problems with sound at all . As to be expected from sitting so far back , we missed all the nuances of expression etc from the performers but as we managed to get them for only 5 ( preview price ) each seat , we certainly could n't complain ! <p> The show itself was truly " wicked " and " wonderful " . It was refereshing to see an original show with such an entertaining story and wonderful score . The first thing I did when arriving home was to track down the cheapest place online to buy the soundtrack from ( HMV by the way ! ) . I am also so glad we managed to see Idina Menzel who sent shivers down my spine during her " belters " . Galinda was raising many laughs with her delivery and we truly could n't fault any of the performances . We were surprised at how good a singing voice Nigel Planer had ! Overall , this is a fantastic show and I would thoroughly recommend it . Have fun trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ! ! <p> Do go and see this show ! <p> Mandi <p> Friday , 22nd September 2006 . Predictably , online excitement about Wicked at the Apollo Victoria is amassing volcanically as it did for the superb OBC Recording , now boasting more than 600 Amazon ( US ) reviews and Londons so ready for it ! <p> Let 's not beat around the bush : Schwartz is a genius ; listen to Pippin ( 1972 ) , the work of a 24-year-old which made more than $3m on Broadway , and judge for yourself . History encourages us to believe that artists , musicians , writers of substance have a work in them a Guernica , or Sound and the Fury which perhaps surpasses all other personal achievement , and so it is with Schwartz in his chosen field : Wicked is his best , and better than anything we 've seen in the UK . The 2000-strong standing ovation at Fridays preview , and the block-long queue of cameraphones desperate for Idina well over an hour after the show , bear witness to this . <p> What an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West End like it : a huge , collective , monumentally visceral anticipation . And when , when did a Creative Team last come together so emphatically ? The Book is dark but compellingly wry , Mantellos direction as ingenious and sure-footed as in Take Me Out ( 2002 ) at the Donmar , the design , staging and costume all scrupulously detailed , and , wow , the lighting . The ticket prices are high but , for once , you feel the money has been well spent , not least on Gareth Valentine , possibly the most inspirational force in London Musical Theatre . So many talented people , all at the very top of their game . <p> Other reviewers have discussed the cast and the intricacies of the set . Suffice it to say , I did n't  spot any technical hitches at this performance . Of the principals , Helen Dallimore was spot on ( tuneful , spirited , engaging ) , Adam Garcia , very watchable , and Idina Menzel utterly amazing ( no wonder there 's so much gnashing on Amazon about not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before she flies off for good , its quite simple . She defies both gravity and belief ! <p> Wicked rocks and so to Press Night , and to the other three performances I 've booked . <p> Richard Sutton SE18 <p> My husband and I went to see this show on Tuesday 19th September 2006 after months of anticipation and I can happily report that we were not at all disappointed . The show was magical , moving and above all we could not get over how funny it was and with a sharp script and a cast of well bedded in characters . We plan to see it again as soon as possible . <p> The set is magic and also hides some nifty and yet very simple and effective transformations so just by a few extras one minute you can be in a magical ballroom of Disney-sequel proportions or a beautiful poppy garden with an ornate bridge spanning the stage and lit by candlelight . There is creative lighting , mechanical wizardry and even video and projector images all used to great effect . <p> We sat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worth full price , we were bang level with the ( enormous ) time dragon ( who sparked lots of oohs from the audience whenever in motion ) and when Elpheba flew in Defying Gravity we had a fantastic overall view of the whole scene one suspects you would not get in the stalls . <p> To the cast ; Miriam Margolyes gives everyone a lesson in voice projection , Idina Menzel is ten times better than she sounds on the CD , Adam Garcia is effortless , Helen Dallimore a wonderful character actress with good comic timing , Martin Ball evokes sympathy and gives some funny and touching moments , Nigel Planer is just " wonderful " as the wizard ( again big mention to the wizard setup - wow very impressive ) and backed up with a solid cast of talented dancers and ensemble . The monkeys are really well done , wings very clever and very effectively portrayed . <p> The problems people seem to be having with this show is they have only the CD to base it on and every actor interprets the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters . For example having read peoples opinions on Adam Garcia 's performance before we went we kept an open mind and after Dancing Through Life my husband turned to me and said " I have no complaints ... " . His only problem is the brief dancing he does is quite contemporary which is a little ... well , gay for him . He is not gay ( thank god hey ladies ? ! ) and he does his best to funk it up the way his character would . Plus with the exception of Elpheba and the Wizard the cast have been made British and given clear cut accents - which avid fans of the soundtrack may find odd to begin with . But its early days and good for them for trying something new and bringing it to our audiences rather than so many musicals being americanified ( Full Monty anyone ... ? ! ) <p> Only problems is the sound could go up a notch especially the orchestra I wanted to be blasted out my seat by that overture and I was not , it sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again early previews yet ! <p> Seats at the very back in the Circle I personally would avoid they were miles high and I looked at them thankful I was not swayed by the cheap offer and had paid the money . <p> The atmosphere was electric , people cheered after every song , they cheered even more at Elpheba 's first entrance and they were the best behaved audience I have seen in a long time , plus of course at the finale not one person remained seated and I suspect mostly not a dry eye in the house . <p> One word sums it up for me " Wicked " . This is what theatre is all about ! <p> I finally saw Wicked , the London production last week ( 18th September 2006 ) . It was a pleasure to finally see Idina , especially as I saw Shoshana on Broadway last year . What can I say about London ? It was good , but I think I still prefer the Broadway production . I feel Glinda does n't quite work being a " Sloaney " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really a dumb character . I have to say , Katie who played Nessarose was absolutely amazing , as was Martin Ball and James . Adam certainly had the moves . I eagerly await press night and the reviews . Oooh sat in the the front of the Dress Circle . It definitely was a great view to take in all the effects of " Defying Gravity " and a good place to appreciate the staging and choreography . Jazz <p> I went to the final preview of Wicked last night - 26th September 2006 . <p> A really good show which tells the story of the two witches from the Wizard of Oz , with a few references to the Judy Garland version too . <p> I was sat in Row S of the Circle and paid just 5 for my ticket . It was very , very loud and I felt the lady who played the part of Elsaba had rather a shrill voice . A couple of scary bits for the younger ones too . <p> The air-conditioning was blasting out - in fact , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first half it was so cold . <p> The show was finished by 10.30pm for those rushing to get trains etc . <p> Judith <p> I have seen the show twice now , first time in the stalls row R 24 and 25 and second time stalls row C seats 18 and 19 . I had an amazing experience is both , but it depends on what you prefer . Row R enables you to take in the whole stage and offers excellent views and sound , though there is a walk way in front so people are able to walk past during the performance which can be annoying , especially during a good number . Row C let 's you become completely absorbed in the action . I love seeing the actors close up and thought this was fab . You are slightly looking up but this is a small matter really . Defying gravity is awesome and I was blown away by this in both seats , row C was fantastic for this song . Idina 's voice is simply beautiful and is a joy to watch . Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more WOW ! <p> If you have never been to a London musical before make sure Wicked is your first choice . I can not recommend it too highly . It is fantastic , amazing , the best show ever ! <p> All the cast are superb . Quality of singing from Idina Menzel is exceptional . The ensemble were first class too and set is fantastic especially the dragon and the neon green set for Oz . <p> As part of the audience I felt it was a really moving production and enjoyed the atmosphere as everyone applauded each song . It was a real credit to the cast that it all culminated in an explosion of tearful cheering , applause and not one person sat in their seats ! All of my party wanted to stay and watch the performance again and again . <p> As a party of 10 I felt very nervous about the position of the seats I had booked to see Wicked on Saturday 30th September 2006 . Even though I had consulted Theatre Monkey to help me decide I was still unsure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be worth the money we had paid . We were sat in the stalls row S24 to 33 . Well I should n't have been worried at all . The view from row S was ideal to see everything and to feel totally included in OZ , but I 'm going to have to go back again to take in things I must have missed as there was so much going on at times . <p> If you are due to see Wicked soon be assured of one thing you will be blown away ! <p> Julia . <p> Wicked is great , definitely a big show worth watching . The Wizard of Oz is a timeless classic and the play helps to answer some of the questions that might have been lingering afterwards . <p> After reading reviews here we paid for top price tickets in the stalls ( J22 and 23 ) , what a big mistake . Out of all the seats in the theatre , the guy with the biggest head and curliest ridiculous hair had to be sitting in front of me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sufficed to say my enjoyment was cut drastically . The seats are not set aside to one another either , i.e. the seat in the row in front of you will be directly in front of you rather than to one side where you would be able to see through a gap between heads . Others around me were finding it hard to see past taller people in front of them as well given that the rake in the stalls is virtually non-existent . I would advise you seriously think about this and perhaps sit in the Circle instead or the first few rows in the Stalls . I heard two people on the radio talking about " Wicked " and how you simply must go and see it , ' you wo n't regret it ' they said . Well , I am writing these thoughts 19 hours after the end of the October 3rd 2006 performance , and you know what ? I ca n't remember the tune of a single song . <p> I was sat comfortably in the dress circle row J seat 28 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , cost 49 with all the extras . On comes Helen Dallimore as Glinda and I found it difficult to distinguish what she was saying . I had similar problems with all the female characters apart of course from Miriam Margoyles whose every word was crystal clear . I experienced a similar problem as mentioned by another correspondent . The audience was laughing and as I did n't hear properly I could n't understand why , although a couple in front of me seemed to get everything OK . <p> All through the first half I wondered what is this all about , and what was that dragon doing there ? Will it fly ? What will it do ? Answer , not a lot really . The first half ended with ' Defying Gravity ' which partly stirred me after the tedium which had preceded it , but even this was n't that great . Again , I am mirroring another correspondent 's views when I say I watched in awe and wonder as the car " flew " in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang . I felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that show . The sets were very good , costumes were very good as was the lighting , especially the way they lit the side of theatre with green when Emerald City was being portrayed but there was n't a show stopping moment , well not for me there was n't . <p> I thought the second half must be better . I heard a similar comment from someone in the bar during the interval , not that I would purchase a drink at those ridiculous prices . I was stretching my legs . Second half started , ca n't remember how or with what , probably a song or two and how about some dancing ? Well that was n't very good either . In fact it completely lacked energy throughout . Although , fair play to the monkeys . They flitted about all over , and above the stage and looked more animated than most . <p> Now for Idina Menzel . A loud voice , yes but I also had problems understanding what she was saying , and not only her speech . There was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very loud but I had no idea what it was about because I could hardly distinguish a word , let alone a line . I noticed a light two seats down from me , it was a woman looking at her mobile phone , very bad manners but showed she was bored with the show . It was almost a relief when it was all over . The audience went mad , most were standing applauding loudly and there was no curtain call , just a scant acknowledgment of the applause and let 's get the curtain down so we can go home attitude . <p> At least it did n't take that long to get out of the theatre because the Apollo Victoria has two exits . I travelled to the show by motorcycle and at the bike park ( conveniently located very near ) I spoke to someone who was unlocking his bike ready to leave . I said have you watched the show ? He said ' no I work backstage . Did you enjoy it ? ' he said . I said ' no , not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can say you 've seen it . ' Well you can also say that if you go , but do n't be fooled by the hype , as is shown by the fact that I ca n't remember a single song means that to me it was instantly forgettable . This is the first " new " musical I 've seen . Previously I have know at least some of the songs before attending a show and have gone out of the theatre humming at least one tune , but I can honestly say I went out of the Apollo not remembering one . I should have got the soundtrack from somewhere , but after that glowing recommendation from those two on the radio ........... The reviewer from " The Times " was right , two stars out of 5 . <p> Stephen <p> Well what can I say ? One of the best musicals I have seen ! ! ! I can thoroughly recommend this show . We wanted to see this show when we were in the States last year but could n't get a ticket for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience of the performance we saw ! ) so when we found out it was coming to London we booked tickets early . <p> We were in the stalls ( J22 and J23 ) these were somewhat disappointing - the rows are all on one level so if you have a tall person in front of you , you have to keep dodging their head when characters are centre stage . I suggest for the stalls either buying tickets further back ( from row Q ) where the seats slope or if you want to be near the front do n't go in the centre that way you are always looking diagonally so people in front of you do not get in the way . The stage itself was fantastically set . <p> If you love the story of the Wizard of Oz ( as I do ) then you will love ' Wicked ' , its alternative story for the witches of Oz ties in beautifully to the original story with every attention to detail ! <p> Finally I must say if you decide to go and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the reason for this .... IDINA MENZEL . She won the Tony award for this role in the States and my god you can see why ! It was the best performance in a musical I have ever seen , she literally took my breath away . I 'm sure her replacement will be brilliant but she was out of this world , so I would get your tickets quickly so not to miss out . <p> All in all 10/10 ! ! ! <p> I booked preview tickets for the whole family to see this show on September 19th 2006 . We sat in Dress Circle row S , seats 27 to 30 . The theatre is set out in such a way that you could probably see the stage to a decent degree no matter where you sat if you are of average height , but being only 5 ' tall , I have trouble seeing anything wherever I go . Although the rear circle has a good rake , we had a tall man in front of us and we had to swap seats around so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But even he had problems and had to constantly lean to one side to get a proper view . Then of course there were safety bars right at the front of the circle , so the four rows in front of us all in turn had to lean forward , until we were all leaning forward to see over someone 's shoulder ! I had a neck ache for days after . <p> The show itself was indeed ' Wicked ' . We all thoroughly enjoyed Idina'a fabulous voice , she really is a talented performer . We were disappointed however that ' Glinda ' - although very talented - was played by an Australian woman with an English accent , and therefore the song ' Popular ' lacked the quaint little lilt of tone that the very American original artiste portrayed . Also we thought it a shame that Madam Morrible did not attempt to sing at any time ! ( on the CD soundtrack she sings ) . The three women in our party particularly enjoyed Adam Garcia . The mobile set and colourful costumes were fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really blown away by the lighting and special effects . <p> All in all , despite having a raging stiff neck for a few days , we all enjoyed this show immensely and would happily recommend it to anyone to see it . <p> Jan <p> Well what can I say .... in a word F A N T A S M A G O R I C A L ! ! ! <p> I went to see the show with 28 other Cast members from G.A.P.S - Gatwick Airport Pantomime Society ( www.gatwickpanto.co.uk ) and we were sat to the side of the Stalls in rows G , H , and J seats 32 to 45ish . <p> As you walk up the steps into the theatre the sheer buzz that you get from the masses and crowds is just out of this world . This show seems to appeal to such a wide mixture of patrons such as Families , Homosexuals , Grandparents , Students .... the list is endless . <p> These seats were excellent and a fun and most memorable time was had by all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monkey 's site . A very clear uninterrupted view . <p> For any musical or show , I would always recommend front Stalls as the best seating . <p> Idina Menzel , and Miriam Margolyes really make the show . Idina 's Voice is truly unmatched by anybody else , she makes your whole body shudder with delight and leaves you feeling like " wow how does she do that " and what can I say about Miriam , dear Miriam , she bumbles onto the stage all voluptuous and boisterous and its then that you know you are watching sheer class ! <p> When Idina walks out there is a massive cheer which at one point felt like we were at a pop concert at Wembley , as she generated such an tremendous buzz ( probably being as she is along the same lines of stardom as Julia Roberts in the USA ) <p> I 'm going again to see the show on in December with my long-time friend Ian , and we have somehow managed to get seats J30 to 31 after plenty of ringing around ( finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats priced at 55gbp+fees will be just ............ WICKED ! ! ! ! ! <p> After many hours listening to the Original Broadway Cast recording and enjoying the music greatly , I got on the phone on the day of the tickets being released and booked two seats for Wicked . Normally I would have booked mid-price seats for a West End show but I thought , " what the hell let 's splash out , " so I got seats M 24 and 25 in the stalls for 55 quid each . Before I go into the review proper I will tell you about these seats and the technical aspects of the production . Other readers of Theatremonkey have commented on the lack of rake in the front centre stalls . This is a problem but we were very fortunate to have two children in front of us ( there is no off centre seats i.e. they are all behind one another in this block ) . Consequently we enjoyed a perfectly central uninterrupted view of one of the most lavish sets I have ever seen . Close enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the whole effect of the set and which does not restrict itself just to the stage ( genius usage of the LED fabulousness that is the Apollo Vic ) . I would like to predict now that Mr Lee will add to his awards collection with the London transfer of his set . <p> With regard to the lighting of the showit could not have been more perfect ( another predicted awards bonanza for Mr Posner ) . Stunning visual treats were created with both set and lighting , the like of which I have not seen before and do not imagine seeing again until a certain big budget show comes to the Drury Lane next year . What really adds to the spectacle is Susan Hilfertys extraordinary costumes of which there were loads ! ! I can not imagine how crazy a life of a " Wicked " dresser must be but , my god , the quick changes were everywhere and unless you were paying attention you would not notice the fact that most of the cast changed from one mentally complicated costume into another in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the show . <p> I then come to the bandoh my frikkin god , they were brilliant . One of the best gatherings under a stage in a long , long time . I would like to moan about one moment when a trumpet was about a quarter tone flat which ruined the whole show for me ( I joke monkey loversits just that as a musician these things are a bit more noticeable for me ) . Some readers have also commented on the sound . I thought it was perfect with the correct variation in volume for each movement and song and my god they have to bash it out when a certain green girl starts to sing with wonderful megaphone style belting qualities ( odd compliment but it works ) . Right let 's get to the nitty gritty of the Wicked experience . I will unusually begin with pre-auditorium entry . Jesus wept people , avoid going into the theatre too earlythe place is rammed and you can hardly move . I have a feeling that most people were trying to avoid the bloomin ' awful stench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blighting the Victoria area on Wednesday afternoon and causing hundreds of people to walk about with scarves and hands over their nostrils in a fashion that would n't have been out of place in a smog filled east Asian mega city in the summer months . <p> Stinkfication aside we got into the theatre and took our fabulous seats .. ooh very comfy and with decent legroom too , and marvelled at the twinkling emerald city and the cogs and gears of the dragon clock . It was very clear that Wicked had already achieved teenage cult status with girls wandering about in show t-shirts and odd looking ladies getting excited over their 15th viewing of the show . One must remember that it was half term for schools ( reason I was there ) and that it was definitely a family visit to London occasion which I loved as the buzz before the show was brilliant and when the band started to play cheers and yelps one would normally experience at a ' Take That ' concert ( albeit not as fun as ' Take That ' and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this actually added to the fun and wonder of the show ( I have a feeling that the cast are loving their jobs as grins and laughter were evident throughout especially from the flying green bird ) . <p> Anyway the show . God this is taking an age opening fantastic , good projections and lighting effects setting the scene for something a bit special , first chance to hear the flipping awesome ensemble.cracking voices , awesome dancers , one of which was very floppy indeed ( look for the one in the skirt in dancing thru life he is very ballet boyz lol ) . Finally we meet Helen Dallimore in her bubble . What a pretty lady she is and , after all the moaning we have seen about her interpretation of a role that some see as only playable by copying squeaky star number one La Chenowith , I was pleasantly surprised by how I warmed to her almost immediately and what a lovely voice she has At one point in thank goodness she proved to me that she could belt green girl off the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I for one am chuffed for her that she got the role . I think it may be time for the woman of green to be talked about.I would normally use expletives to show my enthusiasm for her performance but I will restrain myself and just use the words .. oh my god ! ! ! What a woman.acting perfect , singing perfect and one must on this occasion separate her singing voice from her belting voice as it is quite possible that this woman has another little person living in her larynx ready and waiting to add to the volume when required . Once she had blown the roof off the theatre in the wizard and I the audience went nuts and rightly sowe were witnessing one of the best vocal performances of our timeshe is better now than she was on the CD , more warm , full bodied and rounded vowels adding to a master class in musical theatre singing . This is not to detract from her sotto voce ... which really suited duets with Dallimore ( a lot nicer to listen to than Menzel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membersI will be brief . Katie Rowley Jones as Nessa Rose : stunning voice and later on evilness ooh she was good . James Gillan as Boq : aaaw wee Scottish fella who broke all our hearts and who hides a huge voice which practically explodes out of him on a number of occasions ! Miriam Margolyes as Madame Morrible : wowwhat a woman - not a note sung but it was still splendid and you really wanted to smack her chops by the end of the show ( in a nice way obviously ) . Martin Ball as Dr Dillamond : again heartbreaking performance and a lovely singing voice to match . Nigel Planer as the Wizard was goodits a crappy part but he did well to make it good . And finally Adam ( best bum in town ) Garcia as Fiyero.I was really happy with his performance.he needs to breath more or at least put some effort into sustaining ends of phrases but a nice voice and one that complimented greenies very nicelyI would if I could go at him with a pair of scissorsthat hair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do want to go on a bit about the end of act onenever have I felt such exhilaration and joy than at this moment ... wow wow wow ! Edina Menzel is wonderful and the simple effects are some of the most breathtaking I have seen on a stagewho cares if she does n't  dangle like a blimp ( there 's a cross reference for you ) , she rises majestically and because there was no roof left on the theatre at this stage of the show , I will have to start using ' the walls being blasted apart as she sang ' as a metaphor . God she is loud and it works so well.seriously , by the end of this song the vast majority of the audience are stunned and in shock at what they have just experienced . Even the old man sat behind me said " ( expletive ) me darling , , , that was a bit good ! " and then during act 2 she comes along again and caused nuclear meltdown of the whole of Victoria with no good deed . ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass when they sing , she breaks concrete ! ! <p> Right it 's time to go here are my final words on Wicked.get a bloody ticket before she leaves in Jan 2007 ... the woman is a green goddess ( without the blonde hair and terrifying leotard ) . Obviously she is n't the whole show on her own - and Kerry Ellis will do a fine job when Menzel leaves - but if you can see Edina blow up London if you can . Right I have to go and buy the Take That Tour DVD bye x Freddy <p> It is proof of the almighty power of live theatre in its rawest and most passionate form . <p> The sets are absolutely breathtaking and the costumes utterly marvellous . The score is powerful and the lyrics poignant and witty . <p> TOP TIP : The theatre holds the whole of the front row until the day of the performance , when , for only 25 you can buy them ( max. 2 per person ) . They go on sale at 10am . We arrived at 12pm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were n't ! I hate paying full price in the West End as it always deadens the excitement for me - so this is definitely worth a look ! We sat in the front row of the Wednesday matinee and I must admit I was slightly worried that the principles may not be performing or that maybe they would n't be up to their best - I should n't have worried ! No cast members were understudied and the intensity of all actors was incredible . We were about 8 feet away from the actors , including the fabulous Idina Menzel who rightly deserves the hype - her voice is like nothing else I have ever heard in the West End ! <p> The only negative thing about sitting in the front row is that you lose a lot of the impact of the set , which comes right out over the proscenium arch and into the auditorium . But the fact that you get so close to the marvellous costumes and stunning actors more than makes up for it . You also get closer to seeing things done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe another post on this website that suggested all the songs were instantly forgettable ! The show-stopping ' Defying Gravity ' was haunting me on the train home and I just had to download the album as soon as I got home ( which , incidentally is fantastic ) . <p> The supporting cast is awesome with Miriam Margoyles putting in a devilish Madame Morrible and Adam Garcia superb as the love interest ' Fiyero ' . All in all , one of the best things I have ever seen in the West End . <p> YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS SHOW ! <p> Andy B <p> I went to see it last night ( 14th October 2006 ) , sitting in Row E of the Dress . I was a little concerned before by the reports on this site about the sound . I feel they must have sorted it because I felt it was perfectly balanced between vocals and orchestra , at an appropriate volume - Idina Menzel 's magnificent voice given just the right " knee-trembling " factor ! Also , the spaciality of the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . <p> On another note , I am sure the theatre is now more than air cooled , judging by the temperature at times . It was quite a mild evening last night , and I am sure I felt some icy blasts ! Also , during the quieter moments ( yes , surprisingly there are one or two ) the noise of the cooling system became quite intrusive ! <p> Having booked months in advance for best seats , I was eagerly looking forward to seeing Wicked . What a disappointment . The songs were instantly forgettable , there was little variety in the style of music and there were far two many songs and not enough drama . <p> For the last half century , the songs in musical theatre have been integral to telling the story . Well , in Wicked the songs are boring and there is not enough story to make a two and a half hour show . The show failed to engage me - I could n't care what happened to any of the characters . I found myself listening to lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting any laughs . It was hard to know just what audience this show is aimed at it is too scary for young children and too juvenile for adults . <p> Technically , there were problems with the production I saw ( Tuesday 10 October 2006 ) , and the first act finale failed to take off - literally . The wicked witch looked frankly ridiculous standing centre stage clutching a broomstick and singing " Im flying high defying gravity " . Its a pity that technical problems can spoil the highlight of a show well after opening night . <p> On the positive side the costumes were spectacular , the acting generally good ( Miriam Margolyes is the real star of the show ) , and the sets and lighting were quite good but sadly the positives were not enough to make it a good night out or value for money . <p> Saw the matinee performance on Saturday 14th October 2006 . Sat in seats J 18 , 19 and 20 in the stalls . Fantastic seats could not fault them . The slope in this part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any difference . Could not recommend these seats too highly . <p> Before the review a major moan . After paying 55 for a ticket ( plus booking fee ) the brochure ( no programme available to buy ) is in my opinion a complete rip off . For 6 all you get are the photos you can get off the website for free and the cast bio 's you can also get off the website for free . Plus there is plenty of advertising in there too . You would think that they would make sure that after the high price of tickets , the brochure would be quality . Sadly not . <p> Anyway .... <p> Wow wow wow wow . <p> I had hear it was good but did not expect how superb it actually was . <p> The story is marvellous , very clever the way it is its own story but weaves so much of the original story into the plot . <p> The sets are breathtaking , the whole stage is like a huge clock turned outwards capped off by a dragon dominating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seamlessly . <p> The music is fantastic , in particular " No Good Deed " , " Defying Gravity " , " For Good " and " No-one Mourns the Wicked " just did it for me . <p> Idinal Menzel - just see her ! See her while she is still in London . Her soaring voice was breathtaking . She brilliantly conveyed the transformation of Elphaba from a lonely teenager , to an idealistic young woman and finally a tortured outcast . The audience absolutely got it and loved her from the first time she appeared on the stage . This I felt was a legendary performance . <p> Helen Dalimore was a fantastic Glinda . It appears , from having read earlier reviews , that she has grown quickly into the role . She was hilarious , scatty and spoilt but conveyed a vulnerability coupled with a real steel hand in the silk glove . She was fantastic . <p> Miriam Margolyes as Morrible - all I can say about her is that she stole every scene she was in . She was wonderfully , wonderfully evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine anyone doing it better . Just great in a limited role . In supporting roles , Martin Ball , James Gillan and Kate Rowley Jones as Dillamond , Boq and Nessarose were all superb . Faultless performances . <p> The company is also faultless . Magnificent singing , dancing and movement . What a fantastic afternoon at the theatre . Have not stopped raving about it since I saw it . The audience gave it an ecstatic reception at the end . The ovation was massive - real enthusiasm . <p> In the end though , two words : IDINA MENZEL ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> As I was leaving I sent a text to a work collegue who is seeing it in November and said it was the best show I have ever seen . <p> It was , and I can not wait to go back . <p> Wicked Update : <p> Your comments about the un-American-ness of the show appear to have been taken on board as it would seem from a visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more in tune with the Broadway version that I saw last November in NY . <p> " Once the director realises " Popular " works way better with an American air-head accent than it does with a British spoof-Sloane one , it 'll be the perfect " DVD night in " substitute . " <p> It is now getting back to the American-ness that should always have been there . <p> Friends who saw a preview a few weeks ago and who also came last said everything was tighter and better , especially the sound balance . <p> We were sitting in row H 40 to 44 which are in red on your seat plan . True the left-side stage action when the cast are not very far forward misses a bit of a view but , overall , you lose nothing . One important thing to bear in mind about this show and others - is that a lot of the close-up action takes place on the left side of the stage and rows A to J seats 35 to the 40s really get the best and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also , last night , seats in 35 to 42 in rows B to E were unsold . Any late-comer , personal-callers at the box might enquire about availability of these if they desperately want to see the show at short notice or to try and do a deal . <p> What your other correspondents do n't seem to take into account with regards to " seat rake " is that the theatre was originally built as a cinema and as such the stalls seating in the first 20 rows needed to fall away from the stage level to make the screen visible . Why Live Nation have failed to address this is clearly a matter of cost and priorities - and of course Live Nation 's bottom line . <p> Final moan , and something I have taken up directly with Live Nation directly , is the obscenity - in this day and age - of the long , long queues for ladies toilets all through the interval . There simply just are n't enough and it is a scandal that a top West End show really has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Coliseum - after its own 40m refit - faces exactly the same problem . <p> One day , one fine day , some entrepreneurial property developer , in collaboration with a truly caring and wise theatre-management organisation is going to build a really magnificent London theatre with a wide and flexible stage , excellent sight lines , fantastic acoustics , seating and prices geared to what the public wants and needs almost certainly as part of a comprehensive , major property redevelopment programme . <p> I went along on 31st October 2006 ... had seen the show once before on a " Dress Circle " evening in September during the previews was interested to see how the cast were doing since then .... <p> Well - I enjoyed it even more than last time - excellent seats in row J of the stalls 26 and 27 ... I have seen that other reviewers did n't like row J- maybe we were lucky not to have tall people in front ! I was able to see details of the fantastic costumes and the facial expressions . Legroom was ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Helen Dallimore as Glinda just gets better and better - her accent has settled down , her voice seems stronger , and with the delivery of some of the lines and the expression , she is hilarious - just perfect for the role .. <p> Idina Menzel put in another fantastic performance - ' Defying Gravity ' is possibly the most spectacular , but her performance of ' No Good Deed ' is just mind-blowing ! <p> Adam Garcia as Fiyero .. hmm well , he has got a bit less wooden , but I still do n't particularly like him in this role - the character has charisma , the actor should portray this , but does n't IMO <p> Miriam Margolyes - excellent ! I ca n't imagine anyone better for the role - she goes from a rather comical figure to a chilling manipulator . Speaks rather than sings , but I think this works well <p> Nigel Planer as the Wizard - I think he is very good - he manages to maintain the mid-west accent pretty well ( to my ear , anyway ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the show are very moving , and actually made me feel a bit sorry for this quite evil character . <p> Martin Ball as Dr Dillamond - very very good - ca n't be easy to play I think with the mask , but I really warm to him , ( which I guess makes Elphaba 's fight for Animal rights so important ) <p> James Gillan and Katie Rowley Jones as Boq and Nessarose - Katie has an amazing voice , and her character development is excellently done . James is perfect as the lovelorn Boq , and has a few nice touches as the Shiz Boq ( I loved it when he stuck his tounge out at Elephaba behind her back ) . <p> The Ensemble ... possibly the best in the West End at the moment ( well , tied with ' Les Mis ' ) - excellent singing and dancing . <p> The sound levels were just about right - the staging and lighting are awesome - if you have n't seen it yet , I really would recommend going to see it ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compare with Wicked . It 's lavish , the performances were great , the plot is very cleverly woven into the original " Wizard of Oz " , and overall it 's fantastic entertainment . <p> However , as one of the earlier reviewers has already said , the songs are unfortunately instantly forgettable , and since this is normally one of my favourite parts of any musical , I found this to be very disappointing . <p> Overall , the " Wow " factor of this show is really there , and it was certainly money well spent ( very good seats , thanks to the Theatremonkey Ticketshop ! ) It 's not going to compete for my " favourite show " spot though . <p> Would I go again ? Most definitely . <p> I saw Wicked on 2nd November 2006 . <p> I though this show was mixed . The awards for me go to the sumptuous costumes and the spectacular set and a personal achievement award to Idina Menzel . She is outstanding and I would urge people to book before she leaves the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the cast were very poor they needed a charisma infusion to carry the show through . Interesting how we now have two major West End female parts Elphaba and Evita being filled by foreign actresses and benefiting from it . <p> The staging is extraordinary in its lavishness and in how the setting becomes the focus of the show . The finale of part one is a stunning visual ; the only other show I can think of with scenes where the visuals of the setting are so important and so strong is " The Lion King . " I also enjoyed the clever book and lyrics , and the construct that alluded to the film . I 'm glad I saw this show but I realise that I 've analysed it rather than emoted with it . I took children aged 12 and 16 . They enjoyed it but also identified the faults , so I would n't bank on it for success as a preteen party . <p> Sara Levene <p> Saw the matinee on 5th November 2006 . Was a bit worried as could only get seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not feel like I missed anything . Yes , would be nice to be in centre of theatre but if this is all that 's left did not feel cheated ... and loads of leg room ! I 'm over 6ft and had no problems . In quieter bit did get a little noise from behind curtains at side where they keep stock for the bars etc , so staff should be quieter - and cold blasts as someone else said - but I had a great view . <p> Not a perfect show , but pretty damn good ; has some really magical moments . A little long though , I felt , could be cut a bit and not lose anything . Very strong cast all round no one is weak . Idina Menzel and Helen Dallimore are FAB - fans of the 1939 classic will not be upset or disappointed as they link it in quite well . Great set and lighting , sound was fine even at the back . Both leading ladies should be up for Oliviers as should the show . <p> I 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to see Idina Menzel in Wicked ! Saw the Wednesday matinee on November 8th 2006 . Was supposed to sit with a friend in B 8 and 9 of the dress circle - to all the readers , try and avoid B9 of the dress circle as much as you can , as there 's a pole right in front of your line of vision ! Luckily the seats in the centre of B of the dress circle were n't filled , so we moved and 2 friends who had bought tickets for other seats moved down to sit with us , B in the centre of the dress circle are great seats , I could see everything , facial expressions quite a bit too ! A 5th friend showed up REALLY early and got front row centre seats - I 'd highly recommend this , I paid 55 pounds for dress circle , great seats once we moved , and she got to see Glinda 's tear in ' For Good ' for 25 ! <p> I LOVED THIS SHOW , it 's something I would totally see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , especially recently , and saw a bootlegged Broadway version last year , but this absolutely surpassed it all ! I 'm sure that Kerry Ellis when she takes over as Elphaba will be wonderful , but I got ta say nobody will EVER top Idina Menzel , the woman is absolutely incredible ! ! ! Her voice is so powerful that she left me with chills , almost in tears , and seriously feeling like the roof was gon na blow off from the strength of her voice alone . Although I do have to admit that she let on me down slightly on ' Defying Gravity ' because she did a shorter , one noted version of the " is ever gon na bring ME down " at the end rather than that incredible belted changing ME note that 's on the soundtrack , but the change in weather might have meant that she was n't quite at the top of her game today , plus the fact that the woman does that show 9 times a week ! Course if what I saw was Idina Menzel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she 's fully healthy . Like someone else said , ' No Good Deed ' is absolutely mind-blowing , by far the best song in the show , at least to me ! <p> Adam Garcia was great , I particularly enjoyed ' Dancing through Life ' , but ' As long as you 're mine ' needs some work - the stage movements took away from the chemistry that you 're really supposed to be able to cut with a knife . I absolutely loved the Irish or Scottish version of Boq , he was AMAZING . Miriam Margolyes as Madame Morrible deserves an award , she was awesome ! My friend and I disagreed on the Wizard and Nessa - I loved both of them , she did n't . Nessa was great as the little spoiled sister who can still be pitied , I really liked her . And the Wizard was great - I loved the fact that Nigel Planner stuck more to the traditional Wizard of Oz as a harmless US hick who got carried away rather than the EXTREMELY creepy bald guy version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give him props on the Midwest accent - he did great , though when he first came out my authentic St. Louis/midwestern ear caught a touch of southern ... <p> Now we come to Helen Dallimore as Galinda . I have to give her some credit , because it 's a hard role to do , especially 9 times a week . And she did get much better during the 2nd act . But she just did n't get it in the first , in fact she seemed to lack confidence in the first act , the exact opposite of what spoiled self-assured Galinda should be at that point ! The low point was definitely ' popular , ' sadly because I 'd been so looking forward to that . But the producers need to realize that it just does not work to do ' Popular ' in a British accent ! ! The words are " Popular . You 're gon na be popular " and she did it as ' going to be ' . Seems small but ' gon na be ' and ' going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made ' Popular ' way too proper and it did n't work at all . I think if she can gain the confidence in the 1st act that she has in the 2nd and really work on ' Popular , ' she 'll be great . But like the song says , " let 's start , cause you 've got an awfully long way to go " . <p> The set and costumes were amazing , but next to Idina my favourite part of the show were the monkeys ! ! Especially the part where they 're set free - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING ! They were flipping and flying everywhere , it was incredible ! And I 'm not sure what people are talking about with people not flying , because those monkeys were most definitely flying all over the stage , and maybe it 's just me but considering that Elphaba got up to my eye level in the dress circle in ' Defying Gravity ' , I 'd say that 's definitely flying . It 's one of the parts that kept me open-mouthed during that song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November 2006 ) , and while it is not the greatest musical of all time , it was very , very enjoyable . <p> I think we had fantastic and great value seats , Circle , Row H 18 and 19 . These are two seats on their own , right in the middle , not too far back and priced only 35 . The same would be true for Row G and Row I. <p> Pass the message on . Emma <p> Finally saw Wicked . I enjoyed it very much . I 'm afraid , though , I 'm going to be the odd man out here . I was a bit disappointed with Idina Menzel . She does sing beautifully and has a powerful voice ( her lungs must be made of steel ) . However , I did n't  find her acting all that impressive , especially considering she 's been playing the part for a very long time , and that she received a Tony for this performance . I was , unfortunately , underwhelmed . Maybe my expectations were too high . <p> I was pleasantly surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I definitely enjoyed Helen Dallimore as Galinda . I was kind of reticent that any actress could actually outperform Kristin Chenoweth in the Original Broadway recording , and yet she did a great job . No problems at all with her Popular . Then again , I 'm not American and my expectations are not the same . Helen was n't as smug and self-loving as Kristins Galinda , but more ambitious and wackily ruthless , which suited the rather hypocritical character just fine . She made me laugh in lines I did n't  expect too . Miriam Margolyes , as everybody pointed out , was brilliant . I also thought James Gillan as Boc quite good . <p> Even though Wicked is not exactly my cup of tea ( sometimes it seemed more like a live concert than a musical ) , it made me wish to see it again sometime in the future . <p> Carlos <p> We went to see Wicked this weekend ( 11th November 2006 ) and it was terrific and second to none ! ! We had seats P42 and 43 in the stalls and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your seating plan . Yes , we did have to view the stage at a slight angle but we did n't  miss any of the action on stage and had a fantastic view of all of the characters . The tickets at full price were worth every penny and we would recommend them to anyone . <p> Saw the show on Saturday 11th November 2006 . It 's a great story , the show is quite slick , scenery well done and the cast were all good . However , I have to say it just did n't do it for me . A previous reviewer hit the nail on the head - it just seemed too long winded , and the story kind of got lost along the way on occasion . <p> I felt most of the songs were a bit bland - no memorable ' thighslappers ' here . I felt the show would have worked better without some of them or at least they could be shortened them to get on with the story . I was really disappointed that Elphaba did n't fly when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a technical hitch there and she should have done so - if so they hid it well ... show must go on after all , but if not , what a shame and nevertheless thought there would be more ' flying ' all round . <p> Did n't live up to expectations and left feeling a bit disappointed - shame really as there is a cracking show in there crying to get out . The cast are good but would n't agree they compare to ' Les Mis ' - perhaps that 's down to the songs as well . <p> Ladies - make sure you ' go ' before you arrive - unless you want to wait for ages - the queue for went all the way down the stairs to the door in the foyer at the start and was worse at the interval - be warned . <p> Dee C <p> We saw Wicked on 9th November 2006 . Our seats ( stalls K 26 and 27 ) were AMAZING . I ca n't imagine better seats for this show . Close enough to feel part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of illusion . We had to look up to get the full effect of the dragon , but I really think that it should be that way . After all , he 's meant to be looking down over OZ . <p> We were a bit nervous about the show , having not been grabbed by the soundtrack we purchased online . We went into the theatre feeling even more unsure , as there were notices tacked up everywhere saying that Idina Menzel was not singing that night , but rather her standby , Kerry Ellis . I 'd read reviews saying Menzel 's voice carries the show , so was totally gob smacked when I heard Kerry Ellis . What a voice ! Having never heard Menzel live I can not compare but OH WoW was Ellis amazing . She 'll be taking over in January so do n't by any means think you must rush to hear Menzel before she 's gone , because Ellis has the kind of voice that gets right into your stomach and carries you through the show . When it ended I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> The thing is , the entire show was amazing . It was the kind of experience where you find yourself shaking your head in disbelief because it 's so good . The scenery is wonderful , the transitions ( something I 'm picky about ) were seamless , the costumes lavish and the staging masterful . <p> Basically , do n't miss this show . <p> KFried <p> Went to the Matinee ( 18th November 2006 ) . Spectacular show but the sound was truly appalling . We were in row F of Dress Circle ( 55 per ticket ) . Good view . Spoken word could be heard and mostly understood but as soon as the orchestra struck-up we could n't understand a syllable ! There was just a wall of unintelligible sound ! Very disappointing . GP <p> I went to Wicked yesterday ( 23rd November 2006 ) and it was amazing . During the interval I was already plotting ways to see it again before the end of the year . <p> Our seats were pretty good although we could n't see all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially the part where the house lands on the Wicked Witch of the East . Luckily a girl was sitting in front of me so I did n't have to lean to the sides to see the action . <p> Although I was disappointed that Idina was n't performing , Kerry was amazing and she won everyone over by the end of ' The Wizard &amp; I ' . She did n't hit all the notes that Idina hits in Defying Gravity but she put a lot of emotion in her singing . <p> Adam Garcia was pretty good . His singing was n't on a par with Norbert Leo Butz and Kerry 's voice overpowered his during the duet , but his acting and dancing was good . Kerry Washington , Miriam 's understudy was also on . She was OK but I think Miriam would probably bring more to the character . <p> The wizard has a very dodgy American accent and I 've figure out why ; he 's supposed to be from Kansas in the US . I guess Idina keeps her accent because that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and Kerry keeps her own accent because her Elphaba wants to fit in . I did n't think Nigel Planer was particularly good as the wizard ; he was too flamboyant for a man who is actually quite unsure of himself . <p> In conclusion , I loved it and will be going to a Wednesday matinee before the end of the year hopefully <p> I have now seen the show four times and have sat in a variety of seats . After 0 in the dress circle I have had row P centre in the dress circle , row W dress circle and row D in the stalls . <p> I have to say that from all of these seats I got something different from the show - but all were great . Row W of the dress circle - booked last minute - cheap - great overall view - took my cheap Argos binoculars for a closer view - but others in my party were still blown away by the show from here . <p> - only problem I have found with any of the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have someone that does that - it is a real pain - but a polite word often does the trick . Row D of the stall was a very different experience - very powerful and personal . Great as I 'd already seen the show - but maybe you miss out a little on the whole effect . I would book these / or closer again - as I saw lots of little things I had n't noticed from further back . <p> Dawn <p> With 159 people in my group opinions stretched over the full gambit from at least three saying it was by far the best show they have ever seen , to two of the men wanting to walk out at the interval and one saying it was the worst show he has ever seen . You can never please everyone . <p> The main consensus however was that it was a superb production with incredible stage props and effects and amazing costumes . Kerry Ellis was Elphaba and no one should be disappointed about seeing her in the role full time from January 2007 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had access to the Internet to read up on the story line of the link between " Wicked " and " The Wizard of Oz " and for the others I had copies of the story on the coaches for them to read , but still many had real difficulty in understanding what it was all about ; but I think they were the ones who were just not inspired by it at all and did n't want to understand it . I suppose they were looking for catchy songs to sing on the coach back which they will get with our next two shows " The Sound of Music " and " Mamma Mia . " <p> ' Wicked ' may not have memorable songs but it has a uniqueness that makes it quite special . <p> I was waiting and waiting and looking for Elphaba to get on that broomstick and do a Harry Potter but it never happened ! <p> I think it is true to say that more ladies enjoyed it than the men and it certainly appeals most to the teenage and younger , audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way after the show have been most complimentary and so far those who did not like it have not expressed those views to me . <p> I did get one complaint about the brass rail on the balcony which is just on eye level , fortunately there were other seats empty which they moved to and others in the circle almost had vertigo due to the rake of the seats and they moved to the stalls . <p> We had seats H34 and 35 in the Dress Circle . I took my 10-year-old daughter and she thought they were the best seats we 'd ever had ! Unobstructed view and it was nice not sitting next to anybody ! We usually pay top price so I was apprehensive but I would recommend these to anybody . Show is fabulous - do n't  be put off by critics reviews I 've recommended this show to many people and they were all knocked out by it ! <p> Francesca <p> Went to see " Wicked " for the second time on Saturday 9th December 2006 , having first seen it back in October 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls in the centre . This time row N of the stalls , centre block . <p> This show is a breath of fresh air in West End theatre . Yes the revivals are great , and yes I 've got my tickets for " The Sound Of Music " but give me " Wicked " any day . The music is wonderful , the dialogue sharp and witty , the costumes sumptuous and the sets quite spectacular . And as for the performances ... <p> Both times I have been fortunate to see the full original cast . Second time around Nigel Planer and Adam Garcia had definitely settled into their roles and were a pleasure to watch . Miriam Margolyes strongly deserves to win her best supporting actress nomination as she commands the stage each time she comes on . Helen Dallimore gives a clever and very amusing performance as Glinda . Whilst perhaps not matching the voice of Chenoweth ( original Glinda on Broadway ) she acts as a great foil to Elphaba and the two of them work a good chemistry on the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is her voice the most incredible I 've ever heard in live musical theatre , she creates a totally believable character in Elphaba . She takes Elphaba on a journey from the young , naive , e nthusiastic girl in " The Wizard And I " to the dark , haunted and tormented woman of " No Good Deed " with ease . Her second calling of Fiyero in " No Good Deed " must be one of the most emotional and chilling moments of the show . There is no note she can not hit , no musical dynamic she can not master . Got to be on for the best performance in a musical at next year 's Olivier awards . <p> Technically the show runs like clockwork . We just had a very short failing of Elphaba 's microphone at the start of " One Short Day " . Otherwise , perfect . <p> " Defying Gravity " r emains the biggest show stopper of " Wicked " but second time around I enjoyed many other parts of the show as much . <p> My feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . You 'll either love it and allow yourself to be transported to Oz with all its wonders or it simply wo n't be your thing at all . Guess which category I come under . <p> I think loads of reviews have talked about the wonderful performances in Wicked , but the show as a whole is amazing too . Many musicals on the West End seem to have their very firmly in cheek , ' Spamalot ' and ' Avenue Q ' ( which I absolutely love ) being obvious examples . Indeed many critics seem to think that musicals must be wryly self referential and not take themselves too seriously in order to be taken seriously . Wicked is definitely a funny show , but it is definitely of the old school , proudly sporting at least two power ballads and the odd romantic duet . I think this may be why many newspapers and reviews have not been kind about it , but I believe they have missed the point . It 's well executed , the songs are not too overdone and there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop things getting too serious or self important . It may not be the ' coolest ' musical , but it has a magic to it . I got lost in the show for two and a half hours , caught up in the fun and excitement of what is going on . <p> I was sat in stalls seat B11 , marked red by Theatremonkey . I totally agree with this assessment . Soundwise it is fine , but because it is so far over the side of the stage , you miss some of the action upstage left . The way the chorus are arranged in some scenes also prevents you seeing all the action , which is not great if you do n't know the story . I also got a very good look at : a ) the stage hands in the wings , and b ) Helen Dallimore 's pants at least twice in every scene ( which some may see as a selling point ) . <p> However , if you are seeing the show for a second time , it has its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers , I gained in the leads songs . I was really close and it did really give the more emotional songs more impact . <p> I love Wicked , and the 15th December 2006 was the second time I have seen it . Even though I am a massive fan , straight theatre is more my thing and I generally would n't be so into this type of musical . It really is hugely enjoyable and has something which has now made it a lasting favourite of mine . It is an fun , honest , unpretentious and amusing musical with brilliant tunes . I agree with another reviewer who says you love it or you hate it . If you fall into the first camp then you can help but go along with it . It might not be to everyone 's taste , but give it a go and you may be pleasantly surprised . <p> a later review : <p> You got me ... I went to see Wicked again on 30th December 2006 . I started queuing at 12.40am on the Apollo Victoria steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I was reading a Dan Brown novel . Things could not get much worse . But I stuck it out until the morning and got a ticket ! The last day seat to be exact , stalls A36 . <p> As it was Idina Menzel 's last night ( you would n't catch me sitting in central London all night otherwise ) I do n't think there is much point in reviewing the performance . However , all I would say is just because she has left , do n't stop going to see the show . She is undoubtedly an amazing performer , otherwise I would not have queued nine hours for a ticket , but the show does n't rely on her performance , it is a brilliant musical in its own right , and the other actors are brilliant . I know she has her detractors but Helen Dallimore is a treat as Glinda . She has a real warmth and watchability which has grown over the three ( ahem ) times I have seen Wicked . You feel for her in a way that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitchy cheerleader type that she was on Broadway . <p> I was nervous the queue was going to be a mad scrum but everyone was really calm and fair about who had arrived first . If you can spare the time to queue , these tickets are great value , especially as the prices are going up . Now that Idina Menzel has left I doubt people will need to turn up that far in advance either , especially on weekdays . <p> For 25 this is a really good seat . I have sat on the far side at the other side of the stage and the view here is much better ( and I did n't see Helen Dallimore 's pants ) . The odd bit of a scene was blocked by chorus members , but all in all I caught most of the action . <p> I realise this is now my third review but I would like to point out I am not a weirdo ( much ) . I have never seen any other musical more than once , and indeed have never owned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this one . Wicked has something about which has got me , go and see it ! <p> Hannah M <p> I saw Wicked for 1st time in November 2006 from row G of the circle , 2nd time in December 2006 from row L of the stalls . <p> I queued for day seats on a very cold Tuesday , arrived 0830 ( box office opens 1000 ) . I was 14th in the queue but about 5+ people joined friends ahead of me at various stages so I ended up further back . All the day seats went by about 4 people in front of me - **NB** every 1 person can buy either 1 or 2 tickets ( it does state this on the show 's website ) ( worth checking the policy though , if planning to buy these seats , as it can change - editor ) . The people at the front of the queue had been there since FIVE THIRTY A.M. ! ! ! and this on a day where it was about 1 degree C. Goodness knows what the queue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ticket per person as most day seats are , that way you can judge if you are too late in the queue . <p> Other points : <p> I would agree with previous reviews about the sound - when I saw it in the circle I could barely make out half the words of the songs . The theatre needs to sort this out - that 's why you have preview performances . The sound quality was MUCH better in the stalls . It 's not fair to penalise people who ca n't afford top price tickets such that they get bad sound quality . <p> The view was still excellent from row G circle though , and I did n't find the bar in front of the seats restricted the view . <p> Idina Menzel as Elphaba is EXCELLENT . Helen Dallimore and her understudy are both very good . The other parts are all well cast . <p> Wicked is a visually spectacular show . Costumes and stage are well designed . <p> The songs are a bit pop-musical-ly and I did n't think much of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Defying Gravity ' did have some impact - but they 've all grown on me . <p> Be warned - this show has gone cult and both performances I have seen there are screaming people ( mostly teenagers and I have to say lots of American tourists too ! ) at various points during the show . I did n't know that and it came as a bit of a shock to my friends and I ! <p> You will enjoy the show even if you know nothing about Oz , but if you 've seen the film The Wizard of Oz , and particularly if you read any of the Oz books as a child , you will enjoy the in-references and back story etc . Very clever . <p> Even sitting in the dress circle where all the actors looked like dots ( binoculars come in very handy , so bring your 50ps ! ! ) - the atmosphere was fantastic and the show was amazing ! ! ! <p> Idina Menzel was amazing - what a great voice ! Beautiful girl - shame she only gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strongly recommend ! <p> Laura <p> So much praise has been written of Idina Menzel , all of it deserved , but she has left now ( January 2007 ) , and we must look to Kerry Ellis who has replaced her as Elphaba . I first saw the show in October 2006 and was mesmerised by Idina 's performance , so I must admit I had a preconceived prejudice that she could not be equalled . I went to the show on 1st January 2007 , which was Kerry Ellis ' official first night . I need not have worried ; she soared to the occasion - one might even say she defied gravity - belting out a tremendous performance . <p> Her singing was extremely strong - especially in her big opening number " The Wizard and I " , after which she had the audience under her spell . But where she triumphed was in her acting ability . She captured the nuances of the change from vulnerable , isolated girl , to dark , embittered activist with panache and subtlety . The relationship between her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent not to make Kerry play it with an American accent - Elphaba worked just as well with an English one . While Idina just had the edge in the voice department , anyone who is due to see the show need have no worries that it has been any way diminished by her departure . Kerry was joyous and excited at the curtain call , a delight to see as she absorbed the justified applause and inevitable standing ovation . <p> A quick mention of the other principals ' performances since I first saw it . Helen Dallimore has improved a lot . She has relaxed into the part , and I wonder whether some pressure has been taken off her with the change of Elphaba . I certainly think the chemistry between them is better . Nigel Planer has also settled into the role of Wizard , looking more comfortable . <p> This show has definitely made a ' WICKED ' impression on the both of us . We have now been to the emerald city a grand total of 7 times and every time it gets better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spanning the breath of Oz from row A of the stalls to row X of the dress circle and each seat has given us a new experience and added a new dimension to the already fantastic show . Back of the dress circle is great value for money at 15 but we recommend the middle blocks for optimum viewing . Front row is great but make sure you try to get seats 16 to 25 as a lot of the action takes place here . <p> The only issue we have as frequent theatre goers is that the theatre seems to allow late comers in at any given moment throughout the show even though they say ' late comers will be admitted at a suitable time ' . This can really ruin the performance and has done for us ! <p> We simply loved Idina and are devastated that she has left . We agree with the reports the Helen has grown into the role and have witnessed her flourish with every performance we see . We are now fans ! ! Adam Garcia seems to have been working hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great as it could be . It has definitely improved from when we first saw him during the previews . <p> We are really keen ( but nervous ! ! ) to see Kerry Ellis step into Idina 's shoes . We will report back when we have seen her in action ! <p> TIP : NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED ! ! <p> Karen &amp; Peter <p> Got myself day seats for both shows on Saturday 30th December 2006 . <p> The shows were amazing and definitely worth spending the night outside in the cold for the day tickets ! ! ! There were lots of tears from the cast and most of the audience actually , a few moments of spontaneous laughter from Idina and Adam , and a beautiful speech given by Helen at the end . The atmosphere within the theatre was amazing , everything Idina did was supported with a massive cheer and she lapped it up with extra riffs and harmonies , as well as adding more comical moments than usual . Was truly a fabulous day and was so pleased to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 , our very first British Elphie ! ! ! She was fantastic and ca n't wait to see her develop more and more into character as she goes on . <p> Saw ' Wicked ' for the second time on Saturday 13th January 2007 . I had heard Kerry Ellis was good , so wanted to see her . Only booked tickets two days before and checked before I bought that she was performing . They said " yes ! " so I spent 230 . Arrived on Saturday to be greeted by a small A4 sign on the door saying , " Boq and Wizard = understudies " and , worse still , ' Elphaba ' - no Kerry or stand in - but understudy ! I was really miffed to say the least . <p> But , I have to say how much the whole show has settled and improved since last time I saw it . Helen Dallimore is really great now , a real star ; Adam Garcia much improved . The wizard u/study , well , in my opinion better than Nigel Planer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played by Cassidy Janson ? I think that 's right ? Well all I can say is " WOW " - she did a great job in such a demanding role - I was not disappointed . She hit every note ( did not quite soar like Idina ) , but great job and deserved her standing ovation . Just wish Elphaba really did fly ? Not enough space perhaps ... Sat in row U of the stalls 31 to 34 . Had great view , and was close enough to pick up on things I could n't from previous seats in row ZA . <p> Think its wrong prices go up next month ; I worry many families etc will soon be priced out of theatres . <p> Rob <p> Wednesday 24th January 2007 . Really enjoyed the show certainly full of special effects and costumes and set were great . Kerry Ellis was very good and the other female lead , whose name escapes me one or two of the other parts were a little weaker , namely the male lead who did n't  have a very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally powerful I feel , to match up to her . Ca n't remember who played the Wizard but not Nigel and he did n't  seem to make the most of his character . Overall though I really enjoyed it and feel it is well worth going to see and it would especially appeal to younger people . It was very well received by the audience . <p> The one point I would make is that I ca n't think of any of the songs standing out for me normally when I have been to the theatre there is one song at least that I ca n't stop humming even if I 've never heard it before but I honestly could n't hum one of those if you asked me to ( and I 'm sure you wo n't your loss not mine I hasten to add ! ) Shame they did n't  use one of ELOs songs from El Dorado . <p> Sat in Seats Row ZA in the stalls 28 and 29 and very good view as most of the stall seating seemed to offer . <p> My partner and I went to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful . As already stated by previous visitors to the site , Kerry Ellis delivers . ' The Wizard and I ' and ' Defying Gravity ' left us stunned , such was the power of her performance . She and Helen Dallimore complimented each other well and the whole cast was worthy of the standing ovation it received . <p> Now the negative part , do n't pay 55 or 60 ( come the end of the month ) to sit in Stalls , row E , seats 8/9 . These are top price tickets and yes , you guessed it , they had a restricted view . We could not see a full half of the back of the stage . Thankfully , most of the action took place further forward . <p> Furthermore , " Where did the stage hand come from " ? We saw a lot of him . I did n't realise that the bedroom scene for ' Popular ' involved Elphi , Galinda and stage hand , but there he was ! Also , there was a strange noise coming from the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fab production that we will see again , but spoilt by unnecessary additions and NOT worth top prices for dodgy seats . Now I 'm off to complain to the theatre/ticket outlet . <p> Moon <p> I reviewed this musical for the Monkey back in September and subsequently for www.wickedwestend.co.uk : Defying Gravityand Belief ! ' Wicked ' was the best thing in town by a green mile ; I saw Idina Menzel eight times including both performances on her final day as Elphaba : Saturday 30th December 2006 . As innumerable blogs , mostly on YouTube , testify , this was one of the greatest days in the lives of everyone lucky enough to get tickets at the Apollo Victoria . <p> The performance I saw on Saturday 3rd February 2007 ( 7.30pm ) was simply not the same show . Idina has gone , and with her all the magic . Gone the beauty , charisma , wit and vocals which raised Wicked above the rest . <p> Kerry Ellis was on , with three understudies ( Morrible , Fiyero , Nessarose ) , and it felt like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen Idina then Kerry would pass as serviceable , but the comparison is painful . She sings sweetly enough and they turn the amps up , but so what . Worse is the patent lack of acting talent : virtually everything spoken is flat , humourless and inaudible . Worst of all about which nothing can be done her stage presence : she is not credibly wicked at any point in the evening , resembling little more than a short , tedious school prefect . The show lives or dies by Elphaba : thus we witness a debilitating death . Even Helen Dallimore excellent September thru December was a pale imprint of earlier golden-ness , suffering no doubt from the low energy levels surrounding her . <p> The producers nightmare , all this . I was convinced Wicked would run and run ; now I 'm not so sure , and I certainly wont be hurrying back . Ill make do with the memories of 2006 and the CD . <p> Richard <p> 19th February 2007 . Well , what a show ! I ca n't remember when I last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good music , good lyrics and a book to match . I had heard ' Popular ' and ' Defying Gravity ' before but none of the other songs and I have to say the majority I really enjoyed . In particular ' I 'm Not That Girl ' and ' What Is This Feeling ? ' stood out for me . <p> As for the cast Kerry Ellis has a wonderful voice and whilst one other reviewer seemed to think she lacked presence and ' wickedness ' I can only say that I saw none of that from the performance we saw . One of my favourite singer/songwriters , Mr K Frog , sang of how ' It is n't easy being green ' but our emerald heroine plays her part with such style and apparent lack of effort it might make him a liar . I thought her standing ovation was thoroughly justified . Helen Dallimore is wonderfully funny and Adam Garcia is also very good . It 's testimony to the current cast that an American gentleman was overheard at the theatre shop asking to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't with the current London cast he turned heel and left . <p> For the sake of balance however not everything is wonderful in ' Wicked ' . I agree with others who say there are one or two bits of padding and the Wizomania bit seems simply out of place . I almost expected to see Stuart Hall come on stage laughing about the Belgians as the giant heads bobbed around . All in all though this is a musical I will definitely be seeing again soon and such a relief to find a new show that lives up to the hype and delivers in a big way . Mark <p> Saw the show on 5th April 2007 , amazing ! Kerry Ellis ' voice is superb and she has a great stage presence . Had row W 17 to 20 in Dress Circle , was a bit worried we would not see much but good view , a bit steep going up , and I do n't like heights but coped ! 19 and 20 were the better of the 4 seats as with the other 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of you . Only annoying thing was people being let in late and going in and out to the toilet , not very considerate , I had two children with me and they managed to keep still . Also ladies toilets a nightmare , tried to go in interval and queue right down the stairwell , but is n't that always the way ... the men 's were fine . On the whole a brilliant evening . <p> Karen Wheeler <p> The Apollo Victoria Theatre is filled to capacity during our April 2007 Friday evening viewing of Wicked . The scale of the production with its staging , dazzling visual effects , and eye-catching costumes is sure to delight . Kerry Ellis delivers a strong performance as Elphaba , the wicked witch of the West . The strength of Wicked is its imaginary appeal as a story about the Land of Oz before Dorothy , performed in the beautiful art deco confines of the Apollo Theatre which itself could pass as a portal to Oz . <p> But Wicked also has some problems , the biggest being how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not read Wicked , but are very familiar with the Yellow Brick Road version . I feel that Wicked 's script is clumsy and foggy for the uninitiated viewer who is not privy to the book 's history of characters and events in Oz . It 's not that anything is glaringly wrong , but I simply could not connect the dots to many of the side stories which are intended to show why Elphaba is not the wicked witch she seems . My wife , who read the book , tries to keep me up to speed , but this leaves me scratching my head as to why the script is not more tightly written . <p> The musical score , though pleasant on the ears , lacks that " wow " factor , those songs which stick in your head on the way out the door ( ' Defying Gravity ' comes very close though ) . This is unfortunate as Ms. Ellis has a great voice but only a couple of opportunities to really showcase it . The ending also falls flat , rolling to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is a shame since the cast works so hard throughout ) . Indeed , there 's a happy ending , but it lacks the words or music which should be there to reward both cast and audience and re-enforce the magical production effects . <p> Does this mean that one should not see Wicked ? Not at all . <p> Wicked is an entertaining journey to Oz . One can focus upon the costumes and staging or you can take that imaginary journey to Oz with the characters . We 're glad that we see Wicked , but we 're not in a hurry to go back . All musicals go through transitions and work arounds . Perhaps the script will be tightened and characters more clearly defined to take full advantage of the fabulous staging , the energetic cast , and the wonderful theatre in which Wicked is playing . So by all means go and see Wicked and enjoy Oz without fear of being carried off by flying monkeys . <p> The Apollo Victoria Theatre is itself an attractive art deco venue with high ceilings &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wicked . Our seats in Dress Circle ( D24/25 ) were as TM suggests , very good seats - comfortable and good leg room to boot . However that brass balcony railing which is located adjacent to the aisles is indeed an annoyance which blocks your view of the stage . It affects my view of the stage from D24 , though not my wife 's view . I suspect that the same is true for rows C , E , and F immediately behind or opposite my seat . Perhaps others can weigh in . <p> Barry Liimakka Cinnaminson USA <p> 28th April 2007 , matinee . This was my third visit to this fabulous show . This time I had my children with me - age range 7 to 13 , and my husband . We sat in row C of the stalls 24 to 29 . Fantastic seats with a great view of all the action and the emotion . I had seen the show twice with the amazing Idina Menzel and the question I asked myself was " Is the star the show " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show is the star . I do feel that Idina Menzel plays the part of Elphaba better than Kerry Ellis but that is not to say Kerry is not good . She was fantastic . I just feel Idina holds the stage better and her movement is more theatrical , which compliments the part . She also delivers those comic lines with a touch more timing and punch . However with a less dominant figure in Elphaba the rest of the cast seemed to shine . Helen Dallimore was on sparkling form and Adam Garcia was at his swankiest - a shame they are leaving this summer . Susie Blake played a thoroughly sinister Madame Morrible - excellent . The costumes in Wicked are out of this world ! Sitting as close as we did you could see the incredible detail and Susan Hilferty really should have won the Olivier award for costume design . Loved it , loved it , loved it ! One final comment . Your previous contributor from the US made reference to Adam Garcia mistakenly leaving stage left and having to run across the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been to the show . It 's called comedy ! ! <p> We saw this show on 2nd March 2007 and were blown away . The cast was superb ad the lighting effects fantastic , particularly for ' Defying Gravity . ' Special praise must go the the sound engineer . We heard every word clearly , not always the case . <p> My third time seeing ' Wicked ! ' Was it third time lucky ? ........ well , yes and no . I finally got to see Kerry Ellis play Elphaba and , after everyones ' great reviews was expecting to be blown away ... and yes , she delivers where it matters . Her best song was " No Good Deed , " which was the best I 've seen , but I felt I could not connect with her performance - her acting was pretty shallow in my opinion . I felt both Idina and Cassidy gave real rounded emotional performances . My seats - front stalls row N 23 , 24 and 25 were perfect - best I 've had . They seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear view - even my niece who is an ( emo ) then ( scene ) ... I know , if like me you do n't get it , we are too old ! It 's a kids ' thing but she LOVED the show - has n't stopped singing the songs , wearing her hoodie , and reciting " toss toss " from ' Popular . ' Susie Blake was a good Madame Morrible , completely different performance to Miriam Margoyles but just as good . For me the real star of the show is Helen Dallimore . It 's amazing how she has improved and really made the part her own , her comedy timing is fantastic her voice soars , for me she is the star of the show . Whoever takes over as Galinda has some big shoes to fit . All in all a great night was had by all . One little gripe , and I know lots of people have mentioned it , but latecomers ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! We counted 20 coming in 15 minutes after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - " DEFYING GRAVITY ! ! ! " and sat behind us , then never came back after interval . The theatre must do something about this . Also felt sound was bit muffled and clearer a little further back . <p> Rob <p> I queued up for day seats for my wife and step-daughter on Saturday 2nd June 2007 . I arrived at 7am to find approximately 10/12 people ahead of me in the queue . Some of those at the front appear to have been there most of the night ! ! Please bear in mind that the box office is in Wilton Road and not Vauxhall Bridge Road . <p> The 3 hours passed quickly thanks to meeting a very pleasant couple from Atlanta , Georgia . We all noticed however a number of people " appearing " from nowhere and becoming a part of the queue , not behind us but in front of us ... so beware interlopers and people " saving " places for their mates . At least one of the latecomers had a " Wicked " sweatshirt on and clearly they knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining tickets . It may well be that they were only after one ticket each rather than two but still ... by 10am we had been relegated to 20+ in line . <p> Anyway all 's well that ends well I got the two matinee tickets at 25 each - Row A seats 28 and 29 - which saved my bacon with the missus , and the girls adored the show , and ca n't wait to go see it again . Looks like I will get to know the Victoria Apollo pretty well ... Robert Devaney <p> I saw Wicked ( June 2007 ) , from stalls seat D30 . I did n't feel I was too close to the stage , neither did I feel a sore neck . But there was very little leg room and I was sitting beside a rather large American woman who took up her own seat and much of mine . When we had to let someone in during the second number she refused to get up and chaos ensued . Personally I did n't like the show . Two good songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show and what I heard was extremely bland . Kerry is a powerful singer but I was not impressed by Helen Dallimore , I thought she screeched . Also , I was only in row D yet found the sound a problem . And Ms Ellis sounded as if she was in a hurry to get home . I could hardly make her out in certain parts cos she spoke so quickly ! <p> Loved it . Second time around I thought Kerry Ellis superb ( she was understudied last time ) but prefer Helen Dallimore to the new Glinda - who was a bit over done . Oliver Tompsett was , however , just as wonderful a Fiyero as Adam Garcia . <p> We had 20 seats in the circle and quite a good view , but found latecomers , toilet visitors and general movement throughout the performance to be rather irritating . <p> OK , it was a Wednesday matinee in the summer ( August 2007 ) , so there were a lot of children , but I had two kids with me who would not dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less disruptive . <p> The woman behind me even thought it a good idea to give her restless daughter her mobile to play tunes on during the climactic scenes . Thanks , that really helped the atmosphere . <p> I wish the theatre staff could patrol a bit more , or do something ! It felt more like a cinema than a theatre . <p> I queued up for day seats for " Wicked , " I got there at 8.00am due to delays on the bloomin ' Piccadilly Line and there was about 18 people already in front of me ... but my gosh was it worth the wait ... we got row A seats 31 , 32 and 33 - they were great . Central seats would be ideal , but still they were fab . You do miss a bit at the beginning but its nothing to fret about ... <p> Kerry Ellis was amazing and Dianne Pilkington was amazing as Glinda .. I have seen wicked before - last year with the original cast - but prefer it now . Also , Oliver as Fiyero ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great voice ! ! <p> Overall a standing ovation , and an amazing performance <p> Previous to seeing the show , my friend said " I liked it , but I did n't love it . The choreography was n't very ' WOW ! ' " , and perhaps this lowered my expectations , but I thought it was a great piece of new musical theatre . Every penny is up there on the stage , and most of the sets only appear once , for five minutes , and then are hauled off never to be seen again ; this lack of thrift is nice from something that is obviously a money-spinning production rather than a labour of love . <p> Dianne Pilkington plays Glinda with the perfect balance of comedy and tragedy , and her in-jokes give the show its cleverness - it is actually a smarter show than I had realised , particularly in act 2 when the well known Dorothy storyline starts to kick in . However her singing is not great , particularly in act 1 ( she affects a silly voice for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing ( bad ) , leaving it very nasal , and the high notes sound rather operatic ) . In fact , ' Popular ' was a big hit , but more because she plays it silly and big rather than she hits any particularly impressive notes . Not true for Kerry Ellis who is serious **30;582;TOOLONG stuff . Pitch perfect in every department , I simply could n't fail to love the show whenever she was onstage : ' The Wizard And I ' , ' Defying Gravity ' , and ' No Good Deed ' are all showstoppingly amazing . <p> Interesting then that for a show which seems all about the lavish spectacle , that the big production numbers are the slowest moments . ' Dancing Through Life ' is nothing special and serves no real point except when Galinda realises how she has hurt Elphaba , and this is , admittedly , well handled ( partly due to the leads ' excellent acting ) but a 10 minute song to go around that moment is a bit much . ' One Short Day ' feels anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything and I think 20 minutes pruning in act 1 would keep the whole thing feeling lighter on its toes . As an aside , I think it was in these places that my friend found fault , and it 's true that this is in no way a dancer 's musical . Nigel Planer is underwhelming as the Wizard and looks like he 's about ready to leave the company . Neither of his songs really have anything to them and it niggled me that although none of the other characters affected an American accent , he did . <p> The enormous difference in the quality of the two witches ' singing voices mean that the duets are not perfect , particularly ' What Is This Feeling ? ' but by the end of act 2 , Glinda was far less whiney , so ' For Good ' was really , well , good . Overall , it feels like a really big production in a really big theatre , with , perhaps , slight overkill in almost every aspect ( slightly too long ; tries to do big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oz , particularly at the end are well and truly hammered home ; and somebody please tell me what is the dragon for ? ) , but my worst fears were unfounded - I did n't feel like I 'd been processed or sold cheap emotions , and actually had a wicked time ( sorry ) . <p> A few other bits and pieces : 1 ) I was shocked that there are no programmes or cast sheets , only 6 glossy brochures ( particularly having just come back from Broadway where everyone gets a free programme at every show ) . What a cheek ! <p> 2 ) I went during the week so there were n't very many children under about 15 , but the theatre really try to make it crap for everyone by selling big rustly plastic bags of crunchy popcorn , even coming into the aisles just before act 2 , so beware . <p> 3 ) I was sat in the centre of row G ( G25 , G26 ) . Great seats and did n't have to look up . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiggle occasionally to cover scene changes . <p> 4 ) As I left I overheard a teenage boy turn to his friend an say " ... yeah , but I have only seen it 4 times . " to which she replied " Really ? ! ? " so it looks as if repeat audiences will keep this one running for a while yet ... <p> A.C <p> Our trip to ' Wicked ' was on Tuesday 11th September 2007 - booked several months ago . Our seats were Row E 21 to 25 in the Dress Circle and we had a good view , seating was well raked and all the stage was visible . Legroom was a little tight but nothing out of the ordinary . <p> I came to this show with very little expectation and I came away having had a pleasant evening but I had not been " Wowed " . Parts of the musical are very funny , parts are very spectacular , the two leading ladies were both superb - fantastic singing by both Kerry Ellis and Diane Pilkington . I enjoyed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scenery and costumes were very glitzy and green . The diction from the chorus was very bad at times and the sound did n't blow you away but the story has been cleverly invented and woven around the original version with some neat touches . <p> The theatre seemed to be only two thirds full so I was surprised to read about people queuing to buy tickets . Maybe this was just a bad day for ticket sales . <p> My score overall would be 7 out of 10 - not in my top ten of musicals and I wo n't be going to see it again but an enjoyable evening out . <p> Friday 14th September 2007 : went to see ' Wicked . ' This is a toughie to comment on - the hardest yet . It 's easy when something is naff or great . For me the first hour bored me stiff and , having spoken to a few people in the audience , they also agreed ; however the next half hour in the emerald city was superb . For me the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in others / poor in other bits , very good and so on and so on . The costumes were great . The choreography I thought was quite basic - not much dancing and nothing that would give the choreographer sleepless nights ! ! ! ! Pity ; for me in musical the highlight is the dancing ! ! ! Sadly lacked a bit in this show ! ! ! <p> The singing , in my opinion , must rank amongst the best in the whole of the West End . The Wicked Witch ( green girl ) - her singing was phenomenal . For ME the good fairy , Galinda , I could n't stand her speaking voice or her singing voice . That is NOT saying she has n't got a good singing voice - just not my sort of voice . <p> Most of the songs I thought were boring and very similar - the best song for me was from the Wizard himself , " Wonderful , " - a different tune and catchy . Once again a great voice ( as did the green girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For me the show was too long . Normally the longer a musical , the better , but not in this case . The first hour could have been shortened by half an hour on what we saw . The monkeys were fantastic - obviously trained acrobats I would have thought ? <p> Now here comes the extra talent also ... the stage designers , the lighting , the special effects - all phenomenal . A very high standard - and obviously these " guys and dolls " who did this know their jobs - to the highest extent . <p> Would I go again ? No . Would I recommend it ? No . Would I not recommend it ? No . Would I stop anyone from going ? No . This is what I mean : this is a difficult one to opinine on because I did enjoy it and I did n't enjoy it ! It was ' great and it was n't great ' make sense of that if you can ! ! ! ! <p> The hardest musical I have ever had to opinine on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as always it 's a matter of one 's own opinion ... go and see for yourself ! ! ! ! ! <p> Christina <p> Wicked ' - As Good as it Gets <p> Originally got curious about ' Wicked ' when noticing its success each time I visited the USA and , despite REALLY not being a fan of the MGM , the success , size and spectacle drew me to watch it . Saw it back in June 2007 on a Saturday night and it simply blew me away , so much so that me and my girlfriend have already seen it again and booked tickets for another viewing in October 2007 . <p> ' Wicked ' is as big as you can get in terms of size and spectacle . Aside from ' Rent ' and ' Footloose ' I 'd always appreciated this kind of show more than others , shows like ' The Lion King , ' ' Chitty Chitty Bang Bang , ' etc . I would n't say ' Wicked ' is THE most lavish I 've ever seen , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the effects , everything is sheer quality - it 's no surprise that Hollywood giant Universal is behind the production . <p> The music is quite simply the finest of any show I 've seen . Whilst many shows have strong numbers with a few that really stand-out I think ' Wicked ' has almost 10 numbers that are brilliant , with several that are as good as anything I 've ever heard . The show reminds me of when Disney were churning out another golden age of animated musicals with the likes of ' Beauty and The Beast , ' ' The Little Mermaid , ' etc but in terms of the sheer number of killer songs multiply it by five . <p> The story is refreshingly different and very different from the book . Whilst it 's been " sugar-coated , " the author of the original novel appreciates the fact that you leave the show with the " right " feeling that he intended when writing his wildly successful fantasy . <p> Aside from production values and the music and story itself , the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . I do n't think I 've seen a greater lead-character and certainly Ellis 's performance is awe-inspiring . If you 're not left with rock-solid goose bumps when the curtain comes down for the interval you must be a robot . Idina Menzel made the role her own and my niece was extremely disappointed not to get the chance to see her playing Elphaba when she saw ' Wicked , ' but , needless to say , she now wishes it was Kerry Ellis singing on the soundtrack CD and not Menzel . <p> I guess if I had to note any negatives there 's a lack of traditional choreography and big dance numbers , but please do n't let that put you off . Also , the first half of the show is much bigger in terms of spectacle and feel-good factor ; but the emotional impact of the second half of the show makes up for that . <p> To summarize , ' Wicked ' is brilliant . Amazingly written songs , brilliant to look at , packed full of every kind of emotion and world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than this . <p> On a later visit to a Wednesday Afternoon performance in October 2007 : For our third time in 4 months we used the brilliant ' Orange 2-4-1 scheme ' ( an offer for that cellphone network 's users - editor ) to get two top price tickets for 60 for the Wednesday Matinee Performance . I would never choose this particular performance usually but we were in London for the evening to see Darren Hayes play the Royal Albert Hall in the evening so it made sense , if the offer was n't on we would n't have watched it again quite so soon but very glad we did . <p> In terms of the show the principle cast was thankfully all correct and present with the exception of understudies playing Morrible and Dillamond . With all due respect to Susie Blake and Martin Ball I was just delighted that Kerry Ellis was performing and to a lesser degree Pilkington and Tompsett . Interesting to note that my father ( who is 70+ and very much not a theatre-goer ) thought Glinda was outstanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space of the four months since I 've watched her , though , Dianne Pilkington has improved superbly and I was very impressed by her acting skills this time around when watching so closely . <p> This was my chance to catch Nigel Planer for the first time , as previously he was n't performing , and I have to say the show was much the better for it . The other guys were good ; but Planer was perfect as the Wizard . It 's a difficult role to play as the audience do n't know whether they should love him or loathe him and that 's exactly what Planer nails . Superbly played and I loved it when he spat a tiny piece of spittle toward Elphie by mistake when speaking some lines and , even though hardly anyone saw it and it only travelled a few feet , Kerry Ellis made a light-hearted gesture with her eyeline as if he 'd gobbed a massive ball of spit that flew straight past her - she had a " Wicked " look about her as if to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Seat Reviews : <p> Stalls Row Z 28 and 29 . Paid 40 for these 60 seats when visiting the Box Office on the day ( local discount offer , Editor ) and were good value for the money . My girlfriend is of average height for a female and her view was n't brilliant with someone of average height in front of her , quite far back with low ceiling due to Circle Overhang but for 40 good seats . For face value of 60 you can get MUCH better . <p> Stalls Row M15 , 16 and 17 : Researched these seats and came up trumps . Superb . The raking just comes into effect and the aisle location means that the person in 17 has a total unrestricted view . Plenty of key scenes straight ahead too . If you 're paying top price for tickets , these are near-perfect seats <p> Despite wanting to check out the show from the Circle I 'd been put off by many reviews on this site so this time plumped for the Stalls Row C Seats 32 and 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalls block and this is the second time I 've sat on the aisle on a side block and strongly feel that any aisle seat on either side block from Row C back to P are brilliant . Because of the angle your view will be totally un-interrupted and the seat in from it are usually very good too . My seat in Row C on the aisle was perfect bearing in mind it was my third viewing . I had no one sat in front of me in Row B so when Elphie , Glinda and Co , were my side of the stage it felt like they were singing directly to me . Awesome . <p> Like others have said before though , for a first viewing I think ideally it 's better to sit further back - I bought my parents tickets in P16 and 17 which was a few rows back from my last seats and they loved their view . Having now watched the show from both sides of the Side-stall 's I would recommend labelling Seat No 's C17 back to P17 and C32 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seats next to these wo n't be as good but they 'll still be good ones . <p> Loathing , unadulterated loathing ? No way ! I went to see Wicked on Thursday ( 18th October 2007 ) for the 14th time , this time taking another 94 critics in the shape of pupils aged between 11-16 . They absolutely loved the show and I thought it was one of the best performances I have seen yet . Kerry Ellis was on top form , with ' No good Deed ' and ' Defying Gravity ' being highlights , gave me goosebumps . It was the first time I have been since Dianne Pilkington has taken over the role of Glinda ... with a Ga . I went with reservations , but she was amazing , ultra funny and has made the role her own . Kerry and Dianne have a great chemistry and it looked like they were having a great time . <p> As for the sits , we were spread across the front section of the stalls . I sat in row N seat 19 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because no one was sitting in front of me ( lucky lucky ) . The seats in the front section are poorly raked and hardly staggered which means your full view can be blocked if you are smaller . Some pupils needed cushions kindly supplied by the staff , to help them see . So I would pick front dress circle or the first 5 rows of the stalls . Some pupils commented that some of the action was missed as they were on the ends ( seats 3-7 ) and sight lines are not great ( I have trained them well ! ! ) <p> Overall though , apart from some of the seating , a great show that I have yet to get bored with . Go Kerry , we salute you ! <p> Peter Rose <p> Queued up for day tickets to see the performance on Tuesday 16th October 2007 . I arrived at 8.00am and discovered I was the queue ! ! After another 20 minutes or so another 2 arrived followed by another 2 another 20 minutes later . By 10am there was only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A22 to 24 and have to say they must be one of the best bargains in London . The view of all the action is amazing because you do not have to look up to see it all . <p> This was my first time at ' Wicked ' although my wife and daughter saw it last year . They both thought that Kerry Ellis was amazing and if anything better than Idina Menzel . I personally thought Dianne Pilkington was quite sensational as Glinda . The show itself was quite amazing and I would certainly recommend anyone to but the 25 day seats and have a great evening . <p> This was the second time for me ( first time for my partner ! ) and I enjoyed it much more this time . We had B14 and B15 in the Dress Circle . We were both amazed at how remote we both felt , despite being only 2 rows back from the front of the circle . The seats were good , though the person in front of me kept moving leaning forward when any action took place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . <p> <p> The Green Girl Lives On ! <p> There is SO much to say about this musical that frankly I 'm going to find it hard to keep this a readable length . <p> First off , I decided to take a look at the reviews on this page to see what people had thought about the masterpiece that is ' Wicked , ' and although it had many valid points , found myself irritated by the line in the TheatreMonkey review stating that Wicked gives " spectacle over substance . " You see , the WONDERFUL thing about Wicked stems from its depth and beauty ... <p> The hidden meanings and themes are intriguing , sometimes political , and frankly so moving that the second time I saw it my eyes hardly stayed dry . ( I 've seen it 3 times and am going again on January 18th 2007 ) <p> The thing is , the more you read into it , the more life-changingly wonderful it becomes ! You begin to notice hidden refrains , leitmotifs and chord progressions .. Songs and characters that used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucked into the hugely moving story of this girl and the 3D world in which she lives . But Wicked is n't just for those looking for an obsession and a new philosophy on life . The Tony award wining sets and costumes mixed with the obviously powerful and catchy songs and score shimmer with style and splendour . <p> All of this contributes to the absolutely spellbinding experience Wicked provides night after night . There are , I believe , 8 productions currently running around the world ; ' Wicked ' has broken records on Broadway , around Europe and the UK , fans spend hundreds of pounds to return over and over again and it has spawned itself an almost religious following similar to that of the legendary " RENTheads , " all fantastic proof of how ' Wicked ' has managed to touch literally millions ! <p> I fully understand why people may be sceptical , I 'm not a totally nanve obsessive fan girl . I myself went to it originally expecting a ' Wizard of Oz ' rip-off with mediocre music and no depth , but out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last couple of years , nothing has inspired and affected me so much . I pray with my heart and soul that this will lead the way for a new wave of musicals which are n't  obsessed with cheesy melodies , big dance numbers and an ever-grinning cast . <p> Whether you love " The Wizard of Oz " or not , ( It means nothing to me but for fans it tells you how Dorothys friends came to be and there are some witty references ) , please give this musical a chance and go see it ! <p> See the green girl as you 've never seen her before , let your heart " Defy Gravity , " and allow Wicked to change you - " for good .. " <p> LATER VISIT : Well , when I posted my first review of Wicked on Theatremonkey ( above ) , I was about to return for my fourth time , and theatremonkey asked me to e-mail again with my comments on what it was like now <p> I have to admit I was actually a bit worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was amazing but was n't the best , and I was worried perhaps ' Wicked ' was losing its magic for me <p> BOY was I wrong ! ! ! <p> I go to the theatre a LOT . I see lots of good shows , bad shows , and some that frankly never should be shown at all , and I can honestly say Ive NEVER seen anything quite as magnificent as what I witnessed on 18th January 2008 . <p> I sat in the stalls , near the back of the front section , great seats with a good view , and I was totally absorbed into the world I 've grown , over the last year , to love . <p> Kerry Ellis is one of the greatest performers I 've ever had the pleasure of seeing onstage and after over a year of playing Elphaba now understands every single movement and emotion of the character to the fullest degree ! She effortlessly hit notes most people could only dream of , and on many occasions caused the audience to erupt into rapturous applause . Dianne Pilkington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines are INCREDIBLY hard ! ! ! ) is the single most hilarious comic actress Ive ever seen onstage , reducing me to a giggling lump in " popular , " laughing so much it hurt . She has a great performing talent to pick up on any hint of humour , no matter how small , and create a comic masterpiece . <p> The rest of the cast were similarly stunning ! The chorus never missed a beat and the choreography was of the highest calibre , the kind of drilled group it seems only the best American choreographers can manage , and I noticed this 4th time , lots of hidden musical staging and clever choreography I had n't  noticed in my previous visits . Any principal characters I had doubts about had also improved immensely , most notably Katie Rowley Jones , who was absolutely spectacular as Nessarose , a very difficult part to pull off . <p> I do n't  really know what more I can say to describe how amazing this experience was for me and how much it restored my faith in ' Wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of rush of excitement you can only get from true genius . I was shaking and my heart was thumping , yet I ' couldnt have been happier ! ' <p> And the comments of the other audience members only help to reiterate my point . After the Blackout before the interval , I looked at the woman and her child in front of me ... They just looked at each other and said " wow . " The cheers and woops were deafening throughout , and when the lights faded at the end of the finale , one of the loudest cheers I have ever heard ripped through the theatre . <p> There were standing ovations wherever I looked , ( Though I found myself almost angry there were not more ! ) some younger audience members waving , screaming and cheering , people still drying their eyes , and as I left , I found myself grinning uncontrollably , caught blissfully between laughter and tears . <p> As I was leaving I looked back towards the magnificent proscenium arch stage and thought to myself that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could leave the theatre that night and not have fallen under the ' Wicked ' spell , I will honestly , NEVER understand ! <p> Holly M <p> In spite of the hype surrounding this mystery musical , I reluctantly conceded to my girlfriends insistent pleas , and booked some tickets in the centre of Row G in the Circle . And despite trying to look happy to be there , I truly was n't . Overall , the show lacked " oomph " . To someone who works in the industry , the whole show seemed like a Christmas cracker ; packed full of the old cheesy stuff just to make sure everyone feels like they have got the moneys worth . The choreography was lackadaisical , and the special effects just werent special at all . The mix where I was sitting was absolutely dreadful ; I could hear bass and nothing else . <p> The wonderful cast however , did contribute something to the show . Outstanding performances came from Nigel Planer and Kerry Ellis , and a less than satisfactory performance from the Dragon hiding the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by far the better , was sadly rushed , and I felt let down by that . Needless to say , swarms of other people probably enjoy the quirky first Act , as well as the improper use of the English language . Perhaps I am a little sceptical , but for me , this was awful . The show lacked character , menace and insatiability . Nothing stood out on stage with poise and elegance ; it felt like watching something turned out of Bollywood to make quick money , forgetting what the true Theatre experience is all about . <p> Maks Taylor <p> 2nd of January 2008 : went to see ' Wicked ' for my fourth time . I queued for day seats 25 , got seats A19 to 21 . Amazing , perfect view the best seats in the house - front row . Everyone was on top form ; it was a full cast except for " Glinda , " which Sarah Earnshaw played . I have never seen her before but she is very , very good . I think I prefer Dianne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , a fantastic show , thoroughly enjoyable , Everyone will love it . <p> We went to see ' Wicked ' on 8th February 2008 .. We sat in stalls Z39 and 40 .. which I was really worried about but the view was excellent .. except we could n't see the dragon at the top of the stage , but it did n't  matter . <p> It was really great , and I would definitely go again ! <p> Ashleigh Gray was playing Elphaba .. and she was EXCELLENT ! ! ! ! Her singing voice was better than anyone in the show ! <p> I saw Wicked for the first time last week ( May 2008 ) and I sat in the Dress Circle row T seat 10 . Like other people already said , it 's really distant from the stage , but you saw everything and the sound was great ! <p> The only bad thing was that in the row behind me sat a quite drunk couple and they were talking loud the whole time ! I tried to give them mean looks but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to one of the guards and told them but , before they could do anything , the couple stood up and ( accidentally ? ) spilled drinks all over my , and the girl sitting next to me 's , seat . I got really mad and started arguing with the man and they left . I do n't know if the crew talked to them later because they gave us new seats to compensate for the wet ones . This time we got row P seat 35 . They are marked as red but I liked the seat . Really good legroom and a bit closer to the stage . Would , however , prefer to sit even more close . I 'm glad we got to change seats but I would 've preferred a free ticket for another time because the whole first act was completely destroyed because of those idiots behind us .... <p> I just booked tickets for the 6th June 2008 evening show , this time in the stalls row ZE seat 24 , I do n't know if its closer to the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's definitely not going to be the last time I see ' Wicked ! ' <p> ' Wicked the Musical ' is certainly one of ( if not the ) best West End show around at the moment . I think everyone at one time in their life has felt like an outcast , and I think that not only is this musical modern and entertaining , but also something each of us can relate to . <p> I have read many a review of how people are ' reluctant ' to buy tickets for their friends . However , I think if this is your attitude when you go , of course you are going to focus on the bad points . And this is the case for any show . Therefore I 'm here to tell you the point of view from someone who certainly was n't reluctant - getting tickets 3 times . <p> Act 1 is certainly the more complicated of the acts , both technically and in terms of how the characters develop . The singing is superb and every night is professional as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters is shown so well by the cast and the understudies . The story is a bit of a typical ' high school ' film , but because it 's set in its own world , it just makes it that more different . I think it 's magical , the Act 1 songs are the ones I always come out singing . <p> Act 2 is less complicated to follow , as we are not skipping from scene to scene as fast , which actually works with the theme of ' neither side is winning just grinding to a halt ' ( Yes , I 'm a drama student , I look out for these things ) . But , I have to say this is definitely the Act which will make you emotional . All the characters have a difficult life in the act , and it is quite sad . It is so well performed I feel like I 'm actually a part of the land of Oz . <p> What is this feeling ? It 's the feeling that you want to buy tickets NOW ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 and 10 to see the matinee performance on 11th June 2008 . We arrived at the theatre at 10.10am and luckily , got 4 of the last 5 seats they sell for 25 - they were A 27 to 30 . <p> The show is wonderful ; however I must comment that our two boys would have benefited from having a cushion as they were quite low down to the stage and one got a sore neck in the last hour from looking up . However the seats would be perfectly fine for adults . The theatre was about three quarters full I estimate . Wonderful show , we had Alexia Khadime as Elphaba , she was very good . <p> Karin W from New Zealand <p> <p> This was my third visit to see " Wicked " ( 20th May 2008 ) taking along my mum this time ... who absolutely loved it . Previously I 'd been up in the circle each side - rows B and D respectively - so this time I booked early and bagged row C 18 and 19 in the stalls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got to see such a different show sat there and felt so up close and personal with everything that was going on in font of me . No-one will have a problem sitting in these seats , they were great ! ! ! <p> Cassidy Janson ( who has now left the production ) was in the title role as Elphaba and was completely amazing . Just as good as Kerry Ellis , I find it hard to believe she was n't promoted into the role while Kerry is away on Broadway . <p> Harriet Thorpe has got to be the best Madam Morrible to date , playing the role with the right amount of sinister humour and nastiness to make her an absolute joy to watch . <p> ' Wicked ' is the number 1 show in the West End and it 's not hard to see why and there are not many people who do n't come away having had a great evening out . It 's a barn of a theatre and needs a big venue to do the show justice . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stalls row K , so a different perspective again . <p> My latest visit to see Wicked ( 4th time - July 2008 ) was another fantastic night out with a standing ovation at the end . My friend who came along with me was blown away by it , and wants to go again . The new Elphaba played by Alexia Khadeim was incredible , you could hear every word she was singing and boy , what a pair of lungs she has on her . She is a great little actress too and for me is the best Elphaba yet ( yes , better than Kerry and Idina ) . <p> I wo n't waffle on anymore with regards to the show in general because I 've done that on previous reviews , however , i will mention a couple of negatives ( i know , sorry ! ) . Firstly , Desmond Barrett , who is the new actor playing the great and terrible Oz , ironically ai n't great ... but he is terrible . The part of the Wizard is pretty boring anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole part of the Wizard needs to be revamped and they need someone with a fresh outlook on the whole part . I see him as some sort of mad Dr a cross between the Joker and Emmet Brown from ' Back To The Future . ' The Wizard 's costume is so drab - as are the lines from the script - that it 's the only part of the production that sags . It should n't , because the Wizard is one of the main reasons Oz is Oz , a man of no power but a liar and a cheat . Mr Barrett unfortunately does everything in monotone and not an ounce of charisma comes from him . It spoils the whole feel of the show and almost makes you think that they should write it out completely . Good job I 'm not up on that stage ' cos they 'd be in for a shock ! ! ! ! ! LOL . <p> The other point I would like to raise is the rake in the front section stalls . We were sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre and 11 rows from the front , perfect , I hear you cry , well cry you will because the rake is non existent and even at 6ft 1 " I could not see over the head of the guy in front of me . OK , this particular guy did have the head the size of a large pumpkin ( yes he did ) in fact he could go to his local farm show and he 'd win first prize for the largest pumpkin EVER ! ! If anyone is slightly smaller they will not see a thing and at 60 a time for these seats it 's no laughing matter . I had a much better view from row C when I was sat there at a previous performance because you do have to look up to the stage . Row K you are looking straight ahead , I would n't recommend these seats to anyone . Row A to F would be OK , and I would miss the next few rows out and opt for row P going further back as the rake starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seats were n't directly behind eachother and moved slightly left or right with each row so that you are looking through the gap of heads rather than at a head ( or pumpkin in my case ) . <p> " Stalls K 41 and 42 . Purchased through Ticketmaster for 30 plus service charge . We thought these seats were fair value . Row K is a good distance from the stage in that you are close enough to see everything and feel the emotions of the characters , and far enough that you can take in the whole stage and are not looking up . We could comfortably see almost everything from seats 41 and 42 . There are a very few scenes where you have a few seconds of a restricted view ( mainly left hand side ) but as soon as the characters come further forward ( usually within seconds ) --you have a wonderful view . This is mainly due to the proscenium arch , but it in no way detracted from my enjoyment of the show . In fact , the savings of 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also go to ' Billy Elliot the next night : - ) " <p> I loved Wicked--it is a wonderful show--my evening did indeed " defy gravity " . <p> B <p> We went to see Wicked on the 6th August 2008 , managing to get 10th row circle tickets ( K20 to K29 ) for 40 each from the booth within Leicester Square Tube Station . The view was great , apart from the very front of the stage being cut off ( not that we missed anything ) . Leg space was adequate , though our America friends felt cramped , however we left without bruises on our legs from the seats in front which is n't always the case ! <p> I probably ought to proclaim my bias ... Stephen Schwartz can do no wrong ... so obviously I loved ' Wicked , ' however I was n't blind to its faults . Without doubt the first half is much stronger than the second . The pace is good , the humour is well-placed and mixes well with the more serious aspects of the story . However the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fiyero helps Elphaba escape by threatening Glinda and the guards with a musket , was too broad and out of keeping with what should have been a dramatic moment . It made the transition to the next scene and Elphaba singing No Good Deed feel very clunky . <p> Also the quality of the effects in the second half disappointed , particularly the transformation of Boq into the Tin Man was wheeling him behind a wardrobe , waiting , then wheeling him out the best they could come up with ? <p> I was glad that I knew the songs well before I went as the quality of the vocals was poor ; it was hard to make out most of the lyrics , whether this was the fault of the sound engineer or the artists I do n't  know . Also whoever was doing percussion in the pit should be fired . He or she had no finesse , sense of timing or understanding of dynamics and seemed incapable of counting to 4 . The rest of orchestra were great and the balance with the vocals was fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and really enjoyed the show ; its stronger than some recently written musicals I 've been to see , with songs and themes which lodge in your brain . It really ought to be on the must see list . <p> Steph Nicholls <p> Went to the matinee performance on 9th August 2008 . This was our second visit to see ' Wicked , ' having seen it right after it opened with the original cast . I enjoyed it then , but enjoyed it even more this time round . We sat in seats K26 and 27 in the stalls . Fantastic seats , dead centre , a good rake and outstanding view . Could not recommend these seats highly enough . <p> Last time , I moaned about the quality and price of the programme ; this time , a different moan . Why is it that some audience members ( foreign tourists this time ) think its acceptable to hold conversations with each other throughout the performance ? Behind us were a trio of the most rude people I 've come across in any West End performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they constantly exchanged comments , not even in a whisper . Thought of turning round a couple of times and telling them in the politest way to shut up but decided this would only encourage them - so I did my best to ignore them . <p> Despite the people behind us , we loved it . The current cast - principals and ensemble are outstanding with the acting , vocals and dancing . I had forgotten just how visually stunning this production is with seamless scene changes , spectacular settings and awesome costumes . From the seats I mentioned you can see everything in vivid detail which was great . If you go , catch the costumes worn at the start of the second act during ' Thank Goodness ' - they are the best I think I have ever seen in the West End and reminded me in some ways of the costumes worn during the Ascot sequence in the movie ' My Fair Lady ' although these are a lot more colourful . <p> Going back a second time with a different cast you make comparisons so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best voices I have ever heard in London . Absolute power , completely pitch perfect and expressive . She was better than Idina Menzel both vocally and with her performance . She made the character all the more human and the times that Elphaba is funny she really hit home . Outstanding performance . I have to say that when she sang ' No Good Deed ' the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end and the audience roared their approval at the end of the song . All of her songs were great but that went into a different league . London has got itself one hell of an Elphaba . <p> We saw the standby Sarah Earnshaw as Glinda . Now , I do n't know what Dianne Pilkington has got , but if she matches Ms Earnshaw then wow . She blew Helen Dalimore 's performance ( which I enjoyed ) out of the water . She was hilarious , but could move you during her sadder moments . But it was the humour - she absolutely nailed it 100 percent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels like a Glinda and adds her own little touches which were great . Her performance of ' Popular ' stopped the show . The audience howled with laughter and she picked up every nuance and meaning of the song . Brilliant performance and a fabulous voice . <p> Oliver Thompsett sang , moved and acted much better than Adam Garcia . Was much more convinced with his Fiyero . His performance of ' Dancing Through Life ' was brilliant . He caught the humour of the role much more effectively as he did the more emotional and tender sides to the character . <p> Harriet Thorpe as Morrible was less over the top than Miriam Margolyes and more sinister , but she was a glorious Morrible . From our seats you saw the facial expressions and gestures while other characters were speaking and singing which revealed as much and more than as when she is speaking/singing herself . <p> Desmond Barritt was better than Nigel Planer as the Wizard . He was everything the Wizard should be and seemed more relaxed than Mr Planer was in the role . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both good but I think I preferred the original cast members more . No criticism of their performances because they were very good- just a personal preference . Jeremy Legat especially was just not how I see Boc . <p> The ensemble are outstanding - really are at the top of their game . <p> The special effects are wonderful and even second time round hit home . <p> We loved it last time but enjoyed it even more this time - a fabulous show ! Go and see Alexia Khadime as Elphaba though - she is just amazing ! <p> The show remains ' wicked ' in every way ! Go and see it ! <p> Went to see ' Wicked ' on the 30th July 2008 . Was the matinee and a sign interpreted performance . Do not be put off by signed performances , I forgot the woman was in the corner of my eye after 5 minutes ! Maybe it 's just the fact I 've seen it 4 times now , but I think the new cast are rubbish . Dianne has gone from pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as funny this time round , she seemed to be bored . I like Alexia as Elphaba , for she interpreted the character in a different way , but personally Kerry Ellis still rocks . And as for Caroline as Nessarose , I saw her understudy Galinda and think she deserves the role now ! She was much better . The new Boq is okay , but the old one will be missed . And Oliver Tompsett is the only person who is still amazing as ever and did n't disappoint . Went to the stage door afterwards . We do n't like Alexia ; we were the last two people in line and she said she was too busy to do anymore autographs ! How lazy and rude is that ? Oliver Tompsett and Jeremey Legatt were very nice however , and we love them . <p> Sat in the Stalls Row C seats 12 and 13 . Brilliant view all the time ! But for some reason I prefer Row D ! Totally worth the price as in many theatres , side view seats would be at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this amazing show for the third time ( 25th August 2008 ) . Great , although Alexia Khadime does not have the same spark as previous Elphabas and Diane Pilkington was not on either . <p> Our Seats : Stalls Row G 40 and 41 only cost 20 and were great value - especially considering a few seats across they were 60 . There were only a couple of occasions that our view was not great , but overall brilliant value - I would suggest that the seats similar to these at the other side i.e. Row G 8 and 9 would be slightly better than ours as there is a circular stairway on our side which does protrude more than on the other , where there is n't one . But if your on a budget and want to see this great show do n't hesitate . <p> John <p> Went to see ' Wicked ' on 27th August 2008 ( Wednesday Matinee ) . The seats were adequate ( Stalls Row T 3 to 5 ) although I was surprised that , booking at 10 am on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event - editor ) tickets went on sale I could n't get better tickets . <p> I had n't seen the show before and was totally blown away by it , and I absolutely loved Alexia Khadime as Elphaba . My only problem was the behaviour of other people . We sat behind four young women who gave the impression they did n't really want to be there . They spent the entire time fidgeting about , talking ( which caused a problem as my kids tried to angle themselves to look through the gap of heads , so every time they put their heads together to have a chat , my kids could n't see ) , passing sweets backwards and forwards ( and no , they did n't pass them to the next person , they passed them to the person furthest away from them ) and going to the lavatory . <p> I have n't been to the theatre for many years so I might be out of date here , but when did this kind of conduct become acceptable ? It spoiled my enjoyment to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in a hurry to go to the theatre again . Admittedly , I " only " spent 90 for three tickets when the full price was 180 , but still , it is too much money to waste when you get distracted by inconsiderate people around you . <p> Myself and three friends went to see ' Wicked ' last night ( Thursday 28th August 2008 ) and what a show it was . It was my second time to see it , but my friends thought that it was absolutely spectacular ! <p> When I saw it last time , I was sat in the Circle Row K Seats 14 to 17 , which , at the time were 30 , but as I have just noticed have now changed to 40 . These seats were good , although the characters seemed quite far away , and also the front of the stage was cut off by the bar splitting the circle and the top of the stairwell just a row in front of us . Cassidy Janson ( who has now left ) played Elphaba , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she still played the part perfectly . The sound was powerful and loud and nothing can fault those seats for the amount of money we paid . <p> Back to the 28th August , we sat sat in the Stalls Row R Seats 43 to 46 . Although these seats were located right on the left - hand aisle , and just behind the aisle splitting the stalls horizontally . Surprisingly , nobody got up and walked out to the toilets etc. during the show , so the view was not blocked by anyone ( this was except for about 20 seconds during ' What is this Feeling ' when 2 latecomers had to slip into their seats , which luckily were also on an aisle so did n't result in people standing up ! ) <p> On your seating plan , it marks seats 45/ 46 as red ... but I think that this is wrong ! My two friends who sat here basically had the same view as myself and my other friend did in seats 43 / 44 . They were all worth 30 , so obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time where you could n't see scenery because of the staircase on the left hand side of the stage , like the house in the Catfight Scene and the Stairwell during ' For Good ' but you did not miss anything at all because most of the action took place on centre stage . Here , the sound was better than previously because the orchestra sounded louder and therefore the songs were more spine- chilling , and also you could actually see the character 's facial expressions ! <p> We saw Alexia Khadime as Elphaba and Dianne Pilkington as G(a)linda , and they were both phenomenal ! Defying Gravity was perfect , and the flying section made me get goosebumps because it was so loud and powerful ! Oliver Tompsett was perfect as Fiyero , as like before , and Harriet Thorpe as Madame Morrible was brilliant . We saw all of the cast except for Dr. Dillamond/ Witch 's Father who was played by the understudy , David Stoller . I would n't fault the rest of the cast at all because it all was perfect ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please consider the block of 30 seats in the rear stalls because they are really good value for money , especially as there are 60 seats situated next to them ! Wicked was really " wicked " ! ! ! <p> Tom C <p> We went to see the matinee performance of Wicked on Wednesday 27th August 2008 . Our seats were stalls row D 36 and 37 which were each 20 . The performance was amazing and we thought Alexia 's voice was fantastic particularly in " No Good Deed " which was a very powerful performance . <p> As for the seats they were very good value for money and I would definitely recommend them to anyone , particularly if they enjoy being close to the action . At other musicals I have sat in the circle , but preferred the experience in the stalls as you could see the acting more clearly . Our seats were classified as restricted view - and occasionally we could not see people when they were entering the stage - but we did n't miss any important parts of the show as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stage . I am glad to see these seats are marked green on the chart because I would definitely choose them again . <p> Harriet <p> Theatre : I thought it was very impressive , the structure inside was very nice and really matched the atmosphere , unlike Cambridge theatre . I was also very impressed on how big it was . Overall it was a great experience just being inside . <p> Musical : ' Wicked ' was indeed a very good musical and I 'm sure it deserves No.1 in in the monkey polls ; but it only comes third in mine - better than ' Chicago ' but not ' The Phantom Of The Opera . ' But yes , you should really go to see it , although my friend said that it was quite too juvenile for his taste . but on the other hand the special effects were dazzling and the songs really sent shivers down your spine ; but I thought that the front seats in the stalls were really affected by an overflow of smoke that covers the whole theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row c seats 36 to 37 , which were 20 each and when the show started I really knew why ! ! These seats were really on the side , and parts of the musical were blocked by the staircase on stage . I actually thought that the best seats were in the stalls behind row P in the middle , just because of the rake . In my seats , a very tall man sat in front of me for the second half and I had a neck ache by the end of the show . I also noticed the seats were old , creaky and very uncomfortable - the space was poor and the leg room atrocious . <p> Overall : ' spellbinding ' , ' dazzling ' and very well done . I doubt I would want to see it again , but that 's just my opinion for the most ' popular ' musical in London . <p> 4 out of 5 <p> Cristopher H. <p> My Mother and I went to see ' Wicked ' on Tuesday 16th September 2008 and I think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . I was annoyed by this fact because I had been looking forward to seeing this musical for several years . The acoustics were terrible and we could hardly understand what Glinda was singing half of the time . <p> Our seats were in Row T , seats 33 and 34 in the Dress Circle . Alexia Khadime was amazing as Elphaba but I was particularly disappointed when , during ' Defying Gravity , ' which is arguably the best song in the whole production , a young male usher was stood directly in my way . This frustrated me a great deal as he blocked out the moment where Elphaba starts to fly . I could only see her once again when she had reached the top of the stage . <p> Our view was also obscured by a female usher during the first 15 minutes when she stood in the stairwell , blocking my view directly , even when she was n't ushering anyone to their seats . <p> I have complained to the theatre about this and I have so far heard nothing back . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for me , it ruined the whole show . I had heard many great things about " Wicked " and the show itself is a brilliant production . The staff , however , left a lot to be desired . <p> I went to see ' Wicked ' for the 6th time on Friday 11th July 2008 . This time I queued for ' day seats ' for the first time - and that was an experience . I got there at 7.45am and there was only one girl waiting . After about 40 minutes we were about 5 and then came an American family , a mother with her two teenage daughters . The mother kept nagging about the girls not having enough clothes on , it was a bit chilly in the shadow , but the girls did n't want to lose their place in line . So I talked to them and offered to buy them a ticket - so the mother stayed and the girls went back to the hotel nearby to get a sweater . When the box office opened I got money from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my help . We then walked separate ways but just before the show started they came to me with a box of chocolate wrapped in gold paper , I was so touched , that was such a nice thing to do ! This good deed did n't go unpunished : ) <p> OK , so about the seat : I got A25 and although I 've read that sitting behind the conductor would n't be a problem , it kind of was for me . Not a lot but it was a little bit disturbing , especially when he was making little dance moves or something : ) Apart from that , I really loved the seat ! It was right in front of the action and it felt as if Alexia Kadhime was looking straight at me when she was singing " No good deed " . It was so incredibly intense and really gave me the chills ! Ok , she was probably looking at the conductor , but still : ) I 'm going to queue for day seats again sometime this week and this time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit to the side . <p> I went to see Wicked for the 5th time on 24th December 2008 for the only performance , and then again for the matinee on 3rd January 2009 . <p> I personally felt that the 24th December was n't as good as the 3rd January . I think this was because it was the day before Christmas , and not many people want to be working on that day . So I did feel sorry for them ! However I still thoroughly enjoyed the show and it 's amazing to see Kerry back at work ! She 's still bubbly as ever . <p> We sat in Row D of the Stalls in seats 36 and 37 . Excellent view for the price , much prefered then my old favourties of 25 on the other side . Leg room acceptable , and considering the seat next door is 60 , it 's a bargain . Only disadvantage is scenes with dry ice make you very cold , and there is no heating ! But loved them . Comfortable as always . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant too . <p> The 3rd January was much more fun , partly because the person I went with is as obsessed with ' Wicked ' as I am , and also we went to the stage door twice ! ( I thoroughly recommend going to the stage door at ' Wicked ' as they are always very nice and make it really enjoyable ) . We got all the main cast that were performing to sign before ( as some do n't come out after matinees ) and even some of the ensemble ! Then we actually watched the show , and there was so much energy for 2009 . <p> Definitely my favourite time at Wicked ! Kerry Ellis amazed my friend so much that she stopped singing ( my friend that is ) ! Dianne was hilarious as ever . Oliver is still dancing through life ! But my favourite is Jeremy Legat . I was n't sure at first when I saw him , but he 's my favourite Boq and I love him . I cheer him every time he comes on ! For this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as Caroline Keiff , but still very talented and would pay to see her . <p> We sat in Row J of the Stalls in seats 44 and 45 . Personally this was the biggest bargain I 've ever made at a theatre . I could see all but one part of ' The Wizard and I ' because of the stairs , and Elphaba 's entrance to the Ozdust Ballroom , but otherwise everything was clear and detailed . I loved it . Definitely good seats . Much better then others same priced in the stalls . Legroom is good at the end of row and very comfortable . Some theatres that sell 15 seats are n't anything compared to this . <p> We went back to the stage door after the performance to get photos and missing autographs ! Very fun , finally gave George Ure ( understudy for Boq ) his present and I made his day ! If Jeremy does decide to leave , he has to be next Boq ! <p> Get your tickets now and you 'll be on top of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well , what can I say this time ? This was my SEVENTH time to see Wicked on 23rd January 2009 for the evening . I deliberately went this time for my Birthday and because I wanted to see Ashleigh Gray play the role of Elphaba . Apart from that , we had the main cast . <p> I must say , Ashleigh Gray is the best Elphaba I have ever seen ! She 's positively a star . Therefore I would n't be disappointed by not having Kerry Ellis . If you enjoy the show with Kerry , I think you must try seeing Ashleigh. it 's my favourite time at Wicked and was truly a night to remember ! I think I 'm going to try and see her again myself . <p> Of course the rest of the cast are amazing as usual ! In fact not only was this my favourite time , but I think it 's the best audience of ' Wicked ' I 've been to . You could tell people had come just to see Ashleigh because there were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bigger standing ovation than the last few times I 'd been ! <p> We sat in the stalls Row H seats 41 to 42 . Must say I loved these seats . I think I 'd get them around here because you 're not too far at the side , and not too close to the action to get a bad neck . Lots of legroom , extremely comfortable , just beware of uber tall people in front ( although I did n't have one ) . Could see everything from exit to entrance . <p> Went to the stage door after , many an Ashleigh fan is around which is good to see . People who had just seen the show camped out for day seats the next day ! All the cast are extremely nice , Ashleigh especially ! Once again , stage door is a must do . <p> I went to see ' Wicked ' with my friend for my birthday on the 19th of December 2008 . It was my second time round seeing it , and again , it was AMAZING ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We sat in seats Row B 27 and 28 in the Stalls . Even though you have them marked red , in my opinion , they are the best seats in the theatre . As the stage is quite low , you do n't have to look up so no neck ache ! And you are so close , you feel as if you are right in the action and you can see the facial expressions and costumes so clearly . These seats are best for fans of the show who have seen it before , because admittedly you do lose some of the impact of the set . If I had the chance , I would definitely book these seats again . <p> Kerry Ellis was fantastic as Elphaba , she sang and acted with so much emotion . We had Sarah Earnshaw , the understudy , as Glinda who sang flawlessly and was extremely funny in popular ! Oliver Tompsett was excellent as Fiyero , and we enjoyed ' Dancing Through Life ' very much . We thoroughly enjoyed Andy Mace , the understudy , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an amazing birthday which I will never forget and would definitely go for a third time ! A " wonderful " night out ! : ) <p> written by Bethan <p> February 2009 : ' Wicked ' was my fifth time . Sat in the stalls C26 and 27 . Good view , close to the stage where you can see all the actors trying their best ( except Desmond Barret who is still terrible ) . No problem with any large heads in my way this time , although a rather annoying child kept rocking backwards and forwards in her seat and as they are obviously not oiled you can imagine the squeaking got on ones nerves after a while . <p> My friend thoroughly enjoyed the show but I 'm not sure if I will go again now . ( I know nobody wo n't believe me ! ! ) ... <p> Myself and my fiancTe take in a few shows a year , a couple in London , a couple usually on tour in our home city of Cardiff . As we were visiting the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if we could get a decent deal on another performance of Wicked - our fourth time . This decision was based on three factors : <p> 1 ) The amazing Kerry Ellis finishing this Spring , and wanting to catch her playing Elphaba one last time , 2 ) Loving the show and in particular the music , 3 ) Nothing else really grabbing our attention at the moment ! <p> After checking online sales for a few weeks beforehand we noticed that availability really seemed limited considering that we 'd managed to get great seats previously , once even when Orange were offering their brilliant ' 2 for 1 ' deal ( now ended - editor ) . Seeing the demand , and the fact that the performance was totally packed out with approximately 30 people queuing outside the theatre at 7.20pm for return tickets for 7.30pm , really led me to believe that perhaps this show has genuinely picked up steam in terms of word-of-mouth and truly become the phenomenon that it 's promoters claim it to be ! Considering the size of the venue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a pretty good sign I 'd guess . <p> I digress ... we decided to show at the theatre on the morning of the performance to see how large the queue was for ' Day Seats , ' but we only got there 15 minutes before the 10am ' Doors Opening ' time and there were about 70 people ahead of us . Needless to say the front row seats were gone by the time we got to the Box Office , and we ended up paying face value ( 60 ) for what would appear to be excellent Dress Circle seats . Further to reviews on theatremonkey , I 've always avoided Circle seats but seeing as this was our fourth performance I was more than happy to have central seats only four rows from the front . In terms of sitting in the Circle this is about as good as it gets , so even though we did n't want to pay full price we were both happy that we had tickets at all - were at least pleased with what we managed to get . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst these seats are almost as good as it gets in the Circle , it 's still a long way up from feeling as though you 're part of the action . Considering the great seats you can get in the Stalls , the Circle is just too high up and far back . The leg room was OK and it was great to see more spectacle from the position , but this is far outweighed by what sitting in the stalls at the Apollo Victoria offers . Another thing I found unreal was how everyone had to lean forward to see the performers when they ventured to the front of the stage . You often get this was the front row or two but here I 'm talking everyone . It should be said , when attending the theatre I 'm neither a Circle or Stalls fan . Some shows I 'd prefer to be sat in the Stalls , some the Circle . It all depends on the show itself and obviously the theatre . Having now seen Wicked from four different areas , easily the best place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Stalls Front Section , side areas , C to P 17 , C32 to P32 . <p> If the above was n't bad enough , far and away the worst thing about sitting where we were was the almost non-existent sound level of the orchestra . It should be said , the vocals were fine . When the chorus belted out together , it was indeed as rousing as it should be ; but it was quite simply tragic to miss out on the wonderfully arranged score . Some of the very reasons myself and my fiancTe fell in love with ' Wicked ' so much could genuinely not be heard . The increasingly frantic strings at the climax of " The Wizard and I " , the masterfully dramatic horns of " Defying Gravity " and the emotionally charged accompaniment of " For Good " and the finale . Unless you knew they were there and listening out for them , they were almost non-existent . I 'm truly not exaggerating but I left wondering whether or not majority of the people in the Circle who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they simply did n't share the same emotional experience that I did when I first saw ' Wicked . ' In fact my sister saw the show several months ago from high up in the Circle and as a frequent musical-goer she was surprisingly un-moved by the whole experience and did comment that she felt far from the action and the sound was too quiet . <p> I 'm truly staggered that a mega-budget , worldwide smash on the scale of ' Wicked ' can allow approx 50% of it 's London audience to experience a below-par performance due to sound levels . I can appreciate that the Apollo 's layout may not be ideal in terms of a high Circle but sound level is surely easily remedied ? Not being a sound engineer myself I did wonder why the bank of speakers hanging from the roof was quite so minimal - you 'd think with 2000 people paying 60 a time 8 times a week , they could afford a few more ? <p> The cast and show itself ? Almost flawless . In fact , in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerry Ellis was genuinely awe-inspiring . Perfect , in fact , and it was with sad hearts that we saw her exit the stage for the very last time in this role as I ca n't remember a performer impressing me in a singular role as much as Ellis as Elphaba . Dianne Pilkington does sometimes grate and I do n't think she works well on duets with Ellis , but her performance of ' Popular ' is quite brilliant . Harriet Thorpe is probably the best Morrible I 've seen and Oliver Tompsett is quite simply Fiyero . I think Nigel Planer was far and away the finest Wizard , and whilst I preferred the previous Boq and Nessa-Rose this did n't detract in any way from a wonderful performance . <p> As we 've done once before , we loitered for 15 minutes after the show and told Tompsett and Ellis how much we enjoyed their performances ; and we were again very impressed at how lovely they were with a bunch of fans who were as useless with their camera phones as the Sound Engineers are with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found myself seeing Wicked in February Half Term on 3 occasions ! First time was on 18th February 2009 for the evenings and the other two were both on 21st February 2009 . <p> 18th February was very different from 21st February . Firstly , I was once again amazed at the crowd outside stage door after the matinee . I got pushed onto the wrong side of the barrier and when Kerry Ellis came out , I was almost on the floor . To escape the 1000 pleas for photos , Kerry ran across the road and was followed by several fans . Is this really the reputation we want in London 's Theatreland ? <p> However , after this the show was amazing once again . Kerry Ellis managed to recover from the stage door trauma and was even laughing at the end of As Long As You 're Mine . Oliver Tompsett and Dianne Pilkington both excellent too . We sat in Stalls Row G Seats 40 and 41 . Excellent seats , for 20 you can see everything . I do n't see where ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the side , I do think they are excellently priced and well worth it . Would attempt to get a few rows in front for the same price ( if possible ) though . The only understudy we had was for Boq , we had Alex Jessop and he was good , very funny , but I love Jeremy Legat more . Shame he was i 'll for the whole week because ... <p> 21st February showed another new Boq . George Ure finally went on for the first time in the role and as I have met him at stage door , I was waiting for the day he 'd play the role . Being second understudy for the character I decided I had to go both performances as I may never get a chance for a while ( if ever ) . He was THE best and is my joint favourite with Jeremy . His Scottish accent is just like all the cute well-known Boqs . I went just for him , and the added advantage was Ashleigh Gray was playing Elphaba ( which was my original reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerry Ellis and I 'm so glad that she and George are staying after cast change . I will see many Ashleigh performances as I can . She hits all the high notes and was wonderful . <p> Both shows were very successful and brilliant . Did n't get bored at either . Two Wicked performances in one day sounds mad , but it 's really wonderful . Best bit is , you notice any mistakes if things are different in either . For the matinee I sat in Stalls Row E seat 8 . This use to be my favourite area to sit in as it is amazingly priced for 25 when the seats nearby are 60 . You are up close and personal and the sound if perfect . Legroom at the end of the row is plenty and is very comfortable . <p> HOWEVER , having experienced 20 on the other side of the STALLS I personally feel they are better for money , because I do n't see the restriction over there , but at this seat where Glinda stands in the first scene blocked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stage is not visible . <p> For the evening I sat in the Circle Row R 31 and 33 . We got these last minute from the box office and I think they should be 15 . Compared to the 20 seats behind , which may be further back , they are even worse . There is a ledge in front because of the staircase and I could n't see sitting back ( and I am 5ft 8 ) . I had to lean forward for most of the performance and my back hurt so much at one point , I gave up and just sat forward enough to see their heads . However , from my last experience of the Circle , the sound has much improved and the view without the leaning would be fair value . However , go for Row T in the middle if wanting to sit in the Circle . Stalls for same price much preferred . <p> We bought our tickets through a third party and were given P38 and P39 , and although they 're in white on the seating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but we were quite lucky - the two seats in front of us were unoccupied ) . <p> We did n't really know what to expect as neither of us knew anything about the show , apart from that it was supposed to be excellent , which it proved to be ! The plot is creative , the music is fantastic and all the actors were incredibly talented , and even my boyfriend ( the musical-hater ) had to admit it was pretty damn good . <p> I have since bought the CD and every time I hear it I want to see it again . I recommend it to anyone and everyone ( even if musicals are n't your thing ) . <p> 28th February 2009 19:30 performance . <p> I 'm probably going to be outnumbered here , but having seen most shows currently in the West end : ' Les Mis , ' Oliver , ' ' Avenue Q , ' ' Grease , ' ' Dirty Dancing , ' ' Phantom of the Opera , ' ' Billy Elliot , ' ' Joseph , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was my second time seeing this and I stand by my words last time .... it is my least favourite . <p> I know , I know , it 's won awards and Kerry Ellis is amazing I agree . But I just fall asleep . This musical drags and this time I sat in the back circle , having previously sat in the stalls in top price seats , and it made the performance even less enjoyable . You can see the stage but everything 's mini and most of the binoculars were missing ! I find this show would probably be OK if you were a small child ( or like my partner you like all the flash stages and costumes ) , but to me - I do n't think the story generates enough interest and I find that the theatre 's cramped and not very well laid out in comparison to most others . It may suit others well , but if you prefer a storyline and to leave the theatre thinking - avoid this ! Its more for the ' want to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical ! <p> Louise Robinson , Lancaster <p> I went to the ' Wicked ' matinee on Saturday 11th April 2009 . I have to say I am one of these crazy people who ' day seat ' and on this occasion my friend and I went at 5am to queue for day seats . Five minutes later someone else joined us and by half past six another two people followed . By 10am the queue had stretched all the way down to the stage door , so I was kinda pleased I had got there early , though I was freezing . <p> I was able to purchase seat 23 on row A. I have sat in this seat before and I love it . Its very central and you do n't miss a thing , except perhaps the dragon , which only really moves at the beginning . I was too busy watching the action onstage anyway . The show was really good . Kerry Ellis was on as Elphaba and Dianne Pilkington was on as Glinda . I love Kerry Ellis and I think her and Alexia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen Dianne Pilkington before , but I have also seen Sarah Earnshaw too , and I must say I much prefer Sarah 's way of Glinda then Dianne 's . Dianne seemed to lack energy and enthusiasm yesterday , and I just felt like she was being really fake and rushing through her lines . <p> Oliver Tompsett was on as Fiyero and he is awesome , I think he does a really good job of playing Fiyero . I 'm glad he 's staying after cast change . Harriet Thorpe was Madame Morrible and she really scares me , she is kind of pyscho-scary in the role and it 's brilliant . Andy Mace was on as the Wizard , which meant David Stoller was on as Dr Dillamond for Andy and they both did very well . I thought Andy Mace was a brilliant wizard and , because he is a bit younger , was more ' dancey ' than Desmond . I love Desmond too though , so I 'm lucky to have seen both over the ten times I have been to " Wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sad she 's leaving in May , but hopefully she may come back one day and be Elphaba . Jeremy Legat is a very nice person at stage door but his Boq is so annoying . His voice is very distinctive , you can pick him out a mile off in the ensemble numbers . I look forward to seeing Alex Jessop or George Ure after the cast change , just to see how different they are from him . <p> I loved seeing all the facial expressions of the cast and the detail on the costumes is amazing . They are so beautiful to look at . The set design never fails to impress me either . I really want a go on the ' bubble ' and the lift machine lol . I am going back to see ' Wicked ' again . God help me , I 'm going on cast change , but thankfully I will not be ' dayseating . ' I do not wish to be mobbed and gored to death by 2000+ Kerry Ellis fans all chomping at the bit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets , but for future performances I will be ' dayseating ' again as 25 is well worth seeing one of the best shows in the West End . <p> Kirsty <p> I have seen ' Wicked ' three times and I have sat always at the front of the dress circle . I personally ca n't stand the stalls as I am 13 and I find it very hard to see anything . <p> The first time I went I sat in row A44 and 45 with my best friend . These seats are the last two seats on the row , however I could see everything perfectly and for 30 well worth it - seeing as the seats next to them are worth 60 . <p> I loved the show , so I had to go back again ! This time I sat in Row D 13 and 14 . Central seats , however the view was distant . The seats are so tightly packed , all I can remember of that time I went to the show was a family of 10 sitting around me . Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The kids and even the PARENTS started standing up for no apparent reason ( not during an applause ) , and blocked my entire view for the whole of " Defying Gravity . " I missed all the special effects , and I was very upset as I had paid 120 for the pair . <p> I just was n't satisfied , so I had to see it again . This time I sat front row A23 of the dress circle ... fabulous UNINTERRUPTED view . The first two times I saw it Alexa Khadime was playing Elpheba . She was unreal and excellent voice , very soulful ; better than Idina Menzel who I saw on Broadway . The most recent time Kerry Ellis was playing Elpheba ; also very good , but not as good as Alexia . My all time favourite spellbinding blockbuster musical . 10/10 . I love it &lt;3 x . <p> I saw this marvellous production at Halloween 2008 how apt . It was a ' two for one ' deal at one of the booths and we were happy with rear stalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt you could get a good view from any area of the stalls and Row P was fine for me , even though I 'm usually a front row fan ! If I see the show again ( and its highly likely I will as it completely captivated me ) I would like to sit further forward just out of personal preference . <p> What struck me before the show started was the young audience it attracts , and I 'm gathering they 're fans of the production because they have their faces painted green . Either that or they felt a bit sick ! I was also like a big kid myself watching the dragon hanging out of the top of the stage and getting very over excited when it started moving and emitting smoke . <p> All of the numbers were excellent and Gravity gave me goose bumps . I was more taken with the Good Witch because she had some fantastic comedy moments and I will be keeping an eye out for Dianne Pilkington when she has moved on . I hope she does n't  go just yet though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Morrible , I know her from the TV but this was my first experience of her stage acting . She was very inspiring and although I hear that Susie Blake shone in the role , I 'd like to see Harriet play the part again . <p> Overall 10/10 and a must see for all age groups . You do n't  HAVE to go at Halloween , but it seems to add sparkle if you do ! <p> June 2009 . Have just seen ' Wicked , ' and whilst show was great , I was sitting in F27 in the stalls and was very disappointed with view . I am 5 ' 6 " and the man in front of me was of average height yet I could not see anything in centre stage at all . I spent the entire performance weaving from side to side to follow the performers and felt I had to apologise to the woman behind me for doing so . Her response was that she was following me because she could n't see either ! Having spent 66 per ticket I felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wicked for my 14th time on Wednesday 8th July 2009 at 2.30pm . I went along for the day seats and got there at 7am . I was first person there until 7.45am when someone else showed up . I got A23 and A24 which are good seats . you feel very close to the action and I swear to God at times Alexia was staring right at me . <p> Stevie Tate - Bauer is the temporary 1st cover Nessarose while Emily Tierney has a broken foot . she was on as Nessa for her 2nd show at the matinee and she was very good considering it was her second time . She was n't as powerful as any previous " Nessa " ' s but her acting is really good and she had some lovely moments in ' Dancing Through Life ' . I am looking forward to seeing her again on the 25th July 2009 . <p> Gregor Stewart was on as Fiyero and he is posher than Oliver ! I did n't think it was possible but apparently so . He is as amazing as Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he develops a strong fan base of his own . His dancing is excellent and he has great chemistry with Alexia . <p> Alexia was good but I think she may still be ' under the weathe'r as she lacked a certain oomph . Her ' Wizard and I ' was spectacular though , and her ' Defying Gravity ' was also very good . I think I will have to see an evening performance with her to get full power Alexia . I also liked how she copied Avaric 's Scottish accent when he asks does she realise who this is . LOL . <p> Sarah Earnshaw is without a doubt , a fab Glinda . I much prefer her over Dianne . She was hilarious in ' Popular ' but not as funny as in previous shows I have seen her . I really like her riffs in ' NOMTW ' and ' WITF ' . Harriet Thorpe put in a pretty average performance as Madam Morrible , ca n't complain or praise her really . <p> Alex Jessop - Yey Lancashire Boq ! ! ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different from Jeremy and I love the way he relates to Nessarose and Glinda . He is spot on and I think he is going to be one of the most favourite and best Boq 's ever . Sam Kelly is now the wizard . Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about him . I 'm sure he tried hard but a lot of his diction was lost and even though I was in the front row I had trouble hearing him . I do n't know what he was like when he first started out , but he still needs to improve a lot . I missed Desmond Barrit in the key wizard scenes . <p> All the new ensemble seem to have settled in well and have really gelled well together . They put in a good effort with all their dance moves and acting , and I gave them all a standing ovation at the end . I can not wait to go again for my 15th time on the 25th July ! <p> Kirsty <p> I have been to see " Wicked " twice now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G43 and 42 in the stalls , seats with " restricted view " , so they were just 15 . I can not praise these seats enough for the price , there was a small bit of the stage , maybe the left fifth , but only at the back , you could see everything on the left at the front fine ( and a great view for " As Long As Youre Mine , " it felt like Elphaba and Fiyero were just in front of us ) . I would definitely go for these seats before more expensive seats far back in the circle . I have never sat in the stalls to see a musical before because its always too expensive for me , so it was amazing to be this close to the stage . As for the show itself , it was wonderful , Alexia Khadime was amazing as Elphaba , her voice was incredible . Everyone and everything else was great too ( Fiyero was pretty ) . <p> I loved it so much I went to see it with some ( 9 actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find tickets , and annoyingly there werent enough of us to get the group rate , and I was n't clever enough to think to book 4 and 5 separately to get better seats . I ended up booking row W of the circle . The tickets were 20 each , which I know is quite cheap but I did n't  expect them to be THAT far away . This time Kerry Ellis was Elphaba , and although I know a lot of people love her , I found her disappointing compared to Alexia Khadime ; her voice was n't as powerful , although I do n't  suppose it helped that we were SO far away . Interestingly though you could still see Fiyeros bald spot through the binocular things ! On a related point , why do n't  they have these on the back of every seat ( especially towards the back ) , its annoying to have to pass around between 2/3 people ? I would say avoid sitting this far back at all costs , its definitely worth paying an extra 10 ( or more if you can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon with all my sisters and well be queuing up to get day tickets to hopefully get an amazing view ! <p> I took my boyfriend along to watch ' Wicked . ' He had never been to a musical before and even though I absolutely love them , I have n't had much of a chance to go see many . so I decided to book tickets to watch ' Wicked . ' I booked the lower end tickets ( 15 ) which were a great bargain and got seats K45/46 in the Stalls . I thought that being in the Stalls would mean having a fabulous view of the stage/show . Boy was I wrong ! Yes , these seats are close enough to the stage to see precise expressions of the characters however , they are way too far to the left hand side of the stage and both my boyfriend and I found we had to constantly crane our necks to the right every time there was a captivating scene ( which in my opinion is for the majority of the show ! ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A LOT almost to the point of spoiling the evening . <p> If I had paid any more for these tickets I would have been really disappointed but the FABULOUS acting of both Glenda and Elphaba made the night ! The actress who plays Elphaba has the most AMAZING vocals ever ! The story is warm and very cute and it is a must see ! I would recommend theatre goers to definitely purchase tickets , but try to avoid seats that are along the far side . Overall , a great musical and a defo must see ! ! <p> Dee . <p> I 've seen Wicked 5 times now and really feel that it has lost it 's sparkle as it does n't do anything for me now . I went along to the 19th August 2009 matinee , as a friend was staying with me from afar and really wanted to see it . It was a full house and we were sat in row T 24 and 25 which were really good seats - and no pumpkin head in front of me this time . T24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my leg out . <p> The one annoying thing which I noticed last time and in other theatre to is the squeaky seat syndrome . All around I could hear seats squeaking away it was usually bored kids who were using their seat as a swing and ignorant parents not saying any thin to them . Wicked are not offering any discounts to see the show and i quite happy to charge full price for tickets and not even spend a couple of quid on an oil can to stop the squeaks on the seats , I mean if push come to shove they could ask the tin man I 'm sure he 'd help as one day he will be put off his performance ... <p> Desmond Barrett was unfortunately on as the Wizard and even worse than last time if that was at all possible and poor old Di Pilkington was throwing her lines out so quick that most of the comedy was lost and made me feel like the whole thing was rushed and she could n't wait to get off for her glass of bubbly before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the evening show . <p> Alexia was very good as Elphaba and Harriet Thorpe again put in a sterling performance as Madam Morrible . The whole thing is about making money and a lot of money at that and think it 's sad when there are much better shows in town where the actors are giving it their all and yet are closing because they ca n't get the people in . Do n't think I 'll be stepping back into see the show again . Shame as thought it was the best once . <p> OK ; I was n't going to send another review of ' Wicked , ' but I had to with regards to my latest visit . <p> I went to ' Wicked ' on Thursday 1st October 2009 . I pre-booked seats C10 and C11 in the stalls as I found out Chloe Taylor was making her debut as Glinda . She is the understudy for the role so she never ever gets to go on , and I wanted to see what she was like . C10 and 11 are OK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the whole stage . Anything that happens on the right hand side is totally lost . However , if you are slightly interested in seeing the scenery and cast members move on and off it is quite fascinating . You see everything centre stage and you are still close so you can see all the actors facial features and gestures . In the Shiz scene , though , I had Keeley Jane Jackson and Sabrina Carter blocking my view of Chloe 's Glinda - but hey ho . <p> The show was awesome . Chloe as Glinda is so different to Dianne . She plays Glinda more as a person than a caricature . She is n't over the top high pitched , she is just a very posh , well spoken humorous Glinda . I think it was slightly Helen Dallimore-esque but as I prefer Helen over Dianne this meant that I fell in love with Chloe straight away . She just fits the part so well ; if she does n't get promoted to standby I may never see Wicked again . ( gasp , the horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wicked ' was beautiful , and by ' Popular ' you could see her nerves had gone and that she was having a fun time . It made me laugh when she came on for ' One Short Day ' and she had n't got changed in time to have her yellow dress zipped up at the back . <p> Alexia was very good too . Not the best I 've seen of her , but she really gave it her all that night for Chloe . Her ' Wizard and I ' were short at the end but still got many whoops and cheers from a stagnant audience . And her ' Defying Gravity ' was out of this world . Her favourite song to sing is ' No Good Deed ' and she shone here too . At stage door she sounded so croaky and i 'll , I was n't surprised to find out on Friday night and that Ashleigh Gray had gone on instead . The poor girl is not having much luck at the moment , bless her . <p> It was also my first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how different she is from Caroline Keiff and Stevie Tate Bauer . Those two portrayed Nessarose as more mature and controlling , whereas Natalie really captures the youthful spoilt brat . She did n't belt as much in her big song in Act 2 but I was assured by my companion that she can do better . I am looking forward to seeing her again . <p> Oliver Tompsett threw in a few riffs here and there , Harriet Thorpe was fab as was Alex Jessop . Sam Kelly is refusing to grow on me , I much prefer Sean Needham as the wizard , if I ca n't have Desmond back lol . Sam just looked a loony on the stage . Harsh you might think , but it 's my opinion - so whatever . The cast were all buzzing off Chloe 's excitement and this was possibly one of the best shows of ' Wicked ' I 've been to thanks to Chloe and Natalie . They all worked so well . Go see it ! <p> Kirsty <p> Myself , my sister and a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wicked " on Saturday 21st November 2009 . It was my third visit , my sister 's second and our friend 's first ! <p> We sat in the stalls , row F , seats 38-40 ( 20 ) . As I have mentioned in previous reviews , I have sat once in the circle ( row K ) and once further back in the stalls ( row R ) . The seats for this performance were fantastic ! ! They were really worth the 20 that we paid . However , I agree with the ratings of the seats on your Apollo Victoria seating chart . I sat in F38 which had a perfect view of everything ( except for a small amount of scenery in 2/3 scenes ) - you have highlighted this as green which I agree with ! My sister and our friend sat in seats F39 and 40 and had more of a restricted view . The stairs on the left hand side of the stage blocked around 1/5th of the stage - but as most of the action took place at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised at how good the show was ! <p> Another point that makes these seats so fantastic is that the speakers were literally a few rows in front ( disguised underneath the stairs on stage ) . This meant that the sound was perfect - you could literally hear every instrument in the orchestra and all of the singing on top of this ! There was no point in the show where I could n't hear what was being said / sung . <p> We saw the whole cast at this performance except for Natalie Anderson as Nessarose . Her understudy , Emily Tierney , played the part fantastically ( and personally I would not have even known that she was an understudy ! ) Once again , Alexia Khadime and Dianne Pilkington played their roles extremely well- after reading previous reviews I was worried that they would rush through their lines and therefore lose jokes etc. due to this , but they spoke and sung at a pace that was just right ! It was Harriet Thorpe as Madame Morrible who had this problem - she spoke some sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to understand what she was saying ! However , she played the part really well , and I was impressed with her effort once again . <p> Oliver Tompsett ( Fiyero ) and David Stoller ( Dr. Dillamond ) also played their parts well - they have seemed to improved since I saw them in August 08 which gave me quite a surprise ! Sam Kelly ( The Wizard ) and Alex Jessop ( Boq ) are fantastic additions to the cast and I was impressed with their performances as I had never seen them before . Nevertheless , they both sounded very croaky- so I was n't sure whether they were i 'll or not but they still did very well ! My sister said that she loved Alex 's Lancashire accent ! ! <p> All of the musical numbers were PHENOMENAL ! I can not describe how good they were ! " Popular " was extremely funny , Alexia Khadime 's " No Good Deed " really showed the evil and wicked character of Elphaba and " Defying Gravity " was spectacular ! Being so near the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying so high up- and the lighting effects made it even more special ! Everybody was in awe ( even the older man sat on my right ) during the interval ! He told me how impressed he was by turning to me and saying " WOW ! " as soon as the lights came up ! <p> So , there is my very long but fantastic review of " Wicked " ! Every time I see it , it changes and hopefully it will stay in the West End for many more years to come ! Really , go and see it because you will be totally inspired ! " Wicked " = 10/10 ! ! <p> Tom C <p> Took my friend to see this who had never seen a musical before ( December 2009 ) . She loved it ! It was my fourth visit and as much as I had liked Alexia the time before , I was n't liking her at all today . She swallowed a load of her words and sounded very nasal . Her diction was terrible . Oliver Thompsett , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GREAT ! So was Sarah Earnshaw as Galinda . <p> We originally bought stalls seats in row B 37 and 38 . They were really awful because the staircase was in the way . Just before the show there were literally hundreds of empty seats towards the back of the stalls , so we moved to R 38 and 39 . PERFECT . If the box office staff had n't been so hard about our student I 'd not having a date on they would have gotten a bit extra money for those top price seats : ) . <p> 2nd February 2010 . <p> Stalls G24 : Although ideally placed , this seat ( and those in this area ) could cause problems . There 's no rake and the rows are not staggered . If someone tall sits in front of you , then you 're going to be in trouble . Fortunately , on this occasion I was lucky and so had a fine view of the stage . <p> As for the show : I first saw this show about two and a half years ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more . I was n't wowed like others were . Two and half years later , I was just so utterly bored - especially during the first half when I was praying for something interesting to happen . And it appears that I was n't the only one - the lady to the left of me was having difficulty staying awake , and the couple to my right failed to return after the interval . <p> I 've now seen the show twice and heard the Original Cast album twice , and still the songs fail to register with me . I vaguely remember liking the song ' Popular ' first time around , but last night it was dead on arrival . <p> Although most of the cast had fine singing voices ( apart from Sam Kelly ) , they had no stage presence . For me , Dianne Pilkington appeared to be playing Glinda far too much for laughs - and was n't really getting them . I could n't hear any of the lyrics sung by the chorus and the orchestra failed to make itself felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoilt in recent weeks by seeing a series of wonderfully entertaining musicals . I 've loved ' Legally Blonde , ' ' Sweet Charity ' and ' Priscilla . ' Even tat like ' Dreamboats &amp; Petticoats ' won me over with its energy and enthusiasm - something sorely lacking from ' Wicked . ' Maybe the forthcoming cast change will breathe new life into this show , but I wo n't be going to find out ( unless someone offers me a free ticket - and even then , I 'll have to think twice about it ) . <p> In summary - I HATED IT . <p> " Saw ' Wicked ' at the Apollo Victoria this evening - 8th February 2010 - and was suitably blown away - this is a really , really good show . <p> Elphaba was actually understudied by Ashleigh Gray - not that I could tell , she was exceptional - superb voice , and first class acting . Dianne Pilkington opposite her as Glinda was also very strong - bringing out the comic elements to perfection . Between them they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience towards the end . <p> The rest of the cast were more than solid , with no other stand-out performances , but they all gelled really well . The music is phenomenal , and the set is breathtakingly good . After a couple of recent West End experiences where I was left feeling underwhelmed , it was great to leave the theatre this evening feeling properly entertained and uplifted - I can see why it ranks at the top of the monkey 's current ' best musicals ' chart ! <p> In terms of seats - taking advantage of the January 2010 getintolondontheatre.com promotion , I secured S21 in the stalls for 35 . Initially apprehensive ( S sounded like a LONG way back ) - I was pleasantly surprised - this is a great seat - for some reason it feels pretty close to the action . Perfect view of the stage , and due to the fairly steep rake there 's no problems with anyone blocking your view . Legroom pretty decent too . At full price , I would probably opt for rows Q or P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ' Wicked ' with my sister last Wednesday ( matinee - 10th February 2010 ) . We really wanted to see Alexia Khadime again before the cast change , because she was amazing when we saw her before , so I asked at the box office when I went to buy the tickets a couple of weeks ago if she would be in it - but they said they could n't tell me : ( . I bought the tickets anyway , I asked for F36 and 37 ( 20 ) in the stalls after looking at the theatremonkey plan and they had them . <p> These seats were amazing ! I cant explain how great they are , I think they are the best seats I have ever sat in , anywhere , and such a great deal ! They were what I would describe as a perfect distance away from the stage : really close so you can see everything in detail but not too close . Even though they are towards the side , you can see everything , I sat in 37 and I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seconds to see who had just come on to the stage , but you can see all of the actual action as it goes on in the middle or at the front . I can see from the plan these seats are about to increase in price , but I would say that at 30 , or even 40 they are still fair value , especially as the seats next door ( and behind ? ! ) are top price . <p> The show was , of course , incredible . We got lucky and Alexia Khadime was performing , and she was amazing , to me the show is all about her hitting the big notes and she did it perfectly . " Defying Gravity " and " The Wizard and I " were especially good , and also " No Good Deed " , which I never normally pay attention to on the soundtrack , was also amazing . Glinda was played by an understudy but I would n't have known , she was great . The show was much funnier than I remember it being , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Popular " . Fiyero was also played by an understudy , he was blonde . He was fine , I was a bit indifferent to him really though , I prefer the brown haired guy . <p> Interestingly , the theatre was not full at all , the stalls were half empty , not sure what the circle was like . It did make us wonder why they bother with weekday matinees when its not the school holidays , surely its not worth the effort ( or money ) on the theatres part ? <p> I went and saw Wicked for the evening performance on 10th June 2009 . After doing some research on this website I settled on Stalls , Row Q and was allocated seat 19 . I was extremely pleased with the clear , unrestricted view of the stage and felt that this seat was well worth the top price that I had paid . I was near enough to see facial expressions but far away enough to experience the whole affect of the stage/set designs as they do spill out into the auditorium , especially during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide aisle that runs in front of row Q gives you an enormous amount of legroom to really stretch out . The rake of the floor is also very noticeable in this row , giving you clear views over heads in the stalls in the front centre block . Before you leave , take some time to walk towards the stage and then look back to take in the beautiful art deco auditorium . <p> I bought seats Stalls Row S Seats 1 , 2 and 3 for 62.00 each in April 2009 and thought they were brilliant value but maybe a little low on the rake . View was n't obstructed at all as I am quite tall , but for anyone shorter may be a bit of a problem if you got an adult sitting in front . The show was amazing and would suggest getting good seats for the first time seeing it . <p> Second time I bought Row T Seat 23 and 24 . These were even better seats , and I thought the view was spectacular . I would thoroughly suggest these seats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Wheeler <p> I made a last minute decision to see ' Wicked ' on the 17th March 2010 . The best seat they could offer me was seat 18 in Row A of the Circle . I have never been a fan of front row Circle seats but I have to say that I found this seat gave me an amazing view of the stage . Even better than my favourite seat in Row Q in the stalls . At 5ft 8 " I found the Circle wall to be only very mildly off putting , as it cuts of the very front of the stage and you will sometimes miss some of the limited action that takes place there , especially on the right hand side ( looking at the stage ) . Having always sat in the stalls for ' Wicked , ' I found that sitting in the Circle gave the show a completely different look , and I could see things that I did not see before . <p> However , the only major problem I had was the sound . It was terrible ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went really quiet . For the final five minutes it completely went and then I could n't hear anything that was being said ; which was a shame because I really enjoyed myself sitting in the Circle and would be happy to sit there again . <p> On a second visit ( 27th March 2010 ) we sat in row A , seats 22 and 23 of the Circle . Both seats give a good central view of the stage . In addition , I believe that row A sits at around row N in the stalls so you are not as far back as you think , although the Circle in this theatre does seem high up . At 5ft 8 , I find the Circle wall only cuts off the very front of the stage ( you will miss the orchestra and the right hand stage protrusion ) but this wont spoil your enjoyment of the show and is a good place to see some of the big musical numbers like Defying Gravity and to appreciate the sets , including an excellent view of the Time Dragon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so you can stretch out a bit , but I found that space was not too much of a problem in the front row . The only issue I had was the metal bar that sits on the circle wall at the bottom aisle staircase . Although it does not really obstruct your view , I found it a little intrusive , as if someone was standing right next to you . This was my second time in the circle and was pleased to notice that the sound was a lot better . <p> We saw ' Wicked ' on Saturday night 13th March 2010 - it was the second visit for us . We sat in the circle seats A 7 , 8 and 9 . I was expecting a pole in front of us ( I had these booked for me ! ) , but actually this was not a problem . I think the rows behind were more affected than ours , but the bar was not in the field of vision at all . However the front right of the stage was obscured , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lighting rig in front of us . However , 80% of the view was fine , although feeling distant from the stage . Leg room was terrific ! Overall , I would keep these red for full price , but under the new pricing structure definitely worth looking at . <p> As for the show itself , we were a little underwhelmed this time . I think we were spoilt last time because the show was brand new and we did n't know the twists and turns . Also , there was a real buzz in the theatre every time Idina Menzel stepped on stage . This time , although the casting was great , Diane Pilkington and Alexia Khadime made a good pairing , it just was n't as exciting . A lot of the music passed me by as well , which surprised me as I knew the score this time around . <p> A literal wardrobe malfunction brought the second act to a halt , but the show was quickly brought back on track . <p> As a spectacle it remains unrivalled and the chemistry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do n't think I would hurry to go back again . Still , judging by the reaction of the audience , I think I was in the minority not to be bowled over . <p> Was taken to see Wicked ( April 2010 ) against my better judgement , but actually enjoyed the show . I was concerned about it being a fluffy , girly short-of-a-show and in many ways it was , but the music and ( mostly ) clever lyrics plus the many nods to the original Oz and a good story that kicks off towards the end of the first half finally won me over ! <p> Rachel Tucker ( Elphaba ) was excellent I 'd been told Defying Gravity was the best tune , though I would disagree as No Good Deed certainly was the vocal and dramatic highlight of the night for me from Rachel . Louise Dearman ( Galinda ) also was great and the chemistry between them was wonderful considering the short length of time they 've been playing the roles . Lewis Bradley ( covering for Lee Mead until mid-May ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a wonderfully written character anyhow . <p> Sat in L45 in the Stalls ( 20 ) utterly , utterly brilliant value . Missed very little ( a few entrances ) despite blocking issues with the way the ensemble were placed in the opening scene , as the majority is staged in the centre and front . I suspect I missed seeing Dorothys house but that did n't  matter . Having been a best-seat purist for many years , ticket prices mean that cheaper seats are needed now and then . These seats , should in my view for the price and the view be green . <p> Would see it again glad I did n't  pay 62.50 and would be incredibly happy to see it from L45 once more ! <p> Paul . <p> Cast Change ( 27th March 2010 ) , from seats S38 and 39 in the stalls ! <p> These seats were amazing . I had full view of the stage , No view restrictions . Well worth the 62.50 per seat ! <p> If I went again I would try and get closer to stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S and you do n't get the full OOMPHH of ' Defying Gravity . ' But ... the view is clear , and you can just about make out the facial expressions on the actors/actresses faces . <p> Bloomin GREATTTTT SEATS ! ! : ) <p> George Wheeler <p> Having read all the reviews here and despite being a seating snob ( always go for A-reserve ) , I decided to chance it and bought myself and a friend P42 and 43 in the stalls . I ca n't recommend these seats enough . 32.50 each and the only action blocked were three entrances which were brief and minor . Would I pay 30 more for these entrances ? Absolutely not . To put it another way - the entire row ( P 32 to 48 ) was empty apart from us but we were happy to stay in P42 and 43 . If you can get these , take them . <p> May 2010 : This show will appeal to young teenage girls but in my view the story construction is far to close to the Harry Potter Stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / songs is / are totally forgettable except for " Popular , " which I heard on the radio once . <p> It is basically one main set with add-ons wheeled on and off plus lighting changes . <p> I think that this show is over-hyped . <p> There were a lot of visitors in the audience who insisted on yelping like demented Yaks at each opportunity . <p> Do not have too much to drink before the show . We used the toilets in the interval which for a theatre with 2,000 seats are far too inadequate causing huge queues even at the gents . Patrons continued to disrupt the performance after the performance re-started . <p> We purchased our tickets from a company who advertised no booking fee and showed no booking fee but our account charged us 3 per person booking fee ( 9 ) at the final total . I telephoned them but they refused to refund offering little excuse for their behaviour . I will complain to STAR . <p> David , Redcar Cleveland . <p> Went to see ' Wicked ' on Thursday 10th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't made clear is that they offer the Student tickets to people with 16-25 rail cards . This effectively becomes a 25 and under offer to get top price seats for 25 ; definitely something that people should take advantage of ( check with venue before travelling that this policy is still correct - editor ) . <p> So me and my friend went , and we got stalls F20 and 21 - which I could n't believe when the cashier told me ! Central and close to stage and this was 3 hours before show . These seats are close to the action which is good as you see the expressions on the actors faces , but it is really hard to see the dragon as you have to crane your neck ! Not that I am complaining given the price of the seats . As the monkey suggests , the most ideal seats are a few rows back . The rake also is n't great in these first few rows and so the person in front did have a blocking effect on one half of the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great . The plot is great and there really are surprises in store if you have no clue about the plot ; as the monkey says though , the realisations come late in the show but then you feel a moment of enlightenment and go ' Wow that 's really smart ! ' <p> Set and costumes are some of the best I have seen , and it shows how creative a modern day musical can be . However my only negative is that there are only about 5 good songs ( but those songs are really good ) . One more thing , the ' Defying Gravity ' is the best scene in a musical that I have ever seen . Unfortunately Lee Mead and the new Elpheba were being replaced by their understudies . The Elpheba understudy is fantastic but the Fiyero understudy leaves much to be desired ! <p> I will be returning . <p> Diego <p> I , along with 32 other people who travelled to London by coach , saw Wicked at 2.30pm on Saturday 26th June 2010 . This was my fourth viewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After previously seeing Cassidy Janson and Alexia Khadime play Elphaba , Rachel Tucker did not disappoint ! Her performance was absolutely phenomenal , especially the three ' biggies ' ( ' Defying Gravity , ' ' No Good Deed ' and ' The Wizard and I ' ) . Louise Dearman as Glinda was also a highlight - she had a fantastic voice and was really funny , especially during ' Popular . ' <p> We also saw Lee Mead as Fiyero who , unfortunately , sounded a little under the weather ( probably a sore throat ) - so much so that the orchestra made an obvious volume change during ' As Long as You 're Mine ' . Nonetheless , he did a very good job . A special mention must go to Clive Carter 's Wizard - he is the best Wizard that the London production has seen in my opinion , as he added his own little touches to his songs and really stood out , unlike other Wizards who seemed a bit bored ! <p> The rest of the cast ( no understudies ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a standing ovation well before Elphaba and Glinda even made an appearance in the curtain call ! The atmosphere in the theatre was great ! <p> We sat in a block in the stalls , rows U and W seats 10 to 23 and row X seats 18 to 23 . I sat in U23 ( on the aisle ) , giving a central , completely uninterrupted view of the stage . Although it sounds surprisingly far back , the stage seemed so much nearer but gave you a chance to admire the whole set as well . The orchestra were on fire at this performance , especially the electric guitarist ( or at least I think it was ! ) who stood out during the musical numbers . <p> On the whole , it was an absolutely wonderful performance , and the new cast have really set the bar now for future casts . I predict that Wicked will last for much longer in London - and it certainly deserves it ! It 's the best musical there is ! <p> Tom . <p> Wicked ( 9th June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't surprise me , Lewis Bradley was a pretty good replacement though . Now I 've seen this 6 times now and have to say that this new cast has put my faith back in the show - they are brilliant and gel together like I 've not seen before . There is certainly a new energy to the whole production and hope it can stay like that . Outstanding performances from the two female leads who are the best yet . I 've also always thought the Wizard was a really boring part of the proceedings but Clive Carter is without doubt the best Wizard the show has seen and adds so much to what was before quite dull moments in the production . <p> Sat in Dress Circle Row A 22 and 23 which is dead centre and on the aisle , a bar just to the left on the circle ledge might just creep into sight but it did not distract me at all . Great seats .... Sound quality off balance a few times but not as bad as on previous visits ; I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shows been running long enough now . <p> Talking of which , the producers of the show are always bragging about how much they are taking in Box Office takings ( or ripping people off as I like to think sometimes ) so why cant they spend some money oiling the squeaky seats which is something I 've mentioned before but they are too arrogant to take note . <p> We went to see the matinee on the 21st July 2010 . We booked our tickets through lastminute.com for 20 each , ( though beware even though they say they do n't charge a booking fee they do - and then they say they do n't but that it is the theatre that charges and blames them ) so we actually paid 22 each . <p> We picked our tickets up before the show and therefore took pot luck with the choice of seats . We were in circle row W 18 to 20 on the aisle . I actually took to clients with learning / physical difficulties to see the show . The seats are comfy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the steepest aisle in theatreland . That said , it is worth talking to the theatre as they can be very accommodating ; allowing you in a little earlier to allow you to get to your seats before the rush and allowing you to leave after the rush . However , there is nothing they can do about the queue for the ladies ' toilets in the interval - where you have to navigate your way down the stairs , then across to the other side of the theatre , down past the toilets , down stairs to the front of the dress circle so you can then join the queue to climb the stairs back up to the toilet . Decide carefully if you want ice-cream or toilets as you wont have time to queue for both ... and that is without any sort of disability to slow you down . <p> This is another show with a slow start , but it picks up speed like a jet engine preparing for take-off . Once it gets going there is no stopping it . It just gets better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are stunning and the plot ( although you need to concentrate to follow it ) is actually easy enough to understand - and my clients were engrossed and enraptured from start to finish . There were some tense and scary moments in the second act ( when a 9 year old behind us started crying ) but my clients loved every single minute of this show and so did I. <p> What it comes down to is , " would I see it again ? " and the answer is , " yes , absolutely . " I would probably treat myself to seats nearer the stage to get a little more out of the expressions ( which could n't be seen from out viewpoint ) , though there was so much portrayed in the acting and the inflections in the voices that you knew exactly what expressions they were making and it did n't detract too much . This is a very dark , yet humorous , show and definitely one for musical aficionados . <p> Joss Hockley , East London . <p> On the Saturday afternoon we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some bottled water if it is a little warm outside ! The show was however excellent and I would recommend it to anyone ( with good seats ! ) ... <p> ... We had circle seats E 6 and 7 : As another reader here says about row D in front , the front area of the stage is invisible and the distance meant that we could not see the actors clearly without opera glasses . Most of the front of the stage also had an aisle safety rail blocking visibility . <p> I got seats in the Stalls , M44 and 45 - they were an absolute bargain at 20 ! I would definitely mark these seats green ( value for money ) . Great distance , only occasional restricted view and generally superb . <p> I really enjoyed the show , as always . I give the cast mixed reviews : Rachel was an excellent Elphaba and gave the role a new slant which I liked . Louise Dearman was unfortunately the worst Glinda I have seen - she was borderline annoying and forgot to be at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from holiday I think his voice was a little weak . Julie Legrand was also a really rubbish Morrible - a shame she could n't sing ! On a more positive note , Clive Carter was the best Wizard I have seen ( I used to hate the Wizard songs , but he actually had a good voice and great character ) . Other peripheral characters were okay . <p> Rachel certainly stole the show ( as she should ! ) , and recasting a few of those medium-rate characters ( and Glinda ) would make this one of the best casts of Wicked yet . <p> Saw this on Monday 27th September 2010 for my girlfriend 's birthday . We had seats P42 and P43 ( 35 ) and felt they were great value for money . <p> I only recall two brief instances of missing entrances from the left of the stage , and not being able to see what was in the cage during the lesson . All the other scenes were perfect , close enough to see expressions , far enough to take in the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the head of the people in front of you , which is useful due to the shallow dip of the seats . <p> Two comments : <p> 1 ) Booking : The theatre ticketing system does n't allow you to leave a single seat - this is fully understood and supported . However , this is actually misleading as if you are booking as group of 3 you are further penalised . <p> As a group of 3 you ca n't book any row of consecutive seating in areas where the booking crosses a price break ( nominally where the pricing groups include up to 2 consecutive seats in a row ) - even if you try to book 3 consecutive seats in the same row , crossing these price breaks , leaving no single seat unoccupied . <p> This policy prevented me from having any choice to see ' Wicked ' in the stalls other than 3 consecutive 62 or 95 ( premium ) tickets . <p> The policy meant I effectively had to pay an extra 100 because we are a family of 3 . Maybe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat can be left in any row , but bookings can cross price breaks . A fairer system , but one that may make less money for the theatre ? ? <p> 2 ) Wicked Review - Stall Seats E24 to 26 : My family and I went to see ' Wicked ' on 28th October 2010 at the evening performance . I 've noticed in the monkey reviews that row E is n't mentioned and it also seems to be one of the last to be taken up in the ticket selling plans . Well my advice is do n't worry and snap up the central location . Yes it is at the edge of the price group , but being centrally located and just 5 rows back you get a fantastic view and exhilarating experience being close-up and personal . <p> You do look up , but only a little , the worst is at the start with Galinda in her bubble - conversely the best is when Elphaba is menacingly overhead in ' Defying Gravity . ' <p> I took my twin daughters ( aged 11 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one of the half term matinees . After a great meal at Dim T ( buy one get on free in October - so very reasonable too ) we arrived at a rather chaotic theatre reception area . Open the doors earlier please , as it was packed and people were getting a little stroppy ! ! <p> We sat in seats S 38 , 39 , 40 in the stalls . Excellent views , good leg room and good luck as two tiny people sat in front of my daughters ! ! The staff in the theatre were lovely and seemed to realise that a trip to the theatre is really special . <p> The show was big , bold and well acted by the female leads - Elphaba was stunning and stole the show . My daughters love Lee Mead - as they left the theatre they were pretty clear - " he can sing and dance dad , but he ca n't act " . They still love him , mind ! We have seen many musicals and my daughters were convinced that this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Wizard in April - so it has something to live up to . I suspect it will . <p> We booked three seats for the matinee last Saturday the 20th of November 2010 . We bought seats in Row O - 15 , 16 and 17 of the Dress Circle as I had researched the seats on theatremonkey . I was a bit disappointed . When the action on stage went to the very front part of the stage we could not see it , and had to lean forward a lot . My friend and I could see down to the stage but the little girl with us who is 9 could n't . <p> The show is fantastic , but please give yourself lots of time to arrive early . We did n't - due to the anti war demo - and so we arrived at 2.10 to find the place absolutely jammed . Could not get to the ladies bathroom as it was on the opposite stairs to the one we had to use . Have to say the layout of the Apollo Victoria is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . <p> Merchandise cost 40 for t-shirt , CD and programme ! .... As it was the matinee , it was very noisy with lots of kids . I think if you do n't have children , go for an evening show . <p> Linda O'Reilly <p> On Wednesday 24th November 2010 I saw the matinee of ' Wicked ' for the fifth time : it just gets better and better ! <p> I arrived at the box office at 9.45am to expect to find a long queue for day seats and thought that I would end up buying a student ticket ( still at the same price as a day seat but obviously not front row ) . There turned out to be only 18 people in the queue , meaning that I was in for a chance of getting a day seat . In the end , I was given seat A18 - so when I looked at the provided seating chart I could hardly believe that I was going to be sitting in the centre block on the front row of one of the top West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stage literally feels like an arms-length away , and you can see right to the back of the stage because of its low height . You feel so up-close and personal with the actors and actresses that it feels like they are only performing to you- and you can notice so many intricate details that you ca n't notice from further back e.g. the wonderful costumes . I would highly recommend day-seating if you fancy an affordable trip to the theatre because it is completely and utterly worth it- although if you have n't seen the show before you would be better off sat further back as you can reflect on the show as a whole e.g. see the whole set , rather than being specifically ' zoomed in ' on the characters . <p> Two points , though : - A18 is on an aisle , and it just happens to be next to the position where the ushers sell ice-creams ! Although this can be beneficial ( you can be first in line for an ice cream ! ) , it is really distracting during the interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulder ! <p> - It seems that the day seats in the two side blocks provide less of a good view as members of the cast and parts of the set block the view - throughout the show I noticed the people sat across the aisle from me swaying from side to side to peer through the gaps between the actors . <p> I saw the current cast in June and I was so impressed . They have improved so much since then , and Rachel Tucker as Elphaba is absolutely outstanding ! Her interpretation of ' No Good Deed ' was slightly different to last time , but she sang with such power and emotion- really allowing the audience to witness the pain that she is feeling . <p> I also saw Lee Mead , Julie Legrand , Clive Carter and Cassie Compton once more . Again , they have all improved , especially Lee who seemed to be enjoying it more than he was when I saw him last . We had Sarah Earnshaw ( standby ) performing as Glinda , and she was completely and utterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , Danny Mac was understudying Boq , and I preferred him to George Ure - not sure why but I just think his interpretation was better - and Gareth Chart understudying Dr. Dillamond . <p> Overall , it was a spell-binding show ... and that 's just with Rachel 's " riffs " ! It 's so fantastic that it 's a difficult show to beat ! You just have to see it again and again and again ! <p> Tom C. <p> Went to see ' Wicked , ' ( matinee , Saturday December 4th , 2010 ) . This was a musical that my dear wife had at the bottom of her ' to see ' list , but I was keen to see having read excellent reviews . I won the day , took her , and she was won over . The show was amazing ( though the opening scene is a little odd ) , but soon got under way when the two witches met in " school " . Costumes were fantastic and the two witches were excellent , though Rachel Tucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story unfolds you do get to understand how Wizard Of Oz characters became who they were . A bit obvious I know , but important to the whole Oz experience . <p> As others have commented , the foyer is crowded at its peak and not help by a disorganised queue for ' ladies ' on the stairs . My wife said many in the queue thought it was a queue to the dress circle . The theatre and staff could help out here . On the plus side though , the staff were very friendly and unlike other theatres , people were not harassed with bag searches . Everyone just allowed to get on with enjoying their day . <p> I had booked the show well in advance as the seats D36 and D37 green on the monkey seating plan were available at half the price of D35 - which had no better view than ours ! The seats were on the cusp for viewing the left of the stage and very little was performed there due to the stage stairs in use immediately in front of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time , but the price of the seats made up for this . If going again I would look for seats in the centre , though more expensive . <p> Michael <p> Stalls S46 : I went to see Wicked in January 2011 and had a fantastic view at only 35 , the rows curve into a semi-circle so you actually feel quite close to the action . The seats were slightly wider than in most theatres so more comfortable for larger visitors ( me being one of them ! ) , and leg room was more than ample HOWEVER a small step down between rows S and R means that even when the seats in front of you are occupied , you ca n't stretch your legs out , something I found unbearable as it 's the main reason I choose the stalls . There are no such problems in row T as far as I could fathom , so it may be worth choosing this row if this is a problem for you and you ca n't get a seat any further forward . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wants easy access to the toilets as you just duck behind a curtain and you 're at the door for the ladies ( and the gents ' ca n't be far away ! ) <p> Unfortunately the show was obviously aimed at a much younger audience so I did n't stay , it 's also worth mentioning that I left one and a half into the show , and there was no sign of an interval until two more scenes were completed , so certainly not a show for fidgety or restless people , in fact by the end of the first hour , you have an almost constant stream of people walking the gangway in front of row Q to get to the toilets . I might have stayed if Lee Mead was there but he was on holiday despite his holiday dates being completely different ! <p> Jesca <p> I saw this on Wednesday 12th January 2011 matinee performance . Stalls M17 <p> As I always get lost , no matter where I am , to have my trusted copy of the theatremonkey book to hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it got me straight to the theatre ! If you have n't got a copy , buy one now as its as excellent as the website . <p> Having seen this three times before and really liking the OCR CD , I was looking forward to seeing it again . The theatre is large , very large , and in the past I have found difficulty in getting good sight lines . This seat was fine at the Apollo Victoria and , being tall , I was able to put my legs into the aisle and lower myself into the chair a little to help the person behind due to my big head ! Sometimes I hear people moan behind me when I sit down ; if any one reads this who has had their view blocked by a tall person , we cant help it , we were born that way ! ! ! <p> I have seen Kerry Ellis as Elphaba , Alexa Khadime and Ashleigh Gray . Obviously Kerry was awesome and Alexa was good , but I was very let down by Ashleighs voice and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how I would feel about Rachel Tuckers performance , as had seen her on " Over the Rainbow " . Well , if you 're due to see her as the lead , all I can say is , you 're in for one massive treat . She is PHENOMENAL . I have to say , THE BEST Elphaba I have seen . Her voice is quite astounding and acting skills are almost as if she is living the part in reality . As the build up to the interval got under way , i.e. ' Defying Gravity ' , the song progressed and I was getting more and more spine chills and actually became emotional due to the sheer force and wonderful sound of Rachels voice in the scene that was filling the venue . Some people cheered and stood to their feet even at the interval ! This girl deserves a long career in musical West End theatre . Eat your heart out ' X Factor ' and Mr Cowell ! <p> Not forgetting the rest of the cast . Galindas replacement is excellent too . She plays this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character across beautifully . Lee Meed , it has to be said , caused a lot of giggles and whoops from female and some male audience members when he came on - I would imagine due to the tightness and , how can I put it , outline of his jodhpurs . I heard the woman behind me say " No wonder Denise Van Outen is always smiling " ! ! ! He played the part really well and has an amazing voice . One that stood out for me too was the guy who played the Wizard . Previously this was a sort of quiet/dull part I felt , but this guy blew the top of the place with his acting , voice and stage presence . In fact , this is THE BEST cast Ive seen . Each and everyone had amazing voices and acting skills which could not be said of the cast in its entirety in prior performances Ive seen . <p> No wonder this keeps smashing box office records .

It 's as excellent as the site : ) <p> Sat in Row L of the stalls , seat 36 . Hardly any leg room as 6ft3 " and had to sit bolt upright so probably blocking the view of someone behind . Sorry ! <p> A good view from the side , but would not have liked to be any more to the left i.e. 37 onwards ) as the view must be obscured . <p> Having sat in many other places in this theatre and the sound was good , the sound was not balanced here . Way too much bass . Near the drum kit I think ! and some of the dialogue was drowned out . There was also the noise of what sounded like a large fan constantly ? May be the lighting coolers ? Not had that before either . Glad I only paid 35 for this . <p> I went to see ' Wicked ' and sat in seats K15 and 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted view ' and reduced as such . However , I had no problem with these seats at all ; and for someone looking to see the show on a budget and have a great view I would highly recommend them . No problems at all , could see the actors faces clearly and really felt involved in the action ! <p> 10th February 2011 , stalls Row L Seat 41 ( Price paid 22.50 ) : Leg room was good . This seat was quite to the left of the stage , and I would not advise readers to sit much further to the left . Some of the stage entrances were missed but that was all . I really liked the show and there a definitely some wow moments - and I really like Glinda and Fiyero . ' Defining Gravity ' was probably my highlight . <p> We booked four seats in the stalls ( P40 to 43 ) for a Friday evening performance during February 2011 half-term , which were cheaper than full price tickets but we could n't understand why - as they offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we also made a ' coat booster-cushion ' for our 7 year old son to raise him a little and both he and our 10 year old daughter were able to see everything . <p> D38 : Although the view from this stalls seat was a slightly restricted , it was still a great view for the 20 I paid . The staircase on this side of the stage , that quite a few reviewers have mentioned , was n't actually that much of a problem . In one scene , you could n't really see what was going on at the very left of the stage , but it was easy to guess what was happening , and this was only for one scene . If you 're happy to spend a little more , then go for a seat slightly further in , but if you 're on a tight budget , this seat is more than satisfactory . <p> I have been to ' Wicked ' on 3 occasions , First was on the 5th of August 2009 . Paid 60 and was in stalls row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well worth the money . These seats offer a fantastic view of the stage and you 're not too close that you feel uncomfortable , but not too far back that you do n't feel part of - or engaged in - the show ... and now that they are marked as ' premium seats ' I feel I got a brilliant deal , best seats in the house ! ! <p> On my second trip I was in stalls row ZD seat 34 , paid 40 . Good view of stage and , by sitting further back , you seem to take in a lot more of the show and notice more of detail put into the set . Although ... the overhang prevents you from seeing the dragon , I also felt quiet far back and distant from the stage . <p> On my third visit I booked at lastminute.com and was in the dress circle Y31 . Brilliant for the price of 15 , but you are very far back and are unable too see the actors faces , but at 15 quid you can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats for Tuesday 2nd August 2011 . I thought that considering the show has been running for awhile and that it was a Tuesday I would not need to queue up that early . However I woke up earlier than expected and could n't get back to sleep so I thought I would start queuing . I arrived just after 7am and there were already two people in the queue in front of me . Within 5 - 10 minutes another 2 people joined our queue , whom I shall address as person A and person B. From my estimates , by about 8.15-8.30am , the line had enough people for all the day seats , because at around 8am , people were doing head counts and asking people how many tickets they were buying , by about 8.30am people were just looking at the queue , doing a head count then leaving . The twist is between 8am and 9.50am , Person B was joined 5 other friends , each arriving one at a time with the last arriving at about 9.50am . Each bought one ticket . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They purchased 4 tickets in total . I believe it should have been more , though I might be wrong . <p> I mention this as those who arrived at around 8am and did a head count or the maths of how many tickets each person was going to purchase , were not told of the friends of A and B. So there was a chance they wasted 2 hours standing in the queue and did n't get their day seat . Another unfortunate thing is they would n't have found out till they reached the box office , and by this time , person A , person B and all their friends would have purchased their tickets and left . <p> Concerning the seats themselves ( A27 and A28 ) , you can not get better for the price . Many others have said , you 'll miss out a bit on the mechanical dragon , though it did n't seem to move that much . It is difficult to focus on the whole stage as you are quite close . But I believe the close proximity a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to tilt your head back , but you are close enough that you feel as though the actors/actresses are looking directly at you while they 're singing . You can see the details of all their costumes , the expression on their faces and even their beads of sweat . ( The conductor also poses no problems to anyone . ) <p> If given the choice again , I would still chose the day seats over the regular seats as you really feel the acting , the leg room is great and you are first in line for the ice cream and drinks . <p> About the show , I can see why it has been going on for quite awhile , it was great . <p> I had three seats in row N 46 to 48 in the stalls . N46 was 22.50 plus a service charge of 2.25 from www.ticketmaster.co.uk . N47 and 48 were 15 each plus service charge of 2.25 . <p> N46 had an amazing view and I would highly recommend it , especially for the amount paid . N47 and 48 are over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the show , and the back of the stage is hidden a bit , but you still get to see pretty much the whole show and are so close to the stage . Great seats for the price paid . 17.25 was a total bargain ! ! ! I would highly recommend these seats of you can get them . <p> I also highly recommend Wicked - very entertaining show and amazing talent ! <p> Wicked The Musical - B13-14 ( Stalls ) - 15th June 2011 - Matinee . <p> This was my first time seeing the show since 27th March 2010 , so I could only remember a brief outline of the show ! These seats are marked as ' green ' on the seating plan and I can definitely see why . At times ( especially when she flew ) you really felt as if you were in the action and there , this made it very special . Rachel Tucker completely blew us all away and I ca n't believe how absolutely amazing she is ! These seats were definitely worth it at 28 each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I probably would n't hesitate sitting there again because the view was absolutely phenomenal . <p> 26th August 2011 . <p> I have to admit that , as not usually being a fan of musicals , I was a bit apprehensive about going to see ' Wicked , ' but I need n't have been as I thought it was superb . <p> What impressed me was the clever way that the traditional story of Oz has been twisted . There were plenty of catchy numbers which drove the story such as ' What Is This Feeling ? ' and ' Popular ' but the stand out song has to be ' Defying Gravity ' which closes the first act . The chemistry between Rachel Tucker and Louise Dearman is a pleasure to see , Tucker 's performance as Elphaba was top class . <p> I was sat in the stalls in row D36 and 37 and they offered a decent view of the stage , there was only a small part which I could n't get a clear view of . Definitely go and see ' Wicked ' if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic ! <p> My 11 year old daughter had been asking for ages to see this , so eventually got around to booking tickets . To be honest I was n't expecting that much - a show about witches did n't seem that exciting . <p> However .... I was completely blown away . It was awesome , completely captivating . Not so much for the catchy songs ( I can still only really remember ' Defying Gravity ' ! ) or for the sets ( which were clever ) but for the simple , enchanting relationship between Glinda and Elphaba , played to absolute perfection by Rachel Tucker and Louise Dearman . <p> I had never heard of either of them before but they were amazing , both of them , just stunning ; at times funny , sad , happy , all the emotions were there . I think I could run out of superlatives ..... I also did n't realise that Rachel Tucker was a finalist on ' I 'd do Anything ' ( which we watched ) . I do n't remember her at all ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly an awesome Elphaba . The rest of the cast played their parts too , but these two steal the show . They so deserved their standing ovation and cheers at the end and looked genuinely happy . <p> The story is lovely , in essence very simple , the relationship between the nice good fairy and the horrible wicked one . Of course the nice one is not always that nice and the horrible one is not so horrible . You will never again think of the ' Witch of the West ' as simply " wicked " . <p> The ending of Act 1 is one of the most powerful I have seen .... Act 2 ca n't quite match its power but it 's still a good ending , a nice one . <p> An honourable mention must go to our seats , R8 and 9 in the Stalls , only white in the seating plan , but really really good . Because of the way the seats are laid out , R9 actually has no seat in front , meaning a completely clear view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , I shall go again . It 's completely WICKED ( sorry ! ) <p> PS : A nice touch at the curtain call when Rachel told us about the special ' Children in Need ' performance where she sings with Stacey Solomon , and asked us all to give money for the charity as we left . Of course we were in such good moods .... And as my daughter said " she spoke to us ! ! ! " . <p> Seats Q38 to Q40 in the stalls are great . There are no leg room concerns , as the seats are the first row following a walk through gap . The seats cost 65 each ( including booking fee ) whereas the ones just across the aisle , in the centre block , were 92 each . We each had a full and unobstructed view of the stage . The rake was n't an issue because of the walk through gap and the row in front being set lower down . And , an added bonus for the ladies - loos just off to the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have saved us queuing at the main ones when we came in had we known ! <p> yes .... have just been again ! ! ! ! <p> Had understudy for Elphaba , Nikki Davis-Jones , she was good but not as good as Rachel . Saw Louise Dearman as Gah-Linda though and she was just as AWESOME as before . Stole the show . She can do comedy ( Popular ) and tearjearking ( Change For The Better ) .... wow ! ! ! ! So glad I saw her again before she leaves the show . We stood at the stage door at the end hoping she may come out , but I guess if she does the evening show she may not ...... <p> Other cast the same as before , all very good , and I picked up more of the nuances of the story this time . <p> We sat in stalls row Q , lovely , seats 3 to 9 . Theatremonkey has seats 3 and 4 marked as red but not sure why , me and my friend could see everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And plenty of room for bags , and to stand and cheer Louise at the end . <p> Great , great show . Love everything about it . I may go again , but not sure what I would make of someone else in the role of Glinda . <p> My second visit within the space of around 3 months to see this show ( which is a surprise as I 'm not usually one for musicals ) but I had to go whilst Rachel Tucker and Louise Dearman are still playing Elphaba and Glinda ( or should that be Galinda ? ) <p> Tucker 's performance once again blew me away , that role is made for her . I just wish the producers would listen to the calls for a CD soundtrack to be made whilst these two are still in the production . <p> My brother and I were sat in stalls G38 and 39 which gave a pretty decent view of the stage , only a slight part was obscured but tickets were still great value for money . <p> If you 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wicked . Certainly make sure you get there before Louise Dearman leaves the show in mid December 2011 . <p> Saw it again ......... wanted to see it one last time before Louise Dearman leaves ( why ! ! ! ? ? ? ) and was lucky enough to get Stalls E23 and 24 from ATG Tickets ( Ticketmaster only had seats right at the back ) . <p> So , what can I say that I have n't already said . Wow . Awesome . Still just as good on the third visit , and , if anything , even better being so close , as we could see every expression on their faces and I picked up more than I had done before . We were very lucky to see Louise , and Rachel too .... what a combo ..... as fantastic as ever . They can do funny , sad , poignant , and as I said with seats so close you really get caught up in the emotion . My friend had n't been before and she was blown away too . I am still amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so fresh and powerful . <p> Kudos to the rest of the cast too , they are great , especially Mark Evans as Fiyero , he 's quite a hunk ! ! ! ! <p> That 's me done now . I ca n't imagine anyone else playing Glinda so I do n't think I will go again . But what a very special , powerful show , I am very grateful to have been there and to see the Tucker/Dearman combo . <p> I ca n't imagine there will be a dry eye in the house next Saturday when Louise leaves ........ the song ' For Good ' at the end of the show will be very poignant ! <p> Mila ( Rachel Tucker and Louise Dearman fan club .... shame they do n't release a CD with these two ...... and what will the show be like without Louise ? ? ? ! ) <p> Saturday matinee December 3rd 2011. seats Stalls E23 and 24 , awesome , its great to be so close ... LONG ... <p> I went to see ' Wicked ' on cast change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them . Absolutely spell-binding . Every song had me captivated , the emotion and the story felt so real and you were sucked into vying for Elphaba , Ga-linda ( with a GA ! ) and Fiyero . <p> I 'm a big Wizard of Oz fan , but now I ca n't watch it , as all I do is feel sorry for poor old Elphie . I 'm a WICKED fan now , all the way and do n't care that Wizard was made before and Wicked did n't even exist then . This totally changed the way I view Wizard and it will you too ! <p> Tucker ( who 's playing until Oct 2012 now ! ) was phenomenal as Elphaba . ' Defying Gravity ' had me ( and my musical-hating Dad ) absolutely speechless , and ' For Good ' ( which got the actresses teary , it being their last together ) had me in tears . I could n't recommend this show enough . Just go , go now and try defying gravity ! <p> Jodie Kavanagh LONG ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ( 11th January 2012 ) and thought it might be of use to your website if I gave a review of the seats . <p> I bought B36 in the stalls as it was only 15 ( plus 2.50 for booking ) . I was warned that there was a limited view but decided to go for it as I was probably going for the soundtrack more than anything . Then my Mum decided she wanted to come , so I bought the two seats next to it , B37 and 38 ( I was n't planning to buy two more , but Ticketmaster 's policy of not leaving single seats meant it worked out just as cheap for me to buy an extra seat as it was to move somewhere else ) . <p> For the most part , I had a fantastic view . Being so close to the stage , you are looking at a slight upward angle but it 's not uncomfortable . I had enough leg room as well , but I 'm 5 ' 7 " so anyone taller may have a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you could n't see actions in the back left of the stage due to the stage , but these are n't pivotal scenes and you can still tell what is happening . Also , you do find yourself looking at cast members ' backs a few times but they move around a lot and for all important scenes the view is fine . <p> My Mum had a little more trouble in B37 as the stairs were more in her way , so I would say that 36 is as far as you can go before the view is really hindered , but she said she could still see all of the action in the centre and did n't really feel like she missed out on anything . She also said she thought the music was a bit loud at times as the amps for the orchestra are positioned right in front of our seats . Luckily there was no one in the end 3 seats of row A so no tall people blocking the view . I do n't know whether that would have been a problem ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose ( ours was a Wednesday matinee ) . <p> Overall I would recommend buying 36 if you 're on a budget and do n't mind missing a little bit of the action . Being so close was great as you could see the actors ' faces perfectly and they even catch your eye a few times which was nice . It may be that if you get the equivalent seat on the right hand side of the stalls then your view would be less restricted because the stairs to the wings are n't on that side . I think 36 is as far left as you would want to go if seeing the action easily is important to you , but for such a good price it was great ! LONG ... <p> Being in London for the day , I took my chances at the theatre box office and tried for a single ticket for the same Monday evening . I was offered Q23 and told this normally went for an eye-watering 90 , but I could have it for 62.50 . Still pricey , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really could n't have been better . The near lack of rake in rows A to P works to your advantage here because unless you have someone particularly tall in those seats , you are looking over the people 's heads . Also , as will be seen from the seat plan , it is the front row on a centre aisle so the leg room is enormous . The seats in row Q are also far enough forward so the overhang of the dress does not obscure the view of anything happening high up , as it might do with seats further back . A small ( very small ) irritation is that Q23 is on the junction of two centre aisles , the position where the drinks and ice cream sellers position themselves , so if you 're staying in your seat for the interval , be prepared for quite a bit of traffic <p> as I say minor quibble . Facial expressions would have been clearer by being a bit closer , but again this is a small point and you 're really not that far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tucker 's voice is so powerful it could probably be heard at the Apollo Shaftesbury Avenue , never mind the Apollo Victoria . I 'm probably a bit spoilt now . I can never afford the full price of a premium seat and will not always be lucky enough to pick up one cheaper . But if you can go that extra few pounds , this is a good a seat as any in the house . <p> Tony LONG ... <p> Just returned from ' Wicked ' ( February 2012 ) it was amazing . We got tickets on ticketmaster for 17.25 each and they were perfect . The stalls H43 and H44 . I was a little nervous about them but after reading reviews on this website decided to take a chance . They were great seats and hardly any of the show was missed . I would recommend anyone to go for these cheaper seats than pay full price for them . The show was fantastic and booking again now for another ! ! LONG ... <p> We went to see Wicked on Saturday the 10th March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the stalls . These seats were side right to the stage . We paid 67.50 and would recommend these seats . I unfortunately had a tall man in front of me so had to do a bit of bobbing in and out ; however , he was aware of his height and sat well down in his seat , bless . The characters were easy to see but for more of a look at their expressions etc we used the binoculars . I would recommend these seats and the leg room was excellent . LONG ... <p> Review of Seat : My friend and I were sat on G32 , 33 . Paid 62.50 per ticket . Brilliant seat . Worth every penny . View was clear , we could see the actors up close but were far enough to appreciate the stage . Perhaps a seat further behind in the central stalls would be more appropriate for someone who wishes to enjoy the entire stage . However , I certainly enjoyed being close to the stage . LONG ... <p> Went to see ' Wicked ' matinee show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I say .... the show was amazing and , if anyone is in the area , I suggest you go watch it ! ! <p> We were sat in Circle row H 26 and 27 . The view from these seats was amazing . All the stage could be clearly seen , with none of the characters feeling too far away . Sound was pretty good , better than expected after reading the reviews . However I do not suggest these seats unless bought cheap ; reason being that people in row G in front of you have the railing . We had the guy in front of us constantly moving , forward and backwards - and this was a pain . We were lucky enough that row I behind us was empty so we moved up one row , resolving the problem . So I agree with Theatremonkey marking these rows in Red as they are risky especially if you pay top price for them . Go for rows J or K or A to F middle section , worth every penny . <p> Emerson LONG ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a marvellous time ! Would thoroughly recommend the show to anyone who is a fan of musicals . <p> We had seats P42 and P43 , which were to the left hand side of stalls , and are ones that the Monkey recommends as they are at a reduced price compared to some of the more expensive tickets in the stalls . The tickets were 32.50 and are amazing value as you get a good view of the stage without the big price tag of surrounding seats . There was only one moment where I could n't see one of the performers enter , but they soon moved to the foreground . I would highly recommend these seats as they are really great value . LONG ... <p> Yes , Seen it again ... 4th time for me , 3rd for daughters , 1st for their friends , and it was still magical for all of us . We were lucky enough to see the awesome Rachel Tucker for one last time before she leaves . Gina Beck has big shoes to fill after Louise , but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very sweet .

Seats great , it 's fantastic to be so close . B 13 and 14 are marked as limited view so are much cheaper but are well worth it , none of us missed anything ..... <p> I so wanted to like ' Wicked ' having heard " Defying Gravity , " I could n't wait to hear it live in the theatre <p> Saw the evening performance on 30th October 2012 we sat in the Stalls in seats R38 and R39 great view of the whole stage and one of us could stretch out a bit as R38 is on the aisle seats felt comfortable and binoculars were available if you felt you needed them <p> For the most part sound was fine when people were speaking and singing individually , but when the whole cast sang it was hard to make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of lungs on her she really does belt the songs out and got well deserved applause however both myself and my partner just did n't  enjoy the first act it seemed to drag on I felt like I could have easily just walked in for the ' Defying Gravity ' song at the end of the first act and would n't have felt like I had missed too much . <p> Second act was better , but we both came away feeling huge disappointment there were clever references to the ' Wizard of Oz ' film , concerning three of the characters , which we thought were smart ; the time dragon did n't  seem to do much apart from shaking its head a few times , there did n't  seem much point to it maybe I was expecting too much ? <p> Maybe Wicked is n't aimed at my age group ( 40 ) given the number of young / teenage girls in the theatre , there 's obviously a market for it Definitely not one to go and see again for me

It took the monkey over a year to get around to this - and it is pleased it did - managing to catch much of the original cast before they disperse to other projects . <p> That the play is the product of graduating drama students " doing it for themselves " and ending up , through numerous versions and presentations , with a full-length show backed by a major producer is an achievement . It also means that their frame-of-reference for its creation matches directly the situation they attempt to create . Students writing about a ' student dramatic society ' means that emotionally , the whole thing feels genuine even as every artificially created comedic idea unfolds . <p> And that is the true strength of the show .

The view of the top of the stage is only affected very slightly from row CC back . <p> When seating is used , the stalls are split into sections by aisles . The front section is divided off by an aisle in front of row N , and contains a central and two side blocks . The rear section from row N to FF has six blocks . Either side of the centre aisle are two blocks . Beside them are two outer blocks . These outer blocks are split into middle and rear sections by aisles in front of row X. Only the centre two blocks have seats in row W. <p> The stage front is usually flat , so that seats no longer curve around the front of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front rows between the proscenium arch and the start of the seating . The gap means speakers can be put there without encroaching on sightlines as badly as they did before , for those lucky enough to be in the front rows for concerts . <p> Without seats , a few rails to lean on are provided around the auditorium . <p> Legroom:Good throughout the stalls , best in rows A , N and in row X seats 1 to 16 and 37 to 52 . <p> Choosing Seats in General:Front Section : Theatremonkey rates front section central block seats in rows E to M particularly worth buying , offering a fine view . A reader notes the rake had gone in 2014 , though , before row M. Then try rows D to A in that order before choosing the inside aisle seats in the side blocks of the front section . <p> In the two front section side blocks , seats closest to the inside aisle have a fair view , but for the same money , choose the central blocks . Depending on the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three in D and four in E to M may not see into the stage corners with speakers or other bits of set in front . Still , they may be worthwhile if you are trying to sit as close to the stage as possible , and do n't mind the slight lack of view . The box office note that rows B to E can also be very noisy if the speakers are often placed here ... bring earplugs is the advice ! <p> Rear Section : Central two blocks rows N to S are worth buying . Row N seats 13 to 38 in these blocks combine good views and extra legroom . The rest of the central blocks offer just average value , try for the front section seats mentioned above first before taking rows T to Z. To be fair to the venue , all rows in the stalls feel relatively close to the stage considering the size of the place , but if all seats are the same price , why not sit as close as possible ? <p> The two front outer blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the outermost four seats as again they are mostly outside the proscenium with a poor viewing angle . <p> Even the rear corner blocks are not terrible - ignoring the outermost four seats once again . Again the architecture allows them all to feel fairly close to the stage and , if not able to see performers faces , at least to see more than just a moving matchstick as in other venues . <p> In all blocks , the last rows , particularly AA to CC can offer particular value at a low price for those like Theatremonkey who feel in need of a bargain . Take these before the back of the Dress Circle for the same money , though watch for row FF 36 to 48 which have the sound desk behind and could be a noisy place to sit . The rest of these blocks are also fair value . <p> A final advantage is that the corners of the rear section are close to the exits and high number seats are near the ladies toilets , low numbers near the Gentlemen 's . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , really must . <p> Beside the rear outer blocks is a section for wheelchair users on either side of the auditorium . Each has two chair spaces , with two companion seats beside them . These have an acceptable average view , with the advantage of being slightly elevated . <p> Behind this is space for two rows of 60 people to stand . Arrive early so that you do n't have to stand behind the sound desk ! <p> General Hazard Notes:Seats in the front row may have views blocked by speakers stacked either on the stage front or up the sides . <p> Seats are not " offset " to see through the gaps ahead as well as they could be - around a quarter rather than half way between . <p> Sound desk behind row FF seats 36 to 48. 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments : " E 1 and 2 : " American Idiot " ( December 2012 ) .

The show has a speaker tower at the front of either side of the stage . This blocked not only the rear quarter of the stage but about a third of the stage ( front and rear ) .

" <p> It is divided into front and rear sections by an aisle ( and barrier ) in front of row G. <p> The front section is split into five blocks , the rear into six . <p> There is a low safety rail at the end of each aisle in the front blocks . The monkey has had no complaints about the view being affected by these . <p> Legroom:Average in all seats , up to around 5ft 8 in row A. Those over 5ft 10 or so may find all other seats uncomfortable , alas . A reader found seats in row K behind the stairwell excellent , I 've sat in much worse at 6ft 2 , though . <p> Choosing Seats in General:Front Section : Block 9 rows B to F and the six seats just off the centre aisles in blocks 8 and 10 offer the best value in the circle . The rest of the seats in all blocks are fair value . The distance from the stage means a comfortable viewing angle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 and 24 offer better value for money , being closer to the action . Rear Section : Rows soar towards space with a dizzying rake , a remnant of this theatre 's previous life as a cinema . Theatremonkey generally prefers the stalls rear blocks to any of these rear blocks at the same prices . Circle blocks 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 rows G ( if the barrier is not a problem ) to N are preferable to the outermost seats in the stalls , though , but in the circle row O back is a long way from the stage so the rest of the seats are a choice between distance , view and comfort . The stalls is closer and more comfortable . The circle has a wider view of the stage . Theatremonkey takes the stalls , accepting both options are not great . <p> The outermost four seats in the two corner blocks in the circle 1 and 6 are worth avoiding . Far away in the corners of the theatre the viewing angle is poor and the value worse . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to P then rows G to J before anything else , but prepare for disappointment . <p> If they are not discounted , the other seats worth avoiding in all blocks are rows X to Z for being closer to Hammersmith Flyover than the stage . Take these last when all other seats have gone unless they are cheaper . <p> Standing place tickets will generally be marked " GA " for " General Admission " . They are often sold as " Circle Standing " , just to be clear , though ! <p> General Hazard Notes:Smaller children may find the sloped wall at the front of the circle a little high to see over if in row A or even B for the smallest . Those over about 5ft tall should be fine . <p> The barrier in front of row G may annoy some shorter people . <p> Row K seats 11 to 13 , 24 to 26 , and 64 to 66 and row L seats 54 and 55 are behind stairwell walls . These restrict the view for those under five foot seven . Avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Kate Bush " ( September 2014 ) . Right at the far end and red on your diagram . Keep it red , overall the view was good but part of the stage was obscured by speakers hanging down . I appreciate this is not always going to be the case but if you have the choice ( I did n't - only got the ticket last week ) why risk it ? I would n't have expected this to be a problem for a 135 ticket ! You do see almost everything ( mostly it was part of the backdrops that were obscured ) and if the performance was more fixed towards the front of the stage as more traditional concerts are then it would be a negligible problem . Bear in mind also if the people in front lean forward that 's a huge chunk of the stage gone . Leg room was ok but i was on an aisle so I could stretch slightly to the side , not much width though .

It 's one of the few real anchors to the present - important , as the pace of life demonstrated by the rest is almost unimaginable today and makes the text somewhat less than accessible at times as it is too young to be " classic " yet far too distant to feel even slightly contemporary . <p> Simon Callow keeps the direction light , and the cast for the most part do their best with the text they have .

Araminta ( Lily Cole ) is a victim on a serial man-seducing revenge mission . Celia ( Charlotte Ritchie ) is a post-graduate student yearning for more than settling for what she thought she wanted . The trouble comes by pitting a highly experienced actor against one making her professional debut . On paper , a Supermodel as seductress looks good - and at times , long hair and even longer legs draped around her target , Ms Cole confirms the theory . The trouble is , everything else required comes far less naturally to her than her co-artiste . Add to the fact a quick " straw poll " of men around the monkey gave Ms Ritchie ( who was n't supposed to be the object of such affections ) a clear edge as the most desirable woman on the stage by a mile , and the play is fatally unbalanced . Ritchie is basically every man ( well , monkey , well , man 's ) dream - strong , independent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's face it , highly attractive .

I can not confirm this to be the case since the refurbishment . <p> Also note that if you place jackets under your seat it is susceptible to liquid from seats behind you trickling on to your clothing .

Not large enough for all 12,500 coats , but sufficient to meet demand so far , the venue say . <p> NOTE : This advice is based on " First Impressions " and readers are asked to contribute their own opinions in order to build up a comprehensive picture . Seating advice for events using an arena will be added over the next few months after events have taken place and views assessed . <p> The Arena has a large flat space in the centre , either for seating or standing ; with two blocks of seats down the long sides . The long side seating blocks are permanent and divided into front and rear sections by aisles between rows H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flat space in the middle depends where the stage is put . Notes <p> This Advice deals with " End Stage Layout " events - the most usual arrangement . In this layout , most common for all events including pop concerts , a wide stage is at the West end of the arena . The flat space in front of the stage is filled with seats . Most of side blocks N and S 1 to 3 may not be used or have a " restricted view " depending on the position of the stage and any equipment placed there . <p> Behind and either side of these blocks rise up the tiered seating , discussed later . <p> Four sections of seating here - A , B , C and D. <p> A blocks are nearest the stage - 24 rows of seats . <p> B blocks are directly behind - 22 or 23 rows without a break between them and block A. <p> Then comes a gap before the C blocks - 17 rows . <p> Behind these is a gap before the D blocks - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no rake ( sloped floor ) so if someone tall sits in front , tough . <p> Section C is raised on a single plinth - the first row about five inches above the 47 rows ahead of them . <p> Section D is shallowly stepped , raising all seats slightly above those in front . <p> Legroom:Pretty acceptable in all seats in this area for all but the tallest over 6ft or so . A reader agrees : " Leg room was good ( A block ) and the seats were reasonably comfortable . I ca n't recall if this is a change , however they were padded ( on the seat part ) I do n't think they were before . " <p> The monkey recalls seats in the side tier sections being padded , but not the floor ones ... but is happy to be corrected ! <p> Choosing Seats in General:These are the ones that the Box Office push hardest in Theatremonkey 's experience . There is a good reason for this . In this monkey 's opinion you have to be out of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front rows of section A. Regular Wembley goers know this and avoid sitting here unless utterly insane to get a ticket . The moaning he endures form those seated here <p> All the seats in blocks A to D are normally at top price . Taking each section in order from front to back : <p> Section A is split into three blocks . Block A3 ( seats 22 to 39 ) is the most central , with A2 ( seats 1 to 20 ) and A4 ( seats 41 to 60 ) either side of it . <p> Rows 1 to 8 in all blocks are best - take the row furthest forward is the monkey advice here , before worrying about how central they are ... though central is prime of course ! <p> Lately , the first few rows of block A - the good stuff remember - have had a further premium mark-up added . Trust monkey , it is worth paying to sit in the first 5 rows . Even though it is a VERY greedy thing for promoters to do to fans . Turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows 9 to 14 - also a reasonable bet , though shorter folk may have a problem seeing over anyone ahead . <p> The rest of the rows in sections A and all rows in section B offer a view of heads ( especially if you are shorter ) and little else to recommend , except being closer to the stage than sections C or D. <p> Section C is split into five blocks - C3 the most central - the front three rows of Blocks C1 , C2 , C4 or C5 are the emergency fall back position . The plinth raises you slightly above the poor souls in row 22 of block B. You may see the stage , though the performer looks like a large matchstick . <p> Block C3 in the centre of the arena looks a good bet , until the sound mixing desk is dumped in the front of it . Take it from the monkey , nobody in blocks C3 or D3 enjoy the view much . Luckily , these seats are normally left unsold , or sold last or cheap as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section D is the only section on the floor area to have seats " stepped " in a shallow tier arrangement . <p> D2 or D4 , from about 3 rows back may provide a little more view , but again remember that shorter people could have up to 84 rows of people standing up in front of them between themselves and the stage . <p> A reader suggests taking N/S15 before the back rows of block D because , " You 're in line with the back of block D which is ore expensive , so in that respect it is better value than being at the back of block D. If you 're in the front row of the block then you have an unobstructed view , albeit at a head-turning angle 80 degrees to the left ( or to the right if in block S15 ) . Those who suffer neckache beware " <p> General Hazard Notes:Blocks A and B are not raked . If anybody tall is in front , or when everybody stands up and you are sorter ... unlucky . <p> The stage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , you are better of than those in the rear rows who see only matchsticks . <p> Speakers at the front and sides of the stage can affect views . <p> Block C3 is behind the sound desk . All you see is the back of the mixer . Luckily , they are not often sold . 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments:Block A3 : " Dolly Parton " ( March 2007 ) . Unfortunately this means that you ca n't see anything that is further back than about two metres from front of stage . We did n't see Dolly make her entrance and when she sat down to play piano all we could see was the top of her head ! Probably about four rows back from the front would be better . ( Interesting comment felt the monkey , who would add that to an extent what you see depends on the height of the stage , staging and your own height - all of which are variable ) . " <p> " Block A4 , 47 to 50 : " The Who " ( June 2007 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the times ( 16 ) , that I 've seen them live , I 've never been as close to the stage as that night . We were third row from . Great view even though everyone stood throughout . The stage was n't too high and there was only a narrow pit between the front row and the stage unlike some concerts where you could park a bus and still have room to drive round it . I 'd realised a few days before that my not quite 5 ' tall daughter might struggle to see if everyone stood but she just stood on her seat and no-one seemed to mind . <p> Tickets were pretty steep at 65 but most of the seats were that price so we 'd have paid that or the lesser price of 50 anyway . At least they did n't make the first few rows gold or premium grade to push the price up even more . Also nice to go to a completely no-smoking venue which the arena has been for a while now . " <p> " Block A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it might be good to mention something about the Central Arena Seating which bugged me when I saw Dolly Parton on 25th March 2007 . Sitting in the second row of block A3 ( seats 17 and 18 ) we were joined by to teenage boys , which I was not in the slightest bothered by as you get everyone at concerts . Well the teenage boy that was sitting right next to me decided it would be good to continuously shake his leg up and down with the music ( which again is fine by me ) but in A3 , because the seats are detachable , all of our 4 seats were attached and with his shaking came constant rocking back and forth of the seating . So it might be worth mentioning this . ( Brings a whole new meaning to " shake , rattle and roll " thinks the monkey , who was upset to hear about this behaviour ) . " <p> Block B : ( Lee regular reader ) . Not sure why you have seats in block B as Red because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wembley , the stage is high enough that the lack of rake is never really a problem but I guess others may disagree . ( The monkey comment is that because the stage is not permanent , there can be problems if the design varies in height . Also , the taller you are , the better in block B as there is no " slope " to raise each row above the ones in front ) . " <p> Block D : " Kylie Minogue 's " ( January 2007 ) , ( John ) . As well as Block D being on a rake , Block C is stepped too . C and D merge into one another with only the row numbers going from 17 to 1 to signify this . Each step in height is shallow and has 2 , yes 2 , rows on it . Hence if you 're in the 2nd row and short too you 're really up against it . The front rows on each step are odd numbers in Block C and even numbers in Block D. If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows every time , as at least the step gives an advantage over the row in front . The sound desk is at ground level so C3 and D3 can see over it as they 're raised above , but the step/height problem will remain regardless . " <p> " D4 Row 3 Seats 53 and 54 : Good view in my opinion . Bit too expensively priced generally as they are on the flat . If you get stuck behind someone tall , you 're doomed . Comfortable ( I think ) as I was standing up most the time ! Sound is fine . " <p> Seating is split into E2 and E3 , the central sections which look straight down the arena centre , and E1 and E4 which , at the extreme ends ( seats 1 to 12 and 91 to 102 ) look over the side terraced seating towards the stage . <p> Legroom:Acceptable in all seats for all but the tallest . <p> Choosing Seats in General:Seats here are usually cheaper .

These look over a low wall - not a problem except for the shortest person , the monkey felt ... but an advantage having nobody in front of you ... <p> Then take E2 and E3 , the central sections which look straight down the arena centre , from row back , so that you can see over those ahead of you . <p> Row P seats 14 to 16 , 34 to 36 , 66 to 68 and 87 to 89 may also be desirable as they face down the aisle with either a fully or partially clear view ( nobody in front of you ! ) . <p> General Hazard Notes:Metal work at the front of this block can be annoying for the front four rows , when in place . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are high up and at a steep angle from the ground . <p> F16 to 23 and F79 to 87 look over a low wall , not suitable for the shortest . <p> Dancing in the aisles is not permitted so be prepared to do what you can in your own space . 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments:None . <p> SIDE BLOCKSAlso known as " Grand Tier " ( rows A to H ) and " Upper Tier " ( rows J to W ) seating . <p> Layout:Long rows of tiered seating down the sides of the Arena either side of the central floor area . <p> Split into the lower " Grand Tier " and higher " Upper Tier " section . In practise , the gap is simply a wall and space for gangways . Depending which side of the arena the seats are , they are either in the " North " ( N ) or " South " ( S ) tiers , but the numbering of seats and sections is identical - the monkey talks about both sides simultaneously by using the abbreviation N/S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 3 , there are entrance doors breaking up the seating . <p> In the Grand tier the doors are in the " lower " number halves of each block , and the first row above the doorway is F. Rows A and B are missing in these halves too , to allow gangway access / wheelchair spaces . <p> In the Upper Tier the doors are in the " higher number " halves of each block and the first row is N above the doorways . In the rest of the block , the front row is J. <p> Legroom:OK to generous for all but the tallest in most seats . <p> Least legroom is found in the front row of the section behind gangways , and most will find it pretty comfortable . <p> Worth seeking out are the seats in the centre of the block in rows H and W. These are on the gangway with nothing / only half a seat in front , and can prove more comfortable for many . Identify them by calculating the numbers missing beside the aisles in the other rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be behind the doorways you get a low wall ( nobody in front to look over ) that is unlikely to trouble many but the shortest . Low safety bars also run along in front of each doorway in the Upper Tier , but do n't affect the view enough to worry about , in the monkey opinion . <p> For those in the Upper tiers , seating in rows L and M on the highest numbers halves , around the doorway , may not be the greatest as there is a wall to one side . Worth going a row behind , feels the monkey . <p> First choice of seats is in blocks N/S 6 . Seats 20 to 28 are actually closer to the stage than the first row in the centre of the arena . Rows C to F are best . Blocks N/S 4 at the front of N/S 6 are the prime wheelchair spaces , users should take this first over the rest . <p> Next take blocks N/S 8 seats 80 to 92 , rows A to F then rows G to H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else try blocks N/S 3 and 5 rows J to N ( but not L and M highest numbers if possible ) seats 30 to 66 . For wheelchair users , block S/N 8 is next choice . <p> Finally , there is a choice . Either take the seats in row O back in blocks N/S 3 , 5 and 7 ( remember that they are high up with a viewing angle that can cut off the view of the back of the stage ) . <p> The other option is to try for either N/S 10 seats 109 to 121 or rows J to N in blocks N/S 9 seats 84 to 108 . Then the rest of the rows behind row N in this section . These are half way down the arena but have a good view compared to seats in the centre block as you are raised above heads in front . For wheelchair users , block N/S 10 is next choice . <p> All the above mentioned seats are better than anything past row 12 in the central arena blocks in this monkey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except small parts of N/S 15 which are down the sides of blocks E1 and 4 , are preferable to anything in the centre arena . At least you will see the performer even at a great distance , rather than just heads of the people in front . And you pay less for the privilege . <p> Blocks N/S 12 , then 9 , 11 , 14 , 13 and 15 in order are the choice - though remember to take anything in section E ( from row E back ) before block 13 ( seats 164 to 175 ) , and all of block 15 . Take the furthest forward seats available in each block , deciding whether to move further along the row rather than sit more rows back each time . For the monkey , it prefers to sit further back but closer - but other readers are happier with front rows but further along . <p> Blocks N/S 12 and 14 have wheelchair spaces . The plus side is they are at the front of the block , the minus is they are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces first . <p> Blocks N/S 15 are in the far corners of the arena . Often unsold , you will see less , and folk further along leaning forward can be a problem . Also , avoid seats L199 and 200 . These face a black wall and have less legroom than usual . Claustrophobic and totally avoidable even for those who " just want to be there " in the monkey view . <p> Most of side blocks N/S 1 and 2 are not used for end stage concerts as they are behind the stage . They are , on occasion sold to personal callers as restricted view seats at the last minute . Ask about them . You can often only see the very front of the stage , but at least it is close to the performers . These seats are worth trying for if anyone will sell them to you and you just want to " be there " , but remember that you may well not see as much as you hope . <p> General Hazard Notes:Make sure you on arrival that you choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LONG walk around to reach the other sections ! Every block in both Grand and Upper tier is split into two by an aisle . <p> Dancing here is harder than in the centre arena and the staff do n't let you stand on your seat . <p> Low walls protecting door entranceways may restrict views for the shortest . For seats behind them , everybody else will enjoy not having to look over heads / standing folk in front . <p> L199 and 200 face a black wall and have less legroom than usual . <p> Some seats are not always sold , the monkey notes . As a rule , if they are , then you should be OK seems to be reader feedback . Wembley do n't knowingly sell poor seats without a warning , and sometimes tickets are released once a set has been built and sightlines confirmed by the staff as acceptable . 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments : " Block 10 : Seats in row were O.K. - could have had worse ! I did wish I was much closer as I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pretty much sums up the experience from half way down - you pay for the atmosphere as much as the view . Editor ) . <p> " Block N , Row L , 65 and 66 : " Billy Joel " ( July 2006 ) . I know people have made comments about these seats not being too good . For me they were fine . You could sit right back and see whole stage . But seat 64 would be a nightmare . You would have to lean way forward to see the whole of the stage , are next to a wall with the top/ side of the door blocking almost half the stage . It 's disgraceful that they charge full price for that seat . " <p> " Block N7 , Row J73 and 74 : Much better than Block C , D and E. Do n't have a problem with tall people standing in front of you on the flat like in these blocks . You are also very close , so get a good view and does n't really feel like a side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would get these any day . " <p> " Block N15 : Far back but not bad for sound positioning . You 're in line with the back of block D which is more expensive , so in that respect it is better value than being at the back of block D. If you 're in the front row of the block then you have an unobstructed view , albeit at a head-turning angle 80 degrees to the left ( or to the right if in block S15 ) . Those who suffer neckache beware . " <p> " Block S3 : OK , but a bit side-on maybe . " <p> " Block S5 M66 : It appears they do not sell seats in the following positions .... S/N3 Row L37 and M 38 &amp; 37 . S/N5 Same relative position to the previous . These seats have a restricted view because of the entrance door surround to their left/right . I was in seat S5 M66 and if I was sitting in my seat straight then I would not be able to see the left 1/3rd of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I leaned forward I could see . Anybody not six foot tall like me is likely to have a greater reduction . I would propose marking those seats as red on your plan . ( The monkey has done so , and with the seats in similar position down the whole arena ) . " " Block S5 , Row N , 65 and 66 : " Muse " ( November 2006 ) Reading the other comments on this site I was a bit apprehensive but I have to say the seats were superb . My friend and I had a full view of the stage . I 'd go as far as to say I would recommend these seats to others as the view was pretty awesome . Saying all that , I do think that the seats L64 and M64 would have been pretty poor , especially M64 . I reckon you 'd need to stand to see anything . " <p> " Block S5 , Row J , 48 and 49 : " Bruce Springsteen " ( November 2006 ) , ( Jason ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seats I had . They offered a clear view of the stage and there was no walkway or aisle near to distract you . Considering the seats were right behind the VIP area , I thought they were great value seats considering how much people , possibly , paid to sit in Block S6/8 . I would definitely try and get similar seats if I were to go to Wembley again . " <p> " Block S6 , Row G , Seats 33 and 34 : " Dancing on Ice " ( Pip ) . The best seats by far in the house as you do n't have to worry about being on the big screen and can see everything . The view is perfect and action so close ! Wonderful , delightful . Seats are never comfortable here but good legroom makes up for that . Would pay full price for this . However , for main stage concerts , you will get a side view but I still think you 'd get your money 's worth . " <p> " Block S8 , Row E , 64 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , ( Christopher H ) . We had . These were incredibly satisfying , except seat 66 had a slight restricted view which was caused by the handrail . I was excited because the monkey had given this a green rating , although you should advise people about the handrail at the end of the rows . There was nothing special about this arena , I would probably prefer the O2 , but if you go remember to pick seats in either blocks S6 , S8 or N6 , N8 ; or , if you want to experience the whole atmosphere of the concert , take central arena standing if available . " <p> " Block S13 Row V Seats 155 and 156 : Much better than flat seats blocks A - D. Bit far away from the action if just the normal stage , fine for ' Dancing on Ice ' ( with centre rink ) . Bit far back and dark . Seats definitely comfortable although little legroom , can see past past tall people . Sometimes ridiculously priced , and I would rather not come at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price for this particular event ! " <p> This is a no smoking venue throughout . Thanks to new ticketing technology , " Pass Out " permits are available to allow smokers to leave the building and re-enter if they require . <p> Not air conditioned but such a barn it does not get too uncomfortable .

Something to do with the stage surface muses theatremonkey . <p> Wheelchair users have access to places in five blocks , level from the foyer. 2 lifts are also available for users . Adapted toilets available near each section , and to a very high quality with automatic doors , space to manoeuvre in each cubicle , grab rails and alarm cords .

IT IS STRICTLY FOR ACCESS USERS ONLY . <p> Car users with appropriate Blue or Orange disabled badges are given a discount , and may book at the time they reserve their event tickets . Designated disabled spaces are in the Yellow Car Park on the South side of the arena - Lakeside Way . Call 020 8782 5500 ( Monday to Friday 10.30am to 4.30pm ) for more information or to book .

You can also bring binoculars - but maybe leave the lens covers at home . Anything they do n't like will be confiscated at the door , so check with the box office if you are not sure . You could well be searched and ' frisked ' too . If they find concealed equipment by doing this , your ticket will be cancelled . The whole risk is pointless anyway as , even with a flash , pictures will often barely come out . Since a concert programme is often the price of a disposable camera , monkey advice is to buy the programme . <p> Choice of bars , a 200 seat restaurant ( open from 3 hours before the show - bookable with your ticket ) and takeaway snacks available throughout the venue . The restaurant overlooks the new entrance plaza and the fountains / illuminations . It was also the original " hospitality " area for the performers when the stage was at the other end ... so you could be sitting where your favourite star has sat . There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to businesses . Beer fans will be interested to know that all beer in the venue is carried by pipes ( look for the black ones on some of the concourse staircases ) that keep the beer at 4 degrees for every glass ! The monkey suggested hooking these pipes to the fountain supply outside , but was told that regrettably there would be " logistical issues " to that idea . <p> Adequate toilets for Gentlemen and ladies . Some toilets can be reassigned for performances popular with women . Check the door symbol before entry gentlemen ! <p> A reader notes that : " The extra toilets downstairs below the vendors are a bonus , although my perception last night ( 4th April 2006 ) of the existing toilets were that they seemed generally smaller than before . Certainly less urinal space and more cubicles . The venue is now non-smoking . Gone are the mass fogs that used to make the old bar/food areas along the side so unpleasant . The venue are also very tight on this . When I was in the toilet last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was smoking and escorted him out . <p> Basically , the gents are now situated only at either end of each corridor and all the loos in between have been given over to ladies ( plus one of each in the Atrium ) . This is on balance ( putting my male head to one side for a moment ) the best use for them . <p> There a further one of each down the stairs and under the vendors . These are badly ( or not ! ) signposted so you could end up going down to be faced by a woman 's loo door . These because they are badly signposted are often the quietest and worth looking out for . " <p> Wembley say that they are working to improve signage in this area , though another reader says , " there do not seem to be enough Men 's toilets whilst there are women 's at every turn . Great for women but last night ( 2nd January 2007 ) there were massive queues at the few men 's available . " <p> From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet wash facilities have been designed by a male ! Strange sloping sinks , and the distance to the tap means that we brush up against the shelf when washing our hands ! " <p> Cloakrooms for checking your coats in are NO LONGER available . <p> The monkey gratefully thanks Mr Peter Tudor and everybody at Wembley Arena for their massive help in compiling this information . <p> From the platforms , stairs bring you up to a large new station area at street level . At the right of this station area are a row of ticket barriers in a separate annex . Use these , as once past them you come to a long flight of stairs down to Olympic Way . At the bottom of these stairs turn left onto Olympic way and go straight on under the bridge . <p> If this exit is not available , and you have to leave the station at street level via the barriers ahead of you in the station foyer area , then on leaving the station turn right . You wo n't be able to cross the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the road junction near the Travel Inn Hotel , you 'll either be able to cross the road to your left at the traffic lights , then go straight on and down a flight of steps to ground level - thus entering Olympic Way from above OR turn to your right instead to face the station , then right again into the paved area in front of the station long staircase , and turn right again to walk at ground level under the bridge . Monkey advice is to turn right , right and right again . <p> You have now joined the folks who used the staircase from the station entrance ... so , all together now ... proceed down Olympic Way at ground level , admiring the murals under the bridge as you go . Walk on the right of the paved area ( the side the " Curry 's Electrical Warehouse " Shop is on ) . <p> Continue to where the elevated walkway begins . Do not take the walkway ( that goes to the Stadium ) . Choose the space in the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next road crosses your path . The car park and lower entrances to the Stadium will be ahead of you . Turn to the right - the entrance to the Wembley Arena venue is ahead of you , cross the road to it . <p> The entrance is across a large grey plaza containing fountains ( do n't drink the water - it is n't drinkable ! ) and illuminated columns . <p> On leaving the Arena , North Side ticket holders are ejected onto the pathway at the side of the arena . This cuts a bit of the race to the underground , especially for those in blocks 11 to 15 who have a good 100 yard advantage . <p> Buses:83 , 92 , 182 , 204 , PR2 all stop near the Arena . It is probably better not to bother and take the underground as traffic on event days and sheer numbers of people swamp the services . <p> Car Park:In front of the Arena , under the bridge .

Car users with appropriate Blue or Orange disabled badges are given a discount , and may book at the time they reserve their event tickets on 020 8902 4141 ( Monday to Friday 10.30am to 4.30pm ) . NOTE : This telephone number is only for disabled assistance and is NOT for general public booking . <p> Please be aware that as the area around the new Stadium , adjacent , is being completed , some car parking areas may be further away than usual and may be near building work . <p> Unofficial car-parks are advertised all over the area too in the grounds of tenants on the industrial estate . The official car park operator does n't advise using them as they may not be insured or patrolled by security . <p> Theatremonkey also suggests the Wembley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Forty Avenue end and avoid the chaos of Bridge Road and Empire Way . Only about 96 spaces ( plus 6 disabled spaces ) , so arrive early . It is cheaper ( 2.50 per day , 2 Saturday , Free Sunday and Bank Holidays as of April 2007 ) , and easier to get out of after the event - but getting a space may be almost impossible for a while to come . Just remember to turn right on leaving . <p> On street parking is very limited and tow away zones are rigorously enforced . At the Forty Avenue end of Brook Avenue exists many side roads on the far side of the road from the station . These are not always restricted for parking . Try them to save cash and time in leaving the venue . The extra walk along Brook Avenue can be worth it . <p> Walking from this car park to the venue , walk inside the car park towards the office block and glass buildings . These are to the left if you face the entrance road . Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bays at the end of the car park . Behind these bays are stairs and a wheelchair ramp leading downwards . Take them . <p> If you take the wrong staircase ( a wide one to the right of the disabled bays , NOT behind them ) then turn left at the bottom of these stairs and walk along Brook Avenue , uphill slightly to the large open space on your left , and re-join the group there . <p> Together again in this patch of grey concrete , the long steep station staircase is to your left , a bridge with tunnel beneath ahead of you . Walk to this tunnel ( the strange archer statue points to where you want to be ! ) and use this underpass to get straight onto Olympic Way . Once through the underpass ( admire the murals ) , walk on the right of it ( the side the " Curry 's Electrical Warehouse " Shop is on ) . <p> Continue to where the elevated walkway begins . Do not take the walkway ( that goes to the Stadium ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walkways . Keep on until the next road crosses your path . The car park and stadium lower entrances will be ahead of you .

Sat in this seat for today 's performance of Slava 's Snow Show ( great show ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and width of seat also generous . Comfortable seat but limited support for lower back . Sightlines were brilliant : the rake was steep enough to ensure that the heads in the row in front did not get in the way , and it was also easy to see between the heads . Could see 7/8ths of the main stage and into the wings on the opposite side from where I was sitting . Would happily sit here again . " <p> " G26 and 27 : " The Wizard of Oz " ( July 2008 ) . We sat in Row G seats 26 and 27 of the front stalls . It was actually the 4th row of seats and the sight lines were excellent as you are level with the stage . The leg room was good also . If I was buying tickets in the front stalls I would go for row G and back as before that you have to look up very slightly . " <p> Layout:Four long rows to the side and slightly above the front stalls , extending from row T to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the platform . <p> Rows W to Y are tiered from a level floor at the height of rear stalls row AA . <p> Row Z is behind the other three rows , slightly elevated and requiring stairs to access it from row AA level . <p> Row W seats 1 to 4 and 30 to 33 are single seats placed one behind the other , facing the stage at an angle . <p> Row W seats 5 to 17 and 34 to 46 and row X 11 to 17 and 40 to 46 are all angled to face the stage , with X on a raised plinth . <p> Row Y 19 to 27 and 47 to 56 is raised above row X , but seats in this row , as well as the same numbered seating in W and X , face the platform sideways on with no angle to them . <p> Legroom:Just adequate in most seats for all but the tallest over 5ft 10 or so . Row Z has considerably less - 5ft 6 maximum . <p> In row W seats 19 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 45 to 56 , architecture means that legroom diminishes as you get further along the row towards the stage . <p> The final seats in row W have significantly less legroom - probably uncomfortable for those above 5ft 7 or so in the monkey view . <p> Choosing Seats in General : This section of seating lose around a tenth of the view of the platform area nearest to them due to the angle of the seating and safety rails . <p> For symphonic concerts of course any loss of view is not important to most , but for more visual events the monkey would probably skip the seats closest to the stage . <p> It would always take seats furthest from the stage first , as they have the best viewing angle . <p> Single seats W seats 1 to 4 and 30 to 33 are a decent pick if available , simply for peace as much as view . <p> Wheelchair spaces can replace W seats 1 to 4 and 30 to 33 . These provide an OK view , but chair users should take the places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . <p> Row W 23 to 27 and 52 to 56 are cramped , avoid if tall . <p> Row Z is in its own section behind the other three rows . All seats are in a single row , with those furthest from the stage having an angled view , those closer facing the stage . The pillars in this row do not affect the view from any seat that the monkey noticed . This row is set back a little way , though , and the seats nearest the stage from around 21 to 27 and 50 to 56 lose up to a quarter of the platform from view make these a final choice . <p> General Hazard Notes : Rails and seat angles deduct 10% of the stage view from most seats . <p> Rows W and Z have wide wooden safety rails in front of them , slightly intruding into the view of seats closest to the stage . <p> One reader was n't crazy about the sound at a 2012 concert here . 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments : " RR 28 and 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Philharmonia concert last night ( 13th December 2012 ) and started in RR 28 and 29 . These are centre of the auditorium but quite far back . Visuals were fine with the caveats that have been noted on your site . But the sound was TERRIBLE . It was very heavily bass and muddy . But coughs from people under the overhang were louder than the orchestra in even medium sound passages . We moved at the intermission and the second half was like being in a different concert . And we were on the extreme right of the auditorium in KK . My advice to anyone who cares about sound quality is they should avoid any of the seats from LL back underneath the overhang from the seats above you . We have been to any number of concerts in the top level and found the sound just fine . " <p> " Y52 : My view was severely restricted by the balcony railing , as was that of everyone in my row and those in the row in front . I feel that all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Layout : This is steeply raked area rising from an aisle behind the front stalls to the rear of the auditorium . <p> The Balcony overhangs these seats at row DD but does n't affect the view of the top of the performing area . <p> Seating is split into middle and two side blocks by aisles . <p> Row AA is split from the main section of seating by a wall and rail between it and row BB . It sits on the wide aisle that divides the stalls from the rear stalls . <p> Legroom : Good in all seats for those up to around 6ft tall , felt the monkey , with the exception of row BB which has a little less . Row AA has most legroom as the wide aisle has nothing in front of any seat . <p> Choosing Seats in General : Central section seats AA 15 to 25 may have a problem with visual events as a sound desk could be in front of them , as could safety rails ahead of them , right behind front stalls row T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Row BB 21 to 31 may also be worth skipping in this event . <p> The side sections of row AA are mostly used to provide the best wheelchair viewing places - chair users should enjoy these , the monkey feels . They are also closest to the exit doors . <p> Seating in rows BB to XX is not " offset " - seats are directly behind each other , but the steep rake should mean few viewing problems over those ahead , feels the monkey . One reader found that they really were not staggered enough , though , and advised caution if booking here for a visual performance . <p> For visual performances where sightlines are important ( not orchestral concerts usually ) the monkey felt that row BB 's rail could be an issue for shorter people . <p> Further , again for visual performances only when the stage might be framed by an arch at the sides , seats 1 to 4 and 48 to 51 in rows BB to XX may not have quite as good a view , being to the sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stage area . <p> At all performances with all seats at the same price , the monkey would pick row FF 15 to 37 first , then work backwards to row LL taking either 15 to 37 or side block 7 to 14 or 38 to 45 for preference . The rest of these seats are at least fair value , the monkey felt . <p> Rows SS back may feel a little further from the stage for visual performances - though the view should improve if the stage is raised - but for classical concerts this wo n't worry anyone , the monkey feels . <p> Extra wheelchair places are available in row XX in the centre block . The monkey would take row AA places , then side stalls and box places before these , just for proximity to the stage - though anyone sat here will enjoy at least a fair view . <p> General Hazard Notes : Seating is not " off set " to see between seats in front . <p> Row AA may have a rail in view . <p> Central rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Row BB may have a rail in view for the shortest . 56962 @qwx466962 <p> Reader Comments : " KK 31 and 32 : <p> " The John Wilson Orchestra . " Because , as mentioned on your website , the seats are not staggered - my wife and I ( I 'm almost 6ft ) had great difficulty seeing the singers on the stage and we noticed that many people around were having the same problem swinging their heads from side to side straining to obtain a clear viewing line . <p> Although the seats are raked they are not raked sufficiently and I would suggest that potential patrons proceed with caution when considering purchasing seats in the central rear stall area for any concert involving soloists or singers who they might actually want to see . <p> I believe that paying patrons should be warned of the limitations of these seats before purchasing the same . <p> I have made this point to the Festival Hall but had a generally unhelpful response . " <p> Layout:This is split into front and rear sections by a broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B are split by walls into sections like boxes containing sixteen seats arranged ( mostly ) in blocks of eight . <p> Rows C to N are normal long rows of seats , split into five sections by aisles . <p> Legroom:Just acceptable in all seats except row B where it is noticeably far less , and C where it is tending to tight too . <p> Row A perhaps has an inch or so more legroom . <p> Before rebuilding , some one reader feels that the stalls are far superior - noting that the seats appear wider downstairs , and have far more space to stretch in . The monkey agrees , even after refurbishment , and urges the taller to take front or rear stalls first if comfort is a priority . <p> Choosing Seats in General:The view from all seats can be distant for visual performances , but the sound is adequate for orchestral ones . <p> The monkey would probably pick the non-restricted view seats in row A first , avoid row B and C , then go for seats as near the front and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event is a visual one . For orchestral ones it would just pick seats near the front . <p> In rows A and B , seats 2 to 4 and 45 to 47 suffer the boxes intruding into the view slightly , the monkey noted - which might be a bother for events more visual than a simple orchestral recital . B 4 and 49 are closest for a quick exit . <p> Similarly , the view from seats 4 , 5 , 12 , 13 , 20 , 21 , 28 , 29 , 36 , 37 , 44 and 45 are also affected by high safety bars at the ends of the aisles . <p> The aisle bars in front of row A may also affect the view from some seats in rows C to F ( the monkey noted it does in 20,21 , 32 and 33 , but suspects more ) at some performances when the stage height is low . If raised ( for visual events rather than simple orchestral concerts ) this situation should be alleviated , especially with the stage at maximum 7ft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stage and would welcome reader feedback . <p> A safety rail in front of row C may block the view for some shorter visitors at all performances . <p> Rows C to E seats 1 to 3 and 50 to 51 are to the sides of the hall and the monkey feels them worth missing for visual events where a central view is preferable . <p> Aisle seats in row N ( except 4 and 49 ) are closest to doors for a quick exit . Claustrophobics might want to avoid rows F to N seats 4 and 49 as there is no aisle beside them . <p> General Hazard Notes:Rows A and B 2 to 4 and 45 to 47 have boxes in view . Seats 4 , 5 , 12 , 13 , 20 , 21 , 28 , 29 , 36 , 37 , 44 and 45 , and row C also have a rail in view . <p> Sightlines decline if a low stage is used ( the stage height varies by event ) . <p> Rows F to N seats 4 and 49 have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Rows A and B : ( Alan Marshall ) . Commenting before the refurbishment . We go to the Festival Hall fairly regularly and go for seats in the Grand Tier/Balcony ( rows A and B ) . Safety bars do obscure the view in some seats - try to avoid aisle seats . It is true that the tickets are sometimes marked to show a " restricted view " but prices are not reduced on these seats . ( Invaluable advice , thinks the monkey , who feels it still applies to a great extent ) . " <p> BOXESLayout : Arranged on four levels in the walls beside the front stalls area and above the side stalls to just beyond the front of the platform . <p> Choosing Seats in General : A rail runs around the front of each box ..

With the stage at such a steep angle below , to see over it you have to lean right forward . If you sit back and relax , the view is through the rails . <p> For a classical orchestra with no amplification , the sound was still excellent .

If you purchased them from any agency mentioned on this site either online or by phone or in person , you will need to talk to that agency directly , again by telephone or email as appropriate . <p> For tickets purchased from the " Theatremonkey Ticketshop " ONLY : Questions can be dealt with by the shop 's owner , " LoveTheatre " . They may be contacted Monday to Friday 10am until 8pm ( Saturday 10am to 6pm ) on 020 7420 9778 ( 0044 207 420 9778 if calling from outside the United Kingdom ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by email at tix@lovetheatre.com . <p> Collecting Tickets at the Box Office:When you can collect tickets ordered online or by telephone but not mailed to you will depend on where you bought your tickets from . If you bought them through the actual box office 's website , then normally you can collect your tickets any time you like when you are passing ( except in the hour before any performance you are not attending , when they are busy with other customers ) . Just give them your booking reference number ( bringing along a copy of the confirmation print out helps ) and produce the actual card you used to make the booking , and you 'll be fine . If the card is going to expire before you see the show , hang on to it particularly if the number will change . <p> If you bought your tickets through any ticket agency rather than the box office , then you do have to collect your ticket in the hour before the show . This is because the agents do n't  deliver the tickets to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway the show does n't  begin until the house manager has checked that the box office and all other front of house areas are happy . So , if there was a very long line at the box office , the curtain would be held until it had cleared . Relax , it 'll be fine ... <p> How do I find out about ticket availability ? Unlike Broadway , London is secretive and does not reveal anything publicly about how well a show is doing . <p> If the monkey could post such information , it would , but since it is a regular theatregoing member of the public it is not privy to box office information . <p> The best way to find out about availability is to call the box office direct and ask . Mention specific seat numbers and see if they can offer them to you . Even ask directly if seats go to Leicester Square TKTS to be sold at half price . They will often tell you . <p> Leicester Square TKTS booth posts its own day 's ticket availability online . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Sale " option in the top menu . <p> Overseas visitors might also try using the online ticket agency systems to see what they are offered . The monkey notes , however that on occasion these systems only offer poor quality tickets . An international phonecall can prove a good investment . <p> What is the difference between " preview " performances and " normal " performances ? Previews are the performances before the official opening night , when the press arrive to review the show . <p> Previews are a chance for the cast and technical team to see how the show works in front of a live audience for the first time after weeks of rehearsal . For a brand new production it is also a time when songs , dances or scenes may be added or cut depending on audience reaction and production team instincts . For revivals of productions there is of course usually no need to add to or cut the text , but things like where people stand on stage or how the set / lighting works could change a little to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about it . For all shows , whether new or revival , it is also a time for the actors to find out how audiences will react to the lines they deliver - and adjust their timing to the expected laughs / silences / movements of scenery etc . <p> As a general rule , the bigger the show , the more likely the earliest previews are to be cancelled as the scenery breaks down or the show is n't quite ready to be seen in public ! You 'll get a refund or chance to change your ticket to another performance ( if seats are available ) , but it may prove inconvenient to you of course . As the official opening night date gets closer the show is " frozen " - no more changes are allowed so that everybody can finally settle into the routine that the show will have for the opening night and beyond . Audiences at these later previews will see the finished show , and these performances are often the time that invited industry professionals see it . <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a real problem now that most bookings are done by telephone or online quoting a number . <p> For U.K. based people , the theatre will accept a written booking with a cheque or postal order . Sadly , many agencies do not allow you to do this and will not hold theatre tickets while they wait for your money . If they will not hold an option , then you are best off writing to the theatre itself and stating the seats and date you will be willing to accept . <p> For payment you could also send cash in banknote form . The theatres do not like getting cash in the mail , and the post office discourage it , but if it is not detectable to thieves then you could consider it . <p> Overseas visitors face similar problems , without the luxury of postal orders . For them the monkey suggests either an international money order or sending English ponds sterling banknotes . <p> Overseas visitors could also try local ticket agencies who will often be linked to an international company e.g. Ticketmaster . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter . They may even have tickets when London is sold out ! The downside is that they do charge a higher commission fee than usual . Considering the cost of exchanging money though , you may still find it a reasonable option . <p> Do London Theatres take the " Euro " currency ? No , not at the moment . The monkey will monitor the situation as it changes . <p> At the moment , only the TKTS Official Half Price Ticket Booth in Leicester Square takes Euros . The only other way to buy other tickets in Euros is to use a ticket agency in a Euro using country before you arrive in London . <p> What are " Day Seats " and what does " Personal Callers at the Box Office " mean ? " Day Seats " are tickets , often the front row of the stalls , kept for sale direct from the theatre box office counter on the day of performance to those who visit the theatre personally to buy them . Where shows offer them , " Day Seats " ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them should go direct to the theatre box office counter on the day of the show . Unlike Broadway 's " Rush " seats there is no ballot system . The tickets go on sale when the box office opens ( usually at 10am ) on a " first in line gets the most central seat " basis , and when they are gone , they are gone . For this reason , the line can form much earlier on popular shows at busy performances . Tickets may be limited to 1 or 2 per person , and take both credit cards and cash , as the box office may require one or the other . To beat the touts / scalpers , you may be asked to pay by credit card at the time , be given a receipt , then have to call back and exchange the receipt for actual tickets just before the show , by producing the same credit card used earlier . <p> I 'm larger than average , can you help on locating suitable seats ? A page of advice is available by clicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audio-described performances ? www.vocaleyes.co.uk The website of the audio description service available for some shows . <p> Where can I find more information that would help a disabled audience member generally ? www.artsline.org.uk offers Disabled Theatre visitor information researched from recent site visits , and also offers access information on other London tourist attractions too . <p> The Society of London Theatre website **31;853;TOOLONG also has a comprehensive listing , together with an opportunity to download the " Access Guide to London 's Theatres " book in PDF format . <p> Once when this monkeys ' uncle was a monkeys ' great-grandson , the term Dress Circle meant just that - full Evening Dress for all seated there , or else . Now dress is almost always informal - think " what would I wear to dine in a favourite local restaurant " - and there you will have the maximum folk usually rise to when attending the theatre . <p> Theatremonkeys can get away with jeans , sweatshirts and trainers at all performances except first nights and the first Saturday evening of a new show when a sober lounge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list . In general , suits , jackets , slacks or casual wear are acceptable for men at almost all times - casual especially during the afternoons . Suits really are only compulsory at openings , but are frequently seen on weekend evenings . <p> Monkeyesses as usual have a sartorial minefield to negotiate . Dress for comfort and to embarrass any hairy companion to look good for you . As for theatremonkeys , casual is fine at most performances , dresses , slacks , jeans and sweatshirts all acceptable . First nights require a smart but comfortable evening attire , not elaborate unless you are a celebrity though ! Weekend evenings too can be a bit dressier than a weekday . <p> On a Saturday evening , denim is not really appropriate for either gender if one is sitting in the Stalls or Dress Circle . The monkey does not know why , but finds it to be so , based on observation ! <p> One tip though , if sitting anywhere but the Stalls , monkeyesses should consider skirt length carefully . Your knees will often be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeyesse of the theatremonkey site 's acquaintance wore a microskirt and spent the performance in mortal terror of offering a view to the gentleman in front which he had n't reckoned on . This is passed on purely for information . But Theatremonkey thinks it is worth knowing . <p> In general London nights are cool , even in summer . It is worth remembering a warm garment if you have a long journey home after the evening performance as temperatures will have plummeted while you enjoyed the show . This tip also beats an over enthusiastic air conditioning system too . <p> But what about Pop Concerts ? For pop concerts , dress is almost always casual - plenty of denim in evidence at Wembley and Earls Court . You may want to wear thin layers as it can get fairly hot in these places . <p> The Royal Albert Hall ? The Royal Albert Hall always indicates on tickets if the event requires more formal attire . Otherwise , for pop concerts aimed at younger audiences the dress is often denim and other casual wear . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , and events like popular classical concerts and popular opera , dress is smart / casual . Denim is rarer unless in the " cheaper seats " of the venue , and the thinking is dress as for a casual " evening out at the local restaurant " - i.e. a little smarter but not " ambassador 's luncheon " formal . A comfortable equivalent of your everyday office attire is the level . <p> Other Classical Music Concerts and venues ? For most classical concerts , dress is almost always the same as for theatres - comfort as much as elegance . A recital by a famous musician will merit the " evening out at the local restaurant " again , and the Wigmore Hall tends not to see much denim , but that 's as far as it goes . <p> Actors currently performing can be reached by addressing letters " c/o Stage Door " at the theatre addresses the monkey lists for each show . <p> I want to be in Showbiz : <p> Remember : when looking for a job , do not agree to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices and public places .

Most shows now have a particular charity that they support and limit free tickets / goods to that exclusively . The same is true of many production companies - simply because there is no way any of them could give away anything to everyone who asks , without going out of business themselves ! One major chain of theatres , for example , limits itself to just two tickets per month - and those are mostly to charities with whom it has historic links . <p> The only way to seek donations , alas , is to just keep writing . The books " Contacts " and " The Original British Theatre Directory " ( both add the current year in the title if you are searching online ) list addresses of all major production companies , venues and marketing organisations , and approaching them is the only way . <p> Should any theatrical organisation have items it IS willing to donate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deserving causes , of course ... <p> Tourist queries : <p> What else is there to do in London ?

Agencies are independent companies who work with theatres to sell tickets on their behalf . The reason is that theatres can only reach so many clients at a time , and agencies often have their own special market - like corporate or incoming tourists . Agencies were also historically ( and indeed for weekend performances still ) made to pay for tickets in advance thus taking the financial risk of unsold seats from the producer 's bank balance to their own . Their profits now come from either adding their own service fee to the ticket price or from a commission paid on sales by the theatre producer .

Sites like the fictional " **26;1021;TOOLONG " are owned by agents - either STAR members , STAR sub-agents or even touts / scalpers . Whoever , they are NOT the box office website and you 'll pay more than you would via the official site . Theatremonkey advises strongly that you check exactly who you are booking through . On its listings pages , the monkey always shows the official sites first , followed by legitimate agents .

The Stalls is always the largest block of seats with the most rows in it .

Most agents issue their own tickets either computerised or on hand-written pre-printed vouchers which have spaces for date , seat numbers and theatre to be filled in , above a bold printed seating area word e.g. Stalls or Dress Circle etc . If they have been given actual tickets from the theatre , the name or initials of the agency will appear on the ticket , usually near the bottom of it . <p> A compliment slip or A4 headed notepaper leaf is NOT recognised to be a ticket !

If in doubt , use these genuine stores . <p> Really bad signs include handwritten notices offering tickets to major sporting events like " Wimbledon " and the World Cup finals . Such special tickets would not normally be traded on the street - indeed in Britain it is illegal to re-sell most football match tickets . Signs promising " Half Price Tickets " should be ignored too , unless the agent can prove S.T.A.R membership . <p> A good agency will also offer you a single seat .

We booked one show at a ticket office in Leicester Square ( The middle booth of three within a few yards of each other ) and got four tickets for ' Mamma Mia ' at the Prince Edward Theatre . <p> We did n't know that the " Grand Circle " was , in reality , the Upper Circle and the man in the booth certainly did n't tell us .

So much so that I decided to leave the theatre at the intermission but only stayed because I did n't want to spoil the evening for the other three any more than it had been already spoiled . <p> Stupid ? - yes we were . Gullible ? - yes . But we are not regular theatregoers and , sadly , I still tend to trust people . It was bad enough being ripped off ( we checked with a large number of people at the theatre and found that they had all paid face value for the tickets ) but a very rare evenings enjoyment was totally spoiled .

Not having seen the official plan I took a guess at which prices referred to which section ( not knowing the bands were also wrong at the time ) and got it wrong . This was because on the ATG site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you had to enter the price you wished to pay and only available seats at that price were then shown . Having planned to pay 45 from that misleading online guide I took a guess I would need to pay 55 to avoid the balcony when I saw the pricing had changed , not realising that this severely limited my choice of seats . We were only offered limited legroom ones which I had to decline , being six feet tall . <p> We gave up disappointed , but I thought there was no harm staying in the Nimax queue where I was further back . Eventually ATG were sold out so it seemed pointless ... but I had nothing to lose by staying in the queue , just out of interest , if not desperation given my daughter 's obvious disappointment ! ( In fact I had gone to buy the book for her to try to make up for it ! ) <p> So I was amazed to find there were still seats available when several hours later I got to the front of the Nimax queue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it seemed there were only single ( although Nimax did n't make this clear , only confusingly failing to let you add seats to the basket ) or limited legroom seats available at the 55 price band . <p> So what does one do ? Budgets are tight and the seats expensive enough as it is ; but what else can you do when you have been knocked back and stood in a queue for hours , with no further hope of getting back there ever again ! I did what any father would do , and took one stab at seats at a higher price ... 65 . Bingo ! <p> It was only afterwards when I eventually found a full pricing plan that I realised why my original choices had all failed - because there were so few 55 seats , and mainly limited leg room ones , to start with ! And this is where the Nimax site , despite being so much slower , was much better . I mention it because you referred to not being able to choose your seat . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be available ( although it would have been better to ask you the number of seats first ) in all the bands and theatre sections helping you to make a much more informed choice than ATG . Of course , the wider choice and option to view all of the alternatives may have been why Nimax was so much slower though . <p> So that 's how I ended up spending 80 more than I had planned , when I thought I would be able to buy tickets for ( what to me anyway is ) a pricey 45 each . I am very pleased with the seats though , although I have just noticed a theatremonkey comment warning anyone over 5 ' 10 " , I THINK in relation to ALL the seats in the theatre ?

Just because it is in script rather than manuscript form does n't  mean that it differs in any way .

By the end of the second half of the second play ( yes , its that long ) a " Doctor Who " level of conversation emerges that either you will speak or not . If not , you could regret the previous hours . <p> Its also VITAL that you see the shows in the correct order . Do n't  do otherwise . <p> Some of this duo really is extremely nifty rising to grand on occasion ; but , particularly in the first play , some of the magic can seem either crude or plain dull the " table-hopping close-up magician " that you wish would take his simple tricks elsewhere so you can get on with your meal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first play , too . For the monkey , Part Two , Act 1 was the exciting zenith , from around 30 minutes in .

Esther Smith stood out , with Sandy McDade , Anthony Boyle and Paul Thornley also making the very most of their characters ( no names , to #keepthesecrets ) . <p> In short , for regular theatregoers , this show breaks no new ground . " The Curious Incident of the Dog In The Night Time " attempts similar work , far more stylishly , and there really is n't anything to see that has n't  been done on a stage before .

That 's down to the fact it was Stellas experience with the " Group Theater " in the early 1930s which spawned the Adler Method , Lee Strasbergs Method and a host of other Stanislavski-style approaches which are all practised today . <p> The lady herself was , more or less , a living history of the theatre .

Yet that is n't the surprise ... <p> ... her political career is even more startling . A skirmish with Communism , narrowly avoiding indictment but making the " blacklist , " was n't all . This woman was prepared not only to speak out about the Holocaust while it happened ( and was initially ignored by much of the USA ) , but was pro-Zionist enough to actually do something extraordinary to help the rebel army there .

Oh , and for a British reader like the monkey , there 's another small snigger over the " Lions Restaurant " of post-war London . Its " Lyons Corner House " of course . Hopefully a detail corrected in a later edition . <p> Simply , this is an important work as it collates and distils umpteen disjointed accounts and miscellaneous notes about a person who shaped an entire culture into a single volume .

No , this is based on Jos blog ( hence the pseudonym ) a daily record of just how a musical theatre actress survives when she ca n't be on stage . <p> Each blog entry is classified as either a " Confession " or an " Audition File .

They add up to finally " cracking the code " and landing a job ; at which point the endless accounts suddenly make sense as the harshest of learning curves . <p> Adding to the enjoyment is the brilliant device of occasional " Questions " she 's asked , and the " Answer " she gives ... plus the " Honest Answer " bitingly funny , with a just tinge of vicious melancholy . Andy Peters also provides some brilliant cartoons , bringing Jos hopeful tales to amusing visual life . <p> Perhaps a little more editing might have helped put some of the stories into clearer order she passes her driving test near the end of the book , but talks of driving herself to auditions near the beginning . The odd theatrical term like " track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say that songs were " belted " rather than " pelted , " but these are minor quibbles . <p> What 's abundantly clear is that Jos life is very much typical of most musical theatre performers .

Surviving the deepest self-doubt created by constant rejection ; and the growing awareness that being that good is n't enough even brilliant can be mediocre compared to the next actress ; all seem almost inevitable in the career she chose , and will come as a surprisingly raw realisation for readers . <p> Thought provoking , and a superb reality-check for those who think musical theatre work really is as easy to break into as TV makes out .

Still , he does n't  then go on to note that you could n't , if you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , its more than sensible to conclude that , for those in financial difficulties , a visit to a local jewellers equipped with half a brick and a pair of tights is going to yield a more certain return and about the same jail sentence with none of the hassle or paperwork . <p> Happily , he finishes with the story of one woman going from an idea to worldwide success , based on simple faith in her material . For those similarly inspired , or who hope they might be , this book certainly shows you where to begin . Highly recommended . LONG ... <p> This is a big book . Big in scope , big in information , big on detail and most of all , big in personality . Quite possibly the most important book about theatre since " Cats , The Book of the Musical " ( West End Edition ) . If you want to work on the London stage , in film , television or even advertising haemorrhoid creams , its compulsory reading . <p> From impressing the casting director at audition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surviving a national tour , the hugely experienced and effusively inebriated West End Producer shares years of wisdom as he guides the performer with unsteady hand . <p> Most importantly he reminds all actors , whatever their experience , that there are both right and wrong ways to do absolutely everything . The importance of sharing gifts , stage space , talent ( and , on occasion , fluids ) are stressed . The vital importance of not sharing too much information , personal cash or the casting directors lifestyle even more so . <p> So comprehensive is this book , it even provides actors with a complete " how to plan your day " guide , both when in a regular run on stage or during rehearsal . In particular , the advice on preparation ( laying out your script to leap across the pages at the start of the day ) makes anything Stanislavsky has written look positively old-fashioned , if not totally redundant . <p> The casual non-performer is also rewarded with a rare insight into how producers view them , and indeed a moving final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise words on how ticket prices must be set to encourage them in future . Even better , vouchers allowing theatregoers to interact at close quarters with actors and even try a role for themselves are included at the back of the book and can be redeemed when the Producer gets his scheme is up and running . <p> In summary , any reader can follow these simple instructions to enjoy a long and successful career in the business he calls " show , " just so long as they remember to bring their own hobnobs . LONG ... <p> " Hey Producer " A CD . Catalogue number PM003 Available from Amazon.co.uk <p> You are a musical theatre composer with a trunkful of great show tunes ... but the world prefers the tried and tested. Danny Davies resolves the problem by releasing his ideas here on CD . <p> Appropriately , the disc kicks off with the attention grabbing cry of " Hey Producer " crazy theatrical exhibitionist Julie Atherton issuing the call . Her vocal gymnastics - running sweet ingTnue to vamp - makes her final threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy for her gay victim . <p> Later , from the same potential show " Living The Dream , " " I Need You Broadway , " gives Stephen Weller the opportunity explain just why performers like Julie Atherton and himself crave the energy of musical theatre . A show concept worth developing , feels the monkey . <p> Another potential show idea , a cycle about University old " Friends Reunited " occupies a further three tracks . First up is " Falling Rain , " with " Fall Into Heaven " and " This Dreams Not For You " appearing later . All three adequately capture the narcissism and opportunism of University life translated into adulthood , but perhaps yet require the fermentation of stage rehearsal - Laura Selwoods voice in particular might contribute well to the process . <p> Finally from the concepts bank , " Forgive Me , " is apparently a rock/ballad attempt to musicalise Count Draculas remorse . While ( as others have proven ) the subject is tricky theatrically ; the song itself , with Tom Parsons energy , is a pleasing contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We are also treated to a completed theatre work . " Face To Face , " Daviess first project , follows the relationship between Sir Frederick Treves and Joseph Merrick ( Victorian Englands Elephant Man ) . In " Twice The Man , " Merrick addresses the frailty of being alone , and his hopes for the potential of true friendship . A true stage musical piece , Peter Polycarpou demonstrates years of experience to land effortlessly a difficult theme . Immediately following it with " Picture This , " with Merrick as a medical lecture exhibit , heightens the impact . A twinkling melody and heartbreaking lyric image provide well judged contrast . <p> From the same show , " Whos The Greater Fool , " is of deceptive simplicity ; Gemma ODuffy tackling ( with some vocal discomfort ) twisted love suggesting a potential special moment in a live stage production . " Isnt It Strange , " another female character song , is sweetly performed by Kirsty Hailes . Powerful , some simplistic rhymes aside . Still with the same show , and penultimate track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling of a number from " Chess . " Appropriate as Shimi Goodman plays out an emotional endgame with beautifully judged orchestral accompaniment . <p> This album contains also three tracks that , as song-writers are wont to do , simply had to be written. " One More Night " might actually fit into the " Friends Reunited " score . Chris Thatcher and Alison Jear are as well matched vocally as the characters they play here . " Turn Around " gives David Berkovitch and Gemma ODuffy a second chance to shine in a track that might also strengthen the same score , perhaps . Last of these free numbers " Now You 're Near " could easily be a show tune too . Shona White fans will love it , while those who do n't  know her voice will be fans by the end of it . <p> Closing the disc is the gloriously catchy choral " Shine On Down . " Cut free from a record producers grasp , it became the anthem in 2011 of " Dress Circle , " Londons beloved showbiz shop that faced closure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a galaxy of musical theatre stars celebrate their ( and their audiences ) love of everything stage musical. <p> And that is really what this album is all about . Sharing all that is special in musical theatre creativity . From playing alone with songs and concepts , to finding the right collaborators to bring them to life , this is one mans inspirations presented in a rewarding , generous gesture to all fans of the genre . LONG ... <p> " Shona White : I 'll bring you a Song " A CD . Catalogue number VIB008 Available from Amazon.co.uk <p> Shona White is an established musical theatre actor with a loyal fanbase . This album brings her vocal storytelling skills to a wider public , with a voice that brings out the most elusive meaning in any song . <p> Opening with " Tell Me On A Sunday , " from the song-cycle of the same name , a mature approach is captivating , and contrasts beautifully with the next song , " As Long As Youre Mine , " a younger number recalling her time in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a searing honesty in every line . <p> That same passion reaches even greater heights during " I Close My Eyes And Count To Ten . " The disbelief at her good fortune is evident in every note and sustained to the very end . <p> Returning , mid-album , to a trio of theatre songs , " Easier " ( from In Touch ) begins by attempting a sharp contrast in its simplicity , a guitar and little else . As the number continues , the begging for some easier solution reveals suddenly just how complicated things are beneath the surface . Later , " Easy to Say " ( from " Over The Threshold " ) provides another take on the dilemma . <p> Following these , " I Want To Know " ( from RSVP ASAP ) is a fascinating take on the classic " I want a man " theme . Caught up in her fantasy , the upbeat pleasure taken in imagining the right person is brought to a stunned defeat in the final line . <p> " Nobodys Side , " ( from " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Given an angrier rendition than usual here , its interesting to judge whether the singer is angrier with herself or the world , as repeated listening will change your opinion each time . <p> Best of all is " I 'll Bring You A Song . " Yes , its about the wearing down of a singer on the road , but it sums up the whole album perfectly . This is the Lady who sings songs . Beautifully . Following it with the prayer-like " Ae Fond Kiss " underlines the person behind the performer theme rather well . <p> To finish , the wonderful Don Black lyric of " To Sir With Love " is given a new dimension , as a tribute to the perfect partner Shona has been searching for throughout the disc . A " bonus " How Bout A Dance simply confirms that the right person is everything to a singer who can express so much in song . <p> Here is an incredible recording voice that deserves to be heard by the widest possible audience . Well selected songs exploring an idea to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... <p> Forget " reality TV " documentaries . This CD is as close to a genuine " fly on the wall " experience about what goes on in a musical theatre actors mind ( as anybody would probably want to get ) ... Bawdy and explicit as only theatre humour can be , its certainly an after the watershed listen , in more ways than one . <p> Conceived as a mixture of songs , plus a few sketches based on real experiences of two friends-in-greasepaint , there 's enough material here for a brilliant Edinburgh cabaret evening ; and some outstanding comedy writing on display . <p> It all boils down to just two themes : love , well , sex really ; and the frustrations of trying to get acting work when everybody is just out to exploit or humiliate you - sometimes both . The whole album works best if the listener has a ) a pretty good working knowledge of theatre jargon and b ) a liking for their musical theatre numbers served up " twisted . " <p> Starting the disc as it means to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cops " is a prime example of when theatrical ballads go bad . " Combined with later " In Short " ( from " Edges " ) these are flows of outrageous vitriol on the subject of ending relationships . " Love Song " and " Sex " do little to build bridges either , while " Somebody Kill Me " from " Wedding Singer " is simply a suicidal rant invoking hilarity rather than sympathy . <p> Not helping , the solo alternative , " I 'm In Love " may well be picked up by Ann Summers for an advertising campaign and in-store atmosphere music . <p> There 's an upside , though , with several songs about ( admittedly slightly depraved ) happier times . " The Morning After You Do It " is an openly triumphant celebration ... of events probably better kept private . Continuing the disconcerting , " Sensitive Male Best Friend " is combination to worry the ladies , and " To Excess " a bald warning ... particularly if your name is Clare . Oh , and neither is likely to prove much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the album , " Lullaby , " also wo n't impress a jury . Neatly capturing the cynicism pervading the whole subject , its the filthiest but most searingly honest bedtime tune never sung to a child . Writer Stephen Lynch concocts simply the funniest number the monkey has heard in ages and you 'll be humming it ( subversively ) for hours . <p> Working the second theme , that of exploring the actors experience in depth , " I 'll Always be the understudy " will have anybody whose track is being coveted by that swing in the wings watching their backs for sure ( the monkey told you a knowledge of theatre terms is required ! ) . <p> Scattered among these songs are a few musical interjections , plus some hilarious / wince-inducingly familiar ( depending if you are an actor or not ) sketches by Chris and friend Mathew . The best is a cleverly constructed audition , complete with every stereotype that can be crammed behind a folding table in a sweaty hired rehearsal room . Almost as good are the verbatim records , sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploit Chris to the best of his abilities ... and almost succeeding . With agents ( and , in an early sketch ) friends like these , no wonder Chriss dreams of superstardom are still unfulfilled . <p> Still , we do get a superb rendering of " If You Were Gay " from " Avenue Q. " The show Chris was starring in at the time the CD was released , it features Jon Robyns and in my opinion surpasses for timing the original cast recording version . There 's also " Chips Lament " from " Spelling Bee , " again benefitting from immaculate comic delivery . Bonus track , sweetly done " Rainbow Connection " is final confirmation of the hope that strands come together in the end and that talent will triumph , despite advice from friends / agents / casting directors . <p> Oh , and to complete it , the quotes on the liner notes are worth reading too . A must as a gift for any musical theatre actor , adult musical theatre fan with a twisted sense of humour and any cynic who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . LONG ... <p> This is like having a cast producers can only dream of sit on your bookshelf , ready and willing to recite beautiful verse at your whim . <p> For those like the moneky who know little of the sonnets beyond comparing a loved one to a summers day , this disc is something of a revelation . <p> Its easy to see how they fit with the Bards stage works . 94 , recited by Polly Frame is like something from the Scottish Play , 154 a Directors Cut DVD Extra from " A Midsummer Nights Dream , " for example . <p> Even clearer is the modern day relevance of it all , as a dishevelled Stephen Fry demonstrates that 130 was a precursor to Les Dawson and all other irreverent partner jokes ; while 50 , in the hands of Simon Callow , is close to " Fifty Shades of Grey . " <p> Theres wisdom : 70 being as good as " The Merchant of Venice " for legal advice , 29 and 30 on the importance of reputation , 148 cautioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about love . From the lachrymose 145s touching outpouring from Jo Stone-Fewings , to happier commentary 91 is worth studying as a declaration par excellence . <p> One principal enjoyment is that these pieces are not just delivered by actors . Best of all is Cicely Berry , Director of Voice and Text with the Royal Shakespeare Company . Her " Thexpense of spirit is a waste of shame " should be studied closely by anybody taking to the stage , whether with Shakespearian or modern text . <p> There 's regional UK accents galore , with a fiery Niamh McGrady , mellow Tunji Kasim and of course notable David Tennant among them . From the USA , Kim Cattrall ( apparently originally from Liverpool ) and James Shapiro have accents which ( the monkey seems to recall ) may be even more authentic with the period than the measured perfection of Patrick Stewart or Dominic West . <p> Also interesting is the way in which each sonnet is delivered . The careful voice coach already mentioned , the dramatic acting of Fiona Shaw and the other stage folk or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background of the speaker , each is delivered against a varied setting , some modern , some ancient , others simply artistic , which add visual colour to the words . <p> Of course , with 154 sonnets to film , there 's the odd one which might benefitted from different delivery , but the overall standard is remarkably high . The only other criticism the monkey might make is in the navigation of the disc . While the menus allow access by sonnet or author , its DVD players would n't then allow the rest to play out in sequence from any single point . This means either watching the disc in a single viewing ( you 'll be tempted ) or being prepared to juggle menus after each reading . After contacting the production company , I learned that I had been sent a very early copy of the DVD , and that this fault has now been corrected . They sent me a corrected version ( no charge , thank you ! ) and indeed you can now watch in sequence from any point - a joy for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DVD , and a message on the disc itself direct viewers to an " app " that promises enhanced features like notes from the Arden Shakespeare , a facsimile of the original publication , and a commentary by Don Paterson . While no doubt fascinating , this DVD in itself will satisfy many fans - and win others - of these amazing lines . LONG ... <p> " Mark Evans : The Journey Home " A CD . Catalogue number B0083PP1RQ Available from Amazon.co.uk <p> At just 26 , Mark Evans has a thriving musical theatre career ( plus a brush with the Eurovision Song Contest UK heats ) already to his credit . Condensing that down to 14 tracks for his first album is quite a task , one he manages with some aplomb . A low-key start " Comin Home " is repeated later as a bonus track in its original Welsh . The Welsh original makes a strong case for that language being the most musical in the world . <p> Following the English version of " Comin Home , " " Unchained Melody " unites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a duet that records their on-stage chemistry for posterity . Voices often match and blend in duets , but few are like dancers , following and soaring together as here . <p> " Reach the Sky , " a Bobby Cronin number , builds slowly before suddenly revealing a bright optimism . Continuing the upbeat theme , " Brand New You " from Jason Robert Brown musical " 13 " is given an adult interpretation , turning a duet intended for two teenagers into , first , a rather seductive production number and ( as a later bonus track ) an acoustic guitar driven reflective piece . The former is the more successful , as it brings a new dimension to the song ; though the second is a fun experiment . <p> Broadway composer Craig Carnelias " Flight " may not be well known outside the theatre community , but Evans may rectify that by finding an ethereal quality to the music - making the listener wish to explore the composers other works . <p> By contrast , " Alive " is a rock duet with Ashleigh Gray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are having is infectious and the sound mix perfect . <p> The spooky " In Her Eyes " is another well-judged move , allowing the singer to do something with an equally strong beat but slower rhythm , proving his vocal range . <p> Slowing further " Until Then " is a gentle exposure to composer Scott Allan . A sleepy rendition belies a song with strong inner emotions . <p> A Josh Groban song , " To Where You Are " appeared on Grobans debut album in 2001 , and is a sound choice for this debut album too . Given a simple rendition , its a vocal pitched perfectly for the listeners relaxation . <p> Singing his own lyric , " Keep On Believing " is an anthem to a performers work , something to aspire to in the audition line . Its also an indicator that Mark Evans has some writing talent to match his theatrical abilities . <p> The main album finishes on " The Journey Home . " ( from musical Bombay Dreams ) . Once more , a flavour of Wales influences the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely , its the perfect way to finish the album ; the haunting delivery of the lines " The Journey Home " make for a memorable exit . <p> With a final mention to the third bonus track , " AdreN Ol " for another reminder that Wales manufactures some of Great Britains finest music , its safe to say that Mark Evans is another fine export , and that this album will delight current fans and win him some new ones . LONG ... <p> A copy of this DVD should be placed alongside the Gideon Bible in every hotel room within ten miles of Stratford Upon Avon . For this inspired collaboration by actor Simon Callow and Shakespeare expert Jonathan Bate will instantly and entertainingly provide every ounce of background information any visitor could require ; greatly enhancing their visit with wonderful insights into the subject 's world . <p> A cardboard crown , a wooden sword , a globe , four wooden school chairs and a square of light are all Simon Callow needs to weave ninety minutes of theatrical magic . <p> This is the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most famous characters illustrate their creator 's emotions as we progress through his seven ages ' of life ( itself a concept in his " As You Like It " ) . <p> Alongside the play extracts , own modern everyday language ( peppered with topical references - one to a property portfolio ' causing particular amusement among the on screen audience ) keep the production accessible and the whole moving at smart pace . <p> It 's always a pleasure to hear Shakespeare spoken by the very best actors , but here the particular joy is having those beautiful words set in context against each period of the author 's life . <p> The highest highlights of the enthralling ninety minutes are an hilarious school room ' sequence as the young Snail learns to play with Latin words and a one-man balcony scene ' as he learns to play with girls ... Both are performed with the gentlest touch , and a command of the stage that rather make you glad this is a DVD - so that you can rewind and savour the scenes again and again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the audience reaction and even a few vocal hesitations left in . If there is a single flaw , it is that the interval ' is not defined sufficient to make the sublime re-entry ' line sing for the home viewer quite as amusingly as it could . The fact that this single flaw is noticeable can be taken , of course , as an indicator of just what a singularly outstanding release this disc is . <p> Twenty minutes of extras - a short but fascinating insight into the creative process of this piece , plus three sonnets performed by Callow prolong the enjoyment . <p> The monkey can only end by saying that this is the perfect souvenir for those who have seen the play live , ' a must have ' purchase for any theatre lover and the perfect introduction to England 's most famous writer for absolutely everybody . <p> This is truly the Scottish play . Filmed mostly in Scotland , with Scottish accents throughout , there 's no doubt at all that this is a rare opportunity to see " Macbeth " in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glorious . Panoramas of desolate moorland , grey and cold , moving to oranges and reds as the heat rises and flames consume all . Adam Arkapaws cinematography captures it all , and the interior sets , particularly Fiona Crombies castle and church are impressive , particularly populated with Jacqueline Durrans costume designs . <p> Michael Fassbender in the title role , and Marion Cotillard as his wife make a convincing couple . His gruffness with her French vulnerability and determination are perfect casting . The rawness of their plotting always a physical encounter gives an unusual edge , while the soliloquies are always delivered with an intimacy rarely captured on film . In this , Cotillard admits being assisted by Justin Kurzels directorial choices , including giving her a child to play to at one crucial point . <p> There 's an impressive David Thewlis as Duncan , while Sean Harris finds in Macduff a vengeful grief which manages not to overwhelm but give motivation to his later actions . <p> The only irritant is in the script adaptation . Famous lines go missing , and there are gaps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver lines to this standard , it can be distracting to find the " heath " replaced by " battlefield " and a dagger not " seen still . " <p> Full marks to the score , though , with a composition for the children something of a highlight other stage directors may wish to consider . <p> A few strong scenes aside ( this version does not spare gore nor sex ) , it is certainly better than most film versions of the play as an introduction to it . Several scenes may well capture , particularly in Scotland , the minds of those studying the work for higher school examinations . <p> For the average Shakespeare fan , there are distinct moments of " yes , that 's how I imagined it to be , " and several of " they got the right actor , there " too . <p> A very decent introduction to the Bard , and well worth watching not just for the experts . LONG ... <p> " The Music Box " A CD . Catalogue number ESC0005 Available from Amazon.co.uk <p> First up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Escape . " A quartet that the author claims " works out of context , " the monkey felt that if orchestrated with a pop sound , hed be right . As it stands , the singers wring the very most from the opening line and its yearning theme . Later , two further songs from this show , solos by Katie Rowley Jones and Sarah Earnshaw underline that this is the musical Dicks should devote more attention to . A little tuning , of the type that happens naturally in rehearsal rooms , could produce a very exciting stage work . <p> From " A Million Grains of Sand , " another of his musicals , " Please Do n't  Go " is probably how preceding track " Who Have I Become ? " would work once tidied for the stage . Focussed both in lyric and performance , it captivated the monkey as does later paired track " Without Him / We Are Here " also taken from the second act of that show . <p> Still on a stage theme , combining Shakespearian words with music is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case I ? " is interesting . " Crimson Droplets " - from yet another attempt to musicalise the " Jack The Ripper " story though , is very much a " work in progress " ( as the writer attests ) . Theatre star Rebecca Lock lives up to her billing , dealing effectively with a difficult vocal . As a show number , though , it will no doubt be revised before staging to remove a tendency to sing what the audience can already see and sharpen the original purpose of providing an interior monologue moment . Proving an aptitude for single numbers , " When Will I know Your Name ? " is the most instantly arresting on the disc . <p> Everybody has wondered about a person they 've seen on the train and admired from afar . Gareth Peter Dicks manages to put that universal thought into perfectly set words and music and singer Liam Tamne expresses them well enough to use as a real chat-up line , perhaps . <p> " More " is a change of pace . Inspired by " You Tube " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding ballads . Those seeking a simple break will enjoy it , others may skip the track for later , more sophisticated fare . <p> Among those , the authors " Muse " tribute " No Turning Back " proves that he can write a bass heavy number as well as anyone , while ( maybe over-complex ) country number " Simple Words " indicates further versatility . <p> Second Liam on this disc , Liam Doyle , also delivers an incredibly dark " Run With Me . " Intended to stand alone , this very theatrical sounding track might oddly work in a musical about " Jack The Ripper . " <p> Taking the bloodletting theme a little further , instrumental " The Long Journey Home " ( from which the author removed the word , rightly assuming the music speaks for itself ) has a little of Sondheims " Joanna " from " Sweeney Todd " theme in its violin ; no bad thing , perhaps , in a lyrical piece about age and remembering . <p> Contrasting with such darkness , " Live In Dreams " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Dempsey in mind . Its easy to see why , as a song about light and escape is given the power it needs - with " Les Mis " -like strings attached . <p> As the album closes , a charmingly balletic instrumental harking back to the " Music Box " overture , precedes a remix of musical " Bluebirds " " Goodnight Dear Soldiers . " Abi Finleys already moving vocal is given extra depth with a string section added , while Finley herself stakes further claim to being potential musical theatre leading lady material . Stick around after this for a further small treat , too . <p> As an concept , the author proposes that a Music Box can be a special object linking generations and stories . As this CD proves , its also be a highly appropriate title for a disc reviewing an already varied and successful composing career . LONG ... <p> Like most of the UK public , the monkey first noticed Helena Blackman when she came second in the very first cast-a-show-by-TV programme , " How Do You Solve A Problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has lead to a range of roles in great musicals by composers including Hammerstein and Sondheim . Now , some of her favourites by the former ( her personal inspiration ) are captured on this intriguing debut album . <p> The best numbers are those in which her very obvious ability as a musical character actor shines . Early in the CD , her Nellie Forbush should have a word with her Julie Jordan . Washing that Man Right Outta My Hair " is probably the perfect antidote to the wonderfully forlorn and resigned New England dreamers " What 's The Use of Wondrin " thoughts . Positioning these two tracks early on and together is a clever move , highlighting the dramatic range of Helena Blackmans voice . <p> " It Might As Well Be Spring , " confirms Ms Blackmans character creating abilities . Her take on this lesser known " State Fair " number feels fresh and unique , leading well into the middle section of the recording . <p> A rather relaxed " If I Loved You " blends into " Something Wonderful , " a spine-tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her two " King and I " selections . " I Have Dreamed " ( duet with Jonathan Ansell ) seems a little too quick , without the same time to develop a rapport that she gets later with Daniel Boys ( another " TV casting " find ) in " People Will Say Were in Love . " This time , we know exactly who call the shots in her relationshipstread carefully , gentlemen . <p> Between these two , " Some Enchanted Evening , " and " Love Look Away " ( like the earlier " If I Loved You " and " I Have Confidence " ) seem more cabaret in rendition . Not a criticism ; its just noticeable that Helena sounding relaxed just is n't the same as Helena animating a character. Rather suggesting scope for a separate solo Lounge career beside her show one , really . <p> " The Gentleman Is A Dope " seemingly confirms this theory , being a song that she addresses in both forms with strong character driven comedy , and adding a definite penultimate number in a solo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encore . <p> This is provided by the curious choice of " Climb Every Mountain " as a finale . Its done well enough , but it is a song sung by a very mature nun . Sensibly , Ms Blackman is obviously lining up work for a few decades ahead when The Sound Of Music is revived and she can take the role to perfection , undoubtedly . <p> Before that day , though , Helena Blackman does ( as she should do ) , " Enjoy Being a Girl " here , as much as sharing with us her enjoyment of being a musical theatre performer . As her experience broadens , and before deciding she is ready for the wimple and habit , there are obviously some wonderful years ahead . The monkey hopes it may also result , too , in another album as interesting as this one . LONG ... <p> What better way to celebrate the start of a prestigious tour playing " The Phantom Of The Opera " nationwide ( not to mention two concerts of your own ) , than to release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical theatre star , some song choices seem compulsory . Still , this " Music Of The Night , " threatens to eclipse the Michael Crawford original . Even braver , following it with " Til I Hear You Sing " from sequel " Love Never Dies " makes the listener wonder at what he would have brought to that role too . The answer may be found in an " All I Ask Of You " that clearly bewitches his Christine , Natasha Marsh . <p> Still with musical theatre staples , " Being Alive " moves from slightly stretched into a surprisingly effective begging treatment , while " Somewhere " sparkles both vocally and orchestrally , as a young man sets out his vision to moving effect . Often overdone " This Is The Moment " does n't  dwell on that key-change as lesser versions do - even if this reviewer still finds its continued popularity inexplicable . More successful , bonus track " Bring Him Home " refreshes the singers claim on another leading role . <p> Demonstrating more imagination , there 's a brace of numbers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Bryn Terfel on " I Do n't  Remember You / Sometimes A Day Goes By " from revue " As The World Goes Round . " A thrilling exploration of love in a surprising duet . Then follows " Down To The Sea " - an interesting introduction to " Kristina , " suggesting a musical worth discovering . <p> Away from the theatrical , other choices on the CD are as unexpected as the small gift after track 14 . First is 1947 Eden Ahbez creation " Nature Boy , " which feels as dreamlike as any musical theatre piece . A surprisingly relaxed opening number , its craftily positioned before a macho rendition of " Thunderball . " Owen-Jones finds the story in this song , while the Welsh Session Orchestra ( who accompany him throughout the album ) produce a smart " Bond " sound for him . <p> Later , the Ham / Evans number " Without You " proves that musical theatre does n't  have a monopoly on setting loss to song , but that a musical theatre performer can find an extra dimension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My Life " and bonus number " Hallelujah . " The first bookends perfectly the opening track with another , slightly less laid-back , wishful performance ; the second revitalises a much covered song with a contemplative interpretation . <p> Its sadly rare in musical theatre for those who take over a role created by another performer to have their ideas recorded . Rarer still is a musical theatre artist who can bring those skills to other genres . John Owen Jones achieves both here , and his new disc should delight old fans and win new ones . LONG ... <p> Probably best known for her spell as " Glinda " in the London production of " Wicked , " Louise Dearman has an equal passion for belting out dramatic pop numbers . Her first solo album , " Here Comes The Sun " collects some of her favourites , and ahead of the albums release on 7th May 2012 her PR company shared 5 of the 10 tracks with the monkey . <p> First up is the title number from the album . One of George Harrisons best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully controlling the emotion until , as the " ice is slowly melting , " the heat of her feelings become clear . <p> A Skin / Skunk Anansie song , " Sqaunder " follows . In sharp contrast to the awakenings of " Here Comes The Sun , " this is about the end of a relationship . Caught between anger and reproach , the skills of a musical theatre performer turn introspective rage into vivid conversation . <p> More theatrical experience is demonstrated by both Louise Dearman and duet partner Steve Balsamo as they create a vocal ballet from Cyndi Laupers ever-poetic " Time After Time . " A girl moving to the rhythm of memories is joined at the bridge by a beautifully judged male voice , lending something new the immediacy of hope , perhaps to her thoughts , building to a satisfyingly tender finish . <p> " Gravity " follows , and couldnt be further from the previous track .

The confusion between a need for guidance and defiance drives this final number and , since we do n't  really know which will win , its a suitable exit for a performer who knows how to make an impact when leaving the stage . <p> These well-chosen tracks explore the complex realities of love through complex lyrics , illuminated with great effect by an impressive performer on her debut album . LONG ... <p> If Ken Mandelbaum can be said to have written the " Old Testament " of Broadway Flop musical books with " Not Since Carrie " , then Peter Filichia 's " Broadway Musicals : The Biggest Hit &amp; The Biggest Flop Of The Season " could be regarded as the " New . " The former work begins at 1950 , taking a general sweep through 40 years of Broadway history . Filichia takes 1959 as his starting point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worst of the season . Using ( and occasionally breaking ) his own introductory rules of engagement ' his aim is as much to interpret events as provide an historical record , making this new gospel a joy . <p> It is always a pleasure to be in the company of an expert who loves his subject . Better still , his is a gossipy and highly readable style . With few exceptions , it 's clear that he has spent hours zinging through the year 's offerings to alighting on one particular show for praise or derision . <p> Other reviewers have noted occasional inaccuracies in the book which , as the monkey knows from experience , is almost unavoidable - even the best writers and editors mislay material and miss details . His 1986 page asserts " Merlin " as the flop of 1983 , though he earlier declared " Dance A Little Closer " as the failure of that year ; and it seems lazy not bend the rules once more to find a hit for 88/89 . Luckily , such minor slips never detract from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of debate the author is willing to indulge in . For example , despite the record books asserting " Carrie " as Broadway 's biggest disaster ( and , just for the record , it played Stratford Upon Avon , not London , before Broadway ) , Filichia makes a convincing case for " Chess " to take the crown for that year . He 's also not above iconoclasm with the debunking of the " The Producers " myth as the greatest musical comedy of all time . Like millions of others , the monkey too loved the show passionately on first viewing ... but later realised it was a true one off ' vehicle dependent on star power . <p> Decently presented using quality paper , amusing photographs of the author 's own used ticket stubs divide the chapters ( try spotting one he paid for rather than had free - the monkey could n't ! ) . As both reference work and entertainment , this is a must buy ' for anybody with an interest in musical theatre . <p> Speckulation Entertainment has in recent years built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent . This disc represents a peak in that ideal . Not only does it feature some of their usual repertory company of accomplished West End talent , but the composer was discovered by them via a 2007 national Musical Theatre writing competition . <p> Michael Bruces work has already been heard in concert form on the London stage , and will next ( at the time of writing ) appear accompanying David Tennant and Catherine Tate in " Much Ado About Nothing " at Wyndhams Theatre in Summer 2011 . Before that , this CD takes an entertaining sweep through his varied song styles . " Do n't  Wan na Leave You Now " opens the recording with a surprisingly downbeat first verse leading to an unexpected haunting middle section . " Even Then , " with a heartfelt vocal by Paul Spicer then continues the established yearning theme . <p> Track 3 , " I Want A Man " had the monkey reaching for the listings to check whose smooth sweet voice started the song . Sarah Lark kicks off a vaudeville style duet in fine style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ideal partner . More yearning , but with a witty upbeat lyric . <p> The tempo slows again for Charlotte Wakefields stage ballad style " Someplace Beyond the Moon . " Who knows what went on in the show before she sings it but shell no doubt have the ushers selling out of Kleenex before she 's done . <p> Mark Evans follows with a bluesy click along " Money Honey " moving from theatre stage to smoky American bar setting in the listeners mind . Masculine enough for the ladies of track 3 , perhaps ? Well placed directly afterwards , Emily Tierneys Continental carries the smoky atmosphere a few thousand miles East of the previous track . Another obviously stage number , this would fit well into any evening seeking an alternative to the classic Kander and Ebb Cabaret numbers . Completing the mid-list travelling trio , Away is a forceful desire for emotional release , given power treatment by Alex Jessop . <p> Jessie Buckley then calms things with a perfectly controlled Its Not Gon na Rain. Obviously learning from her time in Sondheims " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way beautifully through a fragile construct , revealing hidden depths in each line . Still in Sondheim mode , " The Musical Theatre Song " is Bruces tribute to " Not Getting Married " from " Company . " Anna-Jane Casey turns in her usual character comedy performance to get the most from a well thought out list number . Ashleigh Gray then changes the discs gear yet again with " My Kind of World . " Sondheim style to begin with , mixing with something contemporary to create a fresh yet timeless ballad . <p> Following this is " Portrait Of A Princess . " No Speckulation Entertainment CD is complete without insanely talented ( or talentedly insane ? ) Julie Atherton providing a lunatic treatment of a mad fun number .. Even better , this superb , intelligent parody has , for those with online access ( and who do n't  mind the odd expletive ) , a glorious Technicolor Disney ( but NOT for kids ) video accompaniment at **27;1348;TOOLONG . You may never look at Snow White in the same way again <p> Looking Back is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theatre star duet . This time , Michael Bruce provides him and Alexia Khadime with a relationship dissection , reaching a wistful , quietly understated conclusion . <p> It is left to Michael Xavier to close the CD with another soft ballad , the titular " Unwritten Song . " Unusually placed after another introspective number , the reason becomes obvious as it draws together the albums theme of exploring loves dimensions . The perfect end to a compelling showcase of an exceptionally talented composers work , given full value by an equally talented team of artists and producers .

Omnibus Press 19.95 ISBN-10 : 1849386617 or 978-1849386616 Available from Amazon.co.uk <p> " Who can say where he may hide ? " To paraphrase a lyric from his most famous musical . Apt , because the authors have to admit on practically every page that a story may or may not have happened , that many pieces of this troubled and splintered life are missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing anybody really agrees on was that they loved this difficult creative genius. <p> Most readers will instantly know that Lionel Bart wrote " Oliver ! " Those of a certain age will be able to hum the cleaned up version of " Fings Ai n't  What They Used To Be " and might even know that it came from one of the most revolutionary experimental theatre productions of its era . Some may also remember the old pianist with the toothless kiddie in an " Abbey National " commercial . A few musical theatre fans will also speak of " Blitz ! " " Maggie May " and " Lock Up Your Daughters " with affection , simultaneously shuddering at " Twang ! ! " <p> The pub quiz bore will know all about Barts connections to Tommy Steele and Cliff Richard among a host of other 1960s stars . Its really in the collation of these connections that this biography scores . Alma Cogan , Judy Garland , Kenneth Williams just a few of the myriad names who drifted into and out of Lionels circle , supported by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography does a reasonable job of recording the occurrence of an interaction , noting where possible those for whom he wrote songs , gave advice or simply walked into a glittering premiere . Of his non-celebrity friends , staff and family , there 's clearly been some long conversations sifted to provide a few insights into how a man can be a millionaire one moment , at the height of his creative powers , then lose everything including health and home in a few short years . <p> Fing is there 's little beyond anecdotal evidence left . A fairly short book is padded with scene setting period descriptions and the odd half-decent unconnected one-liner , because there simply is n't much else recorded as fact . Unlike most biographies which can verify stories of meetings and commentate on their significance to weave an integrated career tapestry , here the threads are tangled ; and most surround holes that a lack of records and departed characters can not fill . <p> Consequently , this is a slightly shaky chronology of highs and lows , with stories held together by the factual evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelling errors , Bart emerges as more than just the " pity case " beloved of tabloids on a slow news day. We now have a reference work that should prove helpful to anybody researching the period , its music and greatest characters . LONG ... <p> Alan Strachan is a WRITER . The monkey uses the capital letters deliberately , for it suspects that few other authors could shape over 50 years and 200 productions into readable form . It helps , of course , that Strachan has directed for Codron on a number of occasions , and thus has an extra affinity ( and source of anecdotes as well as primary evidence ) for his subject . <p> The monkey 's own formative years of West End theatregoing certainly coincided with Codrons heyday , and a major attraction of this book is recognising productions it has seen then learning a little more about how they came to be produced . Thanks to an extensive and almost complete archive , Strachan is able to trace the career of an extraordinary impresario through good times and harder ones in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task is both the books greatest asset , and chief weakness . Once the Codron schooldays have been dispensed with , he adopts a decidedly thematic approach taking either an association with a single playwright or genre ( revue is the most interesting , and the form the monkey for one miss most in London today ) as the subject of a chapter . This saves the whole from becoming just another tiresome chronology , and gives the author flexibility in tracing the development of an association in a single section of the book rather than in small paragraphs across a hundred pages . <p> Anything outside this structure does have to be worked in a little less smoothly than a reader might like , though it can be a relief to turn away from a minute examination of one author for a moment to interpolate a little of anothers success for contrast and colour . The main drawback , however , is that the reader suddenly finds himself plunged back to failure in 1956 directly after celebrating a hit 2005 production at the close of the previous chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times , though compared to the alternative it is rather a sound editorial decision . <p> It could also be mentioned that one minor editorial error gets the dates wrong for a whole sequence of Ayckbourn / Vaudeville Theatre productions and Codrons associated ownership of the venue but , as a writer myself , the monkey knows that such things are unavoidable and it might be seen as a simple case of Ayckbourn confusions enlivening the text a little . <p> This book succeeds both as a reference source for those fascinated by West End production history , and as an aide memoire ' to the keen theatregoer . Certainly one that both will wish to have on their shelves ; either to dip into in order to refresh a memory or simply pass a pleasurable few moments . LONG ... <p> " Evening Primrose " ( region 1 DVD - UK readers may require a multi-regional DVD player and TV set to view ) <p> ... of 1966 American television . A time when quality mattered as much as ratings , and a brave experiment like a season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour version is still missing , so this DVD is taken from a newly discovered black and white archive copy . It 's watchable , but do n't expect crystal clarity in either sound or vision . The sound faults were inherent in production , the visuals simply down to the age and quality of the recording . In the extras ' with the disc , the production team also admit to mistakes made in the original filming thanks to being forced to rush its completion . You 'll have fun spotting them once they are pointed out , and they in no way detract from your enjoyment . <p> For enjoyable this wonderful disc is . Every Sondheim fan will experience the same tingle that monkey did , seeing two fabulous and familiar songs in context ' for the first time . This is even more special , of course , because it is an event few of us thought we 'd ever see . Until now that pleasure was restricted to those lucky enough to visit the New York library where the only known copy was held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hush-hush ' one of a fuzzy bootleg copy . <p> It is easy to see why this garnered such critical reviews following the one and only screening on 16th November 1966 ; even the most forgiving reviewer will notice gaping holes in the plot . What , for example , do the store dwellers at the centre of the tale do during the day ? They are active all night , taking pains to avoid the ( obviously short sighted and goldfish-minded ) security guard by dummying up ' as he passes . So during the day , where do they sleep in a store full of people ? They ca n't dummy up ' then too , can they ? Oh , and how come the store never notices missing food or other items ? Just two of the inconsistencies that may bewilder viewers . <p> No matter . Anthony Perkins makes the most of even the roughest lines and situations dealt to him . His singing voice is a surprise , lifting from song-speak to very creditable as required . Co-star , and object of his on-screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charmian Carr dazzles vocally and visually . Luckily , the director 's instincts were strongest in her scenes , and every nuance of this fine performance is captured . The rest of the cast , comprising many well known elders like Larry Gates and Dorothy Stickney will also provide an education for younger viewers in how melodrama can be played credibly . If that does n't convince , the rest of the musical score ( enhanced at one point by David Shire , who knew ? ) is alone the breathtaking reason to purchase . <p> A well produced history booklet , plus two interviews and some silent test film footage ( neat comedy with a shirt included ) rounds out a must have for anybody who is a fan of Sondheim , Perkins or Carr - or just wonders what happens in a department store at night ... <p> A riotous Malmo Airport encounter with some teenage Swedish boys triggered teen-holiday memories for Composer Dougal Irvine . Accepting how selective these could be , he decided to create a musical - scored for two guitars around them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to remember their past weeks activities . Strong language and graphic images are present from the start , as an incongruous close harmony ( decent voices all ) of a single insult becomes an introduction to the group and sets the scene . <p> Bravado , " Wed like to s*ag your daughter , that 's what your daughters for , " is mixed with the reflective , " Weve been a group for ever , now we must go alone , " marking the end of an era . <p> " Brand New " then introduces Verity Rushworth as Sophie , siren of the boys week . Advertising her availability , the following track , " Sophie " captures an inexperienced males reaction to her dubious charms with a decent erudition of awe and shyness that ultimately ends in mourning a loss . <p> Group member Jordan hints at the reason , knowing it could destroy the group , but frustratingly does n't  divulge it on the disc . This is n't as irritating as the boys attempts to remember " Thursday Night , " though particularly their behaviour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankfully lacking in detail . <p> As the disc progresses the stronger emotional explorations emerge . " Do You Know What I Think Of You " captures brilliantly that moment when one boy outgrows a friendship with another . In similar vein " Picture Book " explores another aspect of loss childhood and family security . <p> Providing contrast , " Why Do We Say Gay ? " parodies various song styles ( Country being the best ) , to dissect wittily ( and explicitly ) the world of male one-upmanship and bonding . <p> With a pause to reflect on what tourism has done ( or not ) for Spain - the theory proposed being that by defending them , the Brits won the right to er , basically trash their entire culture the boys leave for home . <p> " Left Spain , " their closing number , reflects on the changes the boys have experienced in the past week , and focuses attention on the greater changes to come in adulthood . A bonus track , " We Rule The World " is a hymn to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sleeve notes do n't  indicate if this was a deleted number , and it does n't  really fit in the rest of the show , but it provides a fine finish to the recording . <p> Capturing the young male voice is rare , and this musical demonstrates just how difficult it is . Dougal Irvine makes a very listenable attempt , certainly scoring with several of the more introspective numbers . It also left this listener grateful that it was Dougal Irvine and not Andrew Lloyd Webber who was stranded in Malmo Airport that night . Otherwise , who knows , we probably would have ended up with " Luton Never Dies " LONG ... <p> London , November 2008 . In the depths of recession , a new musical opened and quickly closed . Despite a short run , the American Public Broadcasting Service filmed it for both US TV broadcast and worldwide DVD release . Without an internationally famous star , and given the shows difficult five year genesis and even a title-change any reviewer is entitled to ask , " Why did they bother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It not only deserves viewers time now ; but also attention from musical theatre talents capable of building on what producer Beth Trachtenberg and her team managed to achieve . <p> A Warsaw summers carefree carousel party is confined by November 1940 to the citys Ghetto the Nazis " living prison " for its Jewish population . Two years on , Daniels theatre company are making the best of it . Meagre physical resources are eked out by bottomless reserves of courage to produce life-saving distraction from their situation . <p> The decision to stage a play based on the tale of Masada , aligning their own suffering with that of the Jewish population in 66AD , provides a structure for two stories to play out in parallel both to deeply affecting conclusions . <p> So what went wrong ? Musicals are notoriously difficult to get right , often going through many workshops and out-of-town tryouts to resolve structural issues . In this case , I 'd suggest the flaw is in the balance between the ancient and modern tales . <p> The modern storyline is sound . Every sequence involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt in any musical theatre production . Odd clumsy lines , and perhaps a thin sub-plot too many , aside ; these scenes are an immediate reason to purchase this disc . <p> What the team fails to resolve , despite valiant efforts , is the integration of the ancient " Masada " parts . Rather than weaving vignettes derived from the main action into the tale , they opt for long sequences of " show within a show . " Despite a rather lovely title melody and one well-judged comedy song , these mostly dissipate the carefully constructed despair of 1943 , rather than enhancing its dramatic impact . <p> This recording should provide much hope for the future of the show . Constant re-watching should allow the creative team to find the emotional focus they 're already close to discovering , and suggest a new staging . Meanwhile , ordinary theatregoers have an opportunity to enjoy a stirring lesson in faith and courage , and also share this reassuring proof of the human spirits ability to meet even the greatest adversity . LONG ... <p> " The London Palladium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By Chris Woodward.Northern Heritage Publishing . 35 . ISBN : 9-781-906600-39-6 Available from Amazon.co.uk <p> What do you do when offered a wonderful collection of theatre programmes , including many from the most famous of them all the London Palladium ? <p> Chris Woodwards answer is to try telling the venues story , starting with the development of Argyll Street in the early 1730s . He moves swiftly then through the Henglers Circus days to the opening of the current building on Boxing Day 1910 . Here Woodward arrives at the heart of his tale those who appeared at , or managed the venue over the next century . <p> The thick , glossily lavish pages teem with posters recalling the stars , and the surrounding text spell out their famous names and achievements . Wonderful accounts of historic entertainers like the " Crazy Gang " and " Sunday Night At the London Palladium " team are recorded ; and we are also introduced to famous staff from George Black to Bernard Delfont , and producers including Harold Fielding . <p> There 's no easy way to present such detailed annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author does his best to break the flow up a little with the odd historical snippet , but it can get a little repetitive after a while when reading this book from cover to cover . Almost every year and performance is followed by the sentiment , " It was a memorable one " ( complete with exclamation mark ) ; and readers wont be surprised to learn that the author writes the historical notes found in Palladium programmes - the style is comparable . <p> The books only omission is the architecture itself . There are no auditorium photographs ( probably because West End theatres are sensitive about such material being published ) , nor text acknowledging how the auditorium and building changed over time . Also notable is the authors own forgetfulness when criticising the advent of " musicals cast by reality television . " The Palladium has always set public trends and tastes , and by presenting the first experiment with the genre ( " The Sound of Music " in 2006 ) , it actually just adds another page to its legendary reputation in the vanguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this book will probably be of most interest to those who maintain libraries of London theatre reference works because those ( like the monkey ) require a level of detail unavailable online . Its also very much a gift for older readers who will wallow in the bygone nostalgia of golden names . As a simple record of those who made it great , this book is probably definitive and for that alone it is worth dipping into . LONG ... <p> From these eleven carefully selected tracks , it seems that " No Space For Air " alludes to the closeness and sometimes claustrophobia of passionate relationships . Opening number " Weak " contains the line deep as I am - a perfectly summary of the emotional explorations which follow . <p> Doing what theatrically famous Julie Atherton does best , particular highlights are " Lost In Translations " from the concept musical Lift and " Losing My Mind " from Sondheim 's Follies. <p> " Lost In Translation " contains one expletive , but is a wonderful tale of a dare that went wrong , delivered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can manage . Every ounce of comedy and deep yearning are delivered against a beautifully mixed backing . <p> Any selection from Follies is usually a clichT . Atherton and her arranger neatly avoid the problem with a surprise arrangement . To say more would spoil the joy of its discovery , but suffice to say it alone is worth the price of the disc for many fans of both singer and songwriter . <p> Further into the album " Crawling " explores , with variations in accompaniment and tempo , insecurity . This contrasts perfectly with the dominating " Leather , " employing strong imagery and matching vocals to consider the complex dynamics of control and passion . " Broken Wings " manages a similar level of emotion , with less obvious pain and greater introspection . <p> " Never Saw Blue Like That " and " Silent Whispers " cool things a little . The first , slower , number uses the colour in Athertons voice to evoke images of a sunlit coastal villa . The second celebrates quiet togetherness with a delightfully warm tone from the singer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides a thoughtful balance in the discs running order , a reflective interlude before rounding it off with " Encore " - offering some optimism and a plan for future happiness . <p> The monkey 's first reaction to this album release was , " Julie Atherton ? The lady who sings the wonderfully crazy song on the Christmas In New York Album , right ? " Actually , it abbreviated the description to two words This disc proves to be worth many more , most of them superlatives . LONG ... <p> Very occasionally a cast CD makes the monkey wish it had seen the actual production . This is one of those rare occasions . <p> Peter Pan is all too often written off as a childrens treat , or worse given a smug , " edgy " adaptation to disassociate it from its roots . The Birmingham Repertory / West Yorkshire Playhouse production by Stiles , Drewe and Hall nimbly avoids these pitfalls to produce a book musical of the perfect depth of intelligence and clarity . <p> Bright lyrics and some inventive music hang well from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , it is clear that these composers have the experience and inventiveness to provide a fresh and unique angle on the story . The recurrent " Just Beyond The Stars " is a song Streisand could do damage with , while Wendys logic that Pan ca n't remain a chid because he will " grow too tall " is a single example of the thought that has gone into the characterisations and narrative drive of the show . <p> For every character and group is perfectly drawn . Peter himself is perfectly defined by the " Cleverness Of Me . " The Lost Boys gang in full bravado are just short of an ASBO , while the pirates are the funniest bunch of evil cutthroats since Sweeney Todd . Captain Hook may get all " Les MisTrables " for a moment , but the beautifully timed act 2 opener " Look Back Through A Rose Tinted Eyepatch , " and later " A Pirate With A Conscience " ( with Shakespeare thrown in ) keep this hooked maniac on track . <p> Strong vocal performances delight throughout , notably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing of Martin Callaghan as Smee . Along with the ensemble all sound perfect on this detailed and , incidentally , well produced and presented recording . <p> If there are faults , they are mostly with the pacing , which may pass un-noticed on stage but feel a little uncomfortable on CD . " Build A House " is clearly a visual number , judging by the lyric , while the finale " Theres Always Tomorrow " has the right sentiment but perhaps lacks the " button " to turn the song into the triumphant ending the show deserves . <p> Sometimes it is a shame that Londons West End cant support a musical perceived as " for children " outside the Christmas or Summer Vacation period . On the strength of this disc , there should be a rush to sign up the full production rights . The monkey hopes others will agree . LONG ... <p> Mylar is the shiny plastic sheeting ( often slashed into long ribbons ) forming the glittery backdrop behind cabaret performers . This book shines much like it , despite claiming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other musical theatre obsessives , I 'm most familiar with " Forbidden Broadway " on CD . Each new edition is eagerly awaited for its show-roasting , star-skewering lyrics and particularly the latest " Les MisTrables " parody . Here we find out how it all came about , and its a fascinating story . <p> The earliest recordings sound endearingly nanve , and it turns out that the team indeed were . Created initially to amuse friends , Forbidden Broadway quickly became a nightclub hit in the early 1980s . Earning the respect of New Yorks theatre industry , it has had many homes since ; also spawning updated versions , national and international tours , and many recordings . <p> Gerard Alessandrini and Michael Portantiere acknowledge generously every creative contribution down the years . Many past cast and crew members also add pages of personal memories , resulting in an enthralling account of this unique theatrical venture by those who were actually there through great times and " blooper " moments . <p> For those ( like me ) who wondered how the parodies evolve , Alessandrini explains precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brit ( and thus used to cutting / sarcastic satirical humour ) , I found the reasons that they stop short of " next day in the dressing room they hang a star , " interesting . It turns out that many other factors - beyond just rabid US libel lawyers , as I originally supposed - are involved . Luckily , what is produced seems taken in ( mostly ) great humour by the victims and there are plenty of photographs and anecdotes to prove it . <p> Best of all are long passages of lyrics , complete with stage directions . If like me you 've never seen the actual show in New York , these add a hilarious extra dimension to the familiar CDs . <p> Two full-colour glossy sections , many black and white photographs and plenty of Ken Fallin cartoons combine with the beautifully organised and concise text to make this a celebration to be proud of . LONG ... <p> Since 2006 , the " Christmas In New York " team have given British composers an annual boost , performing a selection of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aims to capture some of the best performances , and also contribute towards a Musical Theatre bursary for a student at Arts Educational School , London . <p> The seasonal mood is set in the sleeve notes accompanying the disc . Asked what Christmas means to them , most of the cast admit to silly games and chronic over-indulgence . Luckily this recording was made in November before the Amaretto could take hold of Paul Spicer , and while Hannah Waddingham could still make it off her folks ' couch and into the studio . <p> With few exceptions , many of the numbers here are fresh as new snow and bright as a string of fairy lights . The lively " Christmas In New York City " from the Company gives way to a magic yet fragile piano-only accompanied " White Christmas " from Leanne Jones . <p> Oliver Tompsett then works well with a choir on " The Christmas " before Louise Dearman mixes new and old customs in " All Those Christmas ClichTs . " This gives way to my personal highlight on the recording - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern " A Winter 's Tale . " The trio of voices and careful balancing of each tune and lyric are almost worth buying the CD for alone . " What Christmas Means to Me / Christmas ( Baby Please Come Home ) " then seems brash by comparison but proves a sensibly lively contrast before Samuel Barnett and Anna-Jane Casey turn in the yearning " Miss You Most ( at Christmas Time ) " and sincere " Children " respectively . Then follows a cheering " Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas , " before Daniel Boys provides a relaxed sweet " Ave Maria . " <p> Julie Atherton 's " Perfect Year " edges Dina Carroll 's famous version with a solo guitar accompaniment underlining the vocal in unique style . Leanne Jones returns with the surprising " Just In Time For Christmas " before Clement Clarke Moore 's " ' T was the Night Before Christmas " is given a musical rendition by Anna-Jane Casey and the Company . The show concludes with an uplifting " O Holy Night " from Hannah Waddingham and the choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with a dash of strong language ) may be at odds with the rest of the recording , but Julie Atherton on hilarious form leaves us in no doubt of the turkey fan 's career plans for next year - just be thankful you 're not her agent ... <p> After the crush of Christmas shopping , with its ubiquitous dreary seasonal tunes on a loop , this is a very refreshing and hugely more enjoyable alternative . LONG ... <p> What can be said about Ned Sherrin that has not been already ? The back jacket reminds us of his many talents as broadcaster , writer , director and presenter , and his untimely death left a vast gap in the entertainment world . His parting gift to us is this sharing of what he loved best ; people and places instantly recognisable to anyone who has ever seen a play or watched a great film . <p> Always informative , frequently hilarious ( and occasionally downright bawdy ) this is a seemingly definitive A to Z of showbiz gossip and scandal . Sources are sometimes first hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a phenomenal memory and extensive past library of work to provide much of the most credible material . Other times , references are carefully authenticated by those who claimed to be there. Unlike others , Sherrin tries to avoid the hoarier tales whose constant retelling is their only validation . He admits to leaving in a few for completeness and to ward against reader comment , but for the most part the original prevail . <p> Roaming London and Broadways backstage , Hollywoods soundstage and most frequently the dressing rooms and private homes of those employed there , Centuries of the very best tales are drawn together . Stars from David Garrick to Ian McKellen , writers Shaw to Shaffer , composers Hart to Lloyd Webber all have the best of their public and private moments recalled with the authors trademark clarity , incisive wit and turn of phrase . <p> Its the sometimes less familiar names who provide the most wonderful moments , though . Michael Bryants Badger discovery beautifully deflates an over-eager young choreographer , and the hoary old Pia Zadora / Anne Frank legend is finally laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many tales to tell . Four pages of Sir Henry Irvings wit ends in a ribald Shakespearian story that would make Juliet blush ; the three on Alan Jay Lerner simply remind us how to bring down your final curtain in style . <p> Not for your elderly friend whose idea of theatre is a " nice romantic musical " perhaps , the language is very much the saltier stuff of the theatrical bar raconteur ; but certainly required reading for anyone with even a passing interest in the lives of performers both past and present . Ned Sherrins voice speaks to the reader in a way few else can , and reading the final page is again to feel the pang of loss of his company , but a gratitude that we could have shared this time together LONG ... <p> There is no denying that Gareth Peter Dicks has something special . Not only has he written music , lyric and book for this show , but also managed to get it developed ( via tryout " workshop " productions ) into a fully orchestrated concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Concept albums have always been acknowledged as the finest way to get a work in progress heard , and the excellent cast features particularly strong leads including Ramin Karimloo , Sarah Lark , Stephen Weller and Abi Finley , and outstanding backup performers . <p> With the knowledge that simplicity is often the best course in musical theatre , Dicks has wisely built a book focussing on two families experiences both home and on the battlefield of World War Two . Without intricate sub-plots , he is able to explore far more naturally the effect of such devastating world events on the lives of each individual character . <p> Here the show is certainly at its most effective . A soldiers letter home is incredibly moving ; chilling and beautiful . Indeed , whenever characters interact via letter or in conversation ( " The Hospital / Petes First Letter , " for example ) there is no mistaking the composers talent for musicalising relationships . A " Final Battle " with the spirit echoing through the orchestration and leading into " Goodnight Dear Soldiers " perfectly performed by Abi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there are faults in the piece , they are mainly in the lyric . The rhyming dictionary is thumbed for , " when Im gloomy , you see through me , " while several other moments depart from otherwise sound characterisation in favour of banal " we live a loving life as our fathers did " expressions of thought and feeling . The odd modern phrase , " did they really have a clue " creeps in too , along with a Sergeant spouting possibly un-40s like popular psychology to inspire his men . All may be the types of line West End reviewers pick on with glee , but luckily these would vanish in the transition from concept to full production . <p> The other loss , possibly a result of simplifying the work to fit into 80 minutes of disc space , is the wonderful " Spitfires . " A lovely blend of voices with music perfectly evoking the period look set to drive the evening as narrative links . Sadly , they vanish by track 4 any chance of a return , please ? Speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at the end that husband Pete called his wife Roberta " Bobbie " in their closest moments together . Had we found that out earlier , the impact throughout the show , and notably in the final number would have been even greater . <p> This recording shows much potential , with the writer having the firmest possible grip on the relationships which are the productions greatest strength . With a directors work on the rougher edges of the lyric , this recording confirms that the whole is a piece worth progressing ; and is an early work-in-progress disc that musical theatre fans would wish to have in their collection . LONG ... <p> Aimed at a younger teen audience , the most immediately striking feature of this disc is just how wide their tastes in musical theatre must be . Youd of course expect " High School Musical " ( and its sequels ) to feature prominently , and " Joseph " is almost compulsory - along with a couple of songs from " Grease . " The surprises are how well Abba have transcended the generations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that a traditional musical like " Hairspray " is considered worthy of inclusion , and that 80s number " Fame " still resonates today . <p> Each song is beautifully presented . Rather than lazily settling for being a " compilation " of original tunes drawn from previous cast outings , instead each track has been recorded by a string of very talented session singers . <p> Oddly , some of the vocals particularly those on the " High School Musical " numbers improve somewhat on the originals . There is a confidence found in the professionals voices which is n't always apparent in the actual films . It may be that singers who do this full-time simply develop a different style from actors who sing , or it just might be that this discs producers were aiming for a smoother tone to the whole than the grittiness of the film . <p> The accompanying bonus DVD offers up a selection of 8 tracks , in either sing-a-long or karaoke form . Both options bring up the lyric , highlighted to the rhythm against a static background . The sing-a-long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in harmony with the performers . The karaoke version just provides the rhythm , a far more challenging route for the aspiring young performer to test themselves against . <p> The National Youth Music Theatre are supporting this compilation of tracks , possibly hoping that those singing along will find their way into the ranks of the organisation some time . This nifty little end of school break treat may indeed just encourage some teens to investigate performing when term restarts , and who knows where that may lead ? LONG ... <p> Many composers have undertaken remarkable journeys from playroom piano to West End Stage . Lord Lloyd Webbers artistic output ( since " Twinkle Twinkle Little Star " aged five , allegedly ) has been catalogued on disc many times . Stiles and Drewe , twenty five years in the business , now receive a similar accolade . They may not be in the business of scaring younger children every Saturday tea-time on BBC1 , unless writing incidental music to " Doctor Who , " but their output certainly justifies this unusual and absorbing CD . <p> Recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 , a string of well known West End performers including Scarlett Strallen , Joanna Riding , Clive Rowe and Claire Moore , plus newcomers like Gareth Gates and Leanne Jones lead us through the output of a still evolving partnership . <p> Kicking off with " Just So " in 1985 , Rowe , Dempsey and Atherton do justice to songs which showed early promise but rather explained why the original West End transfer did n't  happen . An exuberant celebration of the " Joy of Motherhood " from " Honk ! " then leads on to even better things with " Peter Pan . " For those familiar with the 1954 Broadway version , this is strikingly deeper , with a wistful " Theres Always Tomorrow " setting a new standard in their work . Lisa OHare wittily reminds us of the duos " Mary Poppins " experience ; before a change of pace with a Joyce Grenfellesque " Carrying A Torch , " preceding two further cabaret numbers . Alison Jiears salute to musical ambition is almost worth the price alone . <p> Rounding off the disc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soho Cinders . " Strong language , yes , but incredibly strong songs to match . Promising yet another new direction for the pair , there is plenty to look forward to . With the finale placing on record the cast thanking the audience , listeners will also thank Spekulation Entertainments forethought in releasing the show for all to share . LONG ... <p> " Sweeney Todd In Concert " Region 0 DVD <p> Thanks to inflation , it has become impossible to reproduce the original Broadway 1979 staging of Stephen Sondheim and Hugh Wheeler 's " Sweeney Todd , the Demon Barber of Fleet Street . " Luckily , it was recorded ( during a later 1982 tour ) and was made available on DVD in 2005 . Before that release , the score might have been lost but for this imaginative preservation attempt by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra , Rob Fisher and director Lonnie Price . In 2000 they came up with the idea of a concert version of the show , a success which lead to stagings in New York , Chicago and San Francisco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness causing Bryn Terfel to drop out , the 2005 stage DVDs George Hearn takes the lead as Todd in this concert version too . It is fascinating how age has mellowed both his voice and approach to the role , as Sweeney becomes more contemplative and relaxed than ever portrayed before . <p> His Mrs Lovett this time is Patti Lupone . The " Making Of " extras on this disc show Sondheim himself telling her to " sing what you like " if she forgets the words and with a singing voice like that it is no wonder he is willing to compromise . Lupones only fault also a problem with Neil Patrick " Doogie Howser MD " Harris as Toby is the British accent during the dialogue scenes . Lupone runs from Maureen Lipman to Barbara Windsor , while Neils Toby is noticeably Cockney to Welsh . Like Lupone , Harris sings well , but he lacks emotional understanding during his pivotal " Not While I 'm Around . " Sound comic timing compensates for this flaw , luckily . <p> The supporting cast make much use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ensemble , Victoria Clark as Beggar Woman / Lucy and Timothy Nolen as the Judge give probably the definitive rendition of their roles . The monkey can not praise either small but important performance highly enough . Davis Gaines as Mark and Lisa Vroman as Johanna also provide strength in their sub-plot romance which remarkably lightens the evening while adding tension simultaneously . <p> Director Price admits that his " multi-level platforms surrounding the orchestra " approach keeps the actors running and the pace smart . Small cuts to the score keep the attention focused , and will not be noticed by most . Restored is " Johanna " the Judges Song which fans of the original cast album will delight in here . Sensibly simple dress and props give more than sufficient detail to enable the story to be told to anyone unfamiliar with the work . <p> With soaring chorals , some fine bleak comic moments and an Act One ending which is stronger than the fully staged original , this is a DVD that Sondheim collectors will want to have , and a good introduction for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a key number in this musical , bringing together the major storylines playing out to a dramatic finish . It could , though , just as easily describe the effect of this album on any listener giving it their full attention . <p> Capturing well the morally decadent atmosphere against which the tale of Occupied Paris unfolds , it goes further than many cast albums by offering a distinctive entertainment in its own right . The vocal performances allow character personalities to develop in listeners minds as easily as on stage , and careful editing keeps the storyline clear too . <p> Ruthie Henshalls " China Doll " is as heartbreaking here as if she were singing standing by the piano at the Theatre Royal Haymarket . Annalene Beecheys " Jazz Time " is similarly effective . Alexander Hansons confusion and sadism in " I Hate The Very Thought of Women " chills , while Matt Crosss humour luckily relieves the ongoing grimness . The ensemble number lyrics are actually more comprehensible on CD than in the theatre , with their breathtaking hypocrisy providing a smart finish . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in evidence with a glossy lyric book , lavishly illustrated with production photographs and well-considered sleeve notes . A bonus track from the original demo recording is a final reason to make this album part of your stage collection as soon as possible . <p> As the era of the 80 's mega-musical drew to a close , Sondheim weighed in with his effort " Into The woods . " The lavishly staged original Broadway production was filmed for television , and released on DVD in 2005 . <p> The basic fairytales of Rapunzel , Little Red Riding Hood , Jack and the Beanstalk and Cinderella become hopelessly and hilariously entangled during Act One , with a happy ending to bring the curtain down . By Act Two , though , a giantess is running amuck and Prince Charming is off charming someone else ( not sure who , but a dwarf is involved ) . With the good advice of the Witch to be " careful the things to wish for " ignored , and the Narrator dead , the indecisive storybook characters must this time bring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful music . <p> Perhaps some of the staging now looks a little dated . Indeed , the London production of this show ( which followed Broadways by about a year ) was already a step on from this original . London had a tighter book and less cumbersome set but what it did n't  have was Bernadette Peters , Chip Zien and the delightfully bratty Danielle Ferland . You 'll enjoy all three performances here , along with Barbara Brynes well-judged comic turn as Jacks exasperated mother and Kim Crosbys winsomely witless Cinderella . <p> The sophisticated jokes fly , most landing brilliantly , and there is always something intellectual from Mr Sondheims lyric to keep interested those who consider themselves too old for fairy tales . If at times the script wanders and characters vanish too quickly , it does n't  matter as the score forgives almost all . <p> Not quite as accessible as " Sweeney Todd , " but perhaps a little more so than " Company ; " this DVD is a must for collectors of course , but also one to buy for those wishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company " <p> Region 2 DVD <p> Just how long can single New Yorker Robert ( Bobby ) remain , " a thing of beauty and a boy forever ? " Today is his 35th birthday , and his ( crazy ) married friends are throwing him a surprise party . As it approaches , his thoughts turn towards love and whether someone special is waiting for him ... or already passed him by <p> John Doyles acclaimed New York 2006 Ethel Barrymore Theatre production is now released on DVD . The style is original 1970s " New York Sharp " for everybody except Raul Esparzas Bobby - the nanve observer ; and the cast play their own instruments , brilliantly . <p> This inspired concept allows the " Drive a Person Crazy " trio to set a new standard for this classic number and demonstrate Amy Justman as a fine pianist . Vocally , Barbara Walsh delivers " Ladies Who Lunch " with perfect control and triggers Bobbys final emotional outpouring with masterful timing . Similarly , Heather Laws handles Amys equally intricate " Not Getting Married Today " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a slinky top-of-piano performance as Marta , and outstanding are Kristin Huffman and Keith Buterbaugh . As Sarah and Harry , their inspired karate sequence will no doubt be copied by every new amateur director of this piece for years to come . <p> Unlike the 1995 Donmar Warehouse London production in which the actors interacted as equals within Bobbys mind , here Bobbys emotional immaturity is underlined . It works when Bobby is trying to analyse friends relationships , but reduces his cathartic closing number " Being Alive " to something rather self-pitying instead of actualising . Still , better than the monkey philosophy of love ( find the one monkeyette who hates you more than any other monkey on the planet , and give her your house and car ) perhaps . <p> This production shines as bright as the disc it is captured on . A dazzlingly deft dissection of a great work for Sondheim fans , a sound introduction to his wider works for those who first encountered him via 2008s " Sweeney Todd . " Either way , this is a must . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not include the " extras " printed on the case . Apparently they were sadly not cleared for international release , but this information wasnt received early enough to remove mention on the packaging . <p> Buy from Amazon.co.uk This is the Region 1 edition - a multi-regional DVD player may be required outside the USA . On the plus side , it has the extras promised ! <p> Andrew McConnell Stott has written perhaps the finest biography the monkey read in 2009 . Following his modern day prologue at the annual Clowns ' Memorial Service in Hackney , the turn of a page takes us back to Boxing Day 1810 , as the greatest clown of all is about to step onto the pantomime stage . <p> We are then treated to an enthralling biography of the clown himself , with stories illustrating the theatrical and social scene around him adding extra colour . At the end , for further interest , pantomime " Mother Goose " is reproduced in full from an 1807 printing and the " Notes " section contains famous extracts of verse including Joe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dibden . <p> Deciding to take this broad view is a wise one . With few solid records and so many anecdotes abounding ( the " go see the great clown to cure your depression - I am that clown " story is here weighed and rightly fast dispatched ) lesser authors might become mired in probably irrelevant details . Instead , placing Grimaldi in his favourite environment allows us to enjoy the intrigues of the artistes ' " Green Room " and managers ' offices ; with excursions into the auditorium , Parliament and the homes of gentry and commoners alike to balance out the biographical insights . <p> Best of all , Stott 's text is as light as Harlequin 's moves , his eye for humour and the need to clarify details for those unschooled in that period always as deft and sure . Not a single passage drags , and it is both the facts and the atmosphere of the era that the reader will absorb by the end . <p> For those like the monkey , who know little about that theatrical period , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comedy will find it a " must purchase " if only to discover who invented " huge clown shoes " and other comedic elements now taken for granted . Taken simply as a biography , for those who enjoy the genre , the monkey opinion is that this is one strongly deserving of a place on your bookshelf . <p> Having read this , the monkey was as happy as the python that swallowed an elephant <p> and is now taking extended sedentary leave in order to digest it . There is much to take in , and all of it deserving extended contemplation . <p> This is a very frank ramble through the mind of one of the worlds best musical theatre composers . From Saturday Night ( 1954 ) to Merrily We Roll Along ( 1981 ) - ( a forthcoming second book will cover his later work ) , every major show on which he worked , either as lyricist or full composer , is covered . The major numbers in each are given a running commentary why they were written or changed , the technicalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductions of his handwritten manuscripts . Always informative , sometimes over-harshly self critical , the dissections gave the monkey a healthy new respect for the craft . <p> It is n't all gloomy introspection , though . Gems such as the truth behind his most amusing ( and filthiest ) double entendre are revealed ( sadly , that one was a happy accident of transatlantic English , rather than planned by a genius as I 'd hoped ) are uncovered ; while the chaos of the rehearsal room is described in enough detail to make you wish you were there when it is going well , at least . <p> Interspersing these show commentaries are some startlingly iconoclastic arguments and opinions about his musical theatre contemporaries . By declaring at the outset that he will only discuss deceased composers work , Sondheim is able to expound fully without inhibition on these . You may agree or disagree with each argument ( Noel Coward in particular I felt was a trifle hard-done-by ) but each piece justifies its ideas , and is a talking point rather than ill-defined attack . <p> Other thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the monkey as a theatre reviewer was Sondheims opinion that musicals are the only art form exclusively reviewed by non-musical people . Its true but , taken to its logical conclusion , it might reduce the entire qualified UK musical theatre reviewing community to pretty much Andrew Lloyd Webber , Stiles and Drewe scary . Also fascinating was his truth that everybody thinks they can fix a show they cant. As somebody who often dares to venture an opinion on such things , that rightly had this simian thinking again <p> Fortunately , the monkey received this as a gift from a friend who was frustrated that I had n't  got around to reading it on publication . The fortune is that because it did n't  purchase it , it was able to instead fill the gaps in its Sondheim CD collection . Be warned , if you do n't  have a recording of each show mentioned in the book , you will very quickly wish to do so . As each disc plays , this book will enhance your pleasure as the numbers acquires a new meaning and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase for fans , and equally a superb guide for the less initiated in the world of a supremely talented man . <p> There is a strange law of genetics which says the very best West End leading ladies should be shorter than 5ft 5 tall and have amazingly huge voices . Kerry Ellis joins Elaine Paige and Linzi Hateley in that number , and here releases a very special treat for " Wicked " fans and general musical theatre lovers equally . <p> So good as " Elphaba " that she was stolen from the London production to play the Broadway version for six months in 2008 , until we could steal her back in December ; Kerry 's parting gift is a stunning three track disc showcasing her voice at its finest . <p> " Defying Gravity " may be identified with belter Idina Menzel , but Ellis takes it to new heights with a rock beat and razor-sharp vocal performance setting a vision for the future which we just know is the right path to follow . Utterly convincing and demands attention to every note - you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop when she buys it , as there is something extra to hear each time . <p> Track two is monkey favourite " I 'm Not That Girl . " Who knows if Kerry has ever felt that way in real life ( c'm on , you really think she ever has ? ! ) ; but whatever she draws on to deliver this could make her a fortune , bottled and sold to musical theatre students . Another sophisticated arrangement and deeply thought out lead vocal , this is n't just a cry of pain , but the human condition heart-breakingly summarized . <p> The final track , " No One But You " is a contrast to the " Wicked " score , offering a chance for Ellis to explore her performing range and providing a neat treat to round off with . Highly reccomended . LONG ... <p> As a writer on London Theatre , the monkey knows from feedback on its own work that a good theatrical ghost story is always appreciated by readers . Ian John Shillito and Becky Walsh , though , take things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports from the spook-face . Full time investigators of the paranormal , Shillito and Walsh present here the results of almost a dozen full site investigations , ' plus short paragraphs about many other venues they either chose / could not fully check out . <p> Those who regularly visit London 's theatres know that each has a unique feel ' and personality . As somebody who is lucky enough to also visit them during the day time without audiences present , the monkey can confirm that the atmosphere is often magnified during those quieter moments . Ian and Becky make the point that theatre folk are almost always sensitive to something in the air ' in their workplace , and on that score , monkey says they were absolutely correct . <p> Where anybody may care to differ is on interpretation of those feelings . For each venue they investigate fully , a quick history lesson is followed by interviews with those who 've worked there . These are followed by an investigation ' and a conclusion , complete with 1 to 10 Haunted Scale ' ranking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian more sceptical yet sometimes experiencing ' something ' too . Becky on a number of occasions reports acting to free ' the unhappy spirits she encountered . Though perhaps depriving theatres of a unique presence ( or just a good story ) , it humanised the text in places - grounding it in a reality any reader could understand . <p> The conclusions each time are equally a balancing act between the pair , and the monkey did respect the way in which a rational explanation was always sought first . Whichever side of the scientific debate you are on ( for monkey , it just believes science does n't know everything yet , but that everything comes from some form of fundamental existential organisation we loosely call science ' ) , these are decent tales to be taken as you wish . <p> If it has a gripe about this book , it is - as a reviewer on Amazon.co.uk points out - in the editing . Syntax and spelling go awry more often than a decent ghost writer ( sorry , could n't resist ) or editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including many eerie and evocative monochrome photographs . <p> There are plenty of spectres everybody in the West End knows about - from Drury Lane 's Grey Man to the Adelphi 's time-share in William Terriss - but this book contains many the monkey had never heard of before . Add the fact it does n't take itself too seriously , but does a nice line in chill , and this becomes a readable reference work for the theatre enthusiast looking to broaden their knowledge of these marvellous old buildings . <p> This memorably captures forever in small laser etched pits rather than paint spots , Londons Menier Chocolate Factory production of a modern Sondheim classic experiment . <p> On stage , effective use was made of back projections to provide a canvas for artist Seurat and his muse Dot . Here , the sound is balanced to ensure the performers voices are always to the fore and every word is clear . Jenna Russells voice is warm with a hint of exasperation as she chides George for his lack of affection . Daniel Evans meanwhile manages a clinical detachment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thoughts of the creating artist . <p> Elsewhere on the recording , the unforgettable park scenes involving everybody at the Grande Jatte are powerfully evoked with a sense of space and distance achieved by careful studio work . The orchestra itself was small in the theatre , and sensibly are augmented by three extra players here . The richness of " We Do Not Belong Together " impresses with its simplicity - the feeling not overwhelmed ( as usually happens ) by a too elaborate orchestration . Oh , and " Everybody Loves Louis " is a hoot , too ... wonderful bawdy comic timing . <p> The overall effect is considerably less harsh than the Broadway recording . The re-writing Sondheim did of Act Two for the original National Theatre London production also stands the test of time , which means the disc is strong throughout , rather than fading towards the end as on the previous recording . Another unmissable addition to the collection for Sondheim fans , especially as this is the first time the score has been released almost entirely uncut . <p> Much maligned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sondheim classic musical has languished in the vaults until now . Time has n't been kind to the print - the DVD faithfully shows every scratch on it , uncorrected by the low-budget company releasing the movie for the first time on disc . Still , through the gloom ( allegedly sometimes there to flatter star Elizabeth Taylor ) a fascinating production emerges . <p> Elizabeth Taylor sings , and actually makes a fair job of sending in the clowns . Len Cariou as Frederick is as fatally charming as he could be , while Hermione Gingold produces the perfect acid commentary on events from her chair . Add Diana Rigg and an early performance by Lesley Dunlop , but subtracting ( sadly ) " Miller 's Son " and two other numbers from the score and the result is a flawed but highly watchable gem . <p> The Sheffield production which was thrice extended at the Savoy Theatre is captured on CD to delight all who were lucky enough to see the show . <p> For the first time a contemporary sound has been brought to the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes up for in a percussion and accordion which bring the rhythm of old Russia appropriately to the fore The warmth of Henry Goodman 's voice is combined with his vocal acting abilities to produce a Tevye of depth and originality . Moving from the childish joy of " If I Were a Rich Man " to the heartbroken introspection of " Chavaleh " the role is his own as much on record as on stage . <p> Of his family , Alexandra Silber delights during " Matchmaker " and together with Beverley Klein 's numerous contributions justify this recording alone . Special mention must be given to the ensemble too , who create choral beauty during " Sabbath Prayer " and later cause tears to be shed at the bravado of " Anatevka " - the chilling line " We are not in America Yet " providing the bittersweet finish that ends a remarkable disc perfectly . <p> The recording is available exclusively from Dress Circle - The Showbiz Shop at : LONG ... <p> Dan Poole and Giles Terera had two things in common ; acting ambitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash , a reliable car and any real contacts in the theatrical world , they decided to make a film about that loathing . 25,000 miles and over 2 years later , " Muse of Fire " is the result . <p> Starting with a " vox pops " outside a West End theatre , in which most contributors could quote something by the Bard but little more , the duo decided to contact as many well known exponents of the Shakespearian stage as possible in order to demystify and return to the public the greatest ever playwright . <p> Interviews with among others - Ian McKellen , Judi Dench , James Earl Jones , Mark Rylance , Tom Hiddleston , Jude Law , Zoe Wanamaker , Ewan McGregor , Ralph Fiennes , Ben Kingsley , Derek Jacobi and , finally their idol Baz Luhrman follow . The journey to meet them all goes from London to Los Angeles , via productions of plays staged in Denmark , Madrid and a tiny theatre in the Eastern USA , that they just happened to notice in passing . <p> Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their rather frantic " mugging for the camera " tone at the outset become far more mature as the pair grow along with their project . The slightly outdated , well , downright cheap cartoon graphics depicting their journey become less a rebellion , more proof of just how tight the budget is the scenes of Poole tiling a bathroom for a living underlining the fact . After all that effort , what is achieved ? Steven Berkoff is the answer . His transformation into " The Godfather " as he recites Shakespearian text is simple proof that it is all about how the word is spoken , and that " the rest is silence . " A compelling presentation , with the language given a meaning and context is all that is really required . Sure , knowing iambic pentameter helps ( you 'll be an expert after watching this ) , but entertaining clarity is all . <p> The companion disc to the feature is a further hour of drama classes , " Shakespeare In Practice " where a troupe of mostly young actors are coached by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting moments , including Sandy Foster and Tony Hasnath as Romeo and Juliet ( a clip of which appears also in the main film ) and the deep joy when an Orphelia and Hamlet know they have " got the scene right " under the direction of Henry Goodman . <p> This pair of films should be of interest to anyone hoping to learn just why they should love a 400 year old writer . It may not be the most polished of documentaries , but the list of interviewees is impressive , and collectively Dan and Giles have ended up with an important documentation of opinions from some of the late 20th and early 21st centurys greatest actors and directors . An historic achievement in itself , and one arguably of importance to posterity in its own right . Rather like the plays themselves , in fact . <p> For those who do n't know Bill Bryson , he is the Iowan anglophile with the ability to see the world from a uniquely entertaining perspective . In this short book his gaze turns to Shakespeare and in true Bryson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... telling us how little is actually known about the man who may or may not have existed yet still provided a few enduring plays . <p> Padding out the actual facts ( a Shakespeare family were prominent in Stratford-Upon-Avon at one time , a Shakespeare signed a witness statement to a London court , a group of actors remembered enough of their roles fifteen years ago to publish a book of plays bearing his name and a nice sketch of a man who could be him ) with descriptions of the time he may have lived , the result is the usual Bryson romp through Englishness . The book works best as an informed look at the period - the monkey loved shuddering at the descriptions of theatregoing behaviour of the time ( not a lot different to audiences at ... well , never mind ... ) - and the arbitrariness of life back then . If the water did n't get you , the food / laws / drunken rabble would - and there was little could be done about it . <p> A swift overview of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the order in which they were written , or indeed whether they are the product of one author . Bryson deals with the various claims of ownership decisively , proving at least one to be false beyond reasonable doubt . He is keen to keep an open mind that collaboration may have happened , though , and provides a convincing explanation as to why . Add sub-plots on Shakespeare 's sexuality and how close he came to execution for treason ; combine with an obvious appreciation of the works themselves and the result is a very readable history-cum-biography that should entertain as well as enlighten . LONG ... <p> Bluegrass music is a type of country / Celtic cross , where the instruments are country , the sound Celtic and the tune given a bit of a jazz improvisation as well . Add acclaimed musical theatre performer Ramin Karimloos voice and classic show tunes and the result is a totally unique sound . <p> First up , " Oh What A Beautiful Morning " is even fresher than the morning its celebrating . A violin set up a swinging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of fun is had with the end of each phrase ( plus , the conversation with the instruments is wonderful ) . You 'll never be satisfied with the original after hearing this . <p> " Losing , " and " Broken , " are a pair of new songs written with Hadley Fraser . The first is a duet about the future of a couple , a strong violin backing adding melancholy to their questioning of relationships and identity . " Broken , " a livelier solo number , has a strong tambourine driven rhythm . Female loss from a male viewpoint , its an unusual perspective and demands repeat listening . <p> Finally , " Empty Chairs at Empty Tables , " the famous " Les MisTrables " number moves to a Deep South bayou at sunset . The voice is satisfying , but its the instruments behind it that set the atmosphere . Unusual , and sure to be a collectors item not to mention a reason for an inventive director to try transferring the whole to a New Orleans setting some time . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of the same standard , this is a collection any fan will wish to own and will win him many more . LONG ... <p> One of the peculiar items in the monkey stocking this past season was the glittering thing it would n't talk about earlier . One of the others was this book ... having read it , the monkey is n't sure which is stranger . Margaret Vermette is apparently an experienced author , writing for respected publications including " Musical Stages . " This book may surprise connoisseur readers of that publication . <p> Those expecting a comprehensive composer / lyricist biography or indeed critique of the duo 's work will be disappointed . Objective commentary on their output is also out . To her credit , Vermette admits at the outset to being a fan , and the photograph on the back confirms it . And this is where the monkey began wondering ... <p> Split into three sections , the first is simply a tribute to them . Vermette seems to consider the mens ' current record to be an apex of theatrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammerstein . The casual reader wo n't mind ... anyone who really loves the subject may well be scratching their heads by this stage , though . <p> On to section two . The first part promises a " biographical portrait " - but is shortened to more of a charcoal sketch of each man . Still , it is a well-executed sketch and a full biography at some point would be welcome . Following this , a particularly dull ( to the informed ) / mostly already published before ( for the obsessive fan who has read all the articles ) / fascinating ( to the theatrical first timer or outsider ) section deals with the creative processes and teams behind the shows . Much of the material seems drawn from already published sources or has been said before . For those who really do n't know how a show is created there is plenty to read . For the rest , it is just another rundown - though you can compare the slight differences in methods between this team and Sondheim , for example . <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awards and odd facts for each show is provided . The discography is n't comprehensive - the monkey itself owns recordings not mentioned - but as a quick reference the monkey suddenly saw the point of the work . Expanded to include full cast change dates and details , along with venues , this section in itself could be the basis of a really satisfying work . <p> Obviously researched with love , and readably written , the book should delight the casual theatregoer captivated by the pair 's musical creativity . More experienced theatregoers may find the reference section helpful , but overall the monkey wished for something more original and incisive . <p> In the USA known as " Interred With Their Bones " By Jennifer Lee Carrell Dutton Adult Hardback . ISBN : 0525949704 <p> What a romp this is ! For those , like the monkey , who felt " The Da Vinci Code " over-hyped and totally obvious from a quarter of the way through ; J.L. Carrell 's alternative proves that Bill the Quill blueprints are far superior . Carrell 's sly wit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a Canary Wharf elevator operator . <p> Taken one way , you have " Indiana Jones and the Raider of the Lost Art " as academic turned theatre director Kate swings across the planet in search of the Bard 's lost work . Complete with requisite " Hmm , there appears to be a ... here " and " With One Bound our Hero Was Free " moments , it 's all the clichTs a good thriller should have - and seldom goes flat for more than the odd page . <p> Pause a moment , and you realise that there is more to it . The chapter layout echoes Shakespearian plays , as does the pace with events unfolding in tried-and-tested theatrical patterns . After a while , look back over the chapters and find some very obviously Old Swan reverencing hallmarks in the tale . ( DO N'T READ THIS LINE TO AVOID A SPOILER ) you get a trail of corpses , some cross-dressing and plenty of twisted families and classic Globe-stage disposal methods littering the plot . <p> There 's a third level beyond this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the research which fans of Bill Bryson 's latest " Shakespeare " ( reviewed in a previous " Mashed Banana " ) will appreciate . Carrell takes what we know and creates a loving fantasia on it that manages to both convince and parody without breaking the spell . <p> Sure , other thriller writers arguably have slightly better control of pace - moving the action along without resort to the most obvious devices - but the stagelike signalling of these suits the style of the work , and the result is fun that kept the monkey reading until the final potion ( champagne ) was drunk ... with the expected results ... LONG ... <p> " Life After Tomorrow " <p> A film by Julie Stevens and Gil Cates **28;1377;TOOLONG Region 1 DVD - this disc will play on multi-regional and American / Canadian DVD players . It may not play on UK region 2 only , or other similarly " region locked " machines . Runs 1 hour 15 minutes approximately , plus over 45 minutes of extra material . <p> Nearly thirty years have passed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a young monkey a lifelong case of " showtunes " on transfer to London . Millions of youngsters have looked forward to the promise of " Tomorrow , " moaned ( or rapped ) about their " Hard Knock Life " and reminded us that " You 're Never Fully Dressed Without A Smile . " A very lucky few actually played in the show professionally on Broadway or one of the U.S tours . Question is , what happened to them once they outgrew the " cute orphan " phase ? Ex-Hannigan charge turned film-maker Julie Stevens decided to find out , giving over forty ( now adult ) cast members a chance to reminisce and ruminate on their time in red dress or rags . <p> From audition memories and the first Goodspeed Opera House tryout ( for those who thought Andrea McArdle was the original Annie , wrong , think Kristen Vigard ) to Broadway , endless road tours and on to adulthood , both the cast and creative team remind us just how long ago the 1970s were . Eight auditions over a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut on sight " were normal . Children aged between 7 and 12 exited the stage door and headed into New York 's notorious " Studio 54 " nightclub three times a week , or else passed their time skating near a brothel , taunting the workers . The theatre itself was equally unsafe , with intensive biology and sociological lessons courtesy of a jealous adult cast . " I was 10 , going on 40 " was how one girl put it ; oh , and Miss Hannigan did n't always pull her punches either . Throw in pushy moms brawling , a stalker with a gun and a slightly odd super-fan with an amazing collection of ' Annie ' goods and it is small wonder the former orphans would , to a woman , discourage their own children from going into the acting business . <p> It is n't all bleak , though . The well-balanced mixture of interviews and original show footage allow the unreality and humour of the situation to emerge too . Removing longer sequences to the " extras " section of the DVD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this section of the disc ) allows both the story of the show , and those who took part in it , to meld seamlessly and simultaneously into both record and investigative retrospective of an iconic production . With the chance to hear from famous names like Sarah Jessica Parker and Allison Smith , as well as rare footage of Charnin and Strouse , this is a cautionary tale well worth watching for both fans of the show and those considering a child-star career . <p> Buy from LONG ... <p> " The Faber Pocket Guide : Musicals " <p> By James Inverne. faber and faber . ISBN : 9780571237517 <p> James Inverne is an outstanding writer . His boundless enthusiasm for the subject comes across in this highly readable pocket guide to stage musicals . <p> Sensibly laid out , we are first treated to a personal exposition on the history of the stage musical , before the author picks 100 of the best . Of course , with so many to choose from , you 'll have plenty of fun disagreeing with his choices .

Occasionally the balance in length between them has a reader thinking , " I 'd like to know more about ... , so why did he discuss ... ? " but each is still informative enough that your CD collection will grow exponentially after reading . <p> Insightful essays on matters musical follow . The writer 's own top 10 will obviously please nobody but himself ; rightly so , and it is just a pleasure to learn far more about his own tastes . His musings on " Musicals Go To The Opera " seem , to my own ( probably philistine ) ear , to rather over-complicate the issue . It 's pretty simple ; when hearing a musical theatre diva in full belt , I can distinguish every word and think " wow !

Again his list will spark huge debate , with such **35;1407;TOOLONG as " Bernadette , " " A Doll 's Life , " " Jeeves " and " Kelly " missing . Still , it leaves plenty of room for a sequel . <p> The only failure of this book is in its editing . In several places an uneducated pen has cut important detail from the text , leaving a howler behind . The former is occasionally to the detriment of show descriptions ; the latter will irritate musical theatre buffs , and require quiz compliers to cross-check details . <p> Still , this a must for all musical theatre fans wishing to learn a little more about them ; particularly assisting newcomers as an introduction to this strange and wonderful world . <p> Few theatregoers ever pause to consider who first told them about the show they are seeing . If it was n't a friend , chances are it was an advertisement or item in the press / online / a TV programme . So how did they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Susan L.

This are some of those stories . <p> Her background as a press agent shines out from every page of this slim volume . Its slim because her years of experience allow her to tell the most compelling tales in the most economical language . This makes for easy reading , her style moving things along as the most entertaining productions should . <p> Even better , her finely honed sense of discretion allows her to speak about stars in a manner both revealing yet respectful . Revelations are carefully balanced to avoid any sense of a tabloid attack , and even the biggest divas come out with their talents recognised ahead of any misbehaviour .

@@45561000 @5561000/ <p> Be first in the KnowSorry , but knowing what is coming and when tickets will go on sale is the best way of guaranteeing your seat . <p> Shows which will always sell out even before they open generally include anything with a star name involved , either in the cast - Elaine Paige or Maggie Smith ; or producing - Mr. Lloyd Webber or Disney Corporation . These shows will be booked pretty solid for several weeks or months after opening night , and longer if reviews and public word of mouth are favourable . <p> Reading the Baz Bamigboye showbiz column in the Daily Mail newspaper on a Friday will keep you abreast of developments , giving details of what is likely to happen . Theatremonkey finds this better than watching TV interviews or other journalists reports - Baz is just so far ahead of the pack . <p> The online e-mailing list run by www.whatsonstage.com offers a weekly newsletter with solid advance rumours . The theatremonkey homepage carries " live " updates of all articles rounded up in that particular email . <p> Group sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes go on sale to groups before the general public .

Get a date for tickets going on sale . If they can not or will not say , watch for teaser advertisements . These will appear in the Press - notably the London Evening Standard on Fridays , The Sunday Times Culture section and the Friday Daily Mail . Details of booking opening dates are often in small print in the adverts - some even offer advance booking just for readers . <p> An old-fashioned method is Theatremonkey sending a letter to the box office a couple of weeks before this date requesting tickets . Mark the envelope clearly with the show title and ' Advance Box Office ' . State a number of dates , specify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be prepared to pay . Give a daytime and evening contact telephone number for queries , and enclose a stamped , self-addressed envelope for return of tickets . Seeletter on this site for an effective example . <p> Theatremonkey notes that postal ticket requests are often processed early and this method often gets the best tickets . Check , though , that the box office is accepting postal bookings before trying this , however . <p> A very large advertisement in the Sunday Times Culture section signifies the opening of major show telephone bookings , traditionally at 10a.m. that day . Phone the hotline number at a bit before or a bit after , then try again at random intervals . Oddly , most people try again every five minutes . If you call , say , every seven and a quarter , your call will avoid the switchboard logjam and get answered first ! Do remember to check the small print beside phone numbers , and only dial those without booking fees or low service charges ! <p> One trend ( since " Breath Of Life " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority internet booking two weeks before tickets are sold by any other method . The news is spread by email to subscribers to particular lists . Those particularly used to launch offers are run on www.lastminute.comand www.whatsonstage.com . Getting onto these lists is free and worthwhile- they do not sell your details on , and the information is invaluable . Additionally the " Priority Membership " paid subscription scheme run by www.ticketmaster.co.uk is often used . This system may well be the future of popular show booking in the future , so is well worth knowing about . <p> Another development is the producer " holding off sale " some prime seats for many performances when booking initially opens , then trickling them back on sale as it gets closer to opening night . Worth ringing regularly if you ca n't get decent seats initially , as in a week or three they might have something good ... <p> Beat the ' Line Busy ' toneTheatre chains Really Useful and Ambassador both have centralised phonerooms . No matter which theatre in the chain you dial , your call is routed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations systems at ALL theatres in the chain .

Learn where the " book now " buttons are , as it saves time on the day ... and register an account with them , if you do n't already have one . Do that be choosing a seat for something you do n't want to see , setting up your email , postal address and password details , then not actually buying the ticket . Make a note of your password and keep it safe , ready for the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Donmar Warehouse by using ATG Tickets ( who run that venue 's box office ) online booking system to the full : <p> Booking opened at 9am . <p> At 8.57am , the monkey logged on to the donmarwarehouse.com website - their venue , the only access to tickets is via their site initially . <p> It followed the instructions there to " Book Now " and found itself on the dedicated page of the ATG website at 8.58am . <p> It was able to get to the " calendar " and see the list of performances . In Internet Explorer 11 anyway , it could then open multiple dates in separate tabs . <p> Here 's the good bit : <p> Each tab initially showed " booking will open at 9am . " Come 9am , each tab AUTOMATICALLY showed " in a queue , waiting time 1 minute " or 30 seconds or whatever . So it did n't have to " refresh " anything , just wait and watch each tab top tag go from spinning to " book .

Two or more computers / tablets also helps provide further options , of course . <p> Remember too : if the system is busy or keeps " crashing , " it at least means that nobody else can book either - so you should still have a fair chance ... <p> Really Useful By the by , at many theatre box offices , should you call in person , you can often ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show hosted by the chain at the same time as buying your tickets for the current resident production . This saves tourist time and feet and is a little known facility . But very useful . Just do not do it in the hour before the show starts , or those waiting to collect tickets may lynch you . <p> Mailing listsThe other best method of jumping the line . Prior to Nicole Kidman 's London debut , thousands joined the Donmar list for advance booking privilege . They were probably about the only ones to get in . No waiting for adverts , the news is delivered in good time to your door . Just remember to act on the same day you get the details - mailing lists are huge and full of avid theatregoers all competing with you .

Membership is 18 per year . Details on 020 7369 1789 . <p> Hey , Mr Producer ! Many shows in West End theatres are developed by theatre companies like the National Theatre , Royal Shakespeare Company or touring companies with homes outside London . In addition to the West End theatre 's box office , these companies may well keep an allocation of tickets themselves , selling them via their own website . For example , the official box office for " War Horse " at the New London Theatre is run by See Tickets for theatre owner the Really Useful Group . BUT the show was originally developed at the National Theatre ... who have an allocation of tickets at their own website , with a far lower booking fee . Worth knowing , feels the monkey . <p> Visitors to London , Theatremonkey knows , often can not book the months ahead that the above methods require . So to get in on short notice <p> Ask for the leastSingle seats are easier to come by than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an odd ticket - insist to the clerk that they check the computer properly . Sadly too many , especially in phonerooms at busy times , will believe the hype and will not . But be polite . If your party is prepared to split up you have a chance . This advice should possibly be ignored by those on a first date though . <p> Reader Ali agrees on this point , " Just a note on getting tickets I was on my own , buying only one ticket ( obviously ! ) I was offered several good options for seats ... I have in the past bought 3 single tickets for my family , sometimes scattered all through the theatre , in order to get to see a show after all , you are watching the show , not chatting , and you can always meet up in the interval . You get a better choice if you buy singles , as they fit you in the gaps , so the seats may be very , very good . It would n't necessarily work if you have young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show is the important thing , do not be picky about date , time , price or seat location . Even theatremonkey has accepted bad or expensive seats on occasion just to ' be there ' for an event . Accept the good seats ( except house seats as below ) are gone , and be grateful to get in at all . <p> Some theatres - notably the Delfont Mackintosh chain , may allow you to " trade up " to better seats if you spot any at least 24 hours before the show . You have to pay the difference in price , but it means you can take advantage of extra good tickets being released . <p> Small point to remember : once you are sure that the clerk has made the effort to look for tickets on your chosen date , accept their word that there are none . Box office staff like selling all available tickets , and will do so if they can . Most are not magicians , though , and can not produce tickets which really and genuinely do n't exist ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically means the show is sold out the second the word " hits the street " . Not true . In London the public tend to buy seats around three weeks ahead . In the case of a new smash hit show review , the first few days after opening will often be less busy than you expect , so tickets will often be available ! <p> Try the Returns and / or " Day Seats " lineEven sold out shows have tickets left on the day of performance . These usually consist of tickets given back to the box office by customers unable to use them , or agencies unable to sell their stock . A few even come from Police and Consumer Protection officers who have confiscated tout 's stock . Also , the theatre usually has n't sold the type of seats mentioned above . Best of all are added a few prime seats called ' house tickets ' normally kept back for VIP / managers use but not required that day . <p> Some theatres , notably the Royal National , the Royal Shakespeare Company ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyceum also keep back a few seats deliberately for sale on the day of performance as a public service and anti tout measure . Increasingly , this trend is being followed by the most popular musicals and plays at other venues , with the front row of the stalls being held for sale on the day - often more cheaply ( though they may have a slightly restricted view of the stage , particularly where the height of the stage prevents seeing the actors ' feet ! ) . <p> Returns lines form outside the theatre from around 8a.m , earlier for really hot shows and in summer . Tickets go on sale at 10 a.m. and continue to be sold as they come in , right through until curtain up time , so stick around until then - even if it seems " all hope " is gone , you never know ! Wrap up warm , take refreshments , and be prepared to wait . Make sure that you also take BOTH credit cards AND cash too , to the value of the most expensive tickets ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box offices insist that you pay with one or the other specifically , depending on the source of the tickets they are selling you . <p> A reader says , " You can usually get really good returns at the Donmar for a Sat eve if you get there by about 6 and are prepared to wait ; we got front row tickets for " Frost Nixon " for example . It 's first come first served and the BO staff are really helpful , and you need cash . If there 's two of you , one can sit and wait and the other can shop in Covent Garden , fetch supplies of food etc . I 've had similar experiences for other sold out shows there and at the Almeida , more than once . <p> The Royal Court 's system works on the basis that you turn up after a certain time on the day and get given a card with a number ; you then go back at a certain time ( I think half an hour before the start time , but you would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had returned in the order of your numbered card . We got great tickets for ' the Seagull ' last year ( 2007 ) . " <p> Reader Mark also notes that unsold ' Day Seats ' may end up being sold either online or by telephone through the central phoneroom of each theatre once demand at the counter has been satisfied . <p> Pay for the VIP treatmentMost theatres offer this service - ask the box office for details . Choose from champagne at the interval to a full meal , private rooms or just a programme and chocolates . All with the best seats included . Not cheap at 100 per person upwards , but memorable . <p> If you happen to be staying in a hotel with a concierge service , ask them to obtain seats for you . Members of the concierge service organisation ' Golden Keys ' co-operate to make the impossible seem easy . It will cost plenty , but the tickets produced will not be stolen or fake - unlike those offered by ticket touts / scalpers . Information about the organisation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hotels at which members operate . <p> Scale the peaksThe busiest performances are Saturday then Friday evening . Next come Saturday and Sunday matinees , especially for child friendly shows e.g. The Lion King ; and Thursday evenings . At the Royal National Theatre midweek matinees are also busy as mailing list members seem to prefer them and take many of the available tickets during their priority booking period . Choose Monday to Wednesday Evenings and midweek matinees ( except at the National Theatre ) as you stand a better chance in general . <p> Theatremonkey reckons Tuesday evenings and the midweek matinees often see the cast give the best performances of the week . <p> Extra PerformancesExtra performances of hit shows are often scheduled outside the normal pattern of Monday to Saturday night plus two afternoons . Either extra performances are added during a bank holiday week to make up for missed evenings / cash in on Christmas or School holiday time , or a charity midnight show will run as a fundraiser . Tickets often go on sale at short notice and seats are often left over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galas may add a donation to the price , but in the cheapest seats it will often not be too much and at least you get to see the play . <p> STAR AgenciesAgencies , because they charge a bit more , can have tickets when the theatre has sold out . Check . Remember to see the Avoid Touts page on this site . <p> Do note , though , that many agents no longer have actual reserved " allocations , " instead , they log into the theatre 's stock and share that . This means of course that if the theatre is sold out , so is the agent . The only exceptions are the few agencies continuing with their own supplies , and those times when a company has bought tickets in advance and so may have some left . <p> Ticketmaster 0161 385 3211 , while often also acting for the box office , occasionally have single seats too , which can be picked up by the lucky ! <p> Local Coach TripsSome coach tour companies within fifty miles of London run inclusive trips combining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies often schedule well ahead and will have bought great seats at group rates in anticipation of a new hit show . The result is a package for less than the price of a ticket alone . They have fifty coach seats to fill from the local population . Why not travel a little way out of town ; see a new place in the day then join them for the trip . If staying in the West End just politely tell the driver you will not be returning with the coach to the starting point after the show . <p> Overseas AgentsTicket Agencies in other countries often have access to an allocation of tickets reserved exclusively for London bound tourists . An overseas call or hit on their website gives access to theses tickets . Some may refuse to sell to UK credit card holders without overseas addresses , but it is worth a try . <p> PackagesBooking a hotel room with a theatre ticket included in the price can sometimes be done at short notice .

Capital Breaks and Tickettree.com are ones to try . <p> Boxes and Restricted ViewsContact the box office by direct phone line or drop in . Seats in boxes and behind pillars are not generally publicised as being available to the public . Theatremonkey notes one occasion where the clerk did n't even know the seats existed , despite being marked on the plan in front of her ! Check the best ones on this site using either Venue Names or Show Titles A to Z <p> Hang aroundInevitably , some disgruntled theatregoer leaves a performance early . Try asking nicely to buy their ticket . Half a show is better than none . Similarly , touts stuck with tickets after curtain up can offer them cheap or even bin the tickets they were holding . Up to your morals to use this method . See Avoid Touts on this site . <p> You could even try offering cash / use of your yacht / mind or any legally tradable commodity , to arriving audience members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Online AuctionsTickets for sold out events , notably concerts , are often offered for sale on online auction / marketplace sites . While sellers may well be legitimate , and abiding by the trading site 's purchase codes , you have no way of telling who they are . Inadvertently you could be buying from a tout / scalper . Prices are also very high and there is no guarantee the venue will admit you even with your expensive ticket . " Let the buyer beware " is the motto here . <p> Theatremonkey does not endorse buying from these sources . Links from auctions to this website are not made by theatremonkey and theatremonkey.com DOES NOT take responsibility for the legitimacy of the seller or tickets being offered . <p> Death Rattles and SuntansIf a " star " name is off , either due to plague or scheduled holiday , the box office is often left with seats even if all other performances are sold out . You 'll see the show - often with highly talented actors covering the star role - without having to wait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marauding germs , it means tickets often come available on the day as fans swap them for other performances ( if the producer allows it ) . Worth asking the box office either by telephone or at the counter if you see " Tonight Mr Wonderful is Off " notices at the theatre . <p> Final NoteMonkey advice is to ignore the " hype " surrounding the concept of " sold out shows " . The only time a show really will be a tough ticket to get is if it is staged in a venue with less than 300 to 400 seats - the Donmar Warehouse , Trafalgar Studio 2 , Royal Court and Pit only . Other London theatres are much larger and take a little more filling ! <p> Very often , once initial press coverage has died down ( around two weeks in London ) those who bought tickets have second thoughts - and frequently return them to the box office . <p> To give one example , a play starring a well known actress was said to be " sold out " for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back more seats than it could sell - so every night there were a few tickets left .... worth remembering , thinks the monkey . <p> Final , final note for Pop Concert fans ... Like theatre , tickets for press-hyped sold out events are actually often easier to obtain than folk think . If you miss out in the initial ballyhoo when " tickets all sold out in 1 hour on the first day they went on sale , " then monkey advice is to " wait and see . " <p> First , when things have settled down a few hours or days later , often checking official websites reveal single tickets left for a particular date . <p> Around 4 to 6 weeks before the show takes place things get even clearer . The stage design is fixed and so some seats that were held back in case they had a restricted view / were needed for technical reasons are placed on sale . At the same time , unsold tickets from package tour operators and agencies as well as unwanted VIP tickets are also released ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the show ! Basically , by waiting rather than feeding the greed of an auction site tout , you 'll often get stunning seats near the front without the hassle of the opening day sales fight . <p> A reader relates her own experiences , " When trying to book Miley Cyrus tickets in 2009 , I rang Ticketmaster up and they said to me , " Oh , more seats will be released , " - which meant another show . The same as with Barry Manilow 2008 . So , be friendly and they will give you information . <p> Also , they hold back tickets until the last week . I was looking at the second Jonas Brothers show at Wembley and getting not very good seats until about 5 days before - where I was getting central seats as the concert was in the round . These were near disabled seats which they might release to fill the gaps where the artists could see them from the stage . " <p> It does n't happen this way every time of course , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 ... <p> Also worth noting is a reader 's experience of " pre sale " priority booking , in 2010 , " I paid 29 with fees for each ticket from a presale for " The Wanted " and I got block 2 in the stalls , Row S , seats 69 to 70 . I was wondering do I have a claim to email the company and ask why I have got such bad seats from a presale ? I have paid a total of 60 on these two tickets and I struggled with a crashed website and when the site came back on I had to book tickets on my phone . " <p> The monkey notes that " pre sale " is usually from an allocation of tickets ... and they may not be the best available ...

This means something as drastic as a close family death or hospitalisation . <p> Sales are usually final , so if no help is coming , pass tickets to friends . This attitude sucks , but prevents everyone who bought seats in advance for a critical flop from backing out - saving the producer 's income .

With huge ticket prices , this is a great way to protect your investment . It is a useful option to consider where offered , feels the monkey ; who hopes all theatres will get round to offering it soon ! <p> Ticket Not Arrived Contact your point-of-sale - box office or ticket agency , online or by phone , with at least 48 hours to go , if possible . They can normally arrange duplicates or confirm that the originals are being held at the box office ( either because you booked too late for them to be sent - every company has a different policy on that ) , or due to some other administrative error they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " I was getting worried because the theatre site says tickets should be posted 5 days before show date - and mine had n't come by the 1st of August , for my show on the 5th .

My tickets came on the 2nd August and I was thinking of getting them signed by the cast ... so I kept them ! <p> When I went to get my duplicate tickets , it did n't seem that any had been sent ! So I was allowed to use the proper ones . Hence my advice is keep your tickets if they do arrive , despite it saying they become null and void !

Arrive early to take your seat as it will give staff more time to sort out the problem . In theatre , possession is NOT nine tenths of the law , so you can be told to move , leave , or as theatremonkey has been , get forcibly ejected . <p> Theatres put the people who bought tickets from their own box office first .

In this case , the person buying from the owner has the right to sit there . <p> If it all goes wrong , you will be moved to seats kept back for such problems . These will be ( in a half full theatre ) whatever the management are sure is unsold , and will often be pretty decent .

If the worst happens , and it is not your fault , take any inferior seat given under protest , insist on free drinks and programmes at half time , and get it noted in writing that you reserve the right to take further action at a later date . You have a legally binding contract , which the ticket provider has breached , your evening has been ruined as you feel humiliated , and who can enjoy the play after such an ordeal . So , use the complaint chain explained below . <p> Ca n't fit into my seatLegroom is generally the reason ... The monkey had that experience in 2012 - it was an invited guest so could n't choose its seat in advance ... and ended up in one of the most notoriously cramped rows of seats that it normally warns readers against . What it did was leave the seat before the show started , and scouted another , much further back and in a cheaper section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last moment to check the seat had n't been sold , then asked an usher if it could move - making clear it had come from a more expensive seat . The usher agreed , and the monkey was very happy . <p> Now , the interesting bit . At the interval , the monkey did n't dare move in case others with similar legroom issues also tried to change seat . Well , it was amused that the usher and house manager stood behind its seat , having the following conversation by radio with the box office , " no , we ca n't move them there , somebody has already taken that one for the same reason ! " <p> Two things to learn from this 1 ) If you have to move ALWAYS ask a member of staff first . 2 ) ALWAYS be first to move , and move early . If you are uncomfortable , chances are others will be too . If you move first , you are first in line to get the best of the seats left over AND , EQUALLY IMPORTANT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others by being uncomfortable / having to move once the performance has started . <p> Got Moved / Not Happy With Your Seat A reader in 2015 noted that his front row upper circle ( second tier ) seat was converted to a stalls ( ground floor ) ticket on arrival , as the circle was closed . Trouble was , the new - and more expensive - seat was at the side and a long way back . <p> A day later , he asked the monkey what he should have done . Monkey reply was , " complain at the time , to front of house or box office staff . " They will try and help you if they can . <p> If they ca n't , make sure the complaint is recorded by a staff member , and take it up with the ticket supplier . Chances are , alas , that you wo n't get very far , but worth a try . <p> Extra Row Added If you 've booked a long way ahead , sometimes the front rows are not fixed until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage begin . Thus your front row seat could become a second or even third row ticket , or have a restricted view . If it 's a view or legroom issue , theatres normally contact you and will move your seat , no problem . If there is n't an issue with view , and you find out about it in time , theatres do usually move folk who ask . Otherwise , the practicalities of re-contacting everyone are beyond them . Partly because new rows may not have the same number of seats or the row will be used for day seats or have a restriction issue like view or legroom . If you are set on the front row , the rule is , keep checking if you can . P.S. Rows can also be removed , and theatres do n't always tell you that either , just hand you a new ticket on the day ... sometimes after you 've found your ticket does n't exist ... <p> A Featured Actor is Not AppearingA condition of sale printed on the back of every ticket states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Complaining does no good whatsoever . If you specifically want to see that person , check with the actual theatre box office before buying your ticket . You stand the best chance of seeing the performer work on a Friday or Saturday Evening , the least chance at a midweek matinee , or a Monday or Thursday Evening . <p> Cancelled PerformanceIf the theatre cancels the show in advance , they will attempt to contact you and offer a free exchange or refund of your tickets . For this reason , make sure when you book that they have accurate contact telephone numbers . No other compensation is payable , and they will not pay compensation for anything else , like a wasted travel ticket . You can try getting something out of the theatre chain general manager at company head office if the cancellation was at less than 24 hours notice , but theatremonkey experience is that you will get nowhere . <p> If the show is cancelled during the performance , a refund is only made if less than half the performance is given .

No money is ever refunded except to school parties . No extra compensation , though . <p> Arrived LateRules vary , but again , no refunds are possible . If a major problem occurs , like the Underground train system failing , the performance will be delayed anyway . Otherwise , you are at the mercy of the theatre . Methods of dealing with latecomers include : <p> Excluding them until a suitable break in the show or even until the half time interval . You may be allowed to watch on a silent TV monitor in the bar if you are lucky . <p> Seating at the back of the theatre until the interval , when you can move forward to your real seat . <p> Just asking you to leave without a refund . Normally the first two apply , but why risk it . Allow plenty of time instead . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest acoustics . Add modern sound equipment and you have the potential to turn the softest song into a rock concert . Sound is balanced from a desk usually sited in the rear stalls . Sitting two rows in front of this desk will give the best balance in the theatre and avoid the people on the desk disturbing you . Sitting in the rear upper circle or balcony will produce the quietest sound , the front stalls the loudest . <p> If you really have a gripe , try a word with the folk on the desk at the interval . Occasionally they can help . Otherwise , ask to move seats . Unfortunately , managers do not seem to care if the sound of ' Les MisTrables ' is making you miserable , and , generally , no refunds are made . <p> Getting i 'll during the showFirst aid is available from either a St Johns Ambulance Brigade volunteer , or the resident first aider . <p> No refunds if you miss the show is the official policy , but a theatremonkey reader has found a much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned about first aid being available , but no refunds .

" <p> The monkey is delighted that such great customer service is practiced . <p> Negligence and TheftIf a member of staff injures you or damages your property , get the house manager immediately , take details of any independent witnesses , then claim costs from the theatre 's insurers . <p> A serious safety failing , like a locked fire door , should be reported to the house manager , and also to the local council health and safety office .

We asked him to be quiet , and he started to threaten me loudly with violence ( he was rather drunk ) .

Some actors have since left the cast . <p> There 's a reason the monkey is able to re-visit this show after 9 years ... it remains a ( pure ) waterproof hit , as slick as its first night . <p> After all these years , it 's very clear just what a well-constructed piece it is . Memorable songs , satisfying story that makes its two and three-quarter hours fly by like a magic broomstick . <p> Best of all , at the performance the monkey saw , a prediction it made back in September 2011 came true . With regular Emma Hatton unavailable , Natalie Andreou ( pictured above ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Ms Andreou did in September 2011 for Amy Pemberton in " Rock Of Ages . " The monkey said then that " Ms Andreou is n't known but should be , and soon . A leading lady who producers should be falling over themselves to sign to whichever musical takes her fancy . " The monkey is so glad the producers of " Wicked " took its advice . <p> At the risk of channelling its " Wicked inner fangirl " Natalie Andreou smashes her role out of the ballpark . The monkey was almost in tears with her " I 'm Not That Girl , " and " Defying Gravity " is a triumph . If this is her third performance , her 103rd will be something . Andreou is someone special in musical theatre . If you can catch another of her nights " on , " do . <p> Savannah Stevenson ( Galinda ) and Martyn Ellis ( The Wizard ) are the other stand out performances , both managing engaging performances . The ensemble too put in a fine effort on a " double performance " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps the narrative . <p> This show remains the perfect teen treat as an introduction to musical theatre . LONG ... <p> This review refers to the original cast . Casting has now changed . " Lyrics and music and book , oh my ! " Proof , if proof were needed , that the old-fashioned Broadway musical is n't dead . The story is basically the traditional " green girl wants boy , boy wants yellow girl " ending with green girl turning boy yellow , and yellow and green girl settling their differences - with some animal rights stuff and zingy one liners thrown in . The satisfaction is in the neat dovetailing with the classic film - find out how the well loved characters became what they are ; the downside is overlong sequences that look great but add twenty minutes of ballast to the proceedings . <p> This is very much a show of two halves . The first has Winnie " My So Called Life " Holzman channel female adolescence with acuity once again . If business starts to slip , producers should re-paint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds and provide free popcorn , cosmetics and a pizza delivery service . Very much attuned to the sleepover crowd , the fun " Popular " and ' I wish ' numbers " The Wizard and I " and " I 'm Not That Girl " are arrows to teenage hearts . Once the director realises " Popular " works way better with an American air-head accent than it does with a British spoof-Sloane one , it 'll be the perfect " DVD night in " substitute . That is n't to say Helen Dallimore should be upset by frank analysis , but the director should consider the show in need of personality dialysis and restore it to the original ( United States ) state at the next cast change . Oh , and that line is probably the " wittiest " in the show - you can almost hear Sondheim scream as it is sung . <p> Act two grows progressively darker , and the resolutions come late into it . Tighter than act one , and noticeably more adult , it eschews the clumsy shifts of place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show comes in at the sub-three hour mark . The searing " As Long as You 're Mine " and insightful " For Good " deserved time that " Wizomania " pointlessly occupies and could have turned a good show into an unforgettable one . Time to contemplate motives , cause and effect are limited , and the monkey would have appreciated more of it spaced through the production . <p> Expensively staged , occasionally buckling under its own spectacular mass , set ( Elphaba could perhaps have flown properly had there been space ) and a desire to give the audience every penny of the production costs in spectacle over substance , this is the golden era of musicals brought into the 21st century . Those old musicals had their faults , as does this , but ultimately a show succeeds on how deep its songs and images engrave themselves in the memory . Probably too crass for the current " post war " musical lover ( though Schwartz produces some of his best work here ) , Wicked will still worm its way into the affections of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " standard " in fifty years time .

@@45561028 @5561028/ <p> You were the inspiration for this site . The following bits of information do n't fit elsewhere , but have been asked so often of this monkey by visitors that here seems a good place to put it all . Please add to this list Contact Us . <p> One reader produced a summary of this experience , which they hope will help others : " As an overseas visitor , what worked best for me was this : I studied the seating charts on this website and made notes of what rows or seats I preferred with , if possible , more than one date that would work . For me , the object was to get the best possible seat and I could be a little flexible with the date . I then called the box office direct and asked for the seats I wanted or else something close . It worked for me because the seating charts and recommended seats were so helpful . I found it was best to be prepared with a little advance knowledge " . <p> The monkey helps these pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of tips : <p> Help the Box Office ClerkClerks get a rough deal ( cue violins ) facing the public every day . Help them when making a booking by listing ( before calling them ) , your a choice of dates and prices , and knowing which seats you prefer . And have your credit card to hand . If you are prepared , the whole booking thing is way simpler and less painful for both parties involved ! <p> As a rule , most expensive seats are in the Stalls and Dress Circle , with a few rows at the back a bit cheaper . Third and fourth prices are in the Upper Circle , with the balcony the cheapest . Restricted view seats and boxes are often at a discount . Do note that seats in boxes are often individually numbered , and if you do n't buy all of them , then the other tickets will be sold to other people . <p> If you are shown a seating plan , the Stalls at the bottom of the page , with any circles / balconies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Stalls is always the largest block of seats with the most rows in it . Row A ( or a letter close to it ) is the front row in every section of a theatre , stalls or circles / balconies . Pillars often show up as black dots on seating plans , and an unusual white space in among a row of seats is also a giveaway . A wide white space between rows often means an aisle - and in the Circles this can also often mean a wall or bars in front of the next row of seats ... <p> Monkey has had reports that both online booking systems and telephone sales clerks have been splitting small parties by placing one or more members away from the rest on the other side of the aisle ! The monkey advises scrutiny of the seating plans to make certain this does not happen to you . Also , do remember that some plans are more detailed than others , so do check more than one if you are not sure . <p> A reader also advises always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seats and prices can vary . The reader writes in February 2007 , " My greater surprise came when I called the box office to get better seats than were advertised on the website for Mary Poppins . My children 's tickets were also discounted ! Instead of the 56 per seat we 'd been bracing ourselves to pay , the children 's tickets were 29 each ! You might want to pass along this information to your readers because it was *definitely* worth a phone call ( even though I use a discounted calling program so it 's cheap anyway ) to save so much money ! " <p> Another reader says , " " When trying to book Miley Cyrus tickets in 2009 , I rang Ticketmaster up and they said to me , " Oh , more seats will be released , " - which meant another show . The same as with Barry Manilow 2008 . So , be friendly and they will give you information . <p> Also , they hold back tickets until the last week . I was looking at the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats until about 5 days before - where I was getting central seats as the concert was in the round . These were near disabled seats which they might release to fill the gaps where the artists could see them from the stage . " <p> Please also be aware that if an event is cancelled , refunds may be limited to the price of the ticket only , with the ' booking fee ' not refunded . This applies particularly to pop concert events . <p> Accepted Credit and Debit CardsAll theatre ticket sellers accept any plastic with the international Visa or MasterCard Symbol on it . They also take American Express ( but will try to talk you out of using it as the commission rate they get charged by the bank is very high - 3.5%+ ; as against 1.5% for other cards ) . London theatres also accept Diners Club , but most ticket agents do not . Japanese card JCB is also accepted in the theatres themselves and by ticket agencies - once you explain it to them ! <p> Debit cards Maestro ( formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ticketmaster . Other retailers are beginning to take them but it varies . If using this method and the clerk is unsure , get them to run the number through the machine to see if the transaction is authorised . Argue that it should in the case of Connect / Delta because they carry the Visa symbol ! <p> For some reason , however , nobody currently accepts Visa Electron . The monkey will keep you posted if that changes ! <p> The actual cardholder MUST be present and produce the credit card used to make the booking , when collecting tickets at the box office counter on the day of the performance . VERY IMPORTANT : Sometimes , when your credit card expires , the new one will have a different number . IF YOUR CARD IS DUE TO EXPIRE BEFORE THE DATE YOU ARE BOOKED TO GO TO THE THEATRE , KEEP YOUR OLD CARD TO MAKE IT EASY TO COLLECT YOUR TICKETS . <p> Theatremonkey 's American friend Brian McKinney ( of late Goodshow.com renown ) says that , " I booked some plays through your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card company turned me down , so I booked them with my bank direct withdrawal card . Later , I received an automated message from the credit card company , asking if I had tried to book seats through a dance club ( LTC ) . You might warn Americans to call their card companies before they order tickets . " <p> Sound advice , thinks the monkey , who would also add that if you are going to make a large transaction - half a dozen " premium priced " tickets for example - it can be worth anyone anywhere notifying their card company in advance . <p> Ticket InsuranceMany theatres now sell ticket insurance scheme " TicketPlan " . This guarantees you your money back if you , a close relative or person accompanying you to the show : is too i 'll / had an accident / died . They even notify the theatre of your non-appearance ; so you do not have to worry ! <p> You are also covered if your car breaks down en-route , or if public transport fails due to industrial action or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great way to protect your investment . It is a useful option to consider where offered , feels the monkey . <p> Dress at the theatreOnce when this monkey 's uncle was a monkey 's great-grandson , the term Dress Circle meant just that - full Evening Dress for all seated there , or else . Now dress is almost always informal . Theatremonkeys can get away with jeans , sweatshirts and trainers at all performances except first nights and the first Saturday evening of a new show when a sober lounge suit should get an airing . Comfort is first on the list . In general , suits , jackets , slacks or casual wear are acceptable for men at almost all times - casual especially during the afternoons . Suits really are only compulsory at openings , but are frequently seen on weekend evenings . <p> Monkeyesses as usual have a sartorial minefield to negotiate . Dress for comfort and to embarrass any hairy companion to look good for you . As for theatremonkeys , casual is fine at most performances , dresses , slacks , jeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable evening attire , not elaborate unless you are a celebrity though ! Weekend evenings too can be a bit dressier than a weekday . <p> One tip though , if sitting anywhere but the Stalls , monkeyesses should consider skirt length carefully . Your knees will often be at head height to the person in front . A monkeyesse of the theatremonkey site 's acquaintance wore a microskirt and spent the performance in mortal terror of offering a view to the gentleman in front which he had n't reckoned on . This is passed on purely for information . But Theatremonkey thinks it is worth knowing . <p> In general London nights are cool , even in summer . It is worth remembering a warm garment if you have a long journey home after the evening performance as temperatures will have plummeted while you enjoyed the show . This tip also beats an over enthusiastic air conditioning system too . <p> TippingNot expected in London Theatres unless something is way beyond the call of duty . Theatremonkey has tipped a brave usherette for retrieving a shoe from the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit card number to the usual address ) . <p> Taking Photographs and RecordingsStrictly forbidden inside theatres for copyright and safety reasons . Flash photography at the wrong moment ended a dancer 's career when it caused her to slip as she was momentarily dazzled . Add to this the fact you are blocking the rest of the audience 's view as well and you have a pretty selfish act . <p> For copyright reasons cameras are often confiscated and film destroyed before return . If you want production photographs , buy the souvenir brochure ( see below ) . The pictures will be better than the shadows your own camera will return anyway . Photographs of the auditorium should be taken only with management permission . Ask . <p> Recording is also strictly forbidden as it again infringes copyright . Buy a commercially available soundtrack from a high street shop ( not the foyer , which sells at full price ) . Illegal recordings of all shows exist , up to your conscience to decide if you are going down this route . Theatremonkey does n't . <p> Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain rises . Remember that rustling sweet wrappers and bags annoy those around you , and please , do n't talk during the quiet bits of music or dialogue . Wait for the interval or the end . Not eating and only laughing / crying / gasping to the action on stage will make you look like a true inhibited British theatregoer and endear you to them all . <p> SoundMusicals in the West End can be over amplified for some . Sound is balanced from a desk usually sited in the rear stalls . Sitting two rows in front of this desk will give the best balance in the theatre and avoid the people on the desk disturbing you . Sitting in the rear upper circle or balcony will produce the quietest sound , the front stalls the loudest . <p> One reader opines , though : " My opinion is that especially RU theatres use underbalcony DandB speakers to give the privilege for the ' less rich ' to enjoy the terrible front stalls loud sound in the back of upper circle . Let 's not generalise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the shows sound great . Good job . " <p> That Ringing BellA bell normally sounds in the auditorium and foyers at around five minutes before the curtain rises . It usually repeats at one minute intervals thereafter . <p> It warns you to take your seat as the show is about to start . It also notifies the theatre staff to check that the restrooms and foyers are clear . This ensures that the curtain does not go up until almost everyone in the audience has been seated , since in the event of a problem , backstage staff can hold off the start for a few minutes if necessary . <p> At the Royal National Theatre , a civilised announcement is made - but the bells are so much more traditional thinks theatremonkey ! <p> ApplauseThis will attract controversy . Theatremonkey has been asked this many times by overseas visitors baffled at the lack of response of British audiences . Obviously spontaneous applause/laughter let 's actors know the audience is still awake . In general though , Brits tend to wait for the end of the act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters or exits or amazes is fine , but some visitors feel compelled to applaud every song in a musical or scene in a play , then get embarrassed when noone else joins in . It seems to this monkey not really a feature of London theatre ( shame ? you decide ) . <p> A standing ovation is usually saved until the end as the cast takes their final bows . Feel free if you are really impressed . Theatremonkey does . <p> I 'm larger than average , can you help on locating suitable seats ? A page of advice is available by clicking here . <p> Car ParkingMany box offices allow you to use a car park space , at a discount , along with your show seats - and the Royal Albert Hall let 's you pre-book spaces too . Worthwhile and guarantees you a place to park without hassle on arrival . The " Theatreland Parking Scheme " may be available at car parks near may West End venues .

Spaces CAN NOT be reserved at these prices , though . <p> If you choose the " Theatreland Parking Scheme " , you must get your car park ticket validated at the theatre 's box office counter ( the theatre attendant will insert the car parking ticket into a small machine which updates the information held on the magnetic strip on the reverse , thus enabling the discount ) . When you pay using the machines at the car park , 50% will be deducted from the full tariff . You may park for up to 24 hours using this scheme and it is endorsed by the Society of London Theatre . <p> 1 ) **25;1627;TOOLONG or Orchestra Stalls .

Ushers inside the auditorium itself , and occasionally in the foyer sell it . <p> A glossy ' Souvenir Brochure ' priced around 7 - 10 is sold in addition to programmes at the big musicals . This is sold in the foyer , in order to shift the stock before the cheaper option is discovered inside the auditorium . This brochure contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles about its ' creation .

Arrive early to get a set , and if you must try another row to get some , take them from the ends of the row as they will be easier to return at the end of the performance . <p> Do not forget to return them , they are loaned , and theatregoers have been prosecuted in the past for theft . If you can not return them to a holder , hand them to a member of staff or leave them on your seat top . <p> Keen theatremonkeys buy their own , but you have to see a lot of shows to justify the cost . <p> Read the playSeriously . If the play is unfamiliar , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three scenes makes it easier to get involved in the action . <p> Foreign Language AssistanceBuying tickets is unfortunately in English unless you strike lucky with a bilingual clerk . Using ticket agencies based in the major department stores - Harrods and Selfridges ; where an interpreter can be called on increases chances of help . Buying from an authorised agent in your home country is sadly the best riposte to monoglot Englanders . <p> Gift VouchersA number of companies , including the Society of London Theatre ( SOLT ) sell Gift Vouchers ( Gift Certificates ) which can be exchanged for tickets . The monkey says , " Think . " <p> Theatre Tokens is a non for profit scheme run on behalf on the UK theatre industry and is administered by The Society of London Theatre . Theatre Tokens never expire unlike other similar vouchers and are available in 5 , 10 , 20 and 50 denominations . Change is also given in Theatre Tokens should the tickets be less than the Theatre Token you hold . Choose from over 230 different theatres right across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half price ticket booths for on the day tickets . <p> Theatre Tokens are available direct from www.theatretokens.com 24/7 or on Tokenline 0870 164 8800 Monday to Friday during office hours and all orders are dispatched by first class post on the following business day . They are also available through a network of retails including all participating Theatres , WHSmiths , Borders , Waterstones and many Tourist Information Centres . <p> Large agencies also issue their own tokens for purchase through their own companies . The choice is baffling . As one reader reports in July 2007 , " I had a terribly problem getting tickets for " Billy Elliot . " I am leaving my job and was given a mix of theatre tokens and a Ticketmaster gift card as leaving presents ! Hurrah ! <p> However , when I phoned Ticketmaster to book tickets using the tokens and gift card I was passed from department to department for about 20 minutes only to be finally told that Ticketmaster DO NOT accept the Society of London Theatre Theatre Tokens for Billy Elliot . <p> Then I had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booking a seat next to the one that had been suggested to me by Ticketmaster . Thankfully the Box Office could sell me D26 in the circle and Ticketmaster still had seat D27 when I phoned back .. ! <p> A very difficult way of trying to get two seats together due to allocations and various odd rules . <p> The morale is - only ever ask for Theatre Tokens and go straight to the Box Office either in person or over the phone ! " <p> Another reader writes of an experience , " I recently received 50 worth of Theatre Tokens as a birthday present . I wanted to see ' Les MisTrables ' and pay with my Theatre Tokens through Ticketmaster , but I was told that because this is a popular show they wo n't accept tokens . I tried phoning back .

If you give them as a present , you are limiting the giftee to the unpopular shows , or preventing them from using the 2 for 1 offers . Steer very clear of Theatre Tokens . " <p> In fact , Ticketmaster do accept SOLT tokens for most shows - BUT users should be careful to use only the booking numbers listed in the gift voucher folder that comes with the tokens as they do n't accept them for all ... AND try and call weekdays 9am to 6pm when it is most likely the agency tokens office staff will be available to help ( often the general telephone team do n't know about tokens and can cause the kind of chaos the reader described above ) . Also , if you do have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8800 can help resolve issues . <p> The monkey KNOWS cash is a thoughtless gift , but still , in this case , consider if the recipient is going to be able to redeem them easily .....

I would n't say these seats are perfect by any stretch but you are close enough to hear everything , see most of it , even if from a side view , and of course covered if it rains .

Stalls have steps rather than slope between rows , quite shallow but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seats also narrower than those in the dress circle . Row Q is in an alcove at the back . No aisles at the ends of rows from D back . Rows A to D at the outer ends of the side blocks have a private door to them , if you know how to reach it ( use the side corridors leading to the stalls boxes , follow round to a big door just beyond them , saves a lot of pushing past in those rows ! ) . From row E back , the seats are right against the wall , so no access . The " restricted view " seats at the ends of rows are due to speakers / lighting . Only the outermost seats in B and C miss much , the inner two are total bargains usually , felt the monkey . The end one may lose a bit , but has legroom ... Legroom is fine up to 5ft 11 or so , B and C 1 and C 39 have nothing in front . The seats beside them - 3 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , depending on the production . With nothing in front , those end seats in row B has less legroom than C , as the seats are closer to the orchestra rail . Stalls boxes A and B have side views and miss the stage edges , as do C and M further back . D to L are in a horseshoe at the back and have a decent view over seats in front . <p> Dress Circle : Circle above overhangs at row B , ca n't see surtitles from H back , lose the very top of the stage at J and significant top at L. A very shallow rake to seats , except L , on a high step . C 2 and 51 have nothing in front . D 1 and 53 are angled at 45 degrees to the stage , with no legroom for a quarter of the seat , unlimited for the rest . D1 is slightly better angled . Side block aisle seats nearest the centre block have a little space for one leg to stretch into from row C back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , allowing longer legs to dangle a bit . Side block seats row A 1 and 72 look past lighting . Close to the stage , though . Legroom is nil in most of row A , 1 to 3 , 15 to 38 , 70 and 71 in particular . A 4 to 12 and 62 to 68 are OK to around 5ft 5 , even 5ft 7 if willing to use toe-room ( not for the monkey , though ) . Side block B and C , except those with nothing in front are OK to around 5ft 6 or so . Other seats in the main blocks from B to L are comfortable to 5ft 10 , K to 5ft 8 , at least . Dress Circle boxes have side views but seem excellent . A reader says of " Sunset Boulevard " in April 2016 , " We chose 75 ' restricted view ' seats in the dress circle on row C ( 44 and 45 ) .

Boxes have similar views to dress circle . <p> Balcony : High and misses sides or front of stage , depending where you sit . Seats are set high on the old concrete steps , so legroom is n't bad for those under 5ft 6 ( just avoid end seats in rows A to C ) , and row K is good for those up to 5ft 9 plus . End seats in row K - 1 , 6 , 7 , 19 , 20 , 32 , 33 , 45 , 46 and 51 have no arm rest on the aisle side , allowing further spread . <p> Of " Bat Out Of Hell " in June 2017 , a reader reports , " I do n't hate all musicals , because there are loads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , entertaining plays and novels appearing almost every week that is likely to remain the case .

Though free water was available . <p> I thoroughly enjoyed the show , it was overblown 70s rock , cheesy , no real story but the special effects team had obviously been allowed to run riot ! The atmosphere was great , friendly audience and a really fun evening . <p> Carrie . " <p> Another reader says , " Bat out of Hell Tuesday 27th June 2017 . Upper Circle K 38 Seat was at near the back , but the view was excellent and there was plenty of leg room . At this performance the Upper Circle was half empty and many people were moving to more expense seats lower down in the Upper Circle . <p> An excellent show , with fantastic visual effects and settings . The actors all had strong voices and easily carried to my seat . All the orchestrations were also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was my first rock musical , although I knew the music of Meat Loaf and I would certainly go to another after my experience . The actors received a well deserved standing ovation . " <p> Another reader says , " Given the theatrical nature of Meat Loafs performances and Jim Steinmans lyrics , it is a wonder Bat of of Hell ( the 5th best-selling album of all time ) has taken so long to be turned into a musical . Well finally it has . Taking over The Coliseum ( the ENO does n't  know what has hit it ! ) before heading to Canada . <p> OK , we know the show is a vehicle for the songs . And a story needs to be built purely to wrap around them . It is a very thin wrapping ! A wafer thin plot blends elements from Peter Pan , Romeo and Juliet , We Will Rock You , The Lost Boys , The Rocky Horror Show and Streets of Fire ( an unashamed guilty pleasure of mine ; possibly the most clichT-ridden movie of all time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round in my head as I write this ) . <p> The plot runs along the lines of BIT SPOILEY boy meets girl ( who how she knew him when it seems she had never been out ? ) , parents get in the way , girl finds parents getting jiggy , boys friends get girl for boy , someone gets jealous , father exploits it , bad stuff happens and a few boys resolve issues with girls ( and girls with girls as well ) END OF SPOILEY STUFF . <p> But so what ? The plot does what it is meant to do ; get you to those songs as quickly as possible . Given the whole script could probably be written out on a single sheet of paper , it manages to include drama , humour , romance , some bad language and smutty asides , and makes a three hour ( including interval ) show fly by . <p> And huge amount so credit to a ( mostly ) very young cast for belting out those songs with aplomb . Each cast member with a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those songs especially have a big ask vocally and the stage presence to make it convincing . <p> A real highlight for me were Christina Benningtons vocals as Raven . Yes , she could handle a rock song , but when asked to perform the one truly gentle , slow ballad , she gave it a tenderness that would have been all too easy to miss in the maelstrom of the other numbers ( if the producers of Wicked are sizing up potential new Ephabas , you could do a lot worse than heading over to The Coliseum to check her out ) . Also a big shout out to Ruben Van Keer , the alternate Strat on the night we went . He made the title song his own and his performance hit all the right notes as the time-locked lead . <p> A special SPOILER moment : Rob Fowler , how did you pull of that underwater costume change ! And then come to the surface to pound out yet another full-blast vocal ! SPOILER ENDS <p> I know some have grumbled about the amplifiers being turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lyrics at times ( well an awful lot really ) , which is a shame as he does pen a clever lyric . But with a band that good , I 'll forgive them ( a lot of people went to the front after the cast had left just to see the band , listen to them play out and applaud them ... this little theatre goer always does and so should you all ) . <p> I also wonder if the show would benefit from a smaller stage ; the impressive set ( really clever use of lighting ) filled it well , but at times when there were few performers on stage it seemed cavernous . <p> I do have a grump ; the chronic under-use of Sharon Sexton . She spends almost the entire time as the sidekick to another performer . But when she gets her chance at her big solo moment , she grabs it with both hands . <p> So what to make of Bat out of Hell ? If you 're looking for a complex plot , forget it . If you want a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get down there before 22nd August . <p> I think the night was best summed up by my wife Laura " It was utterly bonkers ... but we all need spot of bonkers now and again ! " <p> Oh , and can I please have those animatronic bats when they 're finished with them ! <p> Bob Pickett . " <p> The Roundhouse Theatre In June 2012 reader Chris B reports of " Twelfth Night , " : Circle A14 and B14 : Excellent clear view of the extremely expansive stage . You feel very close and the view is slightly side on but this makes no difference . There is a safety barrier just to the right which can easily be seen around and does n't impact view . There is plenty of leg room , especially with both seats being an aisle seat . " <p> The Shepherds Bush Empire:A reader contributes " Stalls : I generally find the view not that great unless you manage to get right up the front - although there are 2 possies either side of the bar with a step that accommodates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab that spot you would have a great view . <p> Level 1 : I much prefer level 1 and some of the best spots are around the sides where there are 2 rows of seating and behind them a sort of wall with a leaning bar - all give unrestricted views and allow you to stand up and dance ( and easy egress to the bar/toilets ) . " <p> Sadler 's Wells Theatre : A reader says , " C8 and C9 in the stalls - bagged a couple of returns due to the snow , as it was sold out . Production : Sleeping Beauty , January 2013 . Not much rake . The seat in front really was ' in front ' - i.e . I was looking directly at the back of someone 's head , whereas usually in the stalls you are peering through a gap where people 's shoulders meet . The seats in front were positioned same as mine , I had to swivel left and right to see certain parts of the action on stage - not very good considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patrons book the row behind - Row D. This is stepped up on a higher level and provides a clear view of the stage unhindered by people 's heads ! Same price I believe . Beautiful production , would n't have missed it for the world . But would rather not sit in these seats given the choice ! " <p> Another reader notes that the back row of the upper circle is further away than most top balcony seats in the west end . A VERY distant , though clear view , from up there . <p> If you book 2 or more productions in a single transaction , the Sadler 's Wells / Peacock Theatre multi-buy discount may apply , see **29;1775;TOOLONG for details . <p> Theatre Royal , Stratford East : A reader says , " The Theatre : What a lovely old theatre . Keeping the local paintworks in permanent employment producing untold gallons of red paint , the Theatre Royal Stratford sits in the middle of a lot of new buildings , giving little clue of what awaits inside . And inside is a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you would expect , but going into the playhouse itself you find a lovely old theatre , which is tall but at no point is anyone far from the stage , making the performance an intimate one . <p> We would quite happily come back here to see more shows . <p> The Seats : We had seats D1 and D2 in the stalls . Deliberately chosen , as D1 has a clear view of the stage with no seat directly in ahead of it from the front three rows . Ideal for those of a shorter stature . The first few rows do that odd thing of sloping gently backwards so the rows in front are actually higher than those behind , but the tilt of the seating means that you get a decent view . As I said in my comments about the theatre , it would not be possible to be far from the stage , so a reasonable view should be possible from just about anywhere . <p> Row A look like a good choice to see a show . There is a good space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the performers can flirt with the patrons ) and as the seats tilt back a little , neckache should not be an issue . <p> The Food and Drink : It is always nice when you get the chance to dine at the theatre . And we enjoyed the fare at the Theatre Royal Stratford East enough to say well come back and use it as a restaurant if we are in the area ! <p> Aside from standard burgers , jacket spuds etc. , they feature a small Caribbean menu . I had the Curry Mutton , my wife had the Jerk Chicken and we had a side order of Macaroni Cheese . And it was all delicious , spiced just right and the Mac n Cheese was thick enough to slice ! <p> Drinks were courtesy of Blue Moon , Kozel and Addlestones Cloudy Cider . They have a fair selection of bottled drinks , plus enough of a range of draught drinks ( though no handpump , unfortunately ) <p> Interval ice-cream is Loseley enough of a reason to go along in my opinion ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Government Inspector : " Next to the rather decrepit Stratford Centre , this is a little gem of a theatre . Richly decorated , nicely furbished . B was front row , I believe . Very good legroom and view . The seats are not very wide , however , if neighbours are a bit on the large side it can get squeezed . " <p> The monkey would add that there 's also nothing in front of A1 and C1 has space for one leg . Rows slope backwards from the stage from the front row ( A or AA ) to D , and A and AA are on the same level if in use . The stage height and offsetting of rows do compensate for this , though . Legroom is OK up to 5ft 10 or so , and feet can go under seats in front . <p> The dress circle has no legroom at all in any seat , so give it a miss if possible if over 5ft 5 or so . <p> In the upper circle row C has most legroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramped if 5ft 5 or over . End seats are comfy as you can turn sideways into the aisle . <p> The Young Vic Theatre ( main auditorium ) : Bench seating , but a generous space allowed per person . Using the " In The Round " layout , the monkey noted that legroom is OK in the stalls - unlimited in row A , up to 5ft 10 or so in other rows except the back row , which is raised and the audience puts feet on a rail in front . Here ( row D when the monkey went , but changes by production ) those up to 6ft should be fine . You get a better view thanks to the extra height , too . The only other note is to try and avoid seats where the rows " turn a corner " as they share legroom with next person along . <p> Upstairs , two rows . Aisle end barriers and rails at the front do n't affect views much . Those up to 5ft 7 should be OK in the front row , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner for an inch more legroom . Back row is cramped in all seats for those over 5ft5 or so . It looks like there 's room ... until you put the seat down to sit on it ... <p> When in " end stage " rather than the usual " in the round " layout , the downstairs area is split into a central and two side blocks , sometimes with two rows of two seats outside of that in the front corner , angled to the stage . All seats are tiered , with steps between . The front section runs from row A to C , with a wider aisle in front of D and a rail in front of the side block row E seats . <p> Side block rows A to CC are worth skipping at top price , as they have a side view and may miss action at the corners . The very cheap extra seats provide exactly what you pay for - up to 75% view , again depending on how the production is staged . <p> Row H is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That gives 2 seats on the two centre aisles unlimited legroom . Elsewhere in the area , legroom is adequate to 5ft 9 or so , more in the pairs of " extra " seats in the corner , which are raised benches allowing " dangle " space . <p> Behind row H , from J back to M the rows rise steeply , decent views . Row M is just below the level of the first balcony . Again , legroom is pretty reasonable , as in rows ahead , and the view is fine everywhere . <p> The first balcony itself is unchanged , except that only the rows behind the main seating block , plus part of the rows at the side are used . <p> And finally .... just for fun ... <p> Chichester Festival Theatre ...

Theatres use central telephone rooms to take bookings , rather than operating small box offices within each individual venue . This means that when you dial a particular theatre , you get put through to a single office owned and operated either by the individual theatre chain or by an agency on their behalf . For RU and Nimax Theatres , their phoneroom has the brand " See Tickets " ; for Live Nation owned venues , " Ticketmaster " is used , while Ambassador and Delfont-Mackintosh Theatres both answer their own telephones during the day , then transfer calls to " Ticketmaster " and " See " respectively overnight . <p> Sometimes the phones will be answered using the brand name , rather than the individual theatre name .

Simply , the monkey is a regular theatregoing member of the public and is not privy to box office information . <p> Unlike Broadway , London is secretive and does not reveal anything publicly about how well a show is doing . <p> The best way to find out about availability is to call the box office direct and ask . Mention specific seat numbers and see if they can offer them to you . Even ask directly if seats go to Leicester Square TKTS to be sold at half price .

See Notes . <p> Layout : Seating is usually a simple grandstand facing an open stage . This is split into a central and two side blocks by aisles . Row J is elevated above row H at the rear corner of the seating block . <p> Occasionally the plan is altered to allow for the style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example . Alternative seating plans are shown on the seating plan pages when available . <p> Legroom:Seats on stage level ( the front row ) have most , as do those at the top of staircases , with nothing in front of them . <p> Otherwise , it can be tight . <p> Choosing Seats in General : Centre block row A is prime , as it is on stage level with good legroom . Of the rest , the central block rows B to F are the next choice . <p> Often H 1 , 2 , 18 and 19 have an aisle in front of them , offering a little more legroom , when the theatre is in the normal arrangement . <p> In the usual plan , in side blocks , the closer to the centre is better , and remember that the seats farthest out from the centre will mean looking sideways at the stage . Usual Theatremonkey rules apply - go for the centre as you will be paying exactly the same money for an inferior view . Oh , yes , Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least view of the stage and being furthest from it . <p> Wheelchairs can be relegated to the front of a side block from the previous prime seats in the centre .

HOWEVER : a sign on the water spout indicates you should tread on something nasty . It actually means you need to tread on the black rubber pads on the floor below the basin to get water out of the spout . The monkey felt like it had " won a crystal in the Crystal Maze " for figuring that one out ... <p> From Moorgate the walk is shorter , at street level , for the adventurous . This monkey 's route is to exit the station on Moorfields . It prefers the " West Side " exit . If you can use this one too ( take the left hand exit ) , you will emerge facing a road , with a building opposite to the right . This building houses the British Red Cross Society . Turn to your right and cross the road to it .... pause a moment . <p> If you came out of the " East Side " exit of Moorgate Underground Station , you too will have a road in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . Ignore them and look to your left , and keep going until you come to the building houses the British Red Cross Society . Meet your friends here , and continue together to the Barbican Centre by one of two routes : <p> STREET : Continuing along past the building houses the British Red Cross Society until you come to the end of the street . There are no signs telling you , but you have come to " Ropemaker Street " . Turn left into it , and walk along . You pass a pedestrian area on the left containing strange metal pyramids . Wonder at them as you pass . Keep going until you see ahead of you on a wall ( across a roadway ) a " Corporation Of London " Crest and signage . To the right of that is a tiny " Moor Lane " sign . Good news , you are in the right area ! <p> Cross the road to this set of signs . Turn to your left and walk on passing a loading bay area . Just past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on your right . Take it and cross to the other side of the road . <p> VIA PIAZZA : Instead of going along past the building houses the British Red Cross Society , take the walking area slope between it and " Tenter House . " Follow the walkway forwards and bear left , passing through an open piazza then a narrower space with restaurants on either side . At the end of it , you will be on Moor Lane . Look to the right , where there is a small roundabout . Cross the road and turn right to walk to that . Then turn to your left into Silk Street . <p> BOTH CONTINUE HERE , AT SILK STREET : Continue down it , passing blank walls with car park vents in them , to the Barbican Centre main entrance at the end of the road where it curves round . The centre is on the right , under the canopy with the statues on it . Careful the adjacent stage door and car park access ramps ! <p> Ignore the curved entrance . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Keep going , and the entrance to the centre is through the set of doors on the left at the bottom of the slope . <p> Car Park:Within the centre . Make careful note of the car park number and bay numbers before leaving or you will probably still be searching for your car until next year . Also note the public foot exits from the car park to the centre are hard to find and narrow . This feature amuses theatremonkey as it seems the builders were embarrassed about having a car park linked to their nice arts centre . Strange . 
@@45561048 @5561048/ <p> The staging and lighting were marginally effective . The direction was uninspired . The plot trite and hackneyed - I mean , who on earth thought of setting a musical to the strains of Abba - ah yes , try Muriel 's Wedding for instance .... A far more polished affair ( perhaps we should leave this sort of things to the Australians ? ) <p> The choreography was so interesting that the dancers each did their very best to provide uniquely individual interpretations - Had they been dancing solo their timings would have been perfect , however , as an ensemble perhaps more like watching a series of jewellery box figurines ( all activated out of sync . ) <p> I think it fair to say that for the price of a couple of pints you would hear ( and undoubtedly **do** ) better in the local boozers ' Saturday evening Karaoke extravaganza . Indeed , for an authentic effect , go on a 70 's night - even with the price of costume hire , you 're on to a winner . <p> A pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats two rows from the back of the stalls - another triumph of overcharging - well done Ticket Master . Proof positive that given clever marketing and hype , tourists and Londoners alike can be persuaded to fork out a small fortune for little more than a pile of sequined pap . Spend the money on tickets to see Bombay Dreams instead ! ! ! <p> Darren Weekes <p> I sat in the front row of the stalls for a 5pm Friday performance where both leads were missing . Laura Michelle Kelly was apparently i 'll - not sure if she did the 8.30 pm show ( but I understand she was perfectly fine the night before ) . This of course does not mean she was n't ill on Friday , but I guess finding out the truth is impossible ! <p> Louise Plowright , ( the best thing about the show , I hear ) was also missing . It would have been nice to find out how good she is , but I understand she never does the 5pm show . <p> About my seat - Stalls Row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view not great , and I understand they recently put the prices up for this row by quite a lot . Sitting here is also very distracting due to the band who talked between the songs quite loudly during the performance . <p> I wrote a letter of complaint to the producers , which was polite and just stated my disappointment , but basically got a snotty reply saying I should take more care when booking tickets and quoted terms and conditions about casting ( but Louise Plowright missing when not ill , to me is not to me an unavoidable cause ! ! ) and offered a worthless apology about the band talking . <p> Their response made me more annoyed and upset than before . I feel strongly that the 5pm show is an inferior one and that people should be warned about this . <p> WOW . What else can I say ? It is the best way to sum up such a wonderful performance . I loved it from beginning to end . <p> The songs are marvelous . Everyone knows the tunes which makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow songs you ca n't get you head around . The set is sooo cleverly made and designed everyone will be amazed . By the end of the show you feel that you really know the characters . All the actors have such amazing voices and I could listen to the sound track . <p> If you like ABBA in any remote way or just love the songs that everyone knows Mamma Mia is the musical for . <p> It is a truly amazing story and does a lot of justice to the brilliant stars of ABBA . I could go back and see it a million times with out being bored . <p> Amylase Winklestein ( Age 15 ) <p> At the age of 55 I 've finally seen my first London Show ( March 2003 ) ! I 'm no critic , so I found the show thoroughly enjoyable , though the theatre was rather warm and the 8 souvenir programme was disappointing . Only published in February , it only contained one or two of the performers currently in the show , and you had to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performers . If you wanted to know about the Australian and Canadian productions etc. it was very good . <p> The show had been recommended by some friends who had gone to see it on the spur of the moment whilst in London . They could n't get returned tickets so ended up buying from a tout / scalper . They paid 55 each for seats in the upper circle ( 20 or 25 face value ) , so please let that be a warning to others to only book as I did , through the theatre itself or an authorised agency to avoid disappointment . <p> <p> Have I been to the show that others have been to see ? I found the show absolutely captivating from start to finish , and the rest of the audience , would hardly let the performers off at the end they loved it so much . <p> The music is , as we already knew , wonderful , and it is applied in a comic way in places , ' Does your mother know ' and ' Take a Chance on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the Stalls , in Row ZA , in seats which Monkey rated as unacceptable ( actually , just " not a first choice at the price " - monkey editor ) . However , the sound and light were fine , and the seats provided an unrestricted view of the stage . <p> I went on the Thursday Evening of 21st August 2003 . Alexandra Jay was not performing , but the understudy , Elinor Collett , was excellent . Louise Plowright delivered a mesmerising performance as Donna Sheridan . <p> Went on the last weekend in June ( 28th , 2003 ) with full cast appearing . Sat in stall row E. View and sound excellent and for some reason there was more leg room here . <p> Bought the tickets for the show on the Saturday afternoon for that night 's performance at 40.00 each from box office . This is the second time this year that I have been to a London show and been able to but top price tickets for that night 's ( Saturday ) show by going in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you hate ABBA . Music familiar and superbly song but the dialogue complements it by being both funny and touching . <p> We went to see " Mamma Mia " on Saturday 11th October 2003 and were extremely disappointed . Yes , the music was great but the story was SO corny . I was expecting a colourful stage but there were just two pieces of set that were continually moved into so many positions it was a joke . Two out of the three lead male singers were a let down , when paying prices as they are you expect the best . <p> This is the first London show I have been to and if this is the best - then it will be the last ! <p> Anne <p> Saw this last Friday ( 17th October 2003 ) at the 5pm matinee . So bad it was good . I could n't work out if it was one long spoof as it reminded me of a school Christmas pantomime in terms of acting and ( particularly ) singing . <p> Still the theatre seemed pretty full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a bad way to spend 2 1/2 hours , just very poor in terms of quality . <p> Michael Entwistle <p> Absolutely fantastic ! <p> I would see it again . I 'm an ex-dancer ( including ballet ) &amp; I loved every minute . It was a real feel-good show that had me &amp; my friends smiling from ear to ear . Well worth seeing . <p> Jill <p> FROM THE PRINCE OF WALES THEATRE PRODUCTION <p> " Mamma Mia - HERE I 'LL GO AGAIN " is what no doubt what a lot of the audience were thinking ! Corny at times , and does n't try to hide it . Surprisingly good plot - I was n't expecting one at all ! Great leading members of the cast - apart from one of the male leads who really COULD N'T sing ! ! ! <p> Sit anywhere apart from the boxes ? <p> Have never been to see a West End show before and to counteract a previous ' reviewee ' - if they 're all like this I 'll be going to see more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose this is the next best thing . I thought all the performers did fantastic jobs . Obviously the music is fantastic , cast great ( ' Sophie ' - Alexandra Jay - was gorgeous ) and the story interesting and funny . <p> The night I saw it everybody was up and " giving it some " during the 3 song encore . <p> Brilliant . Have already recommended it to friends <p> Paul Bessant Thursday Oct 7th 2004 performance . <p> The seats were fantastic as was the show . Well written , funny , the whole audience loved it . <p> Janet Morris September 22nd 2004 <p> We saw the Saturday matinee performance on 30th April 2005 . Sat in seats H 19 , 20 and 21 in the stalls . Excellent seats - I doubt you would get a better view in all of the stalls . <p> What a show ! From the first scene the hugely talented and energetic cast delivered a great afternoons entertainment . I ca n't see what people 's problem is with the set or the dancing . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pure fun and entertainment for anyone who likes Abba songs and a clever idea . <p> The way the music blends seamlessly into the story is excellent . The story is clever , the script is at times hilarious and other times quite moving . Viven Parry as Donna delivered a powerful , touching and endearing performance . Her singing was wonderful and she stopped the show with ' Winner takes it all . ' Sophie Raveglas as Sophie shows she is a highly talented actress with a beautiful voice . She also has one of the most expressive faces I have ever seen . The various friends and fathers were all on top of their game . <p> The climax of the show at the end really delivered too . All of the audience were up dancing and cheering regardless of age or gender . <p> We came out of the theatre beaming . Ok so it was n't Sondheim or Rogers and Hart . It does n't pretend to be . If you want to walk away discussing the finer points of choreography , lyrics and staging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on air having been thoroughly entertained then go . I loved every minute of it . <p> I recently went to see Mamma Mia and it was fantastic - a friend booked the tickets and we were in row D 9 to 17 . The view was fantastic and the seats were very comfortable - it was good to see the expressions on the faces of the cast . No neck ache in these rows despite being 4 rows from the front . <p> There was a hen party in the first row ( A ) and throughout the show they put the smoke machine on and it completely covered them all in row A they could n't see a thing ! ! It went back as far as row B/C but we were lucky in Row D. You could n't see them in row A with the smoke ! ! So row A is not a good bet for this show ! ! <p> Saw the show a second time on 22nd July 2005 with hubbie and kids and they thoroughly enjoyed it hubbie being a cynic even had a tear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINGERS " to Sophie . The kids were in awe ( aged 9 and 13 ) and both want to see it againand again Sophia and Fergus were FANTASTIC and the whole cast just FABULOUS . <p> Well I did it , I saw it yesterday ( 2nd September 2005 ) and it was great as always ... I did read this site 's bit on theatre manners and did n't sing ... Ow , my tongue hurts from biting it ! ! A almost did an impromptu standing ovation for Lucy Harris after she sang winner takes it all ... but I did n't ... that 's easier with two than alone ! ! Hahahah gosh , was I tempted ! ! <p> I have to agree with Theatremonkey on this one ! I enjoyed it , but the scenery was too bland for such a huge production . I enjoyed it very much and the mother had a fantastic voice as did the daughter . I was hoping for some tap dancing perhaps , or other dancing which I did n't think there was enough of . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit to be desired . It was enjoyable and I did enjoy it but I can not put my finger on what was missing - something was missing but I am not sure what . I went to see " Our House " once , which was based on Madness music - a similar idea to this one - and have to say I thought that was better . In " Mama Mia " I thought the " large " lady was terrific full of fun -it was a great show do n't get me wrong , and it is well worth seeing , but I still think there is something missing . Perhaps it was more dancing ? ? ? <p> Ms Christina Brooks <p> Fabulouse ! ! Great show , fantastic cast , great story and even better songs . What an enjoyable evening . Ca n't wait to book up again . <p> I must admit to attending the July 7th 2006 production of Mamma Mia , starring Lucy Harris as Donna , Suanne Braun as Tanya , and Tasha Sheridan as Sophie , mostly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply had difficulty accepting that an understudy , who only performed as Donna once weekly , could be " that good . " Surely there must have been some small , delusional , fanatical , hardcore fan group that identified with her for some irrational reason , pumping her up , out of all proportion , into a caricature of herself . <p> ABBA music is rather unique in that much of it is permeated with folk , even classical , substructures . Although I can rarely tolerate popular singers , especially the bubblegum music of Brittany Spears and company , I can more than tolerate ABBA due to their many classical underpinnings . The underlying chord structure of " I Have a Dream " is similar to what many argue is the most perfect piece of music ever written , Beethoven 's violin concerto , and " The Winner Takes it All , " complete with arpeggiations , is basically " Ave Maria . " I 'm not blaming Benny or Bjorn for plagiarism ; I 'm sure they were written partly on a subconscious level , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular singer that I can easily tolerate is ABBA 's Agnetha FSltskog . Her voice sounds so natural , that the music takes the form of a seamless extension of what you are convinced is her very essence . In contrast , one knows Barbara Streisand is a " great singer , " which is the problem with Streisand . She constantly reminds you with her self indulgent and egoistic singing that she is , indeed , " great , " much in the same way Dustan Hoffman wo n't let you forget he 's a " great " actor . If you need an example by way of contrast , I 'd much rather see Lawrence Olivier " act " tired than suffer the self-absorbed Hoffmann staying awake for three days straight to make himself literally tired for the Marathon Man scene where Olivier , much more convincingly , plays the villain Nazi dentist juxtaposed with the sleep-deprived , ( " look at me , damn you , I 'm acting " ) Hoffman , much like the " Listen to me damn you , I 'm singing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply projecting themselves through the music which you feel you have been lucky enough to happen upon . It 's akin to spying an animal in the wild , displaying great natural skills , unaware of your presence , yet no less impressive for not having studied said skills in an " approved " school . One has the feeling ( whether it 's true or not ) that Lucy would be doing the same thing while gardening if she were not on stage . Similarly , Agnetha FSltskog had a way of singing with technical aplomb but also with total sincerity and musicality without even the slightest hint of any part of her technique sounding " studied . " Regardless of their level of technique , great artists make you forget their technique . Ella Fitzgerald is a perfect example of a truly " natural " singer who never changed her tone colour while changing registers . It was as if she never took a masterclass , and so was blissfully unaware of the difficulty of such a feat . <p> There are only a handful of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same divine spark of total believability , one of which is Lucy Harris . I 'm not talking about technical perfection here , I 'm talking about giving meaning to music with an opaque technique , in much the same way we happily forgive the great impressionists for not drawing with perfect perspective ( deepening in the process , our " perspective " beyond Cartesian geometry ) . <p> I realize my comments about Lucy sound like hyperbole ; but rest assured , I do n't make them lightly . Lucy Harris sings almost in spite of herself ; much like the bumble bee that is n't supposed to fly , she moulds the music in a way that defies labels , and in so doing , transcends the kind of formulaic singing that is fast becoming all too recognizable through drama school homogenization . Method " singing " is a creativity killer just like method " acting ; " neither of which represent genuine singing or acting , anymore than paint-by-numbers represents the pinnacle of visual art . Obviously , Mary Poppins , by contrast , has the almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of quasi-re-enactment of the film ( not that there is anything wrong with that I loved the West End production of Mary Poppins ) . In contrast , Mamma Mia is , or at least should be , all about eccentricity , improvisation , interplay of characters and spontaneity , and as such , should embrace and cultivate the diversity and synergy of Lucy , Tasha and Suanne . <p> The role of Donna was so seamlessly blended into the music itself , that I had an almost unsettling feeling that I could n't disentangle the singing from the acting . Lucy has an uncanny ability to blend the dynamic range and emotional content of the music in a way that simply can not be taught . Her character exudes such transparently sincere emotion , it 's as if she could n't play it differently if she wanted to ; talent does what it can , genius does what it must . <p> Her combination of facial expressions , body language , voice inflections , and seamless transitions from dialogue to singing and visa versa , is so automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she headlined as Donna in an earlier life . I can only hope that she is reincarnated as Donna in a more prominent way , and soon ! If there is any justice in this world , Lucy Harris will get the recognition she most assuredly deserves , both in this life , and in any credit she has already accumulated in any previous lives as Donna . Speaking of reincarnation ( metaphorically ) , in some ways , I see Lucy as a throw back to an earlier time . Her ability to project subtle emotion is akin to vaudeville or silent movies , and stands in stark contrast to the so-called " stars " of Hollywood who can barely manage to project the slightest emotional content , even with the aid of telescopic close-ups ( most recently exemplified by Julia Roberts bombing spectacularly on Broadway ) . <p> The role of Sophie , played by Tasha Sheridan was at once convincing and sincere . I do not consider the two to be the same thing . A car salesman can be convincing and anything but sincere which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production left me with ; an experience I shall not repeat voluntarily . <p> I think that Tasha almost suffers from being " too good . " In that I mean she pulls off the girl next door so convincingly , you almost resent her for not being more glamorous . She could have easily used her runway physique , vocal and acting talents to take Sophie in a more glittery , but in my view , entirely wrong direction , but instead restrains herself in keeping with the character which is both commendable , and in my view , the real genius of her role . If she were anything more than a simple girl who merely wants to find her dad in order to somehow ground herself on the eve of her momentous decision to marry , then she would not be Sophie . I also know how difficult her vocals are . The " I have a dream " number should be simple yet elegant , and she pulls it off without being overly sentimental . The childlike simplicity of " I have a Dream " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish when sung too " straight . " If it is embellished too much with excessive portmenti ( slides ) then it comes off as " cheesy " ( like an overly sentimental country and western tune ) . Just as the line between the sublime and the grotesque in Mozarts music is the most difficult to balance , so too is the melody which , in so many ways , defines Sophie . For you wannabe singers out there , try an experiment at home ; sing " I Have a Dream " staccato with no slides ( like discrete notes on the piano where they are not interconnected by slides ) , and you will have a sense of just how good a singer Tasha is . Her intonation is uncanny and her tone is pure without being saccharine . It is the difference between honestly expressing hope for the future and singing Disney 's " If you wish upon a star " which is meant to be naive , unrealistic and child-like . <p> I also do not resent Tasha for not being trained at the Bolshoi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in the classic ballerina sense ) , which I think contributes further to the believability of her girl next door character . Otherwise , she runs the risk of coming off as a dancer who took a few singing lessons or a singer who learned to dance . I do n't see any combination of singer , dancer or actress in Tasha ; I simply see Sophie in much the same way I see " Donna " in Lucy Harris , which I think is the highest complement one can pay a cast member . This must be why I became a bit tongue tied after the show ; I wanted to congratulate Tasha for all of the above , but could not pick out , to her credit , any single element on which to focus . <p> The role of Tanya played by the South African-Born actress , Suanne Braun , was extremely well played . It is a role which can very easily be over-played to the point of caricature ( as it was in Las Vegas ) , like the difference between a simple fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trademark . I suffered through an exaggerated version of that character in Las Vegas , and it left me doubting that anyone could be that gold-digging , shallow , horny , vain and spoiled and still be friends with Donna . In short , she had to have something in common with Donna to be a believable friend , and she pulls it off effortlessly . I was particularly impressed with her scene with Pepper . She gave the impression that she was only humouring him in a playful , not sadistic way . She also played a very tempting part in its proper proportion in a way that supported Donna , and in doing so , elevated them both ; so just as she never over sang her harmonies , she also kept her character within the intended limits of the spirit of Tanya to support synergistically , rather than compete distractingly against , Donna . <p> The music from the pit was of the highest technical quality , and I can not remember an orchestra that seemed to genuinely enjoy their music as much as this group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the universal appeal of ABBA 's music ( and I told the conductor as much ) . Now , I must confess that I am not a popular music buff or even much of a fan of musicals in general . I 'm not , however , entirely unfamiliar with musical productions ; I played in the pit of several old standbys ( Brigadoon , Music Man , Oklahoma , The Sound of Music , etc. ) and in my youth , was even the " fiddler " in a community production of Fiddler on the Roof ( I played the part of the Fiddler as well as the actual fiddle ; instead of merely miming the tune , I played on stage what is usually played by a pit musician ) . My background is in classical music and I was , as you may have guessed by now , trained as a violinist . I have played and taught professionally in symphony orchestras as well as the occasional orchestra pit , on and off for 25 years . <p> My violin teacher ( www.wernerlywen.com ) used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully for him ( Leonard Bernstein ) . " This was due to Bernstein 's seemingly boundless musical genius that transcended his almost equally grand intellect . In short , he had a way of blending all of the key ingredients of any given performance , creating a totally convincing and unifying impression that left you wanting for nothing , except more of the same . I can say with all candour , that only a few artists in my life have given me the feeling that their interpretation was the only valid one . Some artists were more highly trained than others , but all had that innate quality of total sincerity that can not be faked , transcending the moment ; performances that were so substantial , they seemed to have their own gravitational field independent of , and incorruptible by , outside influences . If you find yourself asking a jealous question such as , " What does Lucy have that I do n't ? " try duplicating all the subtleties of her performance . It 's analogous to saying " Babies do n't really do too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy all their " natural " crawling movements . <p> The dancing and choreography in Mamma Mia was of the highest quality . Rather than give the all too common impression that dancing is an unrelated break from the storyline , serving to disrupt rather than propel the story , the dancing is refreshingly integral to the inertia and character of the story and for this reason , the dancers are unapologetically and justifiably , enthusiastic . Good dancing and choreography can help a musical , but great dancing with bad choreography , can kill one . <p> Mamma Mia is not just a must see , it 's a must repeat see ! Do n't be surprised however , if you find yourself loitering around stage doors , skipping out early from work on Fridays , and daydreaming about the most trivial minutia of anything and everything Mamma Mia . I actually left Friday 's 5:00 performance with an unsettling feeling , not unlike , a person who starts out innocently enough in search of some harmless casino entertainment only to find himself compulsively gambling inexplicably beyond his means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has been activated in me . Indeed , if Lucy 's fan base is delusional and fanatical , I can only say with all humility , I now understand , and even partially share , in their addiction . <p> Tim Winey <p> <p> Because Mama Mia 's present cast will change on 6 March 2006 , I offer some thoughts on the departing cast . I 've been fortunate to view this cast on three occasions , the most recent being the 25 February 2005 , Saturday night performance . <p> Mama Mia continues to be an audience favourite because of its zany story of three men , a mother and daughter , and a father unknown . Add to it the Abba music and the glitter which propels the entire production . One need only sit back and enjoy the snappy dance scenes and familiar Abba songs . But there 's also a story to be told - about relationships and people . <p> This lead cast has been strong and talented . Likewise the energetic ensemble cast . Together , they put on a pulsating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's been a pleasure experiencing this cast . <p> The strongest vocalists are the tandem of Vivien Parry as Donna , and Sophia Ragavelas as her daughter , Sophie . Together they form a fulcrum around which the other performers craft a two hour journey of whimsy , nostalgia , and reflection . But do n't reflect too long as the glittery Abba encore reprise will have you standing and clapping at closing curtain . <p> Favourite scenes , I have many . How to choose between dancing frogmen , friends reflecting on years past while singing Dancing Queen , Donna 's emotional rebuke of a lover singing The Winner Takes it All , or Tanya tweaking a young Don Juan 's ego . <p> But my sentimental favourite scene is the wedding dress scene between Donna and Sophie before Sophie 's wedding . Ms. Parry and Ms. Ragavelas create a sense of remembrance as time slips away between them during their final tender interlude together . They do n't simply sing the words , they convey the feelings in the lyrics with real tears as they perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its best . <p> We 've experienced Mama Mia from many different vantage points . As TM suggests , Stalls L10/11 are wonderful seats providing good vantage and good acoustics &amp; one need only sit back and take it all in . Likewise TM correctly cautions about Stalls D9 which is a stage left seat in a musical which tends to run stage right . Thus one feels a bit removed from the action at times . Sight lines are sometimes obscured by ensemble cast as well . Be forewarned about proximity to the speakers . You 'll adjust during the performance , but during the encore numbers , the volume is all the way up and your eardrums will pop . <p> Our favourite seats were Stalls B 33/34 . These seats are mesmerizing as the actors are so close and you feel the energy of the performance in an entirely different manner . Act II 's dream scene is surreal as fog wafts off of the stage onto your lap . It 's from these seats that we discover the powerful chemistry between Ms. Parry and Ragavelas during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had our own special theatrical moments . Most memorable is the evening when two inebriated women sit behind us and proceed to sing along on every song with the leads . Compounding this is a blind man seated next to me , who upon hearing the drunken ladies decides to join in as well ( badly out of tune I might add ) . The two inebriates are escorted out of the theater at intermission while the blind gentleman is admonished to sit quietly . This is truly " theater of the theater . " <p> Of course we all look forward to the Abba encore after final curtain calls during which the leads don full Abba lycra regalia . It 's one of the few times I 've seen a UK audience stand in unison and clap and join in with the nostalgic Abba celebration -- standing ovations are after all given more sparingly in the UK . But to my surprise , during my most recent February visit , exactly five people stand up in stalls during the Abba encore ( myself included ) . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience . Well at least they all knew who the yanks were . <p> Like life , theater moves on and it 's time for this Mama Mia cast to give way to a new group of performers . It 's been a pleasure to watch this cast perform and I 'm very happy to be fortunate enough to see one of their final performances . <p> Barry Liimakka USA <p> Went to see " Mamma Mia " on 9th March 2006 - great show really good seats in the stalls - right at side of sound box but no problem and plenty of room to get up and have a jig about as only one row behind us . <p> Went with friends who had seen it before and they thought it was better than the first time - they thought the script was funnier they said . Good night out and all the stalls seats seemed to be pretty good for views . <p> Lizzie Loves the Theatre <p> This show was well worth waiting for and one I MUST go and see again ! My only stipulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donna again ! She was taking on the part on a Saturday matinee I saw , although I understand from a recent letter she kindly sent me , that she only usually does a Friday matinee ! <p> The whole show is full of energy and I am a fan of Abba songs anyway which makes all the difference ! We were up dancing on our row at the end when the company sang ' Waterloo ' and in the interval we had commiserated that it was almost over ! The comment from my companion was ' do you think they 'll come back and start again if we sit here long enough ? ! ' when the curtain had gone down ! Well , yes they would , later that evening ! But sadly we did not possess tickets ! <p> A must-see show and I hear it will be touring so those who can not get to London so easily should eventually have a chance of seeing one of the best musicals ever ! <p> 2nd Visit : When I previously reviewed this show ( above ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lead role again . I managed it , booking a Friday matinee intentionally , I tripped back to the Prince of Wales Theatre and was n't disappointed ! <p> I can not imagine why Lucy has not been taken on as the full time Donna . I do wonder what it is she has to do to prove herself to be the first choice . If I go again ( and it is highly likely I will ! ) I refuse to book anything other than a Friday matinee for fear of not getting the same enjoyment . I just do n't  think I would be satisfied seeing her in the ensemble . <p> I am pleased to see that others agree with me as well . <p> I might book again soon to see Jane Gurnett take on the role of Tanya ( although at present , having been a fan of Casualty back in her day , I find it hard to think of her in the role of Tanya ) but I am wondering in the meantime if a letter should be sent to the Production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casting Lucy as Donna ! <p> An excellent production , highly recommended , its great to sing-along to and feel good too ! <p> Helen Hutchinson , Halesowen <p> Thursday , April 12 , 2007 <p> Bravo , Bravo , Bravissimo Linzi Hateley . Even when bravo is repeated for emphasis or used in its superlative form " Bravissimo , " it seems a pathetically inadequate kudo to encapsulate the sheer weight of Linzi Hateleys portrayal of Donna in Mamma Mia . Bravo ! Admittedly denotes much enthusiasm and admiration , but simultaneously sheds far too little , if any , light on why I felt spontaneously compelled to shout it at Linzi Hateley during her curtain call . I 'm ashamed to admit that when I first saw Linzi Hateley s publicity photo announcing her as the new Donna , I was actually angry . I thought to myself " come on Benny and Bjorn , say it ai n't so ; do n't  tell me that you have also sold out to the Hollywood machine ! " In my own defence , my suspicions were not totally unjustified given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , youthful appearance combined with Hollywoods recent casting of the lead roles of none other than Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan in Mamma Mia the movie , to boot , yuck ! <p> Linzi Hateley has , like a catalyst in a chemical reaction , single-handedly transformed the role of Donna and in turn ( much like a chain reaction ) , also transformed Mamma Mia , as a by-product of the first reaction . Thermodynamics aside , the dramatic energy of Mamma Mia obeys entirely different laws when driven ( catalyzed ) by Linzi Hateley as Donna . Make no mistake ; I do not wish to convey the notion that the role of Donna has been somehow dramatically " improved " by Linzi Hateley , unless of course you consider a Porsche Carrera a dramatically " improved " VW beetle . Yes a VW beetle is roundish in shape and has a rear-mounted engine , but for me , that 's where the qualitative similarities part company . <p> I know the more sceptical of you out there are wondering how I could possibly write anything more glowing than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fanatical idolatry ? The answer to that rhetorical question is below ; just keep reading . I just need to dash to the kitchen for a moment to take the " crow " out of the oven . Do n't  pity me , I do n't  mind it too much ; its a small dietary sacrifice for the privilege of having a Linzi Hateley " experience . " In order to put Linzi Hateleys characterization of Donna into perspective , one can not really do it comparatively ; one needs , instead to devise a new scale of measurement , appropriate to the size and weight of the object being measured . One does not measure the diameter of planets in millimetres because even though its possible , it yields numbers that are too large and hence , unwieldy . <p> For those of you who follow classical music , especially in London , Sir Thomas Beecham needs no introduction . Arturo Toscanini said of Beecham , in what must have been the greatest backhanded musical compliment of all time , " Beecham is a genius , amateur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances would , no doubt , cause one to think one had died and gone to musical heaven . But then if one heard Toscanini after Beecham , one would be forced to conclude that what one thought was heaven , was really a musical purgatory . In other words , Beecham would quickly go from being a giant , to being the worlds tallest midget . In my view , Linzi Hateley is as different from the next best Donna , as the worlds tallest giant next to the worlds tallest midget . <p> Linzi Hateley brought out subtleties in Mamma Mia that I am not convinced , even the creators , had the insight to " write " into the script ; nor am I sure if it would even be possible , for the creators to have " written down " what she did . I am reminded of the sheer musical genius of Leonard Bernstein who imbued music with meaning in ways that no one else could , even the composers of said music ! Igor Stravinsky once admitted that " Lenny " brought out things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even he ( Stravinsky ) knew were there ! Similarly , Linzi Hateley brought out aspects , both dramatic and musical , of Mamma Mia that I did n't  think were even possible . <p> I know this will seem like a detour , but bear with me ; I recently saw the Royal Operas televised performance of Wagners complete Ring Cycle ( approx. 15 hours ) . Despite being introduced by Michael Portillo in the most nauseatingly patronizing and arrogantly pseudo-intellectual way , as if to say " thank you all for giving up banger racing this weekend to give opera a chance , " it was well worth it . The vocal , orchestral and most impressively , dramatic elements were woven into a seamless continuum of the highest artistic quality . It was deeply moving , and I 'm not just saying that because of the occasional appearance of the Rein maidens topless ! Just in case you were wondering , I have not yet gotten around to registering a complaint about the maidens with the royal Opera ! <p> In my view , Linzi Hateleys task in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the role of Brunhilde or Sigfried in Wagners Ring Cycle , what most consider to be the most monumental task in Opera . How can I make such an audacious claim ? Well , here 's how . Wagner was the composer , librettist and dramatist of the ring Cycle ; in short , every word , every syllable , note , stage action , plot dynamic , was created by Wagner to interrelate in a complete artistic creation . Mamma Mia was created , as many critics point out , as a cute , but somewhat superficial excuse to sing ABBA music . Linzi Hateley manages , with an uncanny depth of insight , to seamlessly convey the deeper and more universal archetypes hidden in this seemingly superficial story . With a kind of musical and dramatic alchemy , Linzi Hateley transmutates the songs of ABBA ( whose lyrics leave many gaps in terms of their ability to tell the whole story ) into a coherent work of art ( transfiguring the superficiality of contemporary " pop lead " into a timeless , and much more weighty , 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The genius of Linzi Hateley is her ability to reconcile the slapstick with the sublime while somehow , miraculously convincing the audience that both are necessary . <p> In the first scene where Donna encounters Sam , her reaction is more of surprise than anger , which totally transforms the rest of the plot as it unfolds making the overall story much more believable . In her more shocked than angered reaction Donna gives the audience the distinct feeling she is replaying her entire past with Sam and somehow reliving the same feeling of false hope she felt when she thought he had abandoned her all those years ago . This simple tweaking of her reaction , set up the rest of the story in a far more authentic light and hence , renders the characters much more complex . This , in turn , elevates them from mere excuse props for singing ABBA tunes , into bona-fide characters who belong there , with or without ABBA . Because she is n't overly bitter , her hysterical , knee-buckling rendition of Mamma Mia , is that much more reminiscent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the presence of a cute boy . It also raises the deeper and more uncomfortable reality that no matter how grown up we seem to be , much of our personalities are shaped by these youthful indiscretions , which make Donnas reduction to a rubber-kneed teenager that much more poignant and funny at the same time . Im struck with the oxymoronic overtones of the expression " youthful indiscretion " insofar as youthfulness , by virtue of the lack of experience characterizing it , is not as much " indiscrete " as it is an inevitable by-product , often tragic , of youth . I think the laughter during that scene was a different kind of laughter , almost cathartic . Its as if every girl who was ever jilted in her youth , relives it through Donnas rubber-kneed descent into teenage irrationality . It also speaks to the broader notion that deep down , all most people really want is to be loved unconditionally , and that much of what passes for " grown-up " activities are really fatally doomed efforts to win the " unconditional " love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with the act of " earning " love and respect , both cease to be unconditional and hence , loose their purity . <p> During Chiquitita and Dancing queen , one feels that Donna was genuinely cheered-up by Tanya and Rosie which provides much welcomed hope about the elasticity of the human spirit and the hope for a brighter tomorrow . The choreography of the three dynamos and the physical comedy they matched to the lyrics , defies words , even for me ! I have seen several performances of Mama Mia under other casts , and this was by far , the most meticulously crafted , expertly sung and acted thus far . I do n't  think I could take anything much funnier without pulling a muscle laughing . While previous Tanyas may have " looked " the part and acted it well enough in terms of Tanya as a two-dimensional archetypal gold-digger , this Tanya ( Jane Gurnett ) imbues the character with such expert vocals , physical comedy and relatability to Donna and Rosie , as to put her on Mt . Olympus with the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The new Sophie ( Hannah Robertson ) was delightful . She projects just the right balance of innocence , likeability , believability ( especially in her scenes with Sky Paul Chelford ) and strong vocals . One really senses her genuine doubts about the wedding and her naivetT in the opening number , where she conveys , through it , her desire to find herself through her paternity search . The new sky perfectly complements Sophie ; he is naturally very funny , boyishly handsome ( but not in a vain or self conscious way ) and believably heterosexual . Tanya was excellent in the scene with Pepper in " Does Your Mother Know . " She milks every ounce out of that scene without over doing any one aspect of the character , all the while displaying what is clearly a highly trained and unflappable vocal facility . Linzi Hateley rendition of " Slipping Through my Fingers " was absolutely magical . <p> Forgive me Bjorn , but Linzi Hateley is technically and interpretively an even better singer than Agnetha ; I mean that sincerely . Her tonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sings sizzle with an underlying passion . And like a simmering volcano , she produces a steady stream of energy that holds your attention in anticipation of a catastrophic eruption that thankfully , never materializes . Her vocal quality has in my view , an analog in the violin playing of Mischa Elman or the singing of Mario Lanza ( with a sex change , of course ) . For the uninitiated , it may seem easy to do , but I assure you , what Donna did with " The Winner Takes it All ) is technically and dramatically , a very precarious and extremely difficult thing to pull off . Instead of singing the whole song , she talks for portions of it and then , with impeccable pitch , picks up the notes of the melody . This gave the piece a much more authentic and believable effect in that she was essentially crying the song . I have never seen such risks taken in that way in live theater , and I am in awe of her for taking such chances ( considering how perfect it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer than even I give her credit for ) . <p> With humble , awe-struck adulation , <p> Timothy Winey <p> Mamma Mia , here I go again : <p> The September 8th 2006 performance of " Mamma Mia " differed from the July 7th 2006 performance in several ways . Firstly , I want to make it crystal clear to the knuckleheads who passed over Lucy Harris last time for the lead ; please have your eyes , ears , hearts and brains checked in no particular order before the next round of auditions . After seeing Lucy this time , I am convinced she is not a star ; that would be an insult . She is a bona fide supernova . <p> A supernova ( pl. supernovae ) is a stellar explosion that produces an extremely bright object made of plasma ( Lucy Harris ) that declines to invisibility over weeks or months ( when she gets passed over for the lead ) . There are several different types of supernovae and two possible routes to their formation . A massive star may cease to generate fusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and collapse under the force of its own gravity ( Lucy without the support of Suanne Braun ) to form a neutron star or black hole . Alternatively , a white dwarf star may accumulate material from a companion star ( Suanne ) until it nears its Chandrasekhar limit and undergoes runaway nuclear fusion in its interior , completely disrupting it . The explosion drives a blast wave into the surrounding space , ( Prince of Wales Theatre ) causing the audience to spontaneously sing and dance , forming a supernova remnant ( that warm glowing feeling that makes life worth living ) . " Nova " is Latin for " new " , referring to what appears to be a very bright new star shining in the celestial sphere , even if astronomers ( casting agents ) are too blind to notice them ; the prefix " super " distinguishes this from an ordinary nova , which also involves a star increasing in brightness . <p> Lucys emotional , musical , comical and overall theatrical range is on an order of magnitude many times that of anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , whoever is auditioning the next cast , for your own sake and that of the shows immortality , beg Lucy Harris to do Donna as long as she is physically able while quadrupling her salary ( a bargain ) . A talent like Lucys only comes along in a generation or two . Let me make myself clear to those who struggle with analogies , Lucy is simply Donna . There will never be a role for which anyone is better suited , never . <p> I 'm beginning to wonder if Lucy can even be fully appreciated in England . I lived and worked in Portugal for 4 years where something as simple as guiding a driver into a parking space looks like Toscanini conducting a Wagnerian opera . Lucy Harris and Suanne Braun have more expression in their four eyebrows than the whole rest of the West End combined . How can I put this diplomatically ; the English are not famous for exaggerated facial expressions ( their eyebrows generally do n't  move I call it " Fergie face " named for the former toe-sucking Duchess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face from the nose up ) . I just had a very unpleasant vision of Pepper ( who is , by the way , an obviously excellent dancer and naturally very funny not a Botox victim ) sucking Fergies big toe ! Yuck ! <p> I have another bone to pick ; what the hell is Suanne Braun doing in the ensemble ? Her raw talent combined with her impeccable stage presence , shines through so glaringly that I cant even enjoy a balanced view of the stage . Her vastly superior stage presence , movements and gestures make me simultaneously grateful that she 's at least somewhere on stage , but angry that she 's not Tanya . <p> Tasha Sheridan was even better than last time , ( no small feat ) . Her singing was even more polished , and she projected better ( her vibrato has also widened and loosened up ) . She is maturing with each performance . I almost worry that shell get too polished and lose some of the innocence of the girl next-door quality that she captures so well . One has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing community theatre for free had the casting directors not , in a rare fit of reason , cast her as Sophie . <p> Rachel Spry was excellent as Rosie . She was very funny in " Take a Chance on Me . " She has a wide expressive and comic range as well as a strong voice . I cant help but fantasize about how much more electric the chemistry between Lucy , Suanne and Rachels performance would have been with Suanne as Tanya . <p> Paul Hawkyard was excellent . His comic timing and more masculine physical presence add a much-needed ingredient to the mix . I also enjoyed the role of Harry played by Peter Challis . He also has a strong voice , which helps ; particularly in " Thank You for the Music " which is difficult to sing a capella . Iain Fletcher is good and looks the part . He does n't  dominate the stage , nor should he . His selfless performance allows the role of Donna to shine in the center , as it should be . His is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has to play what we call in Portugal , a " banana " ( a guy who is pushed around by females and does what he is told most of the time . I 'm happy for Donna at the end but a bit angry that it has taken Sam 20 years to figure out what an idiot he s been . For all its lightheartedness , Mamma Mia does remind one of the permanence of spur of the moment decisions made at times of high emotion where , blood flow is not always being directed to the cerebral cortex . <p> So , once and for all , would the amateur astronomers please invest in a computer-controlled telescope in order to see the obviously blinding starlight emanating from Lucy Harris and Suanne Braun ? Just because you got lucky by spotting Tasha Sheridan with a conventional optical telescope , does n't  mean you do n't  need to update your equipment . If not , you will turn a Greek comedy into a Greek Tragedy as regrettable as Sam leaving Donna to wed his mother ! <p> Later visit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try this at home " <p> This review , like many consumer products , comes with a patronizing safety warning for the foolhardy . Serious injury or even death could result from attempting to emulate Lucy Harris . In fact , I have a challenge to issue . If those pathetic post-pubescent morons of " Jackass " fame want to truly humiliate themselves , instead of tumbling down hills in outhouses , they should try to sing or act with 1 thousandth the aplomb shown by the trio of Lucy , Suanne and Joanna during Wednesdays performance . The sheer volume of vocal , dramatic and comic elements the three " dynamos " crammed into the November 30th performance of Mamma Mia seemed to have distorted space-time itself . <p> Indeed , I had the feeling of a strange kind of time compression mirage , where the absolute best elements of all previous performances were cut and spliced , and hence , compressed together . The amount and quality of expression , both musical and dramatic , combined with the gut-splitting comic elements in Wednesdays performance were almost too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and view the show in stages . <p> Lucy in particular is , in my view , so innately talented , that she is incapable of being self conscious about it . Couch potatoes are not naturally as impressed by monkeys , as they are by Olympic gymnast ; despite the superiority of primate skills over that of even the most skilled of humans , we naturally do n't  give monkeys the proper credit for doing something they were " born , " not " trained , " to do . So if Lucy will forgive the primate analogy , I think it is a fair one . Put simply , Lucy is " naturally " so good ; ones expectations are automatically raised to a level that would be unfair to mere humans . So while I apologize once again for the simian reference , I assert that Lucy is , metaphorically , a " different animal . " That being said , I understand that Wednesdays can be a little slow and as such , sometimes the audiences are " bussed in " in bulk ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a local hospital must have been evacuated , making for some interesting audience participation , or lack thereof . <p> There was awkward laughter at the wrong times , such as the peculiar laughing at the use of dry ice ; loud questioning , and even louder answers , by and between those obviously hearing impaired . In the finale , one woman , who was 90 if she was a day , was gyrating to Waterloo in a way that convinced me she was having a seizure . I know that many eyes will glaze over when I start with classical music analogies , but I simply must make this one . Bronislaw Huberman ( 1882-1947 ) was the most individual violinist ever to record . My violin teacher asked Hubermans wife after a concert , why he sometimes played brilliantly and other times so poorly ? She confided in my teacher that Her husband suffered from terrible insomnia . The extreme characterization of his interpretations brought Huberman great fame particularly in Central Europe , but also the label of maverick . His admirers included Brahms , Dvorak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an age of standardization , his playing constantly challenges our expectations . I kept searching my brain for the kind of highly individualistic yet non-idiosyncratic phrasing that Lucy reminded me of , and it struck me like a thunderbolt during " Money , Money , Money ; " Huberman . If the Huberman analogy is too obscure , I also see many parallels between the naturalistic singing of Lucy and the Portuguese singer Amalia Rodrigues ; both of whom give one the feeling that they were not formally taught but rather somehow tapped into some kind of universal aesthetic law , giving them maximum flexibility of expression without sacrificing internal consistency ; so even though no two pine cones are identical , the underlying laws governing the germination of seeds never generate a rectangular pinecone . Amalia put it most succinctly when she famously quipped " Fado is not meant to be sung ; it simply happens . " Lucy , like great Fado , does n't  sing , she too , simply " happens . " This is the divine spark that every cell of Lucys body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much she seems to vary her performance , she never violates the limits of the very natural laws that simultaneously define , regulate and liberate her . <p> In short , her " improvisations " are internally consistent , so that every turn of every phrase still comes out " square " no matter how twisted it becomes between beats . I promise this is my last diversion into classical music . The great violinist Fritz Kreisler was the most profound musical genius/violinist of all time . He could memorize music during train rides and then go home and play them on his fiddle . He once had a violin in the shop and showed up to a rehearsal without it . When the conductor asked him how he planned to rehearse , Kreisler calmly said , " fear not " and proceeded to play the violin part on the piano ! Kreisler was famous for warping rhythms in ways that were highly individualistic yet impossible to emulate , always landing on the " beat " ( like Lucy ) at the end of each measure . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were almost trying to act bored so that no one would discover just how much fun they have for fear they may end up donating their time instead of being paid , however little it might be . The music director is clearly a man of very high standards and genuine devotion to the highest quality of each and every performance . His attention to detail did not go unnoticed by me , and I want him to know that he is appreciated . I noticed that many of the transitions from dialogue to music were tightened up , only adding to the overall professionalism of the show . <p> Not even the IV league audience ( intra-venous ) could dampen the enthusiasm , impeccable timing and comic hilarity on the night . It was , in a word , surreal . I am not a conspiratorialist , but I find it difficult to believe that the cast was not somehow drugged with stimulants ( I would n't put it past management ) . Paul Hawkyard and Joanna Monroe were hilarious in " Take a Chance on Me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely concerned about re-injuring my umbilical hernia . I have warmed up to Joanna in a way that has me regretting not noticing her talents more ; she has excellent comic timing , a very solid voice and an ability to blend seamlessly into any scene . I feel that Suanne Braun is really the glue that has allowed the trio of Donna , Tanya and Rosie to congeal . Suanne is simply a comic thoroughbred with every muscle in her body rippling with instinctive timing . When Donna told Rosie and Tanya to not let the newly arrived ex-boyfriends see them , Tanya ( Suanne ) dove onto the floor and assumed a frozen position with her arms clasped over her head as if she was diving sideways , lips pursed , and eyes bulging in a stroke of sheer physical comic genius that is on a par with Don Knotts ( deputy Barney Fife of Mayberry fame ) . James Laileys Harry Bright was very good as the disheveled " closet " boyfriend . <p> If Suanne is not chosen as the main Tanya , then I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wo n't need to ; their wounds will be self-inflicted , like a time-released poison that will have done its damage long before their ability to reverse it . In short , not even 20 Bozo clowns will be able to fill Suanne Brauns metaphorical shoes retroactively . <p> My message for those who are thinking of passing over Lucy , yet again , is simply this , may you and your ilk , be forced to watch , in a West End Purgatory , a never ending production of Mamma Mia , starring your mediocre and myopic leads . Lucy is Mamma Mia . If Lucy is not a Diva , then why was she showered with flowers during the curtain call ? For a moment , I thought I was at La Scala ? Lucys red-faced reaction to the justifiable adulation of her public just goes to show how thankfully out of touch she is with the depth of her own talent , which only deepens the inspired nature of her unique gift . For to be self conscious , is to descend into the banal ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that symbolizes her divine spark . <p> Lucy is a gift , not entirely of this world . <p> Timothy Winey <p> On another visit , he says , <p> <p> A night full of surprises . I attended the November 26th 2009 performance of ' Mamma Mia ' with some trepidation . After all , I made no secret of my suspicion that the decision to cast Niamh Perry as Sophie was partially influenced by myopic commercial " TV Land " considerations , considerations I still do n't feel were in her long-term interest nor in the interest of the West End . This is why the reader should assign double weight to what I am about to write . <p> I doubt anyone with his or her eyes closed listening to Niamh could honestly guess her age ? <p> The richness of Niamh 's tonal palette combined with the maturity of her phrasing , creates a cognitive dissonance between what your ears register musically , and your eyes register chronologically . It 's as if her voice is an amalgamation of reincarnated divas with a freshness not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth is wasted on the young , yet somehow Niamh has managed to cheat the vocal Gods . Her performance left me both mesmerized and saddened . Mesmerized by vocals interpretively well beyond her years and saddened that a more lucrative recording career has not yet materialized for her ? <p> Sally Ann Triplett as Donna was simply stunning . The breadth and depth of her vocal , dramatic and comedic ranges were blended to absolute perfection . The uniquely original mixture of her giddiness , confusion and anger upon seeing Sam for the first time in 20 years , made her rendition of Mamma Mia truly unforgettable . I thought I had already gleaned some hint of Sally Ann 's vocal facility from a recent outdoor performance in Hyde Park , but I was wrong . Outdoor acoustics left me woefully unprepared for the true depth of her virtuosity . <p> The seamlessness with which she married her stunning technique to her equally insightful emotional interpretations of Slipping Through My Fingers , One of us and The Winner Takes it All , rendered them , and her , positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocals that are simultaneously disciplined and expressive . With the Role of Rosie , less is often more , And Leanne selflessly understates her character for the good of the show when necessary . In some ways , the characters of Donna and Tanya are , and should be , bigger than life ; this makes Leanne 's restraint , all the more commendable . <p> One would think I would eventually run out of praise for Jane Gurnett ; think again . Jane has found a new synergy with Sally Ann , convincing me they are genuine old friends . During Chiquitita , my entire torso began a kind of involuntary spastic movement that I initially interpreted as a combination of indigestion and hiccups only to realize that my entire upper body had been set to " chuckle , " not unlike a " Tickle-Me-Elmo " doll . For about 15 seconds I was actually concerned that I would not be able to stop . The only other time I experienced anything like that was when I worked nights at a peach packing plant and became so sleep deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for approximately 20 minutes . It was a temporary but very real psychotic episode brought on by sleep deprivation . <p> So thank you Jane , your physical comedy and expert timing caused me to lose control of my laugh reflex . You really should come with a medical warning . Sam Carmichael as played by Norman Bowman was excellent . He possesses an exceptional voice and uses it to genuine dramatic effect . Without a believable Sam , Donna 's job becomes much more difficult which , thankfully , is not the case with Norman Bowman . <p> The other dads were more than just believable , they were authentic . Well done Paul Ryan as Harry Bright , and Bill Austin 's stand in , Anthony Topham . A brief note on demographics . One of the nicer things about Mamma Mia historically , has been the general level of civility in the audience , typically a bit older , better heeled , dressed and spoken than your average beer-swilling Wicked audience member . I have now detected a definite slide toward the " Wicked end " of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV Land " nearly as much as " Movie Land . " So for all of you hen party gals who got lost on the way to the ABBA Sing Along , do all of us a huge favour , stay home and watch Mamma Mia the Movie projected onto the giant plasma TV mounted on your cave wall . <p> 3. you can really get blasted without having to pay 4 pounds for a cheap champagne served in even cheaper plastic glasses , <p> 4 . You can reduce carbon emissions by drinking directly out of the bottle not to mention the general improvement to the aesthetics your absence will bring to the city , <p> 5 . You can sing along as loudly as you wish with Meryl Streep , which ironically , will probably make you both in tune with each other , <p> 6 . If you start your party early enough , you may have time to catch X Factor where you can spend , voting for your favourite act , what you would have spent on a theatre ticket even though it will no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent exit , <p> And finally , if you still feel compelled to grace the big city with all your refined charms and urbane elegance , you can always go to the brand new and much anticipated production of " Dumb and Dumber , the Musical , " starring , you guessed it , Jedward where you will actually be encouraged to sing along , out of tune , and hence , in tune , with those equally charming twins . <p> Speaking of X Factor , if TV Land casting it is indeed a new economic , and inescapably necessary evil to ensure West End survival , then I 'd like to nominate another Lucy for the next Sophie , Lucy Jones ! <p> Since so many cave dwellers seem to have gotten lost on the way to the Mamma Mia sing along , the absolute minimum courtesy the pathetically impotent theatres could do would be to make an announcement asking the fake fur-lined audience members to please refrain from singing until the very end . Last night I actually had a nightmare where I was surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jedward singing spectacularly off-key in my ear . It was called " I 'm a critic , get me out of here ! " <p> I have seen ' Mamma Mia ' several times now with two different casts , and I have always unashamedly enjoyed the show . Call me simple if you will , but the show is " simply " great fun . If you like ABBA music and good humour , then Mamma Mia is for you ; of course the pseudo-intellectual wannabes out there will tell you that it is a simplistic , " vaudeville-esque " story propelled , tackily , by Seventies pop music . These , of course , are the same people who would go to , and then debate endlessly , French art films rather than go to what they secretly long for , ' Toy Story 2 . ' Well , excuse me for living , but the graveyard 's full . <p> ' Mamma Mia ' amuses me no matter what , and if I am going to pay good money to see a show , it might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be depressed and philosophize about the meaning of life and the suffering in the world , all I have to do is to turn on , for free , ( not counting the TV tax ) the cynical and nihilistic BBC daily news selling western civilization to the lowest bidder in the surreal " bazaar " of political correctness . <p> In what concerns art ; I do not distinguish between art and entertainment . For me , there is no small or trivial " thing " in art . I agree with Picasso " Art is a lie that makes us realize truth , " and ' Mamma Mia ' is a lie I do n't mind being told repeatedly . <p> As far as the cast goes , as another reviewer already said , this musical " transcends any expendable cast members " , notwithstanding the obvious fact that personal audience taste varies , but as a whole , I am sure that most actors do their level best , most of the time , once they step on that stage . Given England 's population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many graduates per capita , it 's definitely a buyer 's market from the production side , who no doubt , get their pick of the West End litter in this peculiar little industry in this peculiar " little " Britain . <p> As far as the cast goes there are certain characters that appeal more to me than others . I am sure that everybody who watches the show has to love the characters Donna , Rosie and Tanya . The cast members filling the dynamo 's shoes are another story . <p> I have to say that I always thought that Kim Ismay was brilliant as Tanya until Suanne Braun came along . Although I would go back to see Kim Ismay in the role of Tanya , I think Suanne Braun is uniquely superb and extremely funny , as if the role was created specifically for her . <p> Lara Mulcahy was hilarious as Rosie , but after watching Joanna Monro more closely , I realized she is also great fun to watch ; she 's a different kind of Rosie , but still a very lovable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage . <p> Unfortunately , I only watched one Donna in all my times at the Prince of Wales , so I do not have anybody to compare to ; that being said , I do think that , as an entertainer , Lucy Harris is great fun to watch and therefore deserves the title " Born to Be Donna " . She has been compared to several " stars " in different reviews and I new the comparison to the great Amalia Rodrigues would ruffle some feathers . The Portuguese are very protective of their Amalia and with good reason . Amalia Rodrigues single handedly put Portugal on the international map as the epitome of talent , grace and class . That being said , I do understand why Lucy Harris 's singing was compared to Amalia Rodrigues ; they both have unique musical phrasing , independent of any differences in range , " character " or respiratory health . <p> Sophia Ragavelas has to be my favorite as Sophie Sheridan , I would not mind seeing her again in this role . <p> I do hope the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit I did not think much of the Sky portrayed by either Fergus March or Gareth Derrick ; they both bored me to death . I imagine " Sky " the character , as a very loveable young man , with lots of personality ; unfortunately all I have seen thus far is a sometimes arrogant , disconnected ( Fergus March ) and effeminate ( Gareth Derrick ) version . <p> The dads were/are quite fun to watch , although I must say that the right Sam Carmichael has yet to be found and I leave it at that . The ensemble is very likable , transmitting much energy , life and happiness to the audience . One exception is Rebecca Mckinnis who somewhat awkwardly sticks out in the group ; perhaps a change of hats would lower her profile on stage ? <p> I plan to return to Mamma Mia , in the not too distant future , to see the new Donna . <p> Grace Homem-Winey <p> Saw Mamma Mia January 12th 2007 and I have to say it was one of the most disappointing nights I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy jolly night out - something like an updated version of a Doris Day movie - and my heart sank more and more as the show continued , it felt like watching a bad holiday camp show . What could have been a simple charming piece of theatre was turned into a series of crude jokes made at the expense of the characters in the show . Do n't get me wrong , I 'm not a prude , but I expect more from a West End show than cheap laughs from fat people dancing badly and men wearing wedding dresses . Where was the story , where was the characterisation ? I 'm not expecting ' Hamlet ' but characters should do more than just turn up , make a cheap joke and never be seen again until the curtain call . <p> I 'm only glad I got my tickets on a " Get into London theatre " promotion ( ended 17th March 2007 ) as I would have been annoyed to have paid full price for this . On the plus side though , the Prince of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through this show to see - take the tour instead . If you like musical theatre and want a good night out , go and see ' Spamalot ' or ' Evita , ' if you like Abba see a tribute band first . <p> Rob . London . <p> We went to see Mamma Mia ( again ) last night ( 20th March 2007 ) and just had to send another review as the cast were so brilliant . <p> Linzi Hateley as Donna - Wow - when I saw she was playing the role I knew she would be tremendous and she was - what a powerful voice coming out of such a petite frame . She surely must be one of the youngest Donnas to grace the stage . <p> Joanna Munro as Rosie is simply fantastic - what great comic timing as well as singing and acting - almost unbeatable . Jane Gurnett as Tanya was spot on too with a fantastic wiggle to boot . <p> The three " Dads " made a great team too -Iain Fletcher and Steven Finch were new to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the characters straightaway . <p> Hannah Robertson as Sophie was good although all the Sophies I have seen in the past have been great too . Paul Shelford as Sky was very dishy indeed again with great acting . <p> Anyway another fantastic performance - full of energy and a totally feel good evening - I ca n't recommend this musical highly enough . We were on our feet dancing at the end and cheering with delight . <p> I 've already confessed to being a Mamma Mia fanatic . Mention to a Londoner that you 're going to see Mamma Mia , and their eyes twinkle and a knowing smile appears while they gently nod . It 's easy to see why Mamma Mia remains a West End audience favourite . Although the casts change , the constant is Abba 's music and lyrics along with clever dialog , and an energetic cast which sings , clowns , and dances through the night . Lots of folks take this repeat journey to the Prince of Wales for their periodic Abba fix . We ourselves enjoy the whimsy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which last long enough to touch you , but then melt away as the next light hearted scene follows assuring you that everything 's going to be OK . <p> Although there 's an absolute constancy to Mamma Mia , there 's also a dynamic process of change . We 've seen Mamma Mia in December , January , and now in April . Each time , the cast adds or subtracts a line , a gesture , or a move . There 's just enough change to create a fresh look and feel while holding onto the familiar things you 've come to love . The cast itself appears to be a tightly knit group of folks who enjoy every minute spent on stage . You can see it in their eyes and faces as on this recent Saturday night when Ms. Hateley , Monro , &amp; Gurnett finish performing ' Dancing Queen ' and join hands for a quick exit , but not before looking at each other as if to say " that was fun " . Just another aspect of theater which is palpable on occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own emotional take on tears spilt and hopes exhausted on a relationship never totally lost or fulfilled when she performs " The Winner Takes it All " . She combines a more theatrical interpretation moving between spoken words and lyrics to ratchet the song up to a new emotional plateau reaching deep within the audience . Lots of tears out there amongst the audience . But do n't fret , Jonna Monro follows with her slapdash scene " Take a Chance on Me " and tears quickly turn to laughter . That 's what Mamma Mia is all about . <p> Do n't be afraid to admit that you 're a Mamma Mia fanatic . Just be sure to get down to West End so you can stand up and enjoy the lycra-fest encores . <p> Barry Liimakka Cinnaminson USA April 2007 <p> Here is an ethical and moral thought experiment for all you budding Mamma Mia philosophers out there . Imagine that you have just seen an emergency news broadcast detailing the certain obliteration of Earth by an unstoppable asteroid in just two short hours . Now imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " policy in the Prince of Wales theatre , everyone but the cast has received the ominous news . Do you tell the cast and give them a chance to say their prayers , or do you keep them blissfully ignorant of their impending doom ? I vote for blissful ignorance , " a noble lie " ( sin of omission if you will ) . I will explain the philosophical justification for my decision in the context of the very special February 29th , 2008 London performance . <p> Firstly , what good could possibly come from telling the cast of their fate ? I know that they are very talented , but let 's face it , like the difference between a genuine smile and a politicians grin , no actor or group of actors is good enough to fake their own enjoyment of this show so convincingly . Secondly , What are the chances that both the cast and audience will collectively ever experience greater joy , not escapism , but the pure joy that should be the inevitable residue of sharing such an extraordinary performance ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would use Lottery funds to subsidize Mamma Mia to mesmerize the population into temporarily forgetting about all the crumbling infrastructure in this country , making it not just " an entertaining night out " but rather a national , and necessary , mental health treasure/break . <p> Still basking in the bittersweet afterglow of Lucy Harriss final performance as Donna , I actually forgave the Ministry Of Transport ( MOT ) for their utterly hopeless , myopic , third world-style road works , as I made the inevitable , poorly-marked , detour around the never-ending piecemeal construction on the M11-M25 junction . <p> Indeed , even the simple wiggling of Tanyas ( Jane Gurnetts ) foot ( never the same way twice ) , on the bed where she fakes an ankle injury to avoid having to " suck or blow " an inflatable mattress , alone , would have made my detour more than worth it . <p> Hannah Robertson in my view , has a very unique talent that should , if there is any justice in show business , allow her to " name her poison " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of her exquisite beauty , grace and musicality tempted me to assert that she has a " Movie Star " quality about her , but given the current state of affairs in Hollywood , I realize it could be taken , justifiably so , as an insult . Thus , I am now , officially , on the record , placing Hannah into my rarified Pantheon of Mamma Mia " Irreplaceables . " <p> I will miss Bill Austins ( Paul Hawkyards ) rapport with Sophie ; he brings a great deal of quality and believability to his role . Unlike the self-indulgent and pathologically narcissistic Hollywood pretty boys personified in Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise or " Brad Pratt " and " Tom Loose " as my son refers to them , Paul Shelford ( Sky ) much like Hannah ( Sophie ) , projects a totally sincere , likable and believable character that must be , like Lucys and Hannahs characters , on some level , a partial extension of himself . He will be sorely missed , as I fear he too , will be enshrined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be holding my breath awaiting his worthy replacement . <p> The comic timing of Jane Gurnett ( Tanya ) and Joanna Monro ( Rosie ) , during Chiquetita was a masterpiece of the most densely packed hilarity I have ever seen , and sadly fear , ever will see , again . It stands alone , like a kind-of " banana bullfight " Mona Lisa of comic genius , that will be debated for centuries to come , with no clear definitive theory ever emerging to fully explain it . It may just be that the best any of us can do is simply gaze in wonderment , and not even try to explain why or how it affects us so deeply . <p> Jane Gurnetts " Does Your Mother Know " scene was so outrageously funny , I thought my wife was going to hyperventilate . May I suggest to the theatre that they change their " fake " warning about nervous dispositions and white LYCRA and replace it with a real medical warning about Jane and install fully functioning drop-down oxygen masks ! A friend of ours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so full of tears from laughing at Chiquetita , she missed half of Dancing Queen . <p> Staying with the Greek theme for a moment , I truly believe that Mamma Mia is fundamentally misunderstood . I submit that it is not the " light-hearted romp " that so many believe it to be , but rather a kind of modified Wagnerian " Total Art " ( Gesamtkunstwerk ) experience , incognito . <p> In my view , whether Judy Craymer realizes it or not , she has , in a way , bested Wagner , and in so doing , has converted one form of psychic energy ( catharsis ) into another , pure joy , by juxtaposing outrageous comedy with the joyful music of ABBA with the potential tragedy of Sophie ( Hannah Robertson ) marrying too young and then narrowly averting the potential disaster of her youthful impulsivity at the 11th hour . Mamma Mia goes well beyond mere entertainment , which is why , like the Greek classics , it will live forever in the hearts of those who are lucky enough to internalize its deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much emotion in my reviews , but here I feel it is both necessary and instructive . Somewhat caught off guard by my own reaction , I kept telling myself , almost embarrassed , " get a grip Tim , its just a show , and a comedy nonetheless ; " of course , my wife blubbering next to me did n't  help my best efforts at stoicism . So why did I feel as if I had been gutted during the curtain call ? Why such a strong sense of loss ? <p> Well , to put it bluntly , Lucy occupies her own unique category , and also still , in my view , partly because of her uniqueness , is not fully cognizant of the true depth of her powers . In some ways I suppose this is a good thing for the quality of her last performance , like the surgeon who is so focused on cutting , that he has n't  the time to speculate on the consequences of failure for the patients friends and family , but for me , it serves as very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepen my sense of loss . It is now my firm belief that even after all the glowing words I have written about Lucy , I did n't  even scratch the surface of her abundant talent . <p> Now I know that you skeptics out there will say , " Come on Winey ! how many times can you eat crow ? " " You are a bigger flip flopper than the infamous Senator John Kerry , who unceremoniously lost the last US Presidential election in a landslide . " I can assure you that there is no crow on this menu . I have not forgotten my earlier reviews , but have had , what I can only call , an epiphany after discovering the deeper message of Mamma Mia , exemplified by the transition from catharsis to Joy , which Lucy ( to my chagrin ) instinctively discovered long ago , and in so doing , literally became Donna . The foundation of all great art is truth . And the " truth " of Donna can not be arrived at through scholarship , only by instinct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucys instinctive discovery much earlier , but like so many things worth treasuring , we often discover , " tragically , " their true value only after they are nearly , or completely , gone . <p> To fully grasp the magnitude of my loss , the reader could combine everything I ever wrote about Lucy , multiply it by a thousand , raise that number to the power of 100 , and then , like imagining an infinity of infinities , give up trying , and simply curse yourself until a real meteor does eventually strike you as just punishment for not having the good sense to fully appreciate her . Alternatively , you could reflect on my emotions during Lucys final curtain call . I felt as if it were the inevitable , end of an era , painfully and irretrievably , " Slipping Through My Fingers . " Lucy ( Donna ) , Hanna ( Sophie ) and Jane ( Tanya ) clearly have gone far beyond the call of duty in their roles , and in so doing , have given me and my family many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a real meteor actually struck me during Lucys final performance , I would most assuredly have died as happy as any man ever did . <p> God bless this cast , and in particular , Lucy Harris , for generously radiating so much joy to so many , in this all too weary world . They say that grief is the price of love , and so I doubt we will ever completely stop grieving over the loss of this " one off " Donna . <p> We were in Circle Row G15 and 16 - very good as reviewed on this site ( thank you Monkey ) last night , Thursday 4 May 2007 . The sound wasnt balanced well at first , and the banker Dad was so soft you could barely hear him speak , but OK when singing . Worth mentioning again , the very steep rake of the Circle . Do n't  wear platform shoes ! I did n't  see anyone walk down facing forward . They all turned sideways . Ladies wearing high heels were the most nervous of all . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good and comfortable , and legroom , at least where we sat , good . <p> Good , lightweight fun . Amazing how many young people know the words better than I do , at near pension age ( oh God , am I really ? ) and the enthusiasm and affection for the performers was voiced all through . Wonderful finish numbers , with the whole audience jumping and singing along lustily . <p> Just wanted to say , nuts to all the negative comments on this show , it 's fabulous . Saw it on Friday 15 August 2007 , 5pm performance , and loved every minute of it . In fact , came out and wanted to go straight back in and see it again - and would have done if we had n't got train tickets to get home ! I reckon your correspondent who saw it in January 2007 was very depressed by the weather , ' cos it certainly was n't the show I saw - I hope no-one is put off by the ' blokes in wedding dresses ' comment for instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that comment is most unfair . I agree with the person who said about the ' feel good factor ' though , it certainly makes you feel good . I agree you really should be a fan of the music but that 's a given if you go and see this show anyway , why would you go to a show based on ABBA 's music if you do n't like their music in the first place ? ? ? <p> Anyway , just had to say how fabulous the show is and ca n't wait to go again . Our seats were circle row D 15/16 and the safety bar on the circle edge did n't bother me and I am only 5 ' 2 " tall , so no probs whatsoever , although the comment about the rake of the seating is true , the one thing you ca n't do in the circle seats , even if you are on the end of the row , is get up and dance at the end - next time I will sit in the stalls ! <p> Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not just for the music . The cast are brilliant - Linzi Hateley is a brilliant Donna , and as for Joanna Munroe and Jane Gurnet , well ! ' Take a Chance on Me ' and ' Does Your Mother Know ' were just 2 of the fabulous performances . We thought it was a brilliant melding of the songs and the story , the whole thing really flowed together , and of all the friends who told us to go and see it , no-one told us how funny it is too , but we know now ! Will definitely be on the train again in the near future to get back and see it again . <p> Jenny Birmingham <p> Having promised my wife for a while I would take her to see ' Mamma Mia , ' I can honestly say that saving it for her Christmas present was a smart move , This show was one of the best prezzies ever bought ; the timing / choreography and excellent mixture of realistic storyline and good comedy was Superb ! ! Topped off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a night we will remember and talk of for a long time . <p> If there had to be a downside at all , I would respectfully suggest that the guy playing Sam has a fantastic voice both in speech and song , but came across very much as being better suited to opera than Abba - that 's Opera as in Carmen etc , not Oprah as in the female talk show host - although I 'm certain he would do just as well in either role ! ! ! Seriously , this guy could bring a tear to a glass eye with such a powerful and emotional aura , unfortunately it made him a little wooden / shouty and over-powering in this particular story ...... But in fairness it did n't spoil anything . <p> Overall I would recommend this to the hilt and then some . The whole experience was nothing short of exquisite in every sense . We have already planned to buy tickets for this as a birthday gift for family and will definitely watch for this cast or any of its current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show itself ... were a joy to watch . Thank you to all ! ! ! <p> It was my sincere pleasure and extremely good fortune to witness a very special performance of Mamma Mia on January 17th , 2008 . After my wifes friend was taken i 'll and could not use her ticket , I gladly stepped in as her " alternate " audience member . To say that the combined performances of Lucy Harris ( Donna ) , Jane Gurnett ( Tanya ) and Hanna Robertson ( Sophie ) were noteworthy would be like saying Simon Cowells criticism can be a little harsh at times ! Lucy pulled out all the dramatic stops , added extra stops , and then pulled those out too , extending the dynamics of her vocal emotional and comedic range well beyond what I thought was already her absolute limit . That 's the magic of Lucy ; its as if she reinvents herself in every performance by drawing on some special powers , optimizing each performance depending on the cast and audience dynamics . The site and sound of Lucy jumping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her vocal , dramatic , athletic and comedic skills and equally concerned about her safety ! <p> Just when I thought the scene couldnt be milked any more , she pulled out a tennis racket and began strumming it in a way that words can not do justice . At times , Lucy projects a kind of " ultra-believability " of character that seems almost unique to her . One could try and dissect it , but why ? Frog guts do not , a frog , make ! Like some kind of sadistic magical dairy farmer , she just keeps milking a proverbial musical , dramatic and comedic cow long after you 're convinced it must be totally dehydrated ! There were substantial chunks of the show where I was drawn into the story in a state of total suspended disbelief . My son said it best when he said he felt like a fly on the wall . No sooner had I regained my composure after the bed scene , than Lucy emerged from a doorway with a purple-feathered scarf and sunglasses wielding her makeshift microphone ( deodorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm still convinced actual sparks flew off her body ! <p> Outdoing oneself seems to have been a recurring theme in the January 17th performance . Jane Gurnetts " Does Your Mother Know " scene with Pepper went well beyond inspired ; it was like 100 master-classes all crammed into one scene , all the while never slipping into a characterization of herself ( a very real risk in such a role ) . Jane is the consummate professional , able to read , with razor-sharp accuracy , the timbre of the audience and adjust her timing accordingly . I feel that much of the subtler aspects of Thursdays performance were lost on much of the audience . I wanted to stand up and shout back at them , " Did you just hear and see what I heard ? " " Were you bussed in from a hospital specializing in mental , emotional visual , auditory , comic and dramatic disorders ! " All kidding aside , I think the percentages of foreign audience members have quite a bit to do with the nature and degree of audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character , helping , along with Lucy , to create and sustain a magical state of suspended disbelief , making their respective characters , and the relationship between them , that much more believable/relatable . <p> Hanna Robertson was divine . She has expertly refined her character in quite subtle , but no less substantial ways , palpably expanding her vocal and dramatic range , rendering an already totally believable character , that much more so . It really is difficult to see where Donna ends and Sophie begins , which is a testament to their individual talents and obvious devotion to teamwork . Despite knowing the plot all too well , I found myself on the edge of my seat , rooting for Hannah to make the right decision , almost embarrassingly so , like a bored housewife escaping into a fantasy world of soap opera , except that Mamma Mia is no soap opera ! Hannah has a unique , almost porcelain doll beauty , which only adds to her youthful innocence , making her decision to marry so young seem that much more impulsive and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much more . I 'm glad she seems to be using less makeup . Her natural , youthful beauty , only adds to the innocence of her wide-eyed character . Hannah exquisitely exemplifies the fragility of youth and along with it , the gravity of her potentially life-altering decisions juxtaposed against so little life experience . <p> Paul Shelford is very believable as Sophies fiancT , and delivers a very selfless , polished , and at times , genuinely funny performance . This Sophie and Sky fully convince me that they could be an actual couple , causing me to root for their happiness that much more . Hannah is truly blossoming into a force to be reckoned with in the West End . I 'm not making this up ; during the drive home , my son complained that his lips hurt and were beginning to crack because he could n't stop smiling ! Notwithstanding Simon Cowells reputation for harshness , I doubt even his hardened show-biz heart could resist substantial softening at the magical performance I was lucky enough to witness . <p> Timothy Winey <p> On arriving at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I was nervous to say the least . My wife was desperate to see ' Mamma Mia ' after seeing the recent film version and although I was told it was a ' girl 's film ' I played the good and dutiful husband and supplied 2 tickets . <p> We took our seats in stalls D17 and D18 and had a good look around and thought that the theatre looked very modern and soulless compared to other West End theatres I had visited before . The music started pumping out very very loudly and then the curtain went up , one pretty young girl sitting on stage begins to sing , then she is joined by two other girls and for some unknown reason I immediately get the feeling this is not going to be my kind of show - how right I was ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> I hated every minute of this production - the jokes were n't funny , the singing was terrible ( apart from Sophie ) , the acting was overdone , some of the songs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dads ' could not sing or dance to save his life and I question how on earth he made it into the show . There were women cackling and howling all around me - it was like there was a big joke that every one else was in on but no one had bothered to tell me about . Do n't get me wrong I liked ' Hairspray , ' ' Guys and Dolls , ' ' Phantom , ' ' Chicago , ' ' Joseph ' etc - so I do n't have a bias towards any particular type of musical but this just did not appeal to me . <p> In summary I would say this is definitely a girls / womens musical and one plus point of the evening was that my wife loved it and thought it was fantastic - but even she conceded it did lack the ' quality ' of other West End shows we had seen . <p> Seat opinion - Stalls D17 and D18 - very close to the action and you can see faces and expressions etc but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> I went to see Mamma Mia on 24th January 2009 at the matinee . <p> It was a full house and I can see why , although I 'm still not sure what to think of this show . I can understand it being a ' woman 's show ' as it is that kind of almost chick flick story . Especially scenes in the wetsuits , definitely for the women of all ages ( and we must n't forget the Gay crowd too ! ) . <p> I personally really enjoyed it , BUT it had its downsides . The beginning of Act 1 is hard to get into and I did n't really start enjoying the show until about ' Mamma Mia ! ' when all the real gags came out ! However from here till the end of the first act they put all the best ABBA songs on , or at least the ones I know . ' Dancing Queen ' was of course my favourite scene . Very amusing and great to watch ( and my friend who 's obsessed with ABBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the first Act 1 was really enjoying it , but then Act 2 followed the same pattern where it is hard getting into it and then all the well known songs come on at ' The Winner Takes It All ' . Out of the 2 acts , Act 1 is the more immature fun one , whereas Act 2 is the more mature one ( but only just ) . I especially loved ' Take a Chance on Me ' , which had me giggling none stop . However after the initial bows with the megamix when everyone got up and danced and sang along , it was good to see everyone up on their feet and I really did enjoy that bit . <p> The cast are all amazing , understudies and the main actors . Loved them all and was probably a perfect cast for a first time . <p> We sat in the Dress Circle Row L seats 7 to 11 . Being the very back row , the theatre has been built in such a way you can see everything like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus these seats are cheap and you feel almost in the middle ! I would get them , very comfortable and lots of leg room . No need to worry about tall people in here ! <p> Overall I would say a good show , not just for ABBA fans and possibly not for the alpha males . Older generations will appreciate it more , but younger ones will still enjoy it and have a good time . But I can only take small doses of ABBA at a time , so this is enough for me for a couple of years . Bear that in mind . But it is a ' must see ' on your lists . <p> Saw this Saturday matinee January 31st 2009 , with sister-in law and 3 x 9 year olds . Sat in the Dress Circle row F seats 31 to 35 , all I could get , but they were excellent seats , we had a great view of the stage and the Circle has a good rake so the kids were able to see perfectly . <p> In one word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun and the perfect antidote to the current credit-crunch gloom and doom . It was a great atmosphere throughout and the whole theatre was on its feet at the end clapping , dancing and cheering for more . <p> I loved Donna ( Linzi Hateley ) and her Dynamos , they were very funny , especially Joanna Monro as Rosie ( fantastic comic timing ) and the boy playing Pepper ( an understudy ) also did very well . However we all thought that the lady playing Sophie was a bit old for a realistic 20 year old ( my 9 year old got her muddled up with Donna from time to time ) . <p> Favourite group numbers were ' Gim me Gim me Gim me ' and ' Voulez Vous ' ( a brilliant ending to Act 1 ) , performed with huge energy and enthusiasm by the cast and of course Super Trouper by the Dynamos . <p> All in all its a brilliant , if a somewhat pricey , way to spend an afternoon .

We were singing the songs and smiling all the way home . <p> Mila <p> Notes from 6th April 2009 performance , the tenth anniversary : <p> First of all , 10 out of 10 for the refurbishment of the theatre - it is the first time I have been since it was done out , and it really sets the standard in terms of facilities , legroom , cleanliness . More should follow suit and bring the West End kicking and screaming into the 21st century without sacrificing the character of the theatres . A big ' thank you ' to the box office staff too . I have been asking for tickets to this performance every time I have been in London for the past eighteen months - they took my details and although I expected to hear nothing , actually did get in touch via email and phone on the day tickets went on sale . <p> Also , 10/10 for the seats - we sat in the stalls row F seats 16 to 19 - a perfect view , and plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night was going to be a special one , what with the decorations , the photographers , the complimentary champagne , programmes , badges etc , and indeed it was . <p> The show itself was a normal performance , Linzi Hateley performed as Donna ( not usual for a Monday ) and was magnificent , and her dynamos were equally good , especially Joanna Munroe . It took me a little longer to warm to the three " dads " but they got going eventually . As for the show itself , my usual thoughts , the first half is fantastic , the start of the second sags a little but then it picks up again - Abba songs take you through a range of emotions and this show certainly does the same . <p> It is the quality of the songs and the script that keeps it going , and as a lifelong Abba fan , I really appreciated the inclusion of ' Slipping Through My Fingers , ' the perfect song for that scene , really proving that the creative team wanted to do more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people around us to tears ! By the end , everybody appeared to be having so much fun that it would be impossible not to be swept along with it . <p> It was during the final run throughs of ' Dancing Queen ' and Waterloo that " normal " stopped , as the theatre was festooned with fireworks onstage , and the auditorium filled with glitter and streamers . This was followed by speeches by Judy Craymer and Catherine Johnson , and finally , raising the roof , Bjorn and Benny themselves . Bjorn 's little joke about Abba reforming was a nice touch ! Good to see the casts reactions too , it was obviously a special night for them . <p> Overall , I would thoroughly recommend this show if you are after a fun night out , obviously this was not a usual night , but it transformed a great show into something unforgettable . <p> Went to see ' Mamma Mia ' ( again ) on Monday 2nd November 2009 . I have seen it several times before in the West End , my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have to say this musical came up as bright and sparkling as a newly minted coin . <p> We sat in the Circle Row D 18 and 19 and had a perfect view of the stage . The feel good factor of this musical ca n't be underestimated and the cast had the audience singing , clapping and dancing during the finale . <p> Special mention must go to Sally-Ann Triplett as Donna who was excellent throughout - try to see her before she finishes in mid-December 09 . <p> We sat in row H , seats 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 of the Dress Circle . Although I personally would n't normally choose to sit this far back I was pleasantly surprised at the amazing view of the stage . I could see loads of detail and the sound was very good as well . In addition , the very steep rake of the seating ( not great for high heeled shoe lovers ) ensures clear views over heads in front of you . <p> In terms of sightlines , this must be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from there front few rows must be even better . The Dress Circle bar is also wonderful with loads of room . <p> The Good ... I managed to get a free ticket for Mamma Mia , this week - March 2010 . I was allocated Stalls O12 . The view was surprisingly good , there was a reasonable rake , and you felt a lot closer to the stage than ' O ' might otherwise suggest . The only downside was that because it 's an aisle seat , there 's an overhead aisle light that shines distractingly in your eyes when the house lights are dimmed . In fact , many of the aisle seats in this area are disconcertingly illuminated whilst the rest of the house is in darkness , making you feel slightly exposed . <p> The Bad ... That night , I was surrounded by people who just would not shut up . Behind me there was a group of generally non-English speaking tourists who appeared to be translating the show for their colleagues , and got louder whenever a song was being sung . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another group of people who had had a few drinks too many ... and wanted to talk . And to the left , near the Sound Desk , there was a girl that was clearly too young to be taken to the theatre who also would n't shut up . It was impossible to concentrate on the show - in fact it was so distracting , I did n't know what was going on or what the story was ( I have n't see the film or the stage show before ) . After 25 minutes , I just could n't take it anymore , and had to leave . <p> Okay , I had n't paid for my ticket , but I felt sorry for those in the same area that HAD paid for their tickets . In 25 years of West End Theatre going , I 've never had a more miserable night . <p> I took two coaches on 5th November 2010 , and as expected everyone loved the show . We had excellent seats in the Dress Circle - rows E , F and G @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could look over the head of the tallest person sitting in front of you . Getting down to your seat from the back would challenge anyone suffering from vertigo , though as it is a very steep rake . Having said that , the refurbishment of the whole theatre is quite spectacular and the seats very comfortable . <p> The show itself has lost nothing compared to the first time I saw it . This was the fifth time , four of them with coaches - making six coaches altogether , which must make it the most number of people I have taken to any show . <p> An evening treat after quite a heavy matinee on 29th January 2011 . I must point out first what a lovely theatre The Prince of Wales is . Really refurbished to such an elegant and high standard . We were in the Dress Circle , row D37 to 41 , which was over to the side but not affecting the view of the stage . The seats were really comfortable too , which was unusual and a nice surprise ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show ? Awful ! They might as well of just stood there and sang a load of Abba songs out of tune . The set was practically non-existent , and what set there was did n't seem to move very much ; which was a theme the actors also used , as they just stood motionless when most songs were being warbled ! A couple of numbers brought some movement , but not much . <p> I ca n't believe this show has been on for so long . In theory it should be an absolute blast but it 's utterly lame . The only energy came in the last ten minutes with the encore . The whole show should of been like it . ( ' Priscilla ' does the same thing 100 times better ) . <p> All five of us were in agreement that it just is n't fun enough or colourful enough ( unless you really like blue ) . It obviously serves a purpose , but we wo n't be going back - which is a shame because the Theatre is stunning ! !

@@45561068 @5561068/ <p> An easy way to ensure that you will be buying tickets from a retailer who adheres to this good advice is to pick one who is a member of Society of Ticket Agents &amp; Retailers scheme ( S.T.A.R for short ) , of which Theatremonkey.com itself is an Affiliate Member . Look for their symbol : With so many outlets all looking alike , though , how can you spot a S.T.A.R ? This simple guide may help you choose . Simply click on the area of London below to help you easily locate S.T.A.R member outlets . <p> DO NOTE THAT some booths do change ownership over time . ALWAYS CHECK FOR the above symbol , and also that you are happy with your seats ( pointed out to you on a proper seating plan ) and the price you are paying , before actually handing over your money ! <p> S.T.A.R .

DO NOT confuse this with the outlet pictured below ... <p> CONCLUSION : It is fairly hard to spot the S.T.A.R . members initially . Every outlet has a huge sign , and no wonder people get confused . Most important - look for the S.T.A.R . sticker or TKTS sign . CHECK that the company meets the guidelines that the Society of London Theatre suggest ... and if you feel unsure , just walk away . <p> Do remember , if things go wrong when buying from a S.T.A.R . member , you have the assistance of S.T.A.R . itself in resolving the problem . Buy from the worst tout or scalper , and at best the local police officer will attempt to retrieve your money for you - but do n't rely on it . As a local officer who patrols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you or any wrongdoing on his part ; and worse , there is nothing much the police can arrest anyone for . <p> Finally , NEVER buy from the folks who ca n't even be bothered to buy a booth , but just stand on the pavement outside theatres or in the streets - some even around the TKTS booth ticket line .

Any co-incidence or confusion is not intended and can not be implied . Opinion expressed is that of the reporting person of an actual event only . <p> ALSO WORTH KNOWING : An emerging trend in 2008 is the buying up of website names that LOOK LIKE , BUT ARE NOT the official theatre website . For example , the official site to buy tickets from the Prince Edward Theatre is that of the owners - delfont-mackintosh.co.uk . A search engine result , though , brings up sites like " **26;2143;TOOLONG " ( example , not an actual or genuine site ) before the official one in the listing . Sites like the fictional " **26;2171;TOOLONG " are owned by agents - either STAR members , STAR sub-agents or even touts / scalpers .

Even though the Palace was n't really its original home , it had come to be something of a cherished landmark and charmingly dilapidated place of homage to all the musical theatre buffs of my acquaintance . <p> In the ultimate gesture of indignity , One of London 's greatest theatrical gems is to be staged in the grotesquely unremarkable and ' sans balconie ' Queen 's Theatre . Gone will be the days of sitting in a rusty and antiquated seat peering almost vertically through a mesh of unreassuring iron-work and gripping the armrests tightly , partly out of sheer emotion , but otherwise out of a genuine fear that you may fall to your death on the barricade . <p> We are told that the staging will be ' rethought ' for the new location -surely not . The fastidiously uninspired set and woefully irksome turntable have become celebrities in their own right so I hope rethinking does not entail any significant changes . <p> Much as I appreciate the palace is falling down and as such this is a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of an era . <p> Will Cooper <p> <p> My wife and I also lament the end of " Les Mis " at the Palace Theatre . <p> Yes , the Palace is a tad run-down &amp; frazzled at the edges . But the Palace fits one just like that trusty old &amp; worn recliner tucked in the corner at home - it 's a cozy place to settle down and escape the world for a few hours . <p> And what better way to escape than by immersing one 's self in the world and characters of Les Mis ? It is truely an experience taking in " Les Mis " at the Palace as the staging , the music , the words , and the theatre all fuse into an unforgettable evening out . <p> We fly over from the States several times a year to take in London for several days , and the Palace and " Les Mis " are often a part of our journey .

A tale of surrogate motherhood , with a British TV-Executive couple using a Russian woman 's egg , their own sperm and an Indian woman 's womb to create a family . Throw in British left-wing angst and a sick relative , a dream about the child-to-be and some other back-story , and the verdict is the whole is compelling . Writer and director are as one , and each actor is considered outstanding - Justine Mitchell as the non-biological mother-to-be in particular . Worth seeing for certain , is the verdict .
