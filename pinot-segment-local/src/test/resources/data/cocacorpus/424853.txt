Let 's give a few final thoughts to 2012 , with the very last day of 2012 seeing the release of the second instalment of Shiki , titled Shiki Part 2 . Shiki approaches the legend of the Okiagari ( or Shiki ' , which means corpse demon ) - bodies that have risen up and transformed into Vampires . All hell breaks loose in the village of Sotoba . The village 's Doctor soon becomes suspicious by what appears to be some kind of epidemic ( or so the rest of the people of Sotoba think ) , with a large number of the villagers being claimed by death since the summer . But what is really going on is that many of the dead are transforming into blood-thirsty creatures of the night , as the Shiki attempt to take over Sotoba . The Doctor soon takes note and begins investigating , or shall I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , making this issue personal ) and eventually becoming all-consumed by the problem at hand and eradicating it . <p> Where some of the dead rise , eventually becoming Shiki , some will just begin decomposing , with death officially claiming them . So when a Shiki tries to turn a human , it does n't guarantee success . But for those who do make it into full Shiki mode , I guess you could say that for those Shiki , the moon begins to look down upon them , because the sun can not , ultimately becoming one of their greatest enemies ( the sun burns them alive , as goes many vampire tales ) . That , and their thirst for blood . However that is not the case for all , with a subspecies whom have escaped the chains of what makes the Shiki supposedly weak . The Jinrou ' as they are known , have the ability to walk about during the day and can also survive on normal food . They have strengthened physical abilities and heightened senses , surpassing those of a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however they do come very close to death when they eventually do transform into this rarity . <p> This is certainly not your typical vampire story . Sure , at first you begin rooting for the humans , naturally . But after some time ( and with some clever storytelling ) you will soon find yourself seeing things from the Shiki 's perspective . Many perceive vampires as monsters of the night , pretty much because there is the knowledge that in order to survive , a vampire must feed , with that food being human blood . But as you progress further and further into the story , the humans take this situation as that of a kill or be killed scenario , with the thought that if they do n't rid their village of the Shiki , they 'll soon find themselves victims themselves . So , ultimately the humans kill with the intention of ridding their town of this apparent problem . The humans face the concept of having to kill family and friends who have now risen , people they have known for a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially because their means of killing is in no way quick , or kind , but instead slow and torturous ( which can at times feel a touch uncomfortable to watch ) . The humans do n't just have blood on their hands towards the end of this , but all over them , literally . They make the vampires ( some being people who they know ) suffer . Dragging them into the sunlight , killing them in various horrendous ways . And then you wonder just who the monsters really are . Human or Shiki ? <p> The Shiki need to drink human blood in order to sustain themselves . Needing to kill in order to survive . However , ultimately there is a choice whether to drink or to starve , and for those who feel the thought of hurting people just to survive in their new form is wrong , find themselves questioning things and making that vital choice between their ( after ) life and someone elses . I find this ultimate personal battle intriguing , exhibiting that the personalities of these Shiki seem very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Having not seen the first part ( prior to watching this ) , I still found it easy enough to get the gist of where this anime was going . I like the way it approaches the vampire genre . The sadness , loneliness and battles that the characters come across . We get to know many of the characters and their backstories , exploring the different perspectives , allowing us to gain a better understanding behind why these characters act that way they do . <p> If you like blood , violence , vampires and some horror thrown into the concoction then give Shiki a watch . This is one story that can get under your skin .

The adjustable headband had a comfortable thick wodge of padding whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around my ears ( which yes , are probably slightly on the small side but the average adult male should also find the cups enclose the whole ear ) . <p> Both the ear cushions and headband are fashioned on the Astro Gaming A40 headset which is made to wear for marathon gaming sessions . Here , whole movies , killer party playlists and long online gaming matches were taken on and were comfortable throughout . Both the hyper loud Killer is Dead and the icily atmospheric Lost Planet 3 were enjoyed without my ears burning or head feeling squashed . I had the headset on and off for a week and went around 10 hours before it needed charging up again . <p> Under the cups was the real magic lay and the 7.1 Dolby surround sound from the PLYR 1 twin drives was perfect for gaming and movie viewing , with bullets and footsteps sometimes heard as if right behind me . <p> Accessed via a small 3-position EQ switch round the back on the right ear cup , there are three different audio settings to choose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode worked well with the latest Star Trek Into Darkness DVD , picking out the explosions and Jim 's punches . Precision Mode is supposedly for clean mids and higher frequencies when you want to pick out vocals in movies and music , or the sound of a gun reloading in a game but I found Supreme mode more than delivered an immersive experience with clear , unmodified sounds . <p> Chatting to friends in game or on Skype was easy as the flexible mic on the left cup could be neatly flipped up vertically until a little click locked it into mute position ( handy for those with a tendency to use fruity language ) . To start chatting again , the mic was easy to pull back down and those on the receiving end said they could hear me clearly .

I was able to fade them out and re-adjust when the noise died down . <p> Cleverly , the stand for the headset is also the wireless transmitter , which was paired with the headset before leaving its factory birthplace . The PLYR 1 headset also comes with a USB charging cable , a USB power cable and an Xbox Live cable which meant I could hook it up to my Xbox or PS3 , as well as my laptop and PC , all of which were easy to connect . As I also use my PS3 for watching movies , being able to quickly adjust audio settings between games and movies were was a pain free process thanks to having no wires to faff with or change over . When powering up either game console , the transmitter powered up as well ; again , less time setting up , more time well spent getting entertained . <p> Overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiest , comfiest and best quality headsets of the summer . For gamers and movie lovers not yet ready to invest in a high-end headset , at $179.99 , this is a great first investment into surround sound joy . <p> Skullcandy PLYR 1 headsets are exclusively available from Best Buy , with more retailers coming soon . <p> Thanks to Skullcandy and Astro Studios for providing a headset for purpose of the review

Journey to Agartha ( Children Who Chase Lost Voices ) is a story that will appeal to the masses . A beautifully simplistic narrative by Makoto Shinkai , who has previously been compared to Miyazaki . <p> The story follows a young girl named Asuna , who is both hard-working and adventurous . Asuna seems like an isolated child , having lost her father when she was younger and her mother is a nurse who has to work unsociable hours . One day she hears an enchanting and mysterious melody ( with the help of a makeshift radio ) , from another world , one known as Agartha . <p> Asuna first hears about this mythical subterranean kingdom of Agartha from a mysterious boy named Shun , but not before he saves her from an ancient-like monster with the help of a high-powered crystal known as a clavis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor injury as a result , she takes him to her secret place and patches him up . The pair soon form a bond that will stay with Asuna for the entire story , one that forms the catalyst for the unfolding events during the film . This bond is enhanced when Asuna reveals to Shun that she had heard the mysterious melody , a beautiful song which she imaged is what music from the heart would sound like . Instantly Shun is intrigued , because it was infact his song she had heard , or I guess you could say his last . Shun had travelled to the surface world and it seems his purpose was fulfilled the moment she told him about the song . It is in this touching moment that he gives her a blessing in the form of a kiss , one that has young Asuna instantly blushing . But sadly , we later discover that Shun has been found dead , something which Asuna finds hard to accept . <p> It is in school that a substitute teacher Mr Morisaki tells the tale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband and wife . When the wife dies , the husband journeys to the underworld in order to retrieve her . It is when the various names of this underworld are read out in class and one of those names being Agartha , that Asuna is instantly intrigued . <p> Asuna soon crosses paths with Shun 's brother , named Shin . The pair find themselves encountering a group called the Arch Angels who are after the way into Agartha , because this mythical land holds the potential to bring the dead back to life . It soon becomes known that one of the Arch Angels is Asuna 's substitute teacher , who had lost his wife and has that very intention - to bring her back from the dead . It is from here that we see the spectacular journey to Agartha commence . But with such a quest in sight there will no doubt be danger , excitement and revelations . <p> I found this a wonderful and endearing story . With beautifully simple , yet direct dialogue that works well in both English , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched both . The entire thing as a whole is full of beauty , from the sound , the visuals and the story . <p> Such a beautiful tale of a legendary land said to be hidden deep with the earth , and as a sucker for legendary tales and far off magical kingdoms , this excited me even more . The beauty of this anime is also in the message , especially in the idea that you have to find your happiness in life , even through all the pain that life can bring . This stunning tale of love and loss approaches the concept of the adventure of life and the inevitability of death being part of the same journey , that when something or someone dies they become a part of something bigger . Beautifully poetic . <p> Admittedly the first draft of this review was a lot longer , discussing the storyline in more depth .

In the first quarter of the 19th Century , apocalyptic ideas in fiction changed from those of religion to something a little more man made . The first post-apocalyptic novel in the form that we recognise it was The Last Man ( Le Dernier Homme ) by Jean Baptiste Cousin de Granville . The two World Wars and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were also responsible for many of the classics within this genre . <p> Post-Apocalyptic Books are once again experiencing a bit of a resurgence . This is largely due to mainstream successes such as The Road by Cormac McCarthy , World War Z by Max Brookes and the popularity of the 2012 myth of the Mayan apocalypse . <p> It would be easy to think that this is all doom and gloom but it 's not .

For a start , it 's a monster movie , or rather , it 's a retake of THE monster movie . Everyone knows who Godzilla is , or if they did n't , the blanket advertising has certainly made sure they do now , so one knows what to expect . In terms of the genre , it is definitely up there in execution with Del Toro 's Pacific Rim , and it stomps all over Roland Emmerich 's 1998 version . <p> However , in recent years , no thanks to Emmerich , the sub-genre of CGI destruction porn has infiltrated the Hollywood blockbuster , where city blocks are literally being busted up into rubble , whether it is the aforementioned Pacific Rim , Battleship , Joss Whedon 's The Avengers Assemble , Zack Snyder 's Man of Steel or the however-many-there-are Transformer movies , without including Emmerich 's canon . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty spectacular , but after a while you start to think , " Yeah , yeah . Get on with the story . " - <p> To be fair , this version of Godzilla does have a story , and , like the original , does carry an ecological message about the power of nature to correct itself beyond man 's influence , as well as highlighting the dangers of nuclear energy/weapons . It also has a human element to it , with a cross-generation tale of family that has been involved with the gestation of the monster(s) . Unfortunately , the human element is mostly secondary to the monster action , which , let 's face it , most people want to see . <p> This film is almost the inverse of director Gareth Edwards ' previous movie , which got a fair bit of criticism in some circles because it had too much human story and not enough monster action , especially , according to the detractors , given the film 's title. - <p> For my money , Monsters was a better movie , because it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also because it did n't show lots of monsters , but inferred their presence . It also showcased what an exceptionally talented filmmaker Gareth is , which is why he got the Godzilla gig in the first place . <p> While there is no doubt this is the Godzilla story Gareth wanted to tell and make , it is Hollywood industrial-size filmmaking and suffers a bit for it . However , that is merely my ( slightly jaded ) opinion , which does n't make me the ideal target audience . I 'm sure the film will be a huge success , and Gareth was definitely the right choice to bring it to the screen . <p> I could n't be more pleased for his success , because , above all , it shows that talent can shine in , and despite , the Hollywood machine , and I look forward to seeing what he does next .

Returning to continue to manipulate the motions that follow in order to create a safe and gentle world for his little sister Nunnally . <p> For those who may not have already seen the first season of Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion , or perhaps need a reminder , here 's a brief recap : Lelouch Lamperouge is actually Lelouch vi Britannia , a royal prince who was abandoned along with his sister Nunnally when they were very young , shortly after their mother had been murdered . So not only did the two young royal-bloods find themselves motherless , they soon found themselves orphaned and alone , with no grievance support from their father ( the Emperor ) , who rejected the pair and sent them away . As Lelouch got older he vowed to seek revenge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for Nunnally , so he created Zero . Zero soon became a symbol of hope for the people known as Elevens ( Japanese ) , with the assistance of his newly acquired gift , known as The Power of Kings ' , or simply as Geass ' - an absolute power to command . <p> In Season 2 , a year has passed in the world of Zero vs the Holy Britannian Empire . We now return to find that even though we left off at a dramatic finishing point , when we come back there is little to no reference to the fact that Nunnally was kidnapped . The situation of the Britannian Empire still stands , there is inequality in the lands , and the best means for justice is to create a more equal playing field , because the Elevens are considered lesser beings by the Britannians . <p> Everything appears seemingly normal at Ashford Academy - a bit too normal if you ask me . With things seeming very much the same in a sense , minus a few ( somewhat major ) changes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyone else seem to have had their memories altered . There is an addition of a new school pupil named Rolo , who everyone acknowledges as Lelouch 's brother , including Lelouch himself . And Nunnally is nowhere to be seen . We do find out what is going on and things do slowly begin to unravel . But the basic outline is the Emperor has stolen their memories , then replaced them in an attempt to control the circumstances that may unfold , planting a few spies along the way , to ensure Lelouch does not remember his sister and his life as Zero . <p> The story is the continuation , and conclusion to Lelouch 's plan . There are many twists and turns to this that makes Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion Complete Season 2 brilliant to watch . It never let 's you get comfortable for too long , with each episode being very much relevant and jam-packed full of plot changes and progressions . <p> Lelouch manipulates the playing field very much like a game - he is a master chess player after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulating each step requires great skill and effort in order to achieve the end goal , sometimes there are even unforeseen sacrifices . We soon discover that in order to build that better world , there needs to be a huge evil to grab the attention , and then a saviour - a symbol of hope to help make things better . That sometimes , things must get worse before they can get better . And as Lelouch reiterates , those who kill , should only be those willing to die themselves . Lelouch wears a ( non-literal ) mask for the sake of others . Playing a game that requires a poker face to end all poker faces , in order to reach his inevitable goal . With life , death is inevitable , but when it comes as a result of Lelouch 's plot for revenge , it makes him all the more determined to build that brighter future , not just for Nunnally , but for everyone . <p> Anti-hero or villain ? Well in my eyes , anti-hero . Even though he inflicts suffering for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , but for the good of the world and those he cares for . <p> After watching the first series , I have been eagerly awaiting this release . And let me tell you this : I was not disappointed . This is a great continuation of Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion . And , this instalment does not , and dares not , disappoint . I can tell you that after watching the first part , this one surprised me just as much . <p> This brilliant , fast-paced , action packed series has a habit of doing a flip-turn on a regular basis . It is not afraid to challenge and change the dynamics , chucking in those twists and turns to intrigue and excite . There are some songs during unfolding events that really helped capture and enhance the moment , to the point I got goosebumps . There are many surprises and losses along the way , something which this series is not afraid to do , so be prepared you may even she 'd a tear or two . <p> Plus , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy enough for someone to follow who has n't watched it previously . However , I would highly recommend anyone who has n't watched the first season to do so , because Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion is one series that should not be missed . <p> Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion Complete Series 2 is Out Now on DVD and Blu-ray from Manga Entertainment

This is the End did really well at the box office despite accusations that the humour was too insular , but given the success of Rogen and crew 's previous hits it is clear their brand of humour travels .

By its very nature , it should mainly appeal to intelligent people who are interested in the bigger picture ; in science and the direction society is heading . To a certain extent , the same could be said for fantasy , but it is sci-fi that usually addresses society 's faults and its dreams by looking at potential future scenarios . <p> A lot of people , as in hardcore sci-fi fans , believe that Star Wars was the worst thing that happened to the genre , bringing it to a mass market that was more interested in action than concepts . OK , the whole Force thing had some mystic overtones , but this was of little interest to the majority that were infatuated with light sabres and slave Leia . As a result , film and TV studios wanted to replicate Lucas 's success by sticking to a similar formula . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for grown ups cancelled , often at a crucial part of the story , or even before a season finishes .

The list goes on and on . <p> There is a new entry to that list , Defying Gravity , which first aired in 2009 . Only 13 episodes were made of this gripping space drama , from the producers of Grey 's Anatomy . The series revolves around the eight astronauts and the ground crew of the Antares and their six-year mission , which includes landing on Venus . However , the complete details of the mission are not revealed to the crew , and when they start to hallucinate they begin to demand answers , giving a flavour of Solaris and Event Horizon . <p> It 's a slow burner , and flips back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' back stories as well as that of the mission . It 's a good six episodes before the drama starts to ramp up , but it is worth the wait .

Adjudicators called Chris Cwej and Roz Forrester as his companions . It 's a fairly grim and gritty story about psychic powers set in a housing estate , darker in tone than almost all Who that has been produced before or since . <p> That said , it 's an exciting , engaging novel and well worth a read if you can track one down ( and afford the mark-up on ebay ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enjoying the story , as the Big Finish audio production is n't far off . <p> While it 's a great Who story , and it 'll be brilliant to hear ' new ' dialogue by RTD performed by one of the classic Doctors , Damaged Goods seems a slightly odd choice of novel for Big Finish to adapt .

@@105082869 @482869/ 92882 @qwx952882 <h> Green Lantern <p> Posted by chris on Sat , 18/06/2011 - 18:34 <p> Could it be that the public is finally getting fed up with 3D and superhero comicbook movies ? It appears that in the US 3D is losing its appeal , and as the technique is mostly applied to blockbusters , which all seem to be derived from comics could this see the demise of the comic book movie . It is rather ironic that a genre firmly based in 2D should become the staple of 3D movies . Is it because superhero comics are the mythology of our time , or is it simply the paucity of original ideas in Hollywood that is the cause of this glut ? To say there are no original ideas in Hollywood is unfair on the writers and directors who try pitch brilliant ideas every day ; it 's the studios ' lack of risk-taking that is the problem . <p> And yet , a small indie flick is going to be less of a risk than a big 3D CG fest such as GREEN LANTERN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last couple of days . Of course , as we have seen in recent weeks , in spite of what the critics say , the power of marketing and the public 's ability to watch any old tosh at the multiplex has seen films such as SUCKER PUNCH still did good opening-weekend business . <p> It 's fair to say that a comic book like Green Lantern would not have been possible to make into a live action movie until now , even if a major part of it is actually CG animation . What has always made comics so engrossing is not so much their storytelling but their artwork . It is a simplified method of telling stories in which the visuals , rather than the words , do most of the work , which is why Hollywood has seized upon them for adaptations " most of the work has already been done . Zack Snyder is a perfect example of someone who took comics or graphic novels and adapted them panel for shot , with a heavy reliance on CG . <p> I 've never been much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so was not at all familiar with the Green Lantern mythology - which could explain why I kept calling it GREEN HORNET " so watching the movie unfold was intriguing from an esoteric point of view , with will being the most powerful force in the universe and fear an equally powerful , albeit destructive force . I imagined that the creators were avid fans of Carlos Castaneda , bringing the information from his books into a comic-book realm , only to discover that Green Lantern originated from the 1940s . Unfortunately , this concept was not explored in any great detail , relegating willpower to nothing more than conjuring tricks stifled by the limited imagination of Hal Jordan ( or the screenwriter ) . If you had the power to create or alter matter , surely , in a fight , you would use subtler methods , such as changing your enemy 's composition rather than create guns and swords . Basically , the Green Lantern Corp were using the Force but in a very physical manifestation . <p> Is the film as bad as everyone says it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exposition to explain the mythology to an ignoramus like me , then it is shown with lots of CGI characters and space vistas . Ryan Reynolds is charming as usual ; Blake Lively , as love interest Carol Ferris , is n't particularly convincing , especially as a fighter pilot ; Peter Sarsgaard is suitably over the top as Hector Hammond . What is sad is the amount of great talent that is gathered together for such a mediocre film . Comic book movies used to be dreadful , or equally bad TV series , but then they started attracting " visionary " directors and their entourage of acting talent , and suddenly everyone was trying to make comic book movies into high cinema , and some even achieved it , although they were n't necessarily from superhero comics . This is something film critics seem to be missing when they unleash their venom ; these are movies based on comic books that were originally written for teenagers , and they will never be much more than that in spite of them having A-list talent attached . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " experts " say people will still go and see it . <p> Overall I found the film no worse than THOR , in fact I was less disappointed with GREEN LANTERN than I was with THOR because : a ) I was expecting it to be bad , based on the trailer ; and b ) I was n't familiar with the character or mythology so was unaware of anything that may have been omitted , as in the case of THOR . <p> Should you go to see it , opt for the 2D version . As with so many 3D films , the only parts that impresses in 3D are the opening and closing credits .

Spare a thought then for Daniel Garner who since Halloween has found himself trapped between heaven and hell in a never-ending battle against all things demonic . If he ever wants to see the light of his life , Catherine , ever again , he 's going to have to run a mighty errand for a big red faced chap with horns and tiny glowing eyes . Armed with a whirly gun that has three whirring blades to plough into the stomachs and faces of oncoming foes ( aptly named the Painkiller gun ) , Daniel must collect 7000 souls or face eternal damnation in purgatory . <p> The opening levels , set in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising up from their tombs are relentlessly chaotic and quite tense with the undead circling Daniel , dashing towards him with grim vigour as a heavy metal soundtrack thrashes over the top , leaving my head and heart frantically throbbing long after the power was switched off . Each area has a wave of enemies to fell , after which , follows an eerie quietness broken only by faint scratchy pencil noises or creepy funfair-esque chimes before CRASH , the next wave appears , the guitars flare up , drums rumble and all hell breaks loose again . This ebb and flow for the most part works really well , offering small pauses in the action . This rhythm however quickly becomes familiar , there are copious numbers of conveniently placed ammo boxes , save points are close together and new weapons are easily won which eases the difficulty somewhat . Different guns are more effective against different baddies and switching between guns on the fly with the mouse scroll button allows for constant gunning whilst most reload speeds were just as zippy . This worked well enough in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages , scrolling through my gun collection felt more like watching the agonisingly slow Generation Game conveyor belt and it 's so frustrating to have no melee option , especially when a gaggle of evil Pinocchio 's crowd round , stabbing you with extended noses ( which the whirly gun has little effect on ) . Michael Jackson has nothing on Daniel Garner as he makes walking backwards to gain enough space to shoot enemies an art form . <p> There are other flaws dotted throughout the game that I also found impacted on the pace . Having to wait ages for bullet ridden bodies to turn into green souls , even with the soul gun 's ability to suck up the green orbs from afar is tedious ( although the gun does also come with the ability to shoot spinning saw blades , making it an excellent choice when stopping larger foes in their tracks with a well-aimed shot to their kneecaps ) .

Perhaps the overseers of Hellish game design decided this would make the game too easy ? That players would save up their demon power until they needed an edge when squaring up to the big bosses and give Daniel too much of a fighting chance but for me it would have added a neat level of control and ranked up the cool ' factor . <p> There is a PvP multiplayer section too that I found quite dull and did n't play much of after the single player campaign where despite all the frustrations , slugging weird S&amp;M dressed monks in vast gothic cathedrals or ninja gas mask wearing ant-men through twisted subway stations or big bulbous butted slobs in an opulent opera house or knife-wielding urchins in an orphanage was damn fun ! <p> Painkiller : Hell and Damnation is perhaps more akin to eating a pack of Ibuprofen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short burst of gruesome gunning , is definitely worth prescribing .

Real Steel . The episode 's name is Steel and it is starring a legend , Lee Marvin . <p> It all starts out in near future where boxing has made illegal . In a small restaurant , a man ( Lee Marvin ) known as Sam Steel ' Kelly sits with his partner Pole , both men have a grave expression as they 're discussing the future of their profession , mechanical boxing . <p> The men owns an outdated B2 mechanical boxer , Maxo ' , and are on their way out because they can no longer compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly believes Maxo still have fights left in him but is fought by his partner Pole who thinks their robot now is only good for scrap metal . <p> Kelly refuses to give up the idea of one last fight which would give them enough money to upgrade and fix the old geezer , and after a long time of persuading , Pole finally caves .

Why do you think there are so many of them ? <p> I do n't know , man . I 've been thinking about that too . I keep seeing these ads for all kinds of things in that vein . Do people feel that the world is in danger of falling apart ? Is this a way of manifesting our fears ? Is it a longing for some mysterious other ? I do n't know . Perhaps many people feel a little on edge and having to survive in a different way , but that 's probably always been the case . <p> The thing with science fiction is it has always been about addressing things that are going on in the world but put into a different setting and context . <p> Yeah , that 's why I often enjoy it . <p> Were you pleasantly surprised that Falling Skies has made it through to three seasons , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well yeah , but it 's kind of hard to predict what 's going to do it and what 's not . I definitely was n't expecting to be doing it this long . But here I am and I 've come to quite enjoy it , and enjoy the people , and I 'm pretty well entrenched in there now . <p> As you get older do you find you get given more of these grizzled characters to play ? <p> It 's funny you should say that . I 've got this busted up finger that I caught in something doing a movie a few years back , and it 's not quite healed . And I 'm missing a tooth , so I have one that I can put in for certain parts . I have a way that I can fix my finger so it looks more elegant . I realised I 've had one or two in the past five years where I 've need that finger and that tooth . There 's not really any reason for any of my characters to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But you do have a good head of hair in this show . <p> That 's because , when I went to do the pilot I was doing this movie called Meek 's Cutoff right afterwards , and I wanted long hair for that because I was playing a pioneer in the 1850s , so I had to keep the hair to do the movie , which is how this unexpected look of Weaver 's came about . The ordinary idea would be to shave the head , but because I had to do the movie he ended up with this hairstyle you would n't expect , and I kinda like it now . <p> If you were in a situation like that , you would either somehow keep it shaved , or let it go . It 's not as if you can pop down to the hairdressers for a shampoo and styling . <p> That 's right . But who knows , maybe he 'll cut his hair at some time . I know Dale Dye , our actual military guy , who I love , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , Patton ? " <p> We see in most of these post-apocalyptic films nowadays that the solution always seems to be a violent , militaristic one , where everyone has guns and is aggressive . Yet in the classic sci-fi from the ' 50s and ' 60s it was the scientists and academics that found the answers . <p> Yeah . I prefer that . Although running around doing all the physical stuff is a lot of fun . In fact , I was just talking to someone and they asked me how would I react in the same situation , and it would be a lot different than Weaver 's . Mine would be : what is this ? Let me look at this , see what it is ; listen and be hopeful and open . That would be my first reaction , but it 's not Weaver 's . <p> Because he 's a military guy . <p> There 's also a lot of revenge running through his blood with what happened to his family , which always colours things . <p> In the second season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a softer side of Weaver come out . <p> It helps that he finds his beautiful daughter . She comes and that cracks his rock of a heart a bit , although there 's a lot further to go . He 's still got his armour on . He 's wearing that mask and that armour , but you see little cracks . <p> Was it a pleasant change to play that extra dimension rather than just barking orders and being disagreeable ? <p> Oh yeah , and that 's what 's great about the character is there is so much excavation that can be done on him . Every time you see something like that , it means something . It 's not something that comes easily . <p> Do you come from a stage background , or have you always been a screen actor ? <p> No .

That 's how I made my way , doing theatre , and basically working construction in order to do theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Do you still do stage work nowadays ? <p> I do , but I only do it if I love it so much that I 'm willing to die for it .

The latest entry is Duncan Jones ' follow-up to his critically acclaimed , award-winning debut , MOON . As with many Brit indie filmmakers , the lure of Hollywood comes with success , although Jones already used US actors in his debut , which could be seen as a smart move on his part to increase his market appeal , although the movie would not have been anywhere near the success it was without Sam Rockwell . This follow-up is a lot bigger in production scope but still follows a similar theme of a man trapped in a small space with alternate versions of himself . <p> Captain Colter Stevens ( Jake Gyllenhaal ) , a helicopter pilot who has been flying missions in Afghanistan , wakes up on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Is he suffering from some sort of amnesia or post-traumatic stress syndrome ? Confused and panicked , he takes refuge in the toilet only to discover another man 's reflection in the mirror . Suddenly a massive explosion rips through the train . Colter awakens , even more confused , in a high-tech isolation unit where Goodwin ( Vera Farmiga ) , a uniformed woman on a video screen , wants to know everything he saw . Colter discovers the train was actually destroyed a few hours earlier and he has to discover who the bomber is because there is a bigger bomb about to be detonated in the heart of Chicago . <p> This is n't so much a time travel movie as a movie about ( speculative ) quantum physics , as the inventor of the source code programme explains when briefing Colter on the importance of the eight minutes he gets each time he has to go back to unravel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable time-travel paradox as Colter not only tries to carry out his mission but also alter events . This is always tricky but it pays off nicely in the final act . The ending may not generate as much debate as the closing scene of INCEPTION , mainly because it is plausible , within the boundaries of the film 's reality , and also because it is not as deliberately enigmatic . As with MOON , it is an ending that has hope , without being an overly cheesy Hollywood ending . The film also addresses some common prejudices about terrorism , to great effect . <p> Jones shows he can direct a bigger budget action movie , although some of the special effects were hampered by a lack of budget ( or talent ) as some of the explosions were less than convincing but , thankfully , they did not detract from the story .

To be fair , ATONEMENT does have an excellent action sequence , and his films do have interesting female characters , one of whom happens to be played by Saoirse Ronan , the star of HANNA . <p> Actually , from the outset the film plays more like a Bourne movie , except with Bourne as a teenage girl . It 's starts with the somewhat feral Hanna living in the Artic Circle with her father ( Eric Bana ) who is teaching her not only survival techniques but also more useful life skills such as languages and geography , which is just as well when she has to leave her snowbound hideaway pursued by a ruthless government agent ( Cate Blanchett ) , before rejoining her father later . <p> Cue the travelogue part of the movie as we follow Hanna through Morocco , where she joins up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jason Flemyng and Olivia Williams ( Dollhouse ) " and their much more down-to-earth daughter ( Jessica Barden ) and her nerdy little brother . Blanchett 's character Marissa also sends a psychopathic German ( Tom Hollander ) and his skinhead cronies after Hanna and it 's not long before they all meet up in Berlin , with the inevitable big action chase . <p> Ronan is perfectly cast as Hanna , with her looks giving her the requisite cold , almost otherworldly , appearance ( which worked so well in THE LOVELY BONES ) needed for the highly trained assassin . She also handles the action sequences deftly . On the other hand , Cate Blanchett , one of the greatest actresses of her generation , does n't seem to gel with the character and fails to give her usual impressive performance . <p> As for the science-fiction ; well it is mostly alluded to , although not as overtly overlooked as in NEVER LET ME GO . Hanna 's secret is revealed towards the end of the film , but it is not that hard to guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the film , which is a solid action movie with some great performances that wo n't disappoint fans of the genre , while remaining smart enough for the sci-fi audience .

The debate about remakes has become as tired as the studios ' imaginations , but I fail to see what is the necessity to Americanise an anime classic such as ASTRO BOY with this new feature-length 3D version . It is clearly aimed at a young audience , because in the West adults do n't watch cartoons , especially ones about robot children , unless they are forced to accompany their children . Japanese audiences , on the other hand , do n't make that distinction and grown-ups are just as fond of anime as children are . Of course , Hollywood executives are enamoured by CGI animation , and think that children no longer want to watch drawn animation . <p> Let 's face it , children will watch anything , which explains why the Chuckle Brothers are still on air , so they would have been just as happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D version . Thankfully , John Lasseter , now head of Disney Animation , and Hiyao Miyazake , know differently and under Lasseter 's leadership the House of Mouse has made its first 2D line animation in years , and Studio Ghibli is still continuing to make unique animated movies , such as PONYO . <p> Some years back the Japanese revived another of their classics TETSUJIN 28 , with a new animated series and a live action movie . However , the Japanese have respect for the source material . On the other hand , this Hollywood ASTRO BOY is aimed at kids with no knowledge of its origins , and , as such , is quite entertaining for the target audience and their unwilling parents . The tale of this cybernetic Pinocchio has plenty of action , humour and sentimentality as the boy-robot comes to terms with rejection and the discovery he is not human , as he makes new friends with a group of outcasts and goes on to save the day " of course . <p> The film has an incredible voice cast , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell , Nicolas Cage , Donald Sutherland and Bill Nighy , along with other cameos . While this looks impressive on the poster , it does n't really translate into an ensemble piece worthy of their names . For the most part these are screen actors who really on their physical presence to enhance their performance , and this is especially true for Cage , who is better known for his various tics than the range of his vocal delivery , which are perfectly displayed in Werner Herzog 's recently released BAD LIEUTENANT . <p> While this film does n't break any new ground , it might encourage some children to explore the original anime and find other gems such as TETSUJIN , or even classics such as AKIRA , before the Hollywood remake hits cinemas . <p> ASTRO BOY is out now on DVD and Blu-ray and is available from Play and all good retailers .

The exhibits have each been created by a different artist and these include people that popped in from all over the world .

The slightest touch will not only mean you have that awful Five Star song in your head for the rest of the day but could cause the entire sculpture to crumble back into a boring , featureless pile of sand . The sculptures really are extraordinarily fragile . <p> The ticket cost ( -6.50 per adult ) initially seemed a bit steep for the size of the exhibition , but the booklet we were given explained that , " We pay each sculptor to work for us .
