@@100521946 @4721946/ 43346 @qwx903346 <h> How To Take Effective Minutes <h> Meeting minutes are notes taken during a meeting . These notes include all pertinent information that was relayed during the meeting , as well as identifying characteristics of the meeting , and may later be used as a reference . If you are responsible for taking meeting minutes , then it is important that you know what to record in order to provide a clear and accurate account of the meeting. - <p> - <h> Step 1 : Prepare for the meeting. - <p> Before the scheduled meeting is to take place , you will need to gather some information and align yourself with the appropriate tools . <p> Gather a list of everyone who will be attending the meeting , including the meeting leader or host . <p> Get as much information as possible from the meeting leader about the purpose and scope of the meeting . The meeting leader should be able to provide you with a basic agenda . <p> Develop a template . It should include a header with the meeting date , time , place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include designations for each topic that will be covered in the meeting . Be sure to leave space for the details of how each topic was discussed and resolved . <p> Choose a method for taking meeting minutes . You may opt to write minutes out by hand , type them using a laptop or record them with an audio recording device . <p> - <h> Step 2 : Keep a seating chart <p> - When you take meeting minutes , you will at times need to refer to the attendee who presented an item , responded to an item or was part of the resolution of an item . Ask the name of each attendee who enters the meeting and mark that attendee 's place on a seating chart so that you can use the chart when you need to reference a name . <p> - <h> Step 3 : - Record important information during the meeting <p> - Do not attempt to illustrate conversations word for word , it will take you too long . Instead , outline the key meeting points , provide short and concise details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are called for by the resolutions . Be sure to include details of responsibility assignations . If a person agrees to do something for the next meeting please write this as a ACTION , and make sure to check the job is completed . <p> - <h> Step 4 : - Ask for clarification <p> While taking meeting minutes , you may find that certain points of discussion are unclear . If that is the case , you should interrupt the meeting in order to ask for clarification . Remember that you are responsible for recording the meeting thoroughly and accurately , and that an interruption is preferable over inaccurate notes . <p> - <h> Step 5 : - Proof the meeting minutes <p> When the meeting is finished , add any notes that you feel are necessary , then have the President read over the recorded minutes to verify that they are complete and accurate . It may be worthwhile to get all members of the committee to check over the notes . <p> - <h> Step 6 : Distribute and update people <p> Once typed up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved parties and put in a public place for members to see such as FB groups , webpage news articles etc. members just need to know the general ins and outs of what happened in the meeting and what was agreed . This is a great way to be transparent and show your members you are working on things and being active as a committee . 43347 @qwx903347 <h> Follow us <h> Find us 43350 @qwx903350

These are great opportunities to promote your society , increase your membership numbers and have great face to face interaction with a wide range of students . <p> - <p> - <h> What to do before Society Sign Up <h> Before Society Sign Up you need to meet with your committee and discuss the following : <h> The Rota <h> You need to agree who is going to be at the stall at what times . You should aim for 2 or 3 people at all times , but prepare for a very busy day ( especially on the first day ) and therefore should ensure that you regularly change your volunteers to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give students <h> Bear in mind that most students will talk to several societies and therefore are n't going to remember large amounts of information . Remember that it 's not just going to be Fresher 's who are looking to join a new society , therefore make sure your marketing applies to postgraduate , 2nd , 3rd , 4th year etc students too . <h> What you need to design or buy <h> Making your table stand out is very important when trying to get the attention of students in a room with over 70 societies to choose from. - You may also want to think about offering chocolates , sweets etc. -- as this often draws more students towards you . Remember to consult your treasurer about how much of your budget you are able to spend at Society Sign . Spending lots might get you hundreds of new shiny members , but that 's pretty useless if there is then not enough money to do anything with these members for the rest of the year . <h> The content of your marketing material <h> Most societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website and information about the first meeting to give to students . This is especially important for those students who do n't want to sign up there and then but instead want to have a think and decide at a later date . Its also important you 're your marketing material shows the information that students want to know . When students are deciding which society to join they will want to know 2 things : what the purpose of the society is and what are the benefits to them of joining that society ( i.e. new skills , making new friends . ) It 's important that your marketing material reflects both of these points . <h> This should be arranged before the Society Sign Up so you have something to talk to students about . <p> - <h> How it works : <h> Students will walk around the room and speak to a range of different societies . <h> If someone is interested in joining your society , you need to give them a sticker with a barcode on it to stick on their sign up card . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to join . <h> Explain they can join as many societies as they want , but should n't commit to more than they can realistically engage with <h> Once they have finished speaking to all suitable societies they should go to the till , where the cashier will scan their card and charge them for each sticker . Each sticker will symbolise a year 's membership . Student Led Societies ( Nightline , Mediation , KUBE and Concourse ) carry no cost . ALL of the money will go to the society . ( Make sure you let people know what the membership includes , for example classes , trips , general membership . ) <h> You will then email your new members and those interested in joining later with reminder details of their first meeting or event . <h> Whilst volunteering at the Fair it 's important to remember the following : <h> Do n't Be Cliquey <h> Whilst students like to see society members who get on and are communicating with each other , do n't be too cliquey as this will discourage students from approaching you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are big groups of you , you are laughing , whispering to yourselves and seem more interested in speaking to each other than to potential members . <h> Take regular breaks <h> As it 's important to remain enthusiastic it 's important to have regular breaks . Take this opportunity to get more students involved in your society via manning the stall . <h> Be inclusive when encouraging students to join <h> A good way to get different student groups to engage is by giving them someone they can associate with . For example have post graduate members there to speak to students about their experiences with your society and- university in general . <h> Be honest <h> Do n't promise the world . Let people know what your society is and what your plans are for the year ahead , but do n't engage in false marketing as , as soon as students realise they have been lied to they will lose interest . <h> Do n't use the hard sell <h> The best way to get students to join is by having a conversation with them , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering any questions they have as honestly as possible . Being too aggressive and forceful will scare students and they will quickly make their excuses and leave . <h> Stay Tidy <h> Make sure you keep your table tidy and presentable . <h> Be respectful to your neighbouring tables <h> If they are speaking to students do n't interrupt or be overly loud . They will then show the same courtesy to you . <h> Have a wander <h> Have a wander round and speak to other societies . There 's nothing stopping you joining other societies or discussing how both of your societies can work together over the forthcoming year . <h> Do n't give away all your marketing material <h> Some students wo n't be able to attend the fair until later in the day so make sure you still have flyers and sweets to entice them in . This will be especially effective when other stalls have ran out , making you stand out from the crowd . <p> - <h> Once Society Sign Up is over , your work is not quite done : <h> Email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , both those that paid and those that expressed an interest reminding them of your next event and other events that have already been planned for the forthcoming year . You should also inform students of what they can do if they ca n't attend the first meeting <h> Keep to your plans and run meetings and events <h> It 's important to ensure that any information you give to students is correct , as changing plans at the last minute is likely to lose members . Therefore it 's important to decide when your first meeting is going to be and stick to it . <h> Involve New Members <h> Make sure that you make new members feel as involved as possible from the beginning . You can do this by ensuring experienced members ( especially the committee ) speak to the new starters and do n't leave them on their own feeling lost . <h> Keep track of Memberships <h> Remember that any students who come to your meeting and later decide that they want to be part of the society need to pay online so make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your online membership list . <h> Evaluate Society Sign Up <h> Consider what went well and what could be improved for next time , for example did you have enough people manning the stall at the busiest times , did you encourage students to attend your first event as much as possible . This evaluation will be useful to pass onto future committees but also to use at the Re-Freshers Fair in January . 43347 @qwx903347 <h> Follow us <h> Find us 43350 @qwx903350

They pay specific attention to the academic provisions and procedures at Keele and manage the Education Zone to ensure that student representatives who fall within this zone are effective .

@@100521977 @4721977/ 43346 @qwx903346 <h> How To Manage Your Society Finances <h> There are a few bits of information you 'll need to know about managing your society account . <h> Background <h> Society accounts stem from the larger KeeleSU bank account so they do not have individual sort codes and account numbers . They are usually created when a society first deposits money ( either through society sign-up or manually ) . Theyll remain active for as long as the society is running and for 3 years after they 've become inactive . If no new students come forward to pick up the society , the money will be subsumed into the Society Trust account where it can be used to bid for larger capital items . <h> Getting an account statement <h> Its usually easiest to get an account statement from the VP Finance &amp; Actvities by e-mailing and asking to have an electronic copy sent over . Otherwise you can ask for one from the Finance once in the SU , which usually takes a couple of days to prepare . <h> There 's an example statement shown below so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little difficult to get used to at first but its the way the accounts are represented and becomes simple to work with once you know that fact . The statement also shows the outgoings and incomings so you 'll be able to monitor what 's coming in and out of the account . <h> Paying In Money <h> Cash <p> In order to pay cash into the account , you 'll need to fill in a society paying in form . These forms can be found at the finance office or the VP Finance &amp; Activities office . These forms are carbon-sheeted so when they 're filled out , the person paying in gets to keep a copy ; VP Finance keeps a copy and so does the finance office . The money will then appear on the society statement a few days later . <h> Cheques <p> If you 're getting someone to pay money via cheque it should ALWAYS be addressed to " Keele University Societies Account " , otherwise the bank wont accept it . You should then fill in the paying in form and attach it with the cheque to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form has the name of the society it does n't  matter that the cheque does n't  . <h> Electronic Transfer <p> If you 're getting someone to transfer money into the account you can do this by electronic transfer to the societies account . This is used for all societies so make sure that the transferor puts your society name in the payment information details . The details are as follows : <h> Sort Code : 09-02-22 <h> Account Number : 10326921 <p> Its worth sending finance an e-mail to say when it should be going in and checking that it has gone in , as there have been a few problems in the past . <h> Spending society money <p> We never allow societies to get cash out of the society account directly because of the small chance that fraud may be committed . We therefore have a claim back system whereby an individual spends the money first and then the individual is given a cheque from the society account . <h> Claiming Money Back <h> Expenditure forms ( usually green ) <p> To the right is an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a society individual . Most of its pretty straightforward information entry . Details of expenditure should be detailed enough so future society members can see what the money was spent on . <p> Once you 've filled this out , the society Treasurer/President needs to sign it and then get either the VP Finance &amp; Activities or the President to sign the bottom line . If either of these two ca n't be found try and make an appointment with them to get these signed . In extreme circumstances you can see the Operational Managers ( Tony Polden , Ceri Smith ) to sign off these forms . <p> Once the form is filled in , hand it into Finance with the relevant receipt/invoice ( YOU MUST HAVE ONE OF THESE TO CLAIM MONEY BACK ) . Theyll then process a cheque which will be ready for collection in a couple of days . <p> If you 're in doubt as to what you can/cant claim back for please contact the VP Finance &amp; Activities before you make the purchase . <h> Using the KeeleSU credit card <p> If a society wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of money ( usually more than 200 or so ) , they can use the KeeleSU credit card under the supervision of the VP Finance &amp; Activities . To do this arrange a time which is convenient with the VP Finance and Activities and attend this meeting with the products you want already decided and the links readily available . The society will then have to fill in a green expenditure form and make the payments using the credit card details . <p> Miscellaneous finance information <h> Societies must levy a membership fee of between 1.50 and 5.00 for members <h> Societies may only hold accounts with the Students Union with the exception of cash floats and pre-authorised ( by the VP Finance ) fundraising accounts . <h> KeeleSU shall not be responsible in any way for expenditure incurred by a society that does not possess sufficient funds to meet its commitments . In such circumstances , the society and its committee will be liable for any of KeeleSUs losses . <h> A KeeleSU society may not receive or use any funds held by KeeleSU for any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal opportunities <h> ( ii ) Any party political activity <h> ( iii ) Any activity in breach of the law of the land <h> ( iv ) Any activity in breach of the KUSU Constitution , Bye-Laws or KUSU policy <h> ( v ) Any activity that excludes any current member of the society . <h> ( vi ) Purchasing alcohol in any way <p> A society found to be doing so shall be subject to penalties and measures under Section H. <p> Society accounts will be active for as long as the society is active . Once the society becomes inactive the account is held in trust for 3 years in case the society is restarted . If this does n't  happen the money gets dissolved into the society trust account from which capital grant items can be bid from . 43347 @qwx903347 <h> Follow us <h> Find us 43350 @qwx903350

Remember , through the union , you can have access to a number of different marketing tools such as social media , website , poster space , SubTV and more ! <h> Just contact either KeeleSU Activities or the marketing department and we 'll help out with the advertising in whatever way we can . <h> If you create your own advertising , do n't forget to put the following on your posters : <h> And do n't forget to consider the inclusivity of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Non-Drinkers <h> Students that live off campus <h> Post-Graduate/ Mature Students <h> International Students <h> Disabled Students <p> - <h> Step 7 : Review/React <h> Throughout the process but especially at this stage , remember to look back and review the process and if necessary make alterations to the process . Consider : <h> -+- Is everything going to plan and according to the timeline ? <h> -+- Are you within budget ? <h> -+- Is the advertising working and how are ticket sales ? <h> -+- Are you currently on track for a successful event ? <h> -+- Does everyone know what they should be doing and are they on track to achieve their goals ? <h> Step 8 : Confirm and Prepare <h> It 's good practice to double check everything after booking and prior to the event , to ensure that all parties involved in the event know the plan and their involvement is confirmed . <h> Make sure SU staff and your team are aware of the requirements for the night and that everything works in advance . - It is vital the Activities Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Step 9 : Execute <h> On the day of the event , make sure you have an achievable timeframe in place , so when doors are set to open , they do .

Although the lords have recommended that TEF will not be linked to tuition fees ; this is not the time for complacency . The House of Lords and House of Commons will debate the amendments before a final deicison is made . As elected officers and students we need to remain cautious about increased tuition fees .

However , we know siblings and grandparents , as human beings , are rather difficult to split in two ... so bring as man people as you like in reality , they can watch elsewhere and walk outside to see you leave the Chapel . <p> The live streams of the ceremonies are shown on the screens in the SU and are available on any internet capable device : <p> Ladies : you will need pins . Lots of pins and hair grips .. these will keep you hat attached to you head , and your robe attached to our outfit . <p> ents : You should wear a shirt and tie " maybe bring a jacket , but do n't wear it if it 's roasting. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood attached to your suit. - - <p> You need to collect them from K2 . For this very special occasion you can ( /must ) use the K2 Bridge . <p> You 're advise to arrive 2 hours before your ceremony to collect your gowns . It sounds like a lot of- time , but you can use that to take photos before it gets busy ! <p> Eventually you will have to take them off . I struggled with this greatly . <p> - <p> The Deal with Official Photos <p> After you 've got your cap and gown , you 'll be ushered through to the Squirrel and then on into Blueprint and the Ballroom . This is where you get your photos . <p> Make sure you leave plenty of time before your ceremony . <p> The photographer is going to move you physically ( if you let them ) to give you that graduate pose ( with your fake scroll in hand ) . <p> You do n't need to pay for photos on the day . The company keep them on their records for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and order them online when you 've assessed which are your favourites ( Hint : your favourites will change ) . <p> - <p> The Deal with the Ceremony <p> You 're called in approx. 15 minutes before it starts . <p> It will last between 45 minutes and one hour . <p> You 'll probably be in the ceremony for your alphabetically first subject ( if you 're dual honours ) . <p> You 'll be sat in alphabetical order . <p> There may well be a random subject with you . <p> You might be sat next to someone from your course that you 've never met . It happens . Test out 2 degrees of Keele separation <p> There will be a procession of ceremony leaders . Do n't laugh when the procession walks in - even if your favourite lecturer is wearing a ridiculously over the top gown . <p> omebody you 've probably never heard of will give a speech . If you 're lucky , it 'll be funny . They do normally try their best . <p> You will be called up row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands with the Vice Chancellor . Trevor is probably going to say well done , but he might ask you a question . Remember to use your words . <p> - <p> The Deal with Saying Goodbye to Keele <p> It 's a day to celebrate but it 's also a day to say goodbye , and your family ( should ) understand that . So they 'll wait for you to be done . Do n't worry too much about leaving them to go a find a friend . <p> Get a hold of everybody you can . Take a thousand pictures . Hug your lecturers ( if they will let you ) . Laugh at the walking talking University Logo . Generally make the memories you deserve from this day ! <p> There will be someone you 're dying take a photo with , but just ca n't find . It 's a crazy day ( week ) and I 'm afraid that happens .

@@100522077 @4722077/ <h> Your Impact - Education <h> This is the most up to date information on a variety of different issues affecting education at Keele <h> Fit to Sit <p> Background : The University are reviewing the current Extenuating Circumstances process . Extenuating Circumstances are situations that could not be reasonably foreseen and are outside of your control or be changes to an existing disability that affect your academic study and results . <p> Current System - The University allows students to submit Extenuating Circumstances before and after any exams/handing in assessments and can make the following decisions <p> ( i ) compensation of a mark where assessment has been completed or partially completed ; <p> ( ii ) recommendation to the relevant University Board of Examiners for further assessment to be regarded as the same attempt , normally taken at the same time as students taking re-assessment for the module(s) ; <p> ( iii ) in the case of any in-course assessment at Level I or at Levels II , III and M where the in-course assessment forms only part of the total module assessment , approval of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - The University are investigating the idea of Fit to Sit . This policy would mean that when you submit your coursework on time or attend an exam , you are making a declaration that you are able to undertake the assessment to the best of your ability and that nothing is affecting your ability to complete the assessment . Therefore NO Extenuating Circumstances will be accepted after the exam has been completed/assessment handed in . <p> Therefore Extenuating Circumstances can only be submitted BEFORE these Extenuating Circumstances claims would relate to health issues or personal reasons that have prevented a student from competing coursework or sitting an exam . <p> Successful Extenuating Circumstances would no longer lead to adjustment of marks . <h> THIS POLICY HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED . <p> Result : Ally Bird ( Vice President , Education ) has been working to ensure that this policy does not go forward and successfully campaigned to ensure that it did not go to Senate . <p> " The University are very keen to implement this system . HOWEVER ! Because of YOUR feedback at AGM and via email @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box full of feedback forms ( It was a big box ! ) to the University Learning and Teaching committee and we resolved to stop the paper going for approval at Senate and the policy should be revisited with the details and procedures fully documented . <p> THIS IS A HUGE WIN ! ! : D This means that we can now work with the University to develop a system that is in the best interests of students . The Students Union still does not support a Fit to Sit policy , but we have the opportunity to ensure that students welfare is always safeguarded . I have all the feedback from your forms so I will be putting this together in a paper to present to the Working Group . The feedback form can be found online too your feedback is hugely important ! <p> YOUR VOICE REALLY DOES MAKE A DIFFERENCE ! <p> Next Steps : We are now in a position to work with the University on this policy . However , KeeleSU and the KPA do not agree with the introduction of the policy and following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 Change , I have proposed a formal motion to Forum 4 Change . As part of this , there is a motion to go to NUS to mandate for their support . KeeleSU and KPA are now putting forward a paper to the Fit to Sit Working Group to counter the arguments proposed . <h> Student Written Submission ( SWS ) <p> Background : The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education ( QAA ) exists to safeguard quality and standards in UK universities and colleges so that students have the best possible learning experience . Every 6 years Universities go through a peer-led process where their processes for management of quality and standards of courses are scrutinised . In preparation for this , institutions are required to submit evidence , and the students ' union also contributes a " student written submission " ( SWS ) which answers questions under headings split into six sections . In this document , the SU is invited to comment on a range of areas pertaining to quality and standards , and student engagement in this . In preparation for the review , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus groups under the heading of " Your Keele " , maybe you took part and helped us to shape this document . ( Do n't worry , all of the quotations are anonymous ! ) 1291 students completed the survey and 91 students attended the Focus Groups . <p> Result : The SWS has now been submitted ( Dec 2012 ) This has been a really positive experience and Ally Bird ( Vice President , Education ) has now secured support from NUS/QAA to produce an annual mini-SWS to help influence KeeleSU in the future . <p> Next Steps : The QAA are visiting Keele in January ( 29th/30th ) and March ( 11th-15th ) to conduct the official review . Following these visits , the key results of the review will be announced in April/May , with a full official report soon after . <h> Academic Year <p> Background : Following feedback from students , the University recognised that the current Academic Year is unfit purpose , especially for students in 3rdyear , who are expected to complete their studies significantly earlier than students in first and second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , with no structured support or teaching . Also , it was found that there is a tendency for teaching to stop after the Easter break ; where the 12 weeks of scheduled teaching was broken up by Easter late on into the semester , teaching did not re-commence after break and students were not being taught for up to 4 weeks after the break in some cases . Therefore , a number of proposals went to student and staff consultation for 3 months . <p> Both KeeleSU and the KPA welcome the re-structuring of the undergraduate academic year as it makes the third year of study ( level 6 ) more equitable to previous years of study ( level 4 and 5 ) . For instance , the level 6 exams will now take place at the same time as level 4 and 5 exams , instead of 4-6 weeks earlier . This has now ensured that finalist students receive the same support and more importantly , teaching for the full 24 weeks of designated teaching and learning time . <p> The academic year restructure has also introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help support some of the delivery of the Distinctive Keele Curriculum . This initiative replaces unstructured spare weeks where no teaching takes place ( between the end of semester two exams and the official finish of semester two ) . <p> And finally , under the academic year re-structuring , the semester one reassessment period has been moved to after the semester two examination period and the new PPD weeks . This has led to an additional 6 weeks , compared to the original timescale , before students are required to complete a reassessment . This now ensures that students who are taking a reassessment have the appropriate time to revise for their semester two exams . <p> Next Steps : Support the University in the transition from the current Academic Year structure to the approved structure ( 2014/15 implementation ) . <h> Academic Warning Policy <p> Background : The Academic Warning Policy is used when students are not engaging with their academic studies within their School . The current policy is that a student will have a maximum of 12 weeks to re-engage in their studies , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 weeks ) . On the third warning , a student is withdrawn from the University . The University prosed to shorten this timescale to a total of 6 weeks ( 3 x 2 weeks ) . Therefore , the University would withdraw the student after 6 weeks instead of the current 12 weeks . This went to Senate in October , where the SU and KPA managed to stop this being approved and delayed until the following Senate . <p> Result : This re-appeared at December Senate ( 2012 ) after KeeleSU and the KPA successfully campaigned to ensure that the Policy was not approved at the previous Senate ( Oct ) . Ally Bird ( Vice President , Education ) sat on the Working Group and Task and Finish Group with Andy ( KPA President ) and managed to secure the policy as a 4 week informal stage , and 3 x 2 weeks of formal warnings . Therefore , the policy now means that students will be withdrawn after 10 weeks , ( 4 + 3 x 2 weeks ) an additional 4 weeks to the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , Education ) also met with the Director of PAA ( Simone Clark ) to finalise the procedure that accompanies the new policy . This has " informally formalised the informal stage " ( bit of a mouthful , I know ! ) , in that , there is now a formal structure/procedure to follow in the informal stage of the Academic Warning Policy . This has ensured that students are supported and have an action plan in place to help them re-engage something that the old policy did not account for . In addition to this , there are School guidelines that are being approved to strengthen and re-enforce the procedures that occur before the policy in enacted . Again , this is to ensure the welfare of students is always at the forefront . <p> Next Steps : To monitor its use , and ensure that Schools are adhering to the new policy . To review the new policy after one year of its implementation . <h> Student Engagement Strategy <p> Background : The SU has a respectable number of students who vote in the KeeleSU main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other elections and other democratic events are low . Therefore , Ally Bird ( Vice President , Education ) has consulted with students about a number of ways that we can engage students in democracy , educational policy and campaigns ( among other SU activities ) . <p> Result : Ally Bird ( Vice President , Education ) is currently working on the draft version of the Student Engagement Strategy . This will inform what the Elected Officers , KeeleSU as a whole , Student Councillors , CAC , StARs and other Stakeholders should do to engage students . Student Councillors have been great in getting involved in helping to draft this thank you all . <p> Next Steps : To finish and finalise the document and send it out for consultation and feedback . <h> Academic Manifesto <p> Background : Over the years , there have been some great **33;491;TOOLONG that have been started but not always continued by the next Elected Officer ( not always through fault of their own ! ) but things get missed or overlooked . <p> Result : This Manifesto will bring some continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , Ally bird ( Vice President , Education ) wants to find the top 10 key issues that students want addressing and ensure that every Vice President ( Education ) from now on is expected to make progress on this issues and report back on their progress ( this will not overtake any other issues that need addressing in that year ) . <p> Next Steps : To canvass students for the issues ( short and long term ) that they would like addressing over the next couple of years . <h> Student Academic Representatives ( StARs ) <p> Background : StARs are Student Academic Representatives . StARs are students just like you who are elected to gather student opinion and represent your views at Student Staff Liaison Committee ( SSLC ) . These meetings ensure your voice is heard if something goes wrong ( or right ! ) on your module or course . StARs also feed important information and decisions back to you so you 're always up to date . StARs are underutilised in the University and following a review conducted by Ally Bird ( Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Representation Co-ordinator ) we have found that the StARs system was ineffective . <p> Result : Ally Bird ( Vice President , Education ) and Emma Hedges ( Student Activities and Representation Co-ordinator ) completed the StARs Review , Operational Plan and Strategic Direction . This has been accepted and approved by the University Learning and Teaching Committee . <p> This year will be the interim year for implementing some exciting new changes . Its hoped that theyll be endorsed by the University for the 2013/14 year - this means that it will become official University policy and must be adhered to . <p> Here is everything else that is happening with StARs : <p> All staff have been informed of the new StARs structure and changes to the scheme including : <p> Improvements to SSLCs - changing how they are convened so they are more effective they must be called by programme now so students in all years for a particular subject are aware of the issues and can share best practice <p> When they are called Wednesdays should be kept fee for Sport and will continue to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fee to meet on Wednesdays <p> Standardised Agenda Items There are now compulsory items on the agenda that must be discussed including National Student Survey Scores , External Examiner Reports and Library and IT facilities ( plus more ) <p> Increased student responsibilities there is an expectation that students will chair and/or take minutes to enhance their own skills <p> The new StARs structure means that there will Lead Subject StARs and Lead School StARs who will liaise with the Faculty Representative to ensure that issues are always fed to university level meetings and important decisions are fed back to students . These additional positions will be elected at SSLCs ( Lead Subject StAR ) and at a Forum of Subject StARs ( Lead School StAR ) . <p> NEW StARs Academy additional training sessions for StARs throughout the year including sessions on Teamwork and Leadership , Effective Communication , Promotion , Campaigns and Fundraising , and Using Data to achieve change . <p> NEW StARs conference StARs will be invited to attend a StARs conference held at Keele with key external speakers such as NUS members of staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and workshops . <p> NEW StARs Newsletters - StARs newsletters will be going out to StARs every month to keep them up to date with everything KeeleSU , campaigns and national issues . There will be a StAR of the month , as well as SSLC dates , details of exclusive StARs events and StARs Academy Training dates ad much more . <p> StARs Awards This year we are looking into hosting separate StARs Awards . <p> StARs will be elected at the end of Semester 2 for 2nd/3rd year ( and 4th/5th if applicable ) so that students can still contact StARs over the summer ( issues still arise before modules start ! ) and that StARs can hit the ground running when they return ( i.e. there is not a long period of elections for all years in October , which can result in SSLC being late into the semester ) . <p> MyStAR KLE tab This will be a space for students to find their StARs and feedback to them any issues electronically in an online StARs forum . There will also be StARs profiles where StARs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ideal space for StARs to feedback the outcomes of meetings and issues when they are resolved and detail all the positive changes they are making . This is coming soon ! <p> Update : This year has been the most successful year for recruiting and training StARs . We have recruited over 390 StARs for the 2012/13 academic year . <p> Next Steps : There is an Action Plan going to Senate ( March 2013 ) which outlines the responsibilities of the SU , Keele University and StARs and the key performance indicators . This is what will become policy and implemented for the 2013/14 academic year . <h> National Student Survey ( NSS ) <p> Background : The NSS happens every year . 3rd year students are asked to fill out the survey in order to provide feedback to the University . For 2011/12 , student satisfaction with Keele University increased to 91% , up 1% on last year , compared to the National average of 84% . This puts Keele in the top5 for student satisfaction . For the first time , students we asked how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rated at 76% , compared to the National average of 66% ( 2011/12 ) <p> Next Steps : Despite these fantastic scores , there is still a lot to be done on individual issues that the NSS asks students about . In particular , students highlighted issues with feedback on assessments and issues surrounding how student feedback on courses is listened to . <p> Over the past few years , Schools have been required to devise an action plan and compile lists of You Said , We Did . The same issues arise again and again ; therefore I 'm looking into how we can make positive changes across the University . As a result , an NSS working group has been set up to ensure that the issues are being addressed . With this , I 'll also ensure that positive changes are communicated to students . Keele dipped this year on Library resources , when in fact we 've made some fantastic changes based on student feedback . Therefore , I 'll be keeping the website and other mediums such as Concourse up to date with all the changes Keele are making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feb 4th . This year we are hosting NSS parties to encourage students come along and fill in the survey while having a bite to eat and grabbing a free goodie bag full of fantastic freebies . <p> A massive plea to all 3rd year students : Please , please , please fill in the NSS this year .

As President of KeeleSU I 've campaigned to improve the mental health provision at our University " but now I think it 's time that we join forces with our institutions to lobby the government to make a national commitment to mental health services .

This can help you to build useful connections . <p> -+- You will gain new skills in areas such as leadership , time management and communication. - These skills will help you both throughout your time at Keele and once you leave . <p> -+- Your experiences may give you a better idea of what you want to do after leaving Keele . <p> -+- You get to do something different with your society , working as part of a team to reach a pre-specified target . <p> -+- It 's a good reason to hold events and activities and thus potentially recruit new members to your society . <p> -+- It can be a lot of fun organising fundraisers and spending the money raised ! <p> Before starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - <h> 1. - Do you have a clear plan ? <p> Events will be more successful if they are well planned . Decide how much money you need to raise and how you are going to do it . The earlier you start planning , the better . <h> 2 . Do you have a clear idea of what you are attempting to raise money for ? <p> People are more likely to sponsor you or give you money through fundraising if they can see clearly where there money is going and what you expect the results to be . When speaking to people , make efforts to ensure that your communication is appropriate and uses language that they understand , therefore avoid abbreviations . Also try and consider what your audiences ' interests are . Once you know this you can present your cause in a way that is relevant to them . <h> 3 . Are you displaying a professional image ? <p> It is important that businesses and the public trust you therefore ensure that all materials are professionally made , using ICT and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to people when fundraising , so they can go away and read more . If they have your contact details they may then approach you in the future with new money making ideas or to offer donations . <h> 4 . Do you have a team providing support ? <p> It will be a lot of work to organise a fundraiser or to achieve sponsorship therefore ensure that you have a team who can share the workload . A team will also provide a range of different skills and connections . When working in a team , communication is vital to ensure that everyone knows what the others are doing . This avoids people being contacted on multiple occasions with the same information , which is likely to irritate them and prevent you receiving funding . <h> 5. - Have you considered working with another society ? <p> By working with another society you have an increased audience to target and more people to offer support in the planning and execution . Consider approaching other societies to see if they would be interested in working with you , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any money made . <h> 6. - Have you got lots of creative ideas ? <p> There are lots of ways to raise money , so have a brainstorming sessions to consider different ideas . Get as many people as possible involved in this brainstorming session to give you a range of options and ideas . <h> 7 . Have you checked that the idea is feasible ? <p> When you decide what you are going to do , contact the VP Finance and Activities or the Activities team to check that this is covered by your society insurance . Remember you are not able to fundraise anywhere without the landowners consent . It is also worth making a list of what equipment you need and asking whether KeeleSU can provide you with this rather than purchasing things . This will save you money . <h> 8 . Have you considered marketing ? <p> When considering marketing , ensure you have a clear idea about your target audience and do not be afraid to think further afield than just Keele students . When marketing the event ensure it is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as all the usual information such as location , time , event details and price . <h> 9 . Have you completed a risk assessment ? <p> Make sure you complete a thorough risk assessment for your event , covering different things that may happen and what you will do to minimise the risk . <h> 10 . Have you considered how you will collect evidence ? <p> Ensure that you plan to take photos and collect other evidence from the event . These can then be provided to businesses and the public , showing where their money was spent . Photos can also help you to get more donations and potentially press coverage at a later date . <p> - <p> - <p> There are lots of different ways to fundraise for a society . Below is a list of some ideas that may help you to get started . <h> Just-Giving page <p> It does n't take long to set up a Just-Giving page and is a great way to collate all the money in one place . You can give the link out to friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be secure . Make sure that you write on the page what the money is for and have a photo or something to identify you , so people are sure they are donating to the right person . <h> Text-Giving <p> This is a good way to fundraise with people you do not know as well and when collecting smaller amounts of money . All of the money donated goes to your Just Giving page . Text-Giving can be good because as people are not handing over money , they are more likely to donate . <h> Talk to everyone <p> When telling people you know about your cause , you will be surprised how many have good contacts and ideas that can help you out. - Remember that talking to people or sending personal emails may be more effective as people feel that you genuinely want their support , as opposed to a group email that can be impersonal . <h> Contact businesses <p> Another option is to contact businesses and offer to give them sponsorship in return for funds . When considering who to contact , consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are going to phone or visit a business in person it is worth practicing what you are going to say in advance as businesses will be contacted regularly about fundraisers and thus you want to stand out from the crowd. - Again always ensure that you give the business a clear reason why they would benefit from supporting you and what the funds are going to be used for . They may ask you to sign a contract , so be sure to read this carefully and always consult with VP Finance and Activities or ASK ( ground floor of KeeleSU ) . Finally consider beforehand if there is anything else that may be useful other than money if a business is unable to give you a monetary donation . <h> Contact charities <p> Some charitable trusts may be prepared to offer a contribution . In order to secure this funding it is important to speak to the trustees and research the eligibility criteria . Once you have this criteria and determine that you are eligible ensure that you are specific in your application so the charity knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may take time to get a response , but do n't be afraid to call and ensure they have received your application and answer any questions they may have . As charitable funding is limited consider applying to a number of charities . As with businesses , it is good to focus on charities where you have a personal connection . <h> Contact the media <p> It may be worth contacting local media i.e. local radio stations or the Sentinel newspaper to ask if they are wiling to do an article on your society and what you are attempting to achieve . Although this may not raise money directly , it is a good way to raise awareness and advertise any fundraising events . <h> Start a blog <p> By blogging about your work and efforts , people will be aware of what you are doing and your progress . This may encourage people to donate as they can see the effort that you have put into the work . It is also a good way for people to see what your ideas are and thus understand how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Look at whether any important upcoming dates or events can be used for fundraising events .

So essentially , the purpose of feminism is to achieve gender equality which is something we should , in theory , all support . This begs the question , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It can be argued that the definition and purpose feminism has changed over . Over the course of the 20th and 21st century , rights for women have increased ranging from contraception to voting . However , when there is a shockingly low percentage of convictions for accused rapists , female genital mutilation is still a global issue and Arkansas recently passed a law to allow rapists to sue victims who want an abortion ; has true gender equality been achieved ? Definitely not . This is why there is still the need for a social movement which protects and promotes womens rights not just in the UK but across the world . <p> The feminist movement has adapted and changed due to the challenges of living in the modern world . When we think of feminism now , do we think of the fight for gender equality or do we think of more radical strands of feminism which gain notoriety ? Each social , political or religious movement has factions and groups who hold beliefs which differ from their original purpose but that does n't  mean we just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As a society , our perception of gender has changed . Gender is no longer considered to be binary just male or female . Can we really achieve gender equality if there are more than two genders to take in to account ? Yes , absolutely . We can always fight for equality . We can always protect those who need it most . We can always think of other people before we act . <p> Some of what I 've mentioned about may explain our reluctance to define as a feminist . Definitions and perceptions of feminism , gender equality and gender itself have changed over time . But when we think of feminism , we need to think retrospectively . We need to think of feminisms original purpose to promote a world whereby men and women are thought of equally in the social , political and economic sphere . To me , feminism means equal access , equal opportunity and equal rights to all regardless of gender . This is surely something we can all get behind . 43347 @qwx903347 <h> Follow us <h> Find us 43350
