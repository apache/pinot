Note that much like the Sony Bluetooth remote , the adapter itself does not function in some few scenario 's , mainly when Playing PS1/PS2 ( disc ) games , reading a disc just inserted , ejecting a disk , also very occasionally when loading movie menus or right as it 's exiting a game or movie . As the driver is IR and one-way , this can occasionally cause a power off command to fail . For best result on power off , STOP any PS1/2 games and wait a second or two . As the power off is based on pulling up a menu ( same as if you use a controller ) , and to cover all possible menu options , the power down is SLOW to execute - do n't get impatient if it does n't shut off right away . Please see this thread for IR placement : LONG ...

@@8311894 @1511894/ @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Not so sure . But communicating with the controller mght be a little dicey . Delays etc , that 's if you really have too . <p> In my opinion the 8zone amp is one of the best value that you can get for your money out of the c4 products . the matrix switch on the other hand . <p> Are you saying you need more than 8 zones in your system because the amp in itself has a built in 8x8 audio switch already . Only if you need more than 8 sources or zones you would need the switch . <p> At this point I only have 8 zones of output and I expect it to only increase by 1 or 2 . If I go with the 8 zone amp , I would use speaker points for those additional spaces . However , I do like the idea that the matrix switch is $1300.00 and I can add different amps as I add listening zones ( inexpensive amps for some areas and better amps for others ) ... I should add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adds to the mix . I 'm also concerned about the 8 zone amp due to a couple of complaints about sound quality . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> You can use third party amplifiers with the audio switch . If you do this you would need to use the audio switch as the volume end point ( as well as the other audio end points ) in the rooms connected to it <p> One caveat with doing this is that when using the audio switch as the volume end point the volume goes up and down in incraments of 4 , where as if you use the Control4 Amp the volume goes up and down in increment of 1 @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Are you guys saying that the matrix is not a zoned pre-amp that has volume control capability ? When I was referring to 3rd party amps , I was talking about power amps . <p> The matrix is exactly that . You ill be able to use 3rd party power amps and the matrix will control the volume . The matrix does not have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the volume on the C4 matrix one notch will increase the volume more than turning up the volume on the C4 amp the same one notch . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> The reason he likes the amp is that you get 8 zones , built in 8x8 matrix parametric EQ in one box . It is one of the best values in Control4 's stable . <p> Also with the built in control of it , can program starting volume levels and see feedback on the navigator . You may be able to accomplish this with 3rd party amps , ( if they have a two way driver written for them ) but the 8zone amp is quick and easy . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> It depends on your budget and how much flexibility you want . For example , if you want to keep budget down and do n't mind joining two of the zones ( they would always play the same content at the same volume ) , you could just put an impedance matching speaker selector switch on one of the speaker binding posts coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor zones or for an open dining room/kitchen where you would never play two separate things anyway and always having them both on/off together is n't an issue . <p> - <p> If that is n't an option , get the 16x16 audio matrix switch and put one 16 channel ( 8 zone ) amp and another single zone amp for the 9th zone @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> f that is n't an option , get the 16x16 audio matrix switch and put one 16 channel ( 8 zone ) amp and another single zone amp for the 9th zone <p> Mark Feinberg <p> Home Theater Advisors <p> Thanks Mark , The second option seems perfect for me . <p> I have another issue though , I have a different automation system running ( Vimar ) .

I have an HTC controller that the insternal USB was corrupted ( if I swap out the USB from another HTC , the hardware works fine ) .

What 's the system/process to use a restore ( or install ) USB ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Clone the bad USB ? I plugged the bad USB into a linux machine and it appeared totally dead ... the PC wo n't even recognize the USB . When I tried to copy the good usb , there are several files that wo n't copy ( protected ? ) So I tried a fresh USB stick . It 's a 1GB vs a 256MB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ca n't seem to make anything happen . Just found that if I hold the front ( I 'd ) button while powering up for about 30 seconds , I get a new message on the TV screen i.e. " Network Update .... Resetting all network configuration parameters to factory defaults. " rather than the normal " please wait ... " power up message . But , it 's been that way for about 15 minutes now . Not sure if it 's becuase I 'm using an " Install " stick of if it would do that regardless . Should I be using an " Install " stick or a " restore " stick ( I have links for both ) . Should I be plugging it in to the external USB port ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> My guess is you need to use " dd " utility to do a low level copy of a good usb drive from another HTC . I have done something similar in the past . I found that windows DD utilities are useless , and I used a Linux live usb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if you have a linux box - even better ) . Using the DD utility I did the low level usb copy of the controller image . <p> The only issue you might have is that there maybe different config ( in particular the MAC address ) on the copy you get from another HTC , which you might need to edit . <p> Once this works you only need a usb restore or install if you want to upgrade to another version . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> The Control4 usb restore stick will only work on Control4 OS versions 1.3.1 onwards . Your Home Theatre Controller may not work with it depending on what is corrupted ( Control4 has a boot loader that boots the rom from the usb ) . As you have damaged the usb you will need to do as dannyboy says and dd and imagine from a working home theatre controller . You will not need to change any configuration files . I am concerned that the usb has corrupted though to a state where it is not recoverable . I would also listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is ticking . If so then that is an indicator that your controller is about to fail . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Yes , I 'm sure the original ( now bad ) usb is totally useless . It is n't even recogonized by the linux box where-as the good htc usb is totally readable ( however on a windows machine both get recognized as a usb drive but then neither is ever recognized as being present when you try to read or format it ... sort of wierd . Anybody know what format the usb sticks are formatted with ? something other than FAT or FAT32 ? ) . <p> Anyway , I assume that since the USB Restore/Install sticks are only usable with 1.3. x and above , the fresh ( replacement ) usb stick I 'm using is not going to work as-is . I 'll pursue using the dd approach first ( the working htc is already on 1.7.4 which is the latest version for my poor old embernet system ) . Thanks for the help guys ! @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Thanks guys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I one . My extra htc has been retored to facotry defaults . Although I still think one knowledgable in Linux should be able to clone a usb stick from a working unit using dd and/or cpio , I was not . I was just not able to get it to end up with the right file structure . I got really close though and maybe close enough to make the htc think it was alive enough to finally accept a USB Restore stick . Actually I got there pretty much using a USB Install stick but the install stick would n't take me all the way there . I really never saw any indication on the video output that the install stick was doing anything but after waiting quite a while , I had files and folders on the usb that were n't there before ( but it did n't have all the folders that were present on the working usb ) . I had to use root access to do anything with the ones that were n't there . Normal permissions and the graphical interface would n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra layer in the tree . Probably all cockpit error ( I 'm not a Linux guru ) . <p> Anyway , I think the biggest thing may have been that I might have been using a bad usb restore builder intially . I had tried it a couple of time and it actually created something that looked more like a USB installer but without the all the supporting files under each product . The final usb restore file structure was totally different that the usb install . The link I used created either/or : <p> Using it , the video defintely provided feedback that the Factory Restore was about to start , that it was in progress and that it finished . I fianlly knew I had licked it when I started seeing those messages . Maybe I 'll start playing with upgrading an htc to 1.8 now and just see what happens there . <p> The game was fun and I think I 'll make my PC dual boot and start playing more with linux .... got a couple tivo boxes to attack next !

@@8311915 @1511915/ <h> Installing C4 , Any Advantage to Lutron Vs Using C4 Light Control ? <h> 13 posts in this topic <p> We are putting in a Control 4 system in a new construction . I had Vantage previously . It ran about 1/2 of the house , all the main areas , but because of expense , we did n't put it in the whole house . Our new house , about 7K SF , with 77 loads is being done by a C4 dealer . He does Lutron , so I had him price it out . After pricing it out , he said he could do similar to what we had with the Vantage system using Lutron , for about 28K . To do the entire house with a wired Lutron Homewerks low voltage product would be close to 60K . He said he could do the entire house lighting control for about 14K with C4 . He said he could do scenes , and basically anything the Lutron system could do by replacing all the light switches with C4 dimmer switches and keypads , and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homewerks , he could do the whole house for 14K with C4 . What are the limitations of the C4 lighting system over the Lutron ? It does n't seem like there can be as much functionality with the C4 as the Lutron ? Is there any reason to have the house wired with Lutron ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> This is how I see the difference : No particular order but my opinion . This is what I found on comparing them ( Lutron RadioRa2 vs C4 ) ( Not homeworks ! ) <p> 1 . Both require a dealer to setup . Both require your dealer to be involved after you add more lighting fixtures so no benefit either way . <p> 2 . Lutron looks nicer ( I really do n't like the curved nature of the decora light switches/dimmers on C4 ... wish they were ' normal ' ) . This is the biggest issue with me . <p> 3 . If you are using C4 , it integrates the best because its made by C4 - increasing your mesh network throughout your home while providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver to be loaded by a dealer for functionality . LONG ... <p> 4 . Lutron and C4 both can be engraved ( multiple buttons ) but Lutron does have a lot of color options but really I only use white . <p> 5 . Both work if the controller goes down unless its a keypad then the C4 keypad wo n't work . However both utilize some controller ( i.e. main repeater for Lutron so if the main repeater goes down your lights wo n't work ) . So , the issue is how often is the controller going to go down ... most likely not often if setup correctly for either C4 or Lutron . <p> 6 . Lutron has been in the lighting business awhile ( this is what they do ) . Could matter but does n't have to . <p> So , these are the items I compared and still have not decided on which way to go . Price really is n't an option given they are comparable if done correctly by a dealer so nothing really makes me say ' Go C4 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your dealers experience with the products . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> 3 . If you are using C4 , it integrates the best because its made by C4 - increasing your mesh network throughout your home while providing lighting control . They both integrate with Lutron creating the driver to be loaded by a dealer for functionality . LONG ... <p> This could be very important depending on the size and design of your house as well as how many C4 controllers you have deployed as ZAPs . You will need a good mesh if you plan on using the C4 remotes. @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I just finished a project with Homeworks in it . It was around 200 loads .

I 'd just be adding the Sonos Connect to my current matrix but looking at the driver options I 'm not certain which one acts as the driver for the device . <p> - <p> Based on EV 's site they have the older 7 series and the newer 8 series . Looks like most everything in the driver database is 8 now and from what I understand I would install the service for each thing I desire such as Beats Music 8.0.0 or Calm Radio 8.0.0 , etc . But what about the primary device ? <p> - <p> The only thing I see that seems like it might be it is the Network 8.0.0 which is billed as an A/V Switch , but when looking at the connections it does n't appear to be it . <p> - <p> Does anyone know the driver name I need to find , or have the supporting documentation you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the online search in composer for the new driver , there are two that seem to pop up . One just says " Network 8.0.0 " from SONOS ( author ) and the other for some reason came up " Network - FREE " which was actually the 7.5.5 driver . <p> The primary component for being able to use groupable zones , matrix ability , and the all around just better way to set it up is to use the " Network 8.0.0 " A/V Switch driver from SONOS in composer . <p> - <p> Obviously , the SONOS system needs to be set up and updated with the normal sonos app prior to doing this . <p> Add in the driver for the- - " Network 8.0.0 " into whatever room.Then , you need to find the driver for the actual component . There are two ( if you want to use an input for the matrix as well ) . I personally feel you are better off setting it up now even if you are using it immediately. - <p> The two drivers are : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( do n't use the ipod one ) . and " Line in ( Global ) 8.0.0 " from sonos as A/V Switch . Add both of these to the room where you will have the SONOS playing. - <p> - <p> The firs tstep the guide tells you is to set up the names at this point . Just stops you from having to rebuild the sonos network if it does n't update later . I use identical naming as the actual SONOS zone in the SONOS app . <p> There are n't as many setting in the new 8.0.0 so basically all I did was made sure SONOS was on the same network and added in my C4 controller MAC . Then i went to the " Actions " tab and pressed " Request settings from zoneplayers " . I then went back to the properties tab and it had my SONOS zone already set in as " Primary " and set it was set up. - For the automatic updates , everyone suggested to set this to on with this driver . <p> Now , go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main proiperties , you do n't really need to do anything but turn on automatic updates , make sure your controller 's mac is in there , and see what is selected for " Zoneplayer name " . To change this , if it is the wrong SONOS piece , click on actions and then click on " Select next zoneplayer " . Keep doing this till the correct zone shows up. - <p> Then , do the same for the line in driver. - <p> Then , you just need to set up your connections . Depends on your set up for how you will do this , but I use the matrix for ease . Made my source connections to the line in driver , then use the line in driver to the matrix ( this is automatic ) then use the source out to the audio endpoint for the room ( most important ) . <p> - <p> Now , for your music services , you need to add each one again . You will see them all in there under their names . Like " InTune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These just worked for me . My phone 's C4 App had me authorize it , but that is really all I did . I was told you have to go to the NETWORK driver , under actions , and select to push to these services but I did n't have to . It just worked. - <p> Sorry if I over-explained . I am sure you have the skill set that most of this is redundant but figured it might be able to help someone else as well if they are less familiar with C4 - <p> Let me know if you have any other questions or PM me your email and I can send you the old documentation . It is a bit different now , but fundamentally the same. - 
@@8311924 @1511924/ <h> Liftmaster garage integration <h> 20 posts in this topic <p> I was at my local garage door company today and saw that they had a lift master Internet access for garage doors . They had a gateway for $70 and then for another $40 a new controller that would let you use your smart phone or Internet to control the garage door . I was wondering if anybody had any integration of this with Control 4 ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> FYI , I just found this out - The units that have Security Plus 2.0 ( MyQ Technology ) are Serial Encrypted . Which means the unit is no longer an open/close circuit ; it 's now a communicative technology that works kind of like a telephone . The Door-control no longer has an open &amp; closed circuit . It 's like a mini computer , communicating with the operator . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> See mine and others posts about this . The liftmaster 8550 does not have a dry contact closure but they have other models that do . You need a dry contact closure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others ) have basically rigged a liftmaster remote to get triggered by the relay that then operates the garage door . I have a contact sensor on the garage door that tells me if it is open or closed . So my programming goes something like " if garage door sensor is open then send a pulse to close the door " and visa versa. @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Some people describe this as a hack job but I can tell you that the integration is great . When I go to sleep I hit a goodnight button and if the garage is open then it closes it .

I have 2 8500 openers with sensors on them to tell me if they are open or closed . I do have the lift master app but would like to integrate into the C4. @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> To see the status of open/closed you will also need wiring to the actual door . <p> If done properly , one CAT5 can be used to carry two contacts ( open/closed status ) and two relays ( does the opening/closing ) . Each requires a simple two conductor cable . Being that CAT came has 4 pair , it works great for up to 2 doors . If you have more doors , you need more wire . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Wiring into the main wall opener use to work but it does n't with the new " Smart Controllers " . Unless you open it up all the way and solder to the actual button vs using the screw terminals on the back . <p> Alarm.com partnered with Liftmaster and thus their system can control an opener . Would like to see C4 partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great as it would provide control and it would know the door state without external sensors .

@@8311936 @1511936/ <h> Somfy URTS II Installation @qwx111136 <p> I have installed a Somfy URTS II 16 Channel using a serial connection to an HC-250 Controller . I am attempting to integrate 6 RTS motorized shades . Do I need to put each RTS on a seperate channel ? I could really use some step by step instructions if anyone could help . Thanks @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I installed the URTSI II and the new Somfy Zigbee controller and some other shades in my home . The Zigbee controller works for the IL2 motor , which is a 120V motor with a special connection port for the Zigbee controller . If you happen to have this motor , it is the absolute bomb since you get 2 way control of the shade . This motor does NOT use the RTS remote control . <p> But if you bought the URTSI II ( which works for the RTS motors ) , you can get it all to work fine for the 6 shades , just a touch slower and abit less control . I have the URTSI set up in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 way control of the shade The URTSI will be essentially acting like the RTS remote control . This means that you will have 3 commands for each shade : UP , DOWN and STOP . <p> BEFORE you use the URTSI : Have your installer set up your shades with the RTS remote control . Make sure each shade is installed on a SEPARATE channel on the RTS remote control : channel 1,2,3,4,5,6 . DO NOT INSTALL the shades all on one channel . You actually can , but that means all the shades will be controlled together and you will not have individual control . Since you have 6 shades , and the cheap RTS remote only handles 5 channels , you will have 2 RTS remotes , 1 remote for channels 1-5 and 1 remote for channel 6 . Since the URTSI is essentially acting as a RTS remote control , make sure everything is working with the remote before moving to the URTSI . <p> FYI : You will only be able to use UP , DOWN and STOP commands . If the blind is moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is also used to create ONE favorite position for each blind . So place each blind in a favorite position , and press and hold the STOP button for 5 secs ( on the correct RTS channel of course ) . The shade will jog up and down , and you know it is saved . Once you have that set up , when you get to COMPOSER , you can just send the shade a STOP command , and the shade will move to the favorite position . <p> Once the shades are set up and their separate channels , and you favorite position is set , plug in the URTI II to the RS-232 port on your controller . It will have a range of 20 feet or so . <p> There is a pin out diagram here on converting the URSTI port to the RS-232 port on the controller . <p> I actually purchased the SOMFY part 9015028 rather than buying a cheap RJ-45 to RS-232 converter online . When I opened the SOMFY converter , the internal pinout was actually different than the diagram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the yellow wire was on a different pin , that that diagram . So if you bought the SOMFY converter , fine . If you bought an aftermarket converter and are following that diagram , and it does not work , it may be the pin out . I think the somfy converter was $19 . <p> Now , my CONTROL4 dealer says he will place the URTSI 16 channels into a room called shades , and then hide the room in the project . He then only copies over the channels he want into the room with the shades . That seemed a little complicated , but you can try it . It is a bit annoying to see all of the 16 channels/shade on your iPhone app though . <p> If memory serves me right , there was no additional binding on the shade that needed to be done ( but someone can correct me ) . In System Design , just double click channel 1 , toggle UP , DOWN and STOP , and the channel 1 shade should work just fine . Repeat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I created a macro for the shades : ALL SHADES UP , ALL SHADES DOWN , ALL SHADES STOP ( which STOPS the shades if they are moving , or if the shades are stationery , it will move them into favorite position . <p> You can also come up with a macros that work for you . I have a 3 button switch that I dedicated to shades , with the TOP BUTTON being all shades up , MIDDLE BUTTON , stop , and LOWER BUTTON all shades down . If I double or triple click those buttons , I initiate special macros like shade/channel 1 UP , channel 2 STOP ( favorite position ) , etc ..... Macros will be your friend when coming up with all of your shade parameters . <p> Since one of my shades is on an exterior door in my bedroom , I actually programmed triple click UP/DOWN on the main room light BUTTON to open that shade channel only so I can leave all my shades down at night , but still go out side easily . <p> You will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blinds in the future , I can not recommend the ILT2 motor combined with the 2 way ZIGBEE interface enough . It is amazing . With 2 way control , you can set your blinds to open or close at percentage intervals ( like 93% closed ) . Imagine the possibilities of that kind of control of the shade versus an up , down and one favorite position with the RTS/URTSI ! Each separate shade will need its own ZIGEBEE controller ( they are about $300 each ) and you do need space to mount them . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> PS : I do n't remember seeing any posts on this forum that review the experience with SOMFY ZIGBEE interface for the ILT2 motor . If anyone wants me to post video or photos of that , let me know . I know folks have posted their experience with Mechoshade and Lutron 2 way shade integration , but if you want my experience with the SOMFY , l am happy to answer questions . <p> It was a very easy set up , the driver is great and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project , so I used the SOMFY ILT2 motor , which used a 120V romex run into the motor from an outlet on the wall of the shade . Each shade needs it own ZIGBEE interface . The motor is very quiet , and very fast . <p> The ZIGBEE interface also works with the Somfy ST 30 RS-485 motor but that is a 24 VOLT motor , so not the greatest for a retrofit project since I would needed to mount a 24V transformer somewhere . But in new construction , 24V cable runs to shades in series is a nice option with a transformer out sight a la Lutron. @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I am interested in Somfy . I have all windows wired with both power(16/2) and cat6. so I guess I 'm looking at an ir system for these . I have all these wires ran to the control closet .

And why would you - you have wires . <p> IR does n't always work nice either - there are sever blinds out there where the induvidual blind control is IR , but the motors require an RF wake-up pripor to responding ( this all built into the remotes they have but not really doable through C4 without a lot of " mods " ) @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Best way to do blinds is via relays/dry contacts as available .

It can also be wired fairly easily DIY although some care would need to be taken to ensure it 's done correctly for the motor involved . <p> I 'm no expert on the costs or exact models of blinds - I just get called in to integrate them , so any specific advise on which are good for you is beyond my knowledge - I do know it also depends on what type of blind you want to begin with ( fabric/material weight , shades vs blinds , rotation and double blinds etc ) so you 're options would get limited there . <p> The only blinds I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't give you much of a reference there either . <p> You may want to consider talking to a blinds specialist to see what they have , and keep integration separate - that may pan out better for you , plus you could do in in steps . Just stay away from no-name brands and battery operated , and beyond that post the blinds they come up with on here and see if anyone knows if they are doable and what their limitations are .

@@8311947 @1511947/ <h> GE Concord 4 problems <h> 11 posts in this topic <p> I realize this may be more appropriate in a security installation forum ( can anyone recommend a good one with lots of traffic/posts ? ) , but since a lot of people here use the GE Concord 4 system I thought I 'd try my hand here . <p> I just had my Concord 4 system installed and we are having some problems , #2 being the most annoying : <p> 1 ) Touchpanel shows Bus Failure 0 and Bus Failure AM3 when I press the ' * ' key . The Bus Failure AM3 I 'm pretty sure is just because we have not yet connected anything to the unit and will probably resolve when connected to control4 . I have no idea what the Bus Failure 0 is nor how to fix it , any suggestions ? <p> 2 ) Our system touchpanel AND Siren both go off whenever system state changes and for all status beeps . For example when entering or exiting with a delay both will go off every few seconds until the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could handle having the touchpanel do that but I can not deal with the siren going off every 2 seconds for 2 minutes or whatever . Plus , if it is nighttime and I come home when my wife has the system armed to ' Stay ' then it will go off until I get inside and disarm the panel , probably waking her and the neighbors up . I 've read the installation manual and the userguide and I can not figure out how to get it not to do this . I know when arming you can use ' 5 ' before entering the codes to do a silent arm , but that still does n't  solve the entry problem since you cant get to a touchpanel before opening the garage , etc . <p> I really need help here , this is driving all of us nuts and the person that installed it does n't  seem to know the answer either . Anyone else with Concord 4 panels having these issues , or is your system always silent unless the alarm is tripped ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be because one of the bus devices was not being correctly identified for some reason . I manually deleted the bus devices from the programming , powered down the unit and unplugged the battery , then powered back up . The bus that was previously assigned to slot 0 did not get identified on that power up and I started getting sirens going off and all of these errors from multiple devices . I manually inputted the same bus I 'd numbers as were present before I deleted them , powered down again , and when I powered back up all was well . So basically everything is back the way it was before I did anything but now I 'm not getting the error . Stupid computers . <p> The AM3 error is still there but I think our explanation above covers it . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Punctuation and grammar go a long way towards people being able to understand what you want to know ... I honestly have read that sentence 3 times and do n't  know what you 're asking . I assume this is a language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure on BUS 0 , is the programming keypad usually . If the programming keypad is plugged in to the panel during the power up phase of the installation , it will scan it in as part of the system so when it is removed there will be a failure because the system can no longer see it . You did the right thing by deleting it . As far as your AM fail .... AM is ( automation module ) correct . Your concord scans and checks in with all devices connected to the system every 12 hours . If this is not connected properly , or not at all connected it will show the failure . Make sure that everything is properly connected before power up on the panel . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Thanks yeah everything is working fine now ... The AM module failure was just because the c4 system was not yet connected to the module . <p> The only issue I am having now is my system protests anytime I try to arm the system with a contact open . I think with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door open etc , so that you do n't  have to always close everything before arming , but for some reason mine wont allow that . Can anyone else here arm their Concord4 system with the garage doors open ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> You need to change the zone type . I do n't recall what they 're called , but one of the zone types allows for it to be open , and it 'll automatically bypass the zone if you arm with it open , and when it closes , the zone goes automatically into armed mode . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> There are sensor groups that allow for delays ( groups 10 , 11 , 12 ) but there are none that allow for the sensor to be open when the system is armed . The only way I can find to allow it is to bypass the sensor while arming the system , but then I do n't  think it arms them when the garage door closes . 
@@8311948 @1511948/ <p> We currently have 3 blinds that work through a Somfy remote control and also work through the control4 system via key pads . One of the motors went bad and was replaced .

It 's important to note that- all- Wirepath DVRs contain a local NTP server that may be open to this attack if the System Time Synchronization setting is not changed from the factory default ( NA ) . The DVR will not be affected if it has been configured correctly to synchronize to a public NTP server on the Internet . <p> Solution:Set the DVR System Time to synchronize to a public NTP server .

The IP camera support that allows you to test the various video modes is for OS2.6 and higher . Obviously if using an older OS , because of older controllers that ca n't be updated beyond 2.5.3 , then you will always get this error on testing . This wo n't however mean that the driver will not work in the Navigators . <p> - <p> I created a new Ip camera driver and experienced the same error in Composer 2.5.3 , but not in later releases .

@@8311980 @1511980/ <h> 413 posts in this topic <p> We are releasing a new solution for RGB LED Control with Control4 . There is not so many good and affordable solutions of this kind right now , this driver may fill a gap many people wanted since a while . <p> If you have tried other RGB LED Control solution for Control4 that are on the market right now , you may have find they may produce disappointing results , or other solutions may be better but for a price . <p> The driver we are presenting if focussed mainly to work with RGB LED and use DMX as the standard lightning control protocol . It teams with a powerful interface that is the RS-232 DMX Engine from Engineering Solutions Inc . This little box have enough power to allow a complete management of RGB LED , Color effects , smooth fades , and more . Best of all , it does cost less than the other popular DMX solution for Control4 . <p> The driver fully support Advanced Lightning Agent scenes with perfectly synchronous activation with no external tool required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user friendly color effect management and native Control4 dimmer control to keep the experience similar the same as with Control4 own lightning system . <p> The total cost of the driver and the interface is lower than the actual most popular DMX solution for Control4 and will produce better results , guarantee . Many people are already using it and they liked it . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I 'm interested in using this driver for an RGBW install . - Assuming a single 4ch dmx decoder is used to run a chain of RGBW strips , how is the 4th channel ( white ) treated in relation to the RGB ( 1-3 ) channels ? - Can all four channels be ON simultaneously or does channel 4 override ( turn off ) channels 1 through 3 ? - @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> You can configure an RGB dimmer on the 3 channels and do a separate single channel dmx dimmer driver for the white channel .

Many RGBW strips have a shared +12v across all four which potentially you ca n't use two seperate decoders ( will depend on the decoders , hoe they are powred etc ) . <p> Also make sure if you have a 4channel decoder that it is in fact 4 true channels , I 've had several where the 4th channel is not a true connected channel ( even though it had connectors ! ! ! ) but the 4th channel is a master channel for overal brightness . <p> - <p> Personally I prefer using a standard RGB decoder and putting white with blue ( or any color ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , NO/NC to White/Blue . This works fine with the EV driver ( as it allows channel setting and having channels nrs more than once ) - I can not say if it works on the one this thread refers to . <p> - <p> Note - does require some added programming of course to switch the relay and force virtual master channels to go to 100% on turning on ( if you use it ) . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> As for the Chase you want to do over RGBW fixture , the answer is yes , this is possible . For that you will need to use the latest version of the Effect Switch ( v 1.2 ) and you will configure the number of channel per fixture to 4 , as follow : <p> - <p> - <p> - <p> This will instruct the driver to skip any extra channel that follow the first three ( R-G-B ) .

We just need to find witch one 's the best bang for the bucks .

I 'll keep you posted . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I need to post something about that because there is a LOT of cheap DMX decoders on the market and they do n't work all well when dimming and controlling LEDs . Note that commercial stage light with built-in decoder are always the best choice for perfectly smooth fades and effect , but when you want to control Low Voltage LED recessed ceiling light or LED strips , you need to choose the right decoder if you want the best results . <p> - <p> #1 Recommended model , the PX24500 . A $20 eBay China decoder that perform incredibly well , it also provide hi-current output for up to 5a per channel and easy daisy-chain using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival- Stage Lights . <p> This is the worst of all . Look practical to get 24 channels in a single box but no , it does not worth it ! It perform so bad dimming LED , it flicks- and fades are nothing else than choppy and ugly . Trust me , do n't use this one ! <p> This one is not as bad as his 24ch big brother , but it is surely not recommended . It does not flick when dimming but it 's all but smooth . Choppy color change and not very robust . Do n't use this one too ! <p> - <p> #3 Is a DMX decoder from the same " series " but it is made for Pixel LED strip : <p> This decoder is supposed to be able to address a 3 DMX channel per pixel but has only a single- set of PWM transistors to dim the whole pixel set . Result is a VERY choppy dimming and color change because the PWM need to dim all channel one at a time . This is NOT the right decoder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be driven with powerful commercial-grade decoder made especially for that purpose . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> LimitlessLED / Mi-Light Wi-Fi driver update . Yes , it 'll work . I have built a basic driver to connect the Wi-Fi hub and it 's pretty easy to control the LED bulbs once they are paired with the hub . This system is pretty limited though , only 4 channel per hub , you can group bulbs together but with C4 , this could end up messing things up when you want to use scene . There is no limit of the number of hubs to use so in theory there 's no limit of the number of bulbs to control if you 're not afraid of frying your brain through all those radio frequencies . <p> - <p> Very basic scene support to expect , the bulb does not support the " Ramp To " command , only one ramp rate available which is the default rate you see when you turn of the bulb with an iPhone . <p> Popcorn effect to expect when using scenes , or use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will disable the control over each individual bulb of the group . <p> - <p> Color Change will be only the built-in function of the bulb , not possible to build some custom color changes over C4 because this will eat up too much CPU and the Wi-Fi hub is simply not built to received a continuous stream of commands .

Instead of going directly to white - the older dimmers went to red - then quickly to white - then quickly to the normal color - but it will not turn the light on and make it stay on . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I have many dimmers that are installed where power comes to the switch through the fixture .

Maybe someone with serial experience can clear up something for me .

I like Matrix , cause we can retrofit a home with only speaker wires at the volume controls . The keypads connect to the speaker cable only . They use the 2 negatives of the left and right to send and receive commands and feedback . We can also just use the controller only ( up to 64zones in 2 zone inc. ) if we have a C4 interface in each room . C4 actually tracks the 3 streams out of the MC . So if one zone is listening to out 1 of the MC , the next zone calling for Digital music will get out 2 . On the keypads form Matrix , you can listen in on all 3 streams at once .

@@8312047 @1512047/ <h> Vacation Mode Programming Anybody ? <h> 5 posts in this topic <p> Just wondering what some of the techniques to implement a vacation mode would be . Currently , my vacation mode is very klugey . I have defined a Vacation mode ON and a Vacation mode OFF lighting scene . I then use scheduler to set start and stop dates for the vacation and it turns the lighting scene on at sunset and off 6 hours later . The scheduler randomizes the on and off by +/- 30 minutes . So , in order to do this I have to go in to scheduler and adjust dates . <p> I would prefer having some button defined in the MTS that I could use to turn the Vacation mode on before I leave the house . It would also be nice if the lights defined in the scene could come on and off independently while the vacation mode was on . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Right next to my garage door , I have a six button pad . As I leave , I press a single button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HVAC , lights , security system and a few other things . Most of the scene is set during the daily lighting schedule . If the away variable is on , then it quietly exits . Otherwise , it executes the daily scene . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> This is an interesting question which I worked on awhile back , and decided to do something which would stay in effect all the time . My own version of it depends on having your C4 tied into a security system , but if yours is then here 's what 's worked really well for us . <p> I defined three schedule agents : <p> Travel Evening 1 <p> Travel Evening 2 <p> Travel Evening End <p> The first one is programmed for sunset +/- 15 minutes ( randomized ) <p> The second is 9pm +/- 30 minutes ( randomized ) <p> The third is 11:30 +/- 30 minutes ( randomized ) <p> I then created 3 lighting scenes . One for the early evening ( office , kitchen , kid 's bedrooms ) and one for the late evening ( upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for night time ( external lights , most interior off ) . <p> In the programming for each of the three agents , I have 2 lines of code : <p> For schedule agent travel evening 1 , it says : <p> If Alarm System is armed to Away <p> &gt;&gt; Execute scene Travel Evening 1 <p> And then the same for Travel Evening 2 and Travel Evening End . <p> The nice thing about doing it this way is it not only makes the house look lived in when we are on vacation , but if we 're out later in the evening ( especially now that sunset is so early ) we come back to a house that also looks lived in . And I do n't have to remember to do anything special when we 're heading out of town . <p> Because we 'd never have the alarm armed to away when we 're home the scenes wo n't be triggered if anyone 's in the house . If you do n't have your system tied into the alarm , you could do all the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're heading out of town ( so instead of " If system armed to away " it would be " If variable ' Away ' = True " then execute scene ' travel evening 1 ' ) . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> One other option which comes to mind if you do n't have an alarm system connected to C4 but you want the vacation settings to kick in automatically . <p> You could have another variable called " Occupied " . Every afternoon at 4pm you could set the variable to " False " and then program a number of actions which would revert it to " True " such as lights going on , media active , etc . At sunset you have the evening lighting sequences above occur , but instead of checking the alarm they 'll check the variable . If between 4pm and sunset none of those actions occurred , then the " Occupied " variable will be false and the lighting scenes will begin . If one of the actions occurred , then the schedule events will find the variable " Occupied " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you could program a sequence of commands to check each light in the house and change the Occupied variable to true if it finds any lights turned on , and that way the sequence will kick in if the house is totally dark . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Jason , Finally got around to implementing this . Thanks for your help . I do n't have my alarm system integrated yet so I went with a simple variable called Vacation Mode . I enable this via the MTS if I 'm out of town . I like your " occupied " idea too . I may have to try that .

@@8312101 @1512101/ <h> Security Cameras <h> 8 posts in this topic <p> I have read several posts about cameras , but nothing very recent . I am looking at adding an IP POE camera system to my home . Currently I am planning having the camera system ( NVR , software ) separate , but allow C4 to integrate the feeds as well . I will use more than likely use C4 for easy one stop viewing and if need to pull actual footage go to the " stand alone " system , more on this later . I hope this will accomplish a few things for me . <p> First , allow me to build this in stages . I do not know how many cameras I will ultimately need/want . I would imagine this would allow me to put any combination of camera configurations into my system , whether it is a single 16 channel or 4 separate 4 channel systems . I could use Control4 to view all cameras in a single location . I have n't really dove into pricing yet , so I have no clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other combination is most cost effective . <p> Second , allow me to mix and match brands of cameras and systems . I am not sure how important this really is . I am not sure if different camera brands have niches where they shine . I also know there is " add-on " software that can be used , possible with any camera model meeting certain specifications . For example the AXIS Cross Line Detection and eLPR - Embeded License Plate Recognition off the Axis page LONG ... as well as others . <p> So my current thoughts for my system are to put 4 cameras out by the street ( 100 feet or so frontage ) and 4 more cameras on the front of the house ( same frontage , but 150 back ) . This may be overkill and I am open to suggestions , even if it is to call a professional . In the back I will ultimately add somewhere around 8 cameras at some point . These will all be wired because that is what I prefer . I am not looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets the job done without breaking the bank , if possible . I do n't really mind spending the money , if it really makes that much of a difference . I would like input you are willing to give . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> From experience : I purchased 8 wirepath 2MP IP cameras and their 16NVR . While the optics on the camera seem pretty good in my inexperienced opinion , the NVR is leaving much to be desired . <p> After several hours on the phone with SnapAV , I 'm not much further along trying to do anything but watch live cameras . They keep claiming their beta drivers will be out within the next two weeks ( been going on for 8 weeks now ) . Any NVR development will be out some time next year so they say . <p> I 'm a little disgruntled for paying retail to be a beta tester . Yes I can view the cameras in C4 but you ca n't do much with the NVR in CR . More importantly , is the lack of features on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ca n't use Chrome but IE kinda works . It just feels super buggy . Smart Searching or any searching for that matter with the NVR is a total chore . If you want to just watch live cameras then this could be your ticket . But if you want a more usable NVR , then I 'm afraid SnapAV is going to need more time in the oven . <p> I would think there would be a better solution . I do n't mind viewing cameras in C4 but not at the expensive of a crippled NVR . Does anybody have any suggestions for approx 2MP , dome , IP cams preferably around $550 per camera ? Or a decent NVR ? I currently have a Synology Diskstation and have heard good things about the Surveillance Station app but have no first hand experience . <p> Best case would be to have cameras that work in CR but also work with a good NVR or Synology if that is the best choice . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I 've used few of the Snap units directly , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NVRs and lots of different camera 's - both do not provide limitations on using their own cams or not , or having at least a certain % of their own cams. @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Cyknight : thanks for the input . At this stage I 'm inclined to start over . Can you recommend any IP cam / NVR combo . I think it would be a plus to have C4 compatibility but not mandatory . Camera budget approx $550 and NVR around $2,000 . <p> I own a Synology NAS that has Surveillance Station , but the Wirepath Cameras are not compatible to my knowledge . There are many QNAP vs Synology threads out there . They seem comparable .

When in cooling mode the power is taken from the call for heat path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a heat only or cool only install , when the system calls for heat there is no cool path to steal power from thus the battery will deplete faster .

@@8312252 @1512252/ <h> GE Concord V4 question ....... <h> 12 posts in this topic <p> Does anyone know how to activate the alarm system to " Away " mode remotely via 4Sight ? My problem is that if someone is actually leaving when I arm it it 's fine because an exterior door is opened , so the system " sees " that someone has left the premises . What I 'm trying to do is arm it to Away without having to open an exterior door . Is there a way to trick the system into thinking an exterior door has been opened ? My problem is my kids or the housekeeper occasionally forgets to set the alarm but when I go in to set it to Away , the system automatically detects no exterior door being opened and sets it to " Stay " mode . Any thoughts ? ? ? ? Thanks @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Yup , this is a setting called the " Auto Stay Arming Feature " . It monitors the house when it 's been armed to away and if no exterior door is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overall industry effort to reduce false alarms ( which account for some enormous percentage of alarm calls , like 99% or something incredible . <p> The idea behind it is that , in the absence of a logical explanation like arming the house from outside , if the system sees " Arm to Away " and then no exterior door is opened , then it would be reasonable to conclude that the person arming the system has stayed in the house and must have intended to press Arm to Stay . <p> To get around this , you 'd actually need to ask your dealer to change that setting . My dealer was able to do so remotely . Took a few phone calls to get it done , but now we can arm it from outside of the house , or arm to away when someone wants the added security of motion detectors ( and will be in locations that wo n't trip motion sensors ) . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> JBS , which " dealer " programmed this for you ? Was it your C4 dealer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you tell me who it was so I can try and get them to program mine ( or help my dealer program it ) ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> It 's not a user-programmable feature unfortunately . It 's something your alarm dealer will need to program for you . Since the intent is to reduce false alarms , they sort of want to limit the frequency with which people turn it off . But in this case ( arming from an external interface ) it makes perfect sense . <p> We had them turn it off for both the reasons stated below -- to occasionally be able to arm at night using motion sensors , and also to be able to arm with a key press from the garage , for example . In both instances the lack of a delay door opening and closing after arming would have reverted to the Arm to Stay state . <p> Just ask your alarm dealer to disable it , and explain why . I suspect they 'll have no problem with it . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow arming your system to AWAY remotely ? My concern is if you forget to ARM TO AWAY before leaving your house for a trip and want to turn it on ( not just ARM TO STAY ) using 4SIGHT .... <p> I 'm curious whether using Alarm.com 's mobile app has any impact on this since it 's much more logical that someone would use that from outside the house to arm their system . I suspect it 's the same situation because the panel either has AutoStayArming on or it does n't , but it 's at least an easy-to-explain reason to ask your alarm dealer to turn off the feature . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> I think after combing my manual and trying to ARM TO AWAY remotely without going into the SYSTEM PROGRAMMING menu ( where I was stuck last night until it apparently timed out overnight so I could arm again ) the best way to do this is the ARM TO AWAY with NO DELAY by pressing the 4 button after hitting ARM TO AWAY ..... It has stayed in ARM TO AWAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When you say virtual button , do you mean a button on the onscreen Control4 display or like a button command ? <p> The security panel onscreen display is missing the A , B , C , and D buttons that are on the actual physical GE panel and those would be beneficial to have as well if you are talking an onscreen panel . <p> I would like something that would be easy to ARM TO AWAY if you forget to arm when leaving as many of my lights and thermostat control are tied to whether the GE Concord is ARMED TO AWAY vs. at home ( ie when I ARM TO AWAY I have certain lights turn off and on at different times and also turn the thermostat way down ) .... <p> At least I was able to figure out the NO DELAY works for ARM TO AWAY without reverting to ARM TO STAY if you do n't trip a door sensor on the way out .

I ended up leaving that dealer and became an independent designer/programmer . About a year ago , I co-founded BitWise Controls . We 're making some IP-enabled control system peripheral devices , the first of which is the BitWise Controls BC4 . It 's a small PoE enabled enclosure which has an on-board temperature sensor , and accepts various expansion modules with different hardware configurations . The first available module is the BCX-1 , which has GPIO , Relays , RS232 , and route-able IR with a massive on-board IR library . We 're working with a number of integration partners to develop BC4 support , and I 'm also looking at creating a DriverWorks driver for it .

It seems the question , that I do n't know the answer to , is whether you can use 2 keypad buttons to dim up/down a scene . @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Thanks to everyone for helping me further my education in C4 , as it is new to me . I do not believe a scene can be dimmed as the scene is just that , however if a dimmer can be bound to a keypad button would you still have the ability to dim up/down with a single button or would you need the use of 2 buttons to be able to dim up/down ? ? ? @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Thanks for the help , my dealer is telling me that a keypad can not be programmed to ramp up/down a dimmer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lighting sceen of which I was already aware ) . Bummer , they need a hold button option in programming , hopefully an update in the future . <p> I was able to get a 2-button to behave like a dimmer using HE , by basically programming key presses on the the 2-button to trigger key presses on the corresponding dimmer ( including press/hold to ramp up ) . Seems to work well EXCEPT that a quick single-tap and release does not turn the light to 0 or 100% ( depending on top or bottom ) . Actually , since this functionality was n't important to me , I did n't try to incorporate it---so perhaps this can be mimiced too .

This was mainly to run everything within our TV room ( DirecTV HR20 , Denon Receiver , xBox 360 , and Samsung 72 " DLP ) . Next came a few light switches . Since then , we have decided to relocate the majority of the equipment to the basement and set up an A/V room to house everything .

The HC500 plugs directly into the Kramer via serial cable but there is no driver I have found that runs it properly .

Kodi offers a beautiful simple interface that enriches your playback experience . The Chowmain Kodi Lite driver enables us to integrate the Kodi Entertainment Center into the Control4 home automation system with seamless control and feedback. - <p> This is the most feature packed media player on Control4 to date providing the user with an enriched movie playback experience . See below for more details- <p> Numerical buttons act as jump to percentage during video playback or SMS style quick navigation when in navigational modes .

This driver provides the ability to send Kodi announcements . Like a Control4 Announcement this will pop up a custom message however in this case it will not interrupt the current Kodi activity . It will just pop up in the bottom right hand corner for a few seconds and then hide away . <p> This driver provides two way feedback on what media you 're consuming and what the state of the media player is .

If you leave the room for too long or fall asleep at the tv the driver will automatically turn the room off ( all av devices off ) upon detection of screensaver activation. - <p> Some projectors have the option of clearing out the black bars ( masking ) in movies . This driver reports back the aspect ratio of the video it is currently playing as a variable . Using this information we can automate these projection masking modes and as such make the user experience nicer. - <p> This driver has feedback on CPU usage , Memory usage and CPU temperature . This information is extremely important for maintaining the health of the hardware platform it is on .

@@8312319 @1512319/ <h> Motorola VIP 22xx ipTV receivers and C4 <h> 8 posts in this topic <p> I just switched to ipTV here in Canada ( known as Bell FibeTV ) and would like to know if there is an issue with the Motorola VIP 2262 and VIP 2202 receivers with respect to the IR commands required to get them to work with C4 . My installer had a hell of time setting the commands up to work from C4 . However , their response to channel changing or channel selection ( using C4 's channel icons to select a channel ) leaves varying results . For example , if I need to go to channel 1214 it will go to 214 or 121 whereby a digit(s) gets missed . This happens when punching the numbers manually using C4 or selectin the icon that 's suppose to take you to the desired channel . Also , setting up a scheduled alarm does not turn on the TV to the channel that has been defined in C4 . It normally turns on to the last channel viewed or will give me some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ( again , using 1214 , I will get 214 for example ) . <p> Is there an update that C4 and/or Motorola will be providing to address this response issue when using these receivers with C4 ?

I am a Contro4 installer having hard time controling this particular receiver ... The remote code is nearly impossible to learn because most buttons strangely does the same IR patern . I manage to learn the Channel Up/Down keys and the only way to make it work reliabily is to disasable the C4 's IR emiter and place the diode directly in front of the receiver . Having directional keys and other function learnt was impossible , if someone has a way to get this receiver to work or a list of discrete IR code , It 's more than welcome ! @qwx111139 @qwx111137 @qwx111138 <p> Anyone have any results with this driver and the 1262 ?
