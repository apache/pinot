The season is n't over and Gottfried is still the coach ( update : He s been fired ) , but we watched another 2nd half of poor basketball last night and with all the rumors swirling , I think this thing has a pretty clear ending . We know you do n't  want to read what went wrong against UNC. Shoot , its the same stuff that went wrong in their first loss against Creighton or the loss against Miami . So instead , we want to write what you are likely here to read . A first glance as some potential hires for the POSSIBLE upcoming coaching search . Here we go . <p> Archie Miller ( Dayton ) This is a no brainer . To be honest , I believe if Archie was having a bad year then the fire Gottfried call would not have been quite as loud . However , Miller is having a great year , is tied for first in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . State donors and fans all realize that the time is now or never on Miller , which is likely what started the ball rolling on moving away from Gottfried despite a track record that may have at least bought him another year . <p> Either way , Miller would be a homerun hire for State . Would he be the best hire ? I dont- know . He would certainly unite the fan base and he certainly would bring more of a structured atmosphere around the program . He is an up and comer who is on everyones radar . Which brings us to <p> Would he come ? Good question . He is an alumnus . His wifes family lives about 1.5 hours outside Raleigh . Those are the plusses . We know his dream job is OSU and Thad Matta is having a bad season , but will they fire him ? I doubt it . If that job were to open then Archie would take it . That 's pretty much the bottom line . Now , aside from that scenario , would he think about coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but its certainly not off the table if the Wolfpack open up their pocketbook and pay him out ( offer the guy $3.5 mil and make him turn you down . ) <p> Will Wade ( VCU ) If Archie is your 1A then Wade is your 1B . Honestly , Wade might be the better get of the two , but with Archie being from NC State and having connections I think fans know that hed understand the situation of NC State better than Wade . Honestly though , does that matter ? Wade is a hard-ass , no-nonsense , tell is like it is kind of guy and he s only 34 years old . He s the one tied with Archie for 1st place in the A-10 . This is only his second year at VCU and he s having a ton of success , but would he jump to the ACC ? I 'm not so sure . This is a very confident coach who likes where he is at and seems self-assured that there will be big time jobs waiting for him when he s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump ? I do n't  think a guy like Wade is necessarily looking at NC State and hoping they offer him something , but a move to the ACC would be a step up and again , if NC State makes Wade a HUGE offer he ca n't refuse , they just might be able to pry him away from VCU . Take a look at some of Wades greatest hits . <p> Gregg Marshall Marshall has always been on the Wolfpack fans radar . He won at Winthrop and then took the Wichita State job where he has been for the past 9 years . He has taken them to 5 straight NCAA tournaments and is well on his way to another as he sits at 14-1 ( 1st place ) in the MVC conference . Marshall is a key candidate for the Pack because he s likely ready to try his hand against the big dogs in the ACC . Marshall is a competitor . He s a very fiery , very passionate coach who would fit well with the NC State fanbase . The guy has a chip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does is keep on winning ( oh and he hates Jeff Goodman so that 's a plus ) <p> So what 's the catch ? Money . Marshall is making over $ 3million . That is a ton for the head coach of Wichita State . But what does that show you ? Wichita State has no business paying their coach $3.3 million , but they did and they are now a powerhouse in their conference . If NC State would just stop trying to find a bargain and open their wallet up , then they might get the right guy here . If you want to compete with the top teams in the nation , then you need to offer a top-line salary to your next coach . Show Marshall the money and there 's a good chance you could pry him . <p> As you can see in this clip , Marshall is n't necessarily interested in much else than the business of basketball . He is n't interested in Jeff Goodmans take that people do n't  like his personality . He s an outsider that nobody gets . Well , guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets and if you want a guy who is n't scared one bit of standing up to Roy and K , then Marshall is your man . Marshall has won and won big everywhere he s been . You want a winner ? Offer Gregg . <p> Chris Holtmann ( Butler ) Lots of talk around Holtman right now . He stepped in for head coach Brandon Miller a few years ago when he was forced to take a medical leave . Holtmann was the top assistant and moved to the HC slot . Now , he s done a pretty good job there and hed be a nice hire , however . I think Hottmann is probably your 4th or 5th best option at this point . Sure , he s taken a Butler program to two consecutive tournaments in his first two years , but NC State is a different animal . Coaching at NC State means much tougher competition , attracting a different type of player , etc. - Could Hotlmann do it , I think so . Would he be a major upgrade to our program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that is big thing with Holtmann . I think he would . With his name seemingly floating around out of nowhere , I wonder if his agent or his people are n't  the ones floating it . Maybe I 'm wrong and he plays it safe and stays at Butler . I mean , he is a top 25 team and 2nd in the Big East , but maybe he wants- to get paid . He s only making about $1 mil , so a offer for $2.5 might get him if Butler does n't  re-up. 73283 @qwx273283 <p> 12 Comments 73278 @qwx273278 <p> 12 Comments on " Early Names to watch in the NC State Coaching Search ( part 1 ) " <p> I will say this . I 've questioned a lot of Yows decisions but I have to give her this she listens to fans when they are fed up . Her office was getting tons of emails calling for Gotts head and she responded . Maybe not as quickly as I liked but she acted . <p> When the new coach is hired , if he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season I will support that . We need a coach that kids will respect and also kids that are coachable and play their asses off for their coach . <p> Heres hoping we get it right this time and choose a real winner . As always I am willing to give the next guy 4 seasons to prove himself . Just want to see progress each season , some decent defense , and disciplined basketball . If the next guy can build the team with 3&amp;4 stars and be kicking ass by year 3/4 I could live with that too . Nothing worse than losing with 5 stars . <p> Well its official . Gott is axed . I do n't  hate Gott but I never liked his hiring . It felt like Yow either struck out on the big names , pissed off a couple of coaches then was forced to settle on a guy who was fired from his previous job . Not a recipe for success . <p> I heard we screwed up with Marshall during a previous coaching search so he may not be interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He s a fiery guy and his guys play disciplined basketball . <p> I still like McDermott and Holtman . That game we played against Creighton , we were totally and completely outcoached . Holtman is the guy you want if you like the young up and comer . <p> 2 73279 @qwx273279 <p> Guest <p> yakima2k <p> 5 months 3 days ago <p> McDermotts utter failure at Iowa State in what was an otherwise stable and successful program concerns me . Not to mention he has n't  had great success at Creighton since his son graduated , although they are definitely looking good this year . Holtmann , though , appears to be great and his time at Gardner-Webb at least gives him some link to the region . <p> With McDermott , he has a track record of improving programs at the lower levels ( see Wayne State &amp; Northern Iowa ) but has struggled at times in the big leagues . But when he has talent he wins . Maybe its just a matter of pairing him up with good recruiters . <p> Yeah I may lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Butler and really took full advantage of the situation . He s young and likely has that energy needed at a program like State where the kids do n't  appear to be buying in . <p> McDermott is such a long shot anyways . But Holtmann , IMO , is a true target . I just think this time around NC State needs a guy who mirrors the personality of the fan base . The softer , friendlier approach did n't  translate well for Herb Sendek despite putting together some pretty nice seasons . I think they need to put a huge package together and throw it at Arch , Wade and Marshall . <p> To me , those are your top 3 guys . You basically ask them what its going to take to get them here and you match it . After that then you go to your second tier . I think Keatts is your last option , but I hear he WILL take it . 
@@26404578 @104578/ <h> Why all the buzz about NC State target Kevin Keatts ? <p> We 've heard it . Youve heard it . Kevin Keatts , the current UNCW head coach , is on the list of head coaches that are being vetted by NC State . <p> From everything we 've heard , Keatts would take the job if offered . But WILL NC State offer ? Let 's take a look at the situation and give you a breakdown of our thoughts . <p> Most of you know Keatts from Hargrave , where he coached former NC State point guard Lorenzo Brown . During Browns recruitment , we had the chance to speak with Keatts on numerous occasions . He is a good basketball mind and gave a lot of good insight into the recruiting process . <p> After Hargrave , he went to Louisville to become to the top recruiter for Rick Pitinos squad . While there , he landed some impressive classes and started to make a name for himself . After his run with the Cardinals , Keatts took his first head coaching job at UNC-Wilmington . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radar . <p> In his three years at UNCW , Keatts has taken a struggling program and put them back on the map . Wilmington has finished 1st ( or tied for first ) in all three seasons under Keatts . He also won coach of the year in his first campaign . <p> So why is NC State considering him ? Well , first off , he is an up and coming star in the coaching ranks . The key phrase , however , is up and coming. Winning in the Colonial conference is one thing , but winning in the ACC is another animal . Wilmingtons competition is n't that strong , but his recruiting ties to the area and his ability to build a program has NC States attention . <p> Honestly , I find the amount of buzz around him to be fair , but not fully substantiated . We 'd think that Keatts would be a top tier ( maybe #2 or #3 ) candidate for the Wolfpack if he had both shown success at Wilmington and also shown success at another stop . Basing your hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we 'd like to believe that the NC State position is prestigious enough to warrant a little more evidence of success . <p> Sure , Daytons Archie Miller only has 6 years at one stop , and VCUs Will Wade has 4 years of experience at two stops , so its not like they have that much more . However , both Miller and Wade have found success in a much more competitive conference and we believe that is worth something . Miller and Wade are pretty much believed to be NC States top two mid-major candidates at the moment , with Keatts looking like the #3 . <p> We think Keatts is a good candidate , sure , but we think he s a tick below Miller and Wade based on experience and proven success . So why is there so much buzz about Keatts ? <p> Let 's break that down . Keatts is thought to be the most attainable candidate . Talk is that he wants the NC State job pretty bad . True or not , that is a reason that the N&amp;O and multiple national writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NC State . <p> The other reason we think you 're hearing Keatts name mentioned so much is because we are seeing it being floated a lot more by sources close to NC State . What does this mean ? It certainly does n't  mean they think Keatts is a top 2 or 3 candidate , does it ? You have Miller , Wade , Drew , Holtmann and a few more that would obviously be bigger splashes than Kevin Keatts . So why all the chatter ? <p> We believe that NC State is doing all they can to not replicate the failure in PR we saw during the last search . People were talking Rick Barnes , Sean Miller , Billy Donovan , and many more huge names ( many of which ended up being pipe dreams ) . Debbie Yow offered up a letter during the latter days of the search that basically tried to walk back NC State fans expectations before she announced the out of the blue hire of Mark Gottfried . <p> We believe that while it may have worked at the time , NC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have time to vet him on the message boards and social media or come to a consensus on whether or not they liked him for the position . Now , it shouldnt matter what message board fans think , however as you 've seen , fan perception does end up playing a role . Gottfried was never their guy. So when the going got rough they did n't  feel a invested connection with him and were quick to create a rallying cry for his ouster . Were not trying to say it was undeserved , but had it been Rick Barnes or Sean Miller with the same record we believe the fans would not have come to such a quick consensus on time being up. <p> At the end of the day , what we believe is going on is that , yes , NC State does think Keatts would be an acceptable hire and would be someone who could turn the program around , but we also believe they know he s their floor guy . They likely are n't  going to hire Keatts over Archie , Wade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doing their best to get his name under consideration early , so if in fact , they end up missing on their top names , fans are n't  breaking out the pitchforks after being blindsided for a second time . <p> Take it for what its worth . We do n't  have any insight into the true motive for Keatts name being floated so prominantly , but we 've been doing this for a while now and get a feeling that this just might be the case . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> May have to put ETSUs Forbes on coaching search backburner . Does n't  have a lot of Div I head coaching experience but the success of the programs while he was an assistant is impressive : TAMU , Tenn , Wich St. <p> I hear Yurt7 is testing NBA waters . I think theyll tell him what I would tell him go back and work on getting stronger . When he committed to playing in college I do n't  know that he fully thought that through . A mediocre 7 footer coming out of Europe has a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States because the NBA does not vett foreign players very well . <p> 1 73279 @qwx273279 <p> Guest <p> wolfpack74 <p> 4 months 4 days ago <p> The NBA should tell him that yoou cant even play at the college level , how in the hell do you think you can play at the NBA level ? He is a mid development league player right now at best . Stay in school under a decent coach until you average a double double . Most overrated player of all time at State . <p> I do n't  think it would be a good move for either party . Keats is too inexperienced and has not coached in a challenging enough level to make this kind of leap . It could be a disaster for both State and Keats career if he fails badly . We should have learned our lesson about recruiting . Its only part of the answer . Good coaching at a high level is the bigger part of the equation .

@@26404582 @104582/ <p> Say what you want , but if NC State offers Keatts then it means that Archie Miller said no .

Keatts is a proven assistant and a proven recruiter , but if NC State is looking for proven success at a competitive level , they wo n't get it with Keatts . Were not saying he cant do it , were just saying hiring him would be taking some true risk . Winning at UNCW is great and he really turned that program around , but that is the colonial conference .

@@26404586 @104586/ <h> Our Take : Kapita emerges , Dorn Dominant in win over St Francis 86-61 <p> Now that was what the Wolfpack faithful was hoping for ! After an opener that left much to be desired , NC State looked a lot more like the team pundits were hyping all preseason as they demolished St Francis 86-61 . Let 's take a look at the player by player breakdown <p> Torin Dorn Dorn finished with 21 points , 7 boards and 3 steals in the win . So far this kid has been the glue guy for this ballclub . When he is on the floor , the Wolfpack offense looks ( at times ) unstoppable . Dorns strength , balance and body control are unmatched and when State needs a bucket , Dorn goes and gets it . Couple that with the fact that he s making all the hustle plays and moves well without the ball , and you have what looks like a guy that 's going to be a constant contributor and possible team leader . Against St.Francis , Dorn put pressure on the defense all game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he finished in traffic and he was the go to guy when State needed a bucket . Add in the fact that he flashed his stroke with a 3 and a long jumper , and you can see why were so excited about Dorn this season . <p> Ted Kapita We have to admit , there was a point when we were told that the team was preparing for a full season without Kapita . While it scared us , it was more about the effect it would have on frontcourt depth . We did n't  know the polish hed bring on offense . Kapita moves well and finishes strong . He s physical , he s huge and he s got a real motor on him . Its no wonder Gottfried said that he was one of his top 7 guys during the preseason . Kapita came in and quickly made his presence felt . He scored 17 points and pulled down 8 boards in only 24 minutes of play . Not only is he giving the Wolfpack a scoring threat on the blocks , he s also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . His footwork , his hands and his body control are all far and away better than many expected . Adding Kapita makes this team that much more well rounded and in our minds , solidifies this team as a true contender , thanks to the added depth and versatility of their roster . <p> Terry Henderson Henderson seems to be the team leader at this point of the season . With more experience than most guys on the floor , Henderson brought another nice across-the-board performance . He can shoot it , he can take his man off the dribble and he can finish . With Henderson and Dorn in the game , NC State has a slew of guys capable of beating you off the dribble . And the best thing about these guys , is that once they get in the lane they are also unselfish and always looking to dump it off for an easy bucket . Henderson finished with 11 points , 5 boards and 3 assists against St. Francis . While he did n't  connect on any of his 3s , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense every time he forced the issue on the drive . <p> Dennis Smith Jr . Slowly but surely Dennis Smith Jr is starting to get accustomed to the college game . You get the feeling that he did n't  expect the level of physicality he s getting right now , but alreayd in his 2nd game you can tell he s feeling it out and adjusting . Smith looked more aggressive in this one , and while he got into some foul trouble , he also flashed some promise . He finished with 12 points , 3 boards and 3 assists in 26 minutes , but I still do n't  think we 've seen the real Dennis Smith just yet . I 'm guessing he has a huge tournament down in St. Thomas this coming weekend . <p> Malik Abu Another guy who most thought would be a major scoring threat for the Pack is Abu . Over the first two games however , Abu has n't  really got into a true rhythm . While he is a junior , I think he s getting used to playing with his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their style of play . Over his first two seasons Abu was getting his points on cleanups around the rim and on one-on-one isolations in the post . This year he s seemed a bit surprised when guys like Smith , Dorn and Henderson drive and dish off to him . He s fumbled a few and mishandled a couple , but he s just getting used to having the ball delivered to him in traffic . Once this all starts to click , Abu is going to a be a major contributor in the post . Coming from an offense that seemed stagnant on most nights , the new group is applying much more pressure off the dribble , and this opening up passing lanes for easy dump offs . Positioning and reading these drives is going to be where Abu finds his payoff . Against St Francis , he was good , dropping 11 points and grabbing 7 rebounds , but like Smith , once he finds a rhythm with these guys , that stat line is going to look mighty pedestrian vs. the type of lines we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson Another solid , but not spectacular performance from Johnson . To be honest , that is what this team needs from him . He s a steady hand , sure with the ball , and more of a distibutor than a scorer . He s a huge insurance policy for Gottfried , who can feel confident in playing Smith with foul trouble , knowing Johnson is waiting in the wings . Against St. Francis , Johnson made plays that were there , and did n't  really force things that were not . He finished with 6 points and 3 assists with only 1 turnover . <p> Hicks and Anya Anya looked a lot more active in this one and it paid off . The big man finished with 7 points , 3 boards and a block . He , like Abu , is still learning how to play with this group of talented guards . There is less back to the baskest isolations and more dump offs in the paint . Anya still needs to work on cating the ball and going straight up with it ( just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , hesitated and then was fouled before he could get it up and in . The good news here is that it seems Anya has worked on his freethrows . He hit 3 of 4 , when last year he was a 40% FT shooter . <p> As for Hicks , he did what was asked of him . He came in to spell Kapita , took up space , played physical and added 4 boards in 24 mintues . He and Anya need to keep doing what they are doing . While Kapita might start eating into their minutes , they will still need to turn to these two when fould trouble arises or when Abu and Kapita need breathers. 73283 @qwx273283 <p> 3 point shooting can improve dramatically if the shots are open and in rhythm . It will all depend on the maturation of our PGs as the season progresses . Too often in the 1st two games guys were rushing or taking bad shots from the perimeter . If Gott does a better job of running plays for Dennis/Markell where they penetrate and cause defenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abu wants to go pro he really needs to work on going up strong in traffic . He struggles with the ball in the paint with defenders on him and he avoids contact and fades away when he should be attacking . In all honesty , CJ Leslie was a better talent than Abu and he never made it in the NBA . Abu needs to attack and he must become a ball hawk and above avg defender to appease NBA scouts . <p> 2 73279 @qwx273279 <p> Guest <p> wolfpack74 <p> 8 months 4 days ago <p> I also agree with you on Abu . What I have seen so far this year and the last two is that he is not a NBA caliber player . Good kid , but not NBA level . Stay another year and develop an outside shot would help his future . <p> Coach needs to run some different plays for Dennis . He s too young to just be let loose .

That way he has an open lane to the basket instead of having to ad lib too much from the top of the key . <p> I like Henderson on offense but he seems to lack lateral quickness on defense . He got beat a few times off the dribble and was just unable to keep up . Help defense was lacking and it led to some easy layups by St. Francis . <p> 1 73279 @qwx273279 <p> Guest <p> wolfpack74 <p> 8 months 4 days ago <p> I agree with Henderson . At address , his feet are too wide to stay in front of his guy . His balance is terrible . I also not in love with his shooting ability .

Keep everyone breathless and happy . <p> So it looks good based on the numbers . He seems to have good athleticism and quickness . Also looked really smooth .

@@26404590 @104590/ <h> How Defense Ruined Wolfpacks Big Night in Loss to Syracuse <p> NC State played what was probably their most impressive game offensively , but it was n't enough as Syracuse exposed the Wolfpacks weakness on defense in their 100-93 OT win . <p> Dennis Smith logged his second career triple-double ( 13pts , 15 assists , and 10 rebounds ) , Mav Rowan scored a career-high 31 on 8 three pointers , Henderson added 16 , Abu pitched in a very loud 19 and Yurtseven even dropped 10 . So how in the world , with those stats did NC State lose this game . <p> Well , you guess it . Defense . John Gillon , who averages 9ppg , decided to drop 43 on NC State . Let 's clear two things up . Maybe decide is the wrong word . NC State , specifically Dennis Smith , let him drop 43 , and while the- defense was extremely poor , we should n't take away from the fact that Gillon put on an amazing performance ( 9-10 from 3pt range and 14-14 from the FT line . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr . or Gottfried ? Not sure who gets the blame here . At a high level , it should be Gottfried because he- should have a gameplan and have his guys stick with it until he changes it . There is too much inconsistency- on ball screens . Sometimes they switch and sometimes Dennis Smith goes over top and most of the time he goes underneath . <p> You could argue that they have matchups that they are willing to switch and ones they are not , but that ca n't be the case because often they allowed a switch on a big , putting Abu on Gillom and Smith on their big . No coach in their right mind would gameplan a switch like that . So that makes it very probable that Dennis Smith is calling for switch when he feels like it , and then staying with his man when he feels like it . <p> Who is allowing this ? Gottfried ? You are 2/3 of the way through the season and your team has shown a very apparent- lack of communication and lack of ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two things . Its either Gottfried giving them the green light to call switches when they want and this is causing confusion and disruption defensively , leading to wide open men and complete collapse of the defense . Or , the only other thing it could be , - is that Gottfried is giving them a game plan ( for instance . Never switch , bigs need to hedge , defender needs to recover ) and Dennis Smith Jr is simply not following it . <p> So to be clear . This problem here is either on Gottfried or Smith Jr depending on what the established gameplan was , but Gottfried gets the most blame because if Smith Jr is going against his game plan defensively then he s allowing it by keeping him on the floor . Tonight proves that everything Smith adds to this team offensively is pretty much made up for by his lack of defense . This is a major , major flaw in the NC State defense . <p> Over or under the ball screen ? - Smith choosing under way too often . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen is for two situations . 1 ) You 're lazy on defense or 2 ) You are guarding a guy who is not a threat from 3pt range and you want him taking 3s . That 's it . <p> So when John Gillom is dripping wet from 3pt range and is single-handedly killing your team , you have to ask why you would ever go underneath a ball screen on him . The only excuse is laziness or being tired . And if its that Dennis Smith Jr is too tired to defend someone , then he should simply not be on the court . That is on Gottfried . If Smith is taking breaks on defense then that is a problem , - and Gottfried needs to get him some more breathers because its already proven that no matter how good you are offensively , when NC State plays no defense , they lose . <p> The point is , even Syracuses- Andrew White couldnt believe how bad the Wolfpacks defense was . <p> " The hedge was kind of soft and his man ( Smith ) was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACC that 's easy pickings. he took advantage of that . But I was surprised to watch them keep going under his screens , especially after he s hitting 3 after 3 . " <p> If Mark Gottfried does not get more strict with his teams defense and his team fails to hold focus and communication on the defensive end then this season is done , over , and probably the biggest waste of talent NC State fans have ever seen.Too many blow-bys but Helpside is either too much , or not at all During NC States run , they were helping and recovering . They were getting shot clock violations and making it tough to find good shots . But why did that only last for a few minutes ? <p> For one , why is NC State guards getting beat so easily off the bounce ? Well , rewatch the tape and see how often they are chest to chest , pressed up on someone way beyond the 3pt arch . What is the point ? If a team is going to beat you by shooting deep threes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not many teams are going to be able to consistently knock down those shots . That is how Virginia is so successful . When you get within the 3pt arch , you get physical man to man , chest to chest defense . When you are at the 3pt line you are within arms length , and beyond that you are 4 feet off the guy . How hard is this to understand . NC State chooses to- exert their defensive effort on the ball , 40 ft away from the basket . <p> When there is a blow-by , especially a baseline blow-by , there almost never is a big ready to drop down and beat the man to the block and stop his drive . They are nearly always late . Why ? How ? Are bigs not taught to see man and ball at all times . Isnt that literally the first thing every coach teaches his players ? This is one reason the bigs pick up so many fouls . They are never beating the ball to a spot in help . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> At this point , we literally have no clue why these things are still problems 3/4 of the way through the season . Why is a high-level ACC basketball team having so much trouble with simple foundations of team defense ? <p> We just posed a bunch of questions on here . You have the believe that these are things that Gottfried is preaching to his kids . Right ? So if that 's the case , - then why isnt it happening . Why are these problems still so obvious and so glaring ? <p> That is probably the million dollar question whose answer is the key to NC State reaching their potential . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> How do you think we got Smith or Yurtseven to come to State .

However , as time went on it started to look more and more like Miller was eyeing the potential opening of the Ohio State job . That too changed when OSU publically stated that Thad Matta would be returning next season . So where does that leave the situation , exactly ? <p> Well , tonight Miller will face off against another past-potential NC State target , Gregg Marshall of Witchita State . Should Dayton fall , the game really begins for the Wolfpack . There is no doubt that State will engage Miller . The former Wolfpack point guard is probably the hottest mid-major coach on the market , has ties to Raleigh and the timing couldnt be better ( Miller is losing a talented senior class that has brought him most of his success . ) The question is , will Miller listen ? <p> This is his alma-mater . He has friends here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't  mean he s likely to take the job , we think hell listen at the very least out of generosity . <p> So the question we are posing is , what would it take to get Miller to Raleigh ? There is not going to a hometown bargain here . This is a guy who is rocketing his way up the coaching ranks . A few more big seasons at Dayton and hell be the front-runner for nearly any big-time job that opens up . That means NC State needs to not only come in strong with an offer , they need to blow Miller away . If this is NC States #1 guy , and we believe it is , they need to be ready to compensate him well enough that any questions he has about the decision to come to NC State falls into the background . <p> We are talking big money . Were talking $3 million plus money . We might be talking $3.5 range when all is said and done . But that 's not all . A big salary is n't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull Miller . They need to provide security . That is the biggest detractor from this job . Whether it was Herb Sendek or Mark Gottfried , the word on the street is that NC State has a quick trigger with their coaches . Fair or not , that needs to be addressed in this offer . That means long-term with a large buyout . Too risky , you say ? When you 're bidding for a guy like Miller its a high stakes game . If you , as a program , view Miller as your home run then you go and you get him . You do n't  lowball him or hedge your bets . You go all in . <p> This is the difference between a good program and a great program . Does NC State have the confidence in their vetting process ?

@@26404598 @104598/ <h> Can NC State ask any more of Dennis Smith Jr ? Fair or not , they need to <p> No one should be pointing the finger at a freshman who is averaging 20 points and 6 assists per game . Its not Dennis Smith Jrs fault that NC State is struggling to an early 1-4 ACC record . In fact , Smith has been the only one consistently filling up the stat sheet for the Wolfpack . He s the one taking and making most of the shots . <p> That being said , NC State is in trouble . They are loaded with depth and talent , yet have been outmanned and beat down by the likes of UNC , Miami , Georgia Tech and Boston College . In those games , Dennis Smith has averaged 21 points , 6 assists and 6 boards per game . It does n't  make sense to ask more of Smith . Or does it ? <p> There has been a lot of criticism of Mark Gottfried as of late and its not to say he does n't  deserve it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win basketball games , and lately , he has n't  been doing that . But there is a piece to the puzzle that has n't  been discussed . That piece is on-court leadership . That notion is baked into the this is a young team argument and it should n't be ignored . <p> Take a look at every good team out there . Every single one of them has an on-court leader . A guy who is an extension of the coach on the court . A guy who 's demeanor is unflappable , who sets the tone on both ends of the floor , and who leads both vocally and by example . Right now , this guy does not exist for NC State . But if the Wolfpack is going to turn this season around , they are going to need to find this guy , and fast . So who is it ? <p> While you could name a number of guys youd hope would step up and take on this role , the most likely candidate is certainly Smith . He is the point guard . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who teams are gunning for . The one the media is enamored with and the guy who seems to be looked up to by his teammates . But as much as Dennis Smith Jr has done for this basketball team , if they want to become great , Smith needs to be even more . He needs to become a true leader . <p> Again , we 've said this over and over . This is n't really fair . You should n't have to ask a freshman to come in , lead your team in scoring , lead your team in assists , be the face of the program and grow up faster than everyone else to take on roles that a veteran normally would take . Unfortunately for Smith , while it may not be what he knowingly signed up for , its the cards that were dealt . <p> Now Smith needs to make a decision . He can keep doing what he s doing , filling up the stat sheets and glide to a top 5 pick in the pros . Or he could take on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus money . It would n't pay off with more media hype or more mixtape views . Heck , it might not even mean any higher of a draft position . Taking on this challenge would be more personal for Smith . He s already proven that he s an elite , NBA-ready athlete . He s proven that he can electrify a college arena and rack up stats against ACC competition . What he has n't  proven is that he can be a leader who can will his team to win in any situation . That he can tweak his game to fit the needs of his team at a given moment . The question is if he s up to taking on that challenge . <p> Its easy for a guy of his ability to write off the losses and blame his teammates . Heck , he s dropping 20ppg . What are they doing ? Its not Smith who is letting the team down , but it could be him who helps them rise up . <p> This is a tough article to write because you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . You could focus on a number of areas where NC State is showing weakness and break them down and cast blame , but were writing it because we believe in Dennis Smith Jr . Not his God-given ability ( we believe in that too ) , but his mental capacity , his basketball IQ , his ability to beat odds , to work through adversity and his ability to become a leader . <p> This team is in need of a guy who is cognitive of game flow . What is a good shot in this situation ? What is a bad shot ? Who is hot ? What defense are they running , how do we attack that defense ? Where is the mismatch ? What 's the score ? Time on the clock ? <p> They need someone who can feel the momentum of the basketball game and then communicate that to his team . Not just vocally , but physically . If Smith is going to take this team over , its not going to be by putting up more points . Its going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are watching his body language . They are watching whether or not he has the confidence in them to make a play . They are watching how he defends . <p> Watch this basketball team and youll see that they are subconsciously queuing off of Smith , and right now they see a guy who is trying to do it all . All Smith is doing is what he knows how to do . Score the ball because other guys are n't  . Try to put up as many stats as he can because if he does n't  , who will ? But this can be read as a lack of confidence in his teammates . This can lead to hesitancy , or quick shots because they have n't touched it in a while and they do n't  know when the next time they will . This is a lot like the situation NC State faced with Cat Barber . He was such a good scorer that he held the ball and went one on one until he found his shot . While it worked out a lot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer were guys cutting hard or working to get open , because why waste the energy . Cat was just going to do it himself . <p> There is the gift and the curse of the new-age point guard . You get a guy who always has the ball in his hands and has tons of opportunity to score , but it also isolates the rest of the team . Again , this is not saying that Smith is hogging the basketball . He s not . He s trying to help his team win . But maybe helping them win means more ball movement , less dribbling , less isolation and more teamwork . <p> " We have to want to do it collectively , not just one or two guys . It has to be a team thing . " Terry Henderson after the GT loss <p> This is where Smith needs to feel it out . Obviously , the way this team is playing is not working . If he wants to take on the challenge of turning this thing around he s going to need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammates and holding them accountable . Tell them when they take a bad shot . Get in their face when they take a play off on defense . But none of that matters or will hold any weight if Smith is taking quick shots or letting his man go by him on defense . <p> Being a leader is hard . It means making very few mental mistakes and owning them when you do make them . Being a leader means not looking at the stat sheet and thinking " Well , I did my job . Where was my help ? " It means you are accountable when your team gives up a bucket and you are accountable when your bigs are n't  fighting on the boards . When you lose , you take it personally . Could I have defended better ? Could I have gotten in someones face about their effort ? Could I have worked the offense and set the tone any better ? <p> This is going to start with defense and body language for Smith . Literally , the only two areas where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove that when he guards somebody , that person struggles to score . He needs to show his team that when the refs miss a foul call , or he misses a shot , that it does n't  change his focus . It does n't  affect his confidence . <p> Its then going to need to move into floor leadership . Being more vocal , holding guys more accountable in the huddle . Smith can do whatever he wants to do on the floor , so what if he decided to score 14ppg but see if he could dish out 10 assists each night ? What would happen ? Were not saying it would guarantee an NC State win , but we can tell you that it would energize his teammates . It would bring the team together and it would increase their confidence . All of these things would make NC State that much more dangerous on that end of the floor . <p> Dennis Smith Jr does n't  have to do anything of these things for him to become a lottery pick . He does n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in college if he does n't  feel like it . His stat line and resume will be there at the seasons end and some NBA team will call his name and sign his check . But deep down I do n't  think any of us believe that is who Dennis Smith Jr is . He has prepared for greatness at every level of his basketball career , and its tough to believe that hell be satisfied by filling up the stat sheet if it does n't  mean filling up the win column . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> 14 Comments 73278 @qwx273278 <p> 14 Comments on " Can NC State ask any more of Dennis Smith Jr ?

@@26404606 @104606/ <h> NC State NBA D-League Roundup <p> NC State has a handful of players in the NBA D-League that are making quite an impact . There are 22 teams in the D-League as of now with more expansions in the works . NBA teams have embraced the D-League as an environment to send young players to develop their skills and conditioning . This season a total of 79 NBA players have played in the D-League , including 13 first round selections . Let 's take a look at how some NC State guys are fairing and how likely they are to be called up . <p> Scott Wood Santa Cruz Warriors 6-5 SG <p> Scott Wood received an invite from the Golden State Warriors to participate in their training camp . Wood was optioned to their D-League affiliate and has made the most of the opportunity . Averaging 14.5 PPG and leading the NBAD in made three-pointers at 102 made . The Santa Cruz Warriors play uptempo with the freedom to shoot threes in transition , and in the half-court . Scott has thrived at Santa Cruz starting all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . <p> 10 made three pointers is the Santa Cruz franchise single-game record which Wood most recently claimed . In his last three games , he has managed to make 21 three-pointers . His production of 102 made three-pointers out of 224 attempts is impressive . Not only has Wood been lights out from three but he has improved his all-around game . He has started to get to the rim to draw fouls . This season he is shooting 96.3% from the free-throw line . NBA teams will have to take notice of Woods superior shooting and should be able to claim a 10-day contract . Personally , I do not see a reason why a team would not want an inexpensive 6-5 shooter on their roster . There are not many players that can shoot the ball as efficiently as Wood . <p> CJ Williams Texas Legends 6-5 SG <p> CJ Williams had a great showing in the NBA D-League showcase scoring 32 points aginst Santa Cruz . Williams is averaging 12.5 PPG and 4 RPG . CJ has a solid all-around game showing the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as shooting the three-ball . Williams has a strong frame at 230 pounds allowing him to get to his spots . The NBA will be a tough destination for Williams ; however , if he can continue to improve his defense and playmaking he could have a shot at a 10-day contract . <p> CJ Leslie Raptors 905 6-9 F <p> Leslie is trying to improve the skills necessary to make an NBA roster . He is averaging 10.4 PPG and 5.7 RPG . CJ has prototypical size and athleticism for the NBA ; however , he has had to clean up some fundamentals . Leslie has competed more consistently on both ends of the court giving the Raptors 905 a versatile player capable of impacting the game in multiple ways . This season CJ has shown improvement in his shooting form although the numbers are not there yet , he is progressing . His release is more compact and follows through is consistent . CJ has potential it is just a matter of using his skills in a way that will peak an NBA teams interest . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to use his length and athletic ability to get stops he can be in the NBA . <p> Cat Barber Delaware 87ers 6-1 PG <p> Averaging 14.2 PPG , 3.6 RPG , and 3.9 APG Barber has been able to find ways to impact games for Delaware . Cat has elite speed and quickness that NBA teams look for but has to show he is more than just a high-volume scorer . Barber recently had a look at the 76ers as they had a roster opening but did not make the cut . Cat is still young at 22 years old and should have time to develop as a defender and playmaker . Barber will also have the chance to play overseas if he feels the need to make more money .

@@26404617 @104617/ <h> 3 Reasons State is Poised for a Run in the ACC Tournament <p> NC State has two more games left on the schedule before the ACC tournament and they are looking to make one final run . Can they do it ? Here are the reason we think they just might . <p> 1 ) Moving Markell Johnson to the point It was pretty obvious during ACC play that NC State was n't really even trying to run their offense . Dennis Smith Jr was putting up big time numbers , but his- insistence to dominate the ball at the top of the key- led to NC State looking stagnant and confused . <p> Tuesday night the NC State offense looked much better . The ball was moving from side to side , guys were getting open shots and it seemed as if this motivated them to cut harder and set better screens in order to get open . You can credit this to Johnsons play . He gets the ball down the court and immediately moves the basketball to the wing . When he does make a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing shooters to get clean inside-out looks . <p> Having Johnson on the floor did n't  hurt Smiths game either . in fact , he shot 6-13 on the night ( 46% right on his average ) while dropping 18 ( again , right on his average ) . The other argument we 've heard about playing Johnson at the point and using Smith as a 2 is that youd either have to go small with Henderson and Rowan , or you 'd have to choose between the two . Against GT , Rowan logged 37 minutes , while Henderson had 26 . And as for going small , it did n't  seem to hurt at all when the Pack did that . They ended up with a 40-28 edge on the boards . <p> 2 ) Kapita stepping in Say what you want , but Omer Yurtseven simply is not ready for the physicality of ACC basketball . Gottfried finally realized this and decided to decrease his minutes significantly . This opened up time for Kapita who has played a major role in most games that NC State has shown their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a fluctuation in playing time this season , but you could point to the fact that he does n't  really seem to grasp the offense and he gets lost on defense occasionally . At this point , those are things that really do n't  matter as much . NC State needs guys on the blocks who want to play hard and want to body up . Kapita plays with passion , fights for rebounds and is very aggressive on both ends. - Simply put , NC State needs to put the five guys on the court who are willing to battle every play . Kapita is one of those guys . <p> 3 ) Nothing left to lose You want us against the world ? Well , you 've got it . Not many people believe NC State is going to make a run . Not at this point . Not since theyve failed to really improve as the season has progressed . But do n't  count them out just yet . They really have nothing left to lose . They are n't  going to the tournament without an ACC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that is out the window . What 's left other than pride and proving to the nation that they are in fact who everyone thought theyd be at the start of the season . - <p> I know the comment section is going to be filled up with snarky remarks on how were living in a dream world and how NC State is cooked . We get it . People have been severely let down and it stings , but this team showed at GT that with a few small changes , they might be able to muster up one more run . I guess well just have to wait and see . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> 11 Comments 73278 @qwx273278 <p> 11 Comments on " 3 Reasons State is Poised for a Run in the ACC Tournament " 73281 @qwx273281 <p> 400 73282 @qwx273282 <p> 400 73282 @qwx273282 73284 @qwx273284 <p> Guest <p> wolfpack74 <p> 4 months 25 days ago <p> Poised to make a run .

That will pretty much kill any team when 3-4 year guys are n't  playing any better than year 1-2 . <p> #1 in particular was a glaring problem for me . As talented as DSJ is he seems to enjoy killing about 10-15 seconds of clock just dribbling the ball . Lack of ball movement definitely hurt the offense . Kapita hurt himself early in the season by picking up quick fouls .

Both schools are great basketball schools and both schools have great coaching staffs . I just had to choose the place where I was most comfortable .

I am sure it is a question many Wolfpack fans have been asking themselves as Turner has struggled the past couple of games , but I want to go on record and say that Ralston will have a big impact on the game tonight . A lot of attention has been given to Cat Barber and Trevor Lacey and rightfully so ; however , Ralston has n't  been off by much in the first two games of the NCAA Tournament . His shooting numbers are way down as he has gone 2-14 from distance in the Tournament thus far . <p> I am confident that Ralston will have some good looks tonight and will be prepared to knock them down . As we look back on the travesty that was the Duke game in the ACC Tournament there was n't many positives to be gained but Ralston played well . Versus Duke Ralston had 16 points and shot 60 percent from the field . I honestly think that Louisville will present a similar look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner open ; like he was against Duke . The great thing about Ralston is that he is unafraid to miss ! What do I mean ? Well we have seen Ralston miss 6 or 7 shots in a row only to make his next 5 . This trait is rare as it shows that he is mentally tough as well as confident in his abilities . I love when players display the mental fortitude to move past mistakes or missed shots only to make game altering plays minutes later . <p> Tonight we will see a great game from Ralston and he is the X-Factor who will most likely determine if NC State wins tonight . I do n't  have any predictions as to how many points he will have but I am confident in saying that he will play a great game tonight .

However , who exactly is Butch and why is he a good hire ? Let 's breakdown where he has been and how he got to NC State . <p> Playing Career : 4 years Mississippi State Bulldogs ( 1980-1984 ) - <p> Butch Pierre was a point guard for the Bulldogs and was a great defensive player who knew how to set up his team . He finished his playing career with 342 assists , landing him with 9th place all-time . In his four years at Mississippi State he learned the ins and outs of college basketball . His work ethic was recognized throughout his career and was rewarded with an assistant coaching job at Mississippi State upon graduation . <p> Coaching History : - <p> 1984-86 Assistant Coach Mississippi State <p> - 1886-88 Assistant Coach Kentucky State <p> 1988-96 Assistant Coach Southwestern Louisiana <p> 1996-97 Assistant Coach UNC Charlotte <p> 1997-02 Assistant Coach LSU <p> 2002-08 Assistant Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assistant Coach Oklahoma State <p> As evident above , Butch Pierre has been around college basketball for quite some time , and has plenty of experience coaching in competitive environments . His experience will be called upon in ACC play , as State will look to rebound from an awful 2015-2016 season . <p> While Butch was at Oklahoma State he was called upon to build their defensive scheme and philosophy . I can not think of a greater area that NC State needs help in . It is no secret that Coach Gottfrieds weakness is on the defensive side of the ball , and he has stated that they must all improve heading into next season . Expect Gottfried to call upon Pierre for assistance in building a more respective defensive unit . <p> Key recruits : - <p> Tyus Thomas <p> Glenn " big baby " Davis <p> Marcus Thorton <p> Stromile Swift <p> LeBryan- Nash <p> Marcus Smart <p> Garrett Temple <p> Anthony Randolph <p> Brandon Bass <p> Ronald Dupri <p> Jabari Smith <p> Kevin Brooks <p> In his time with LSU , Pierre helped the Tigers- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Junior College All-Americans , and 2 Junior College Players of the Year . While at Oklahoma State , he was instrumental in bringing the programs highest rated recruit , LeBryan Nash ( 4th overall ) . <p> Not only has Pierre been recognized by his peers as an excellent coach/recruiter , but Dick Vitale- named Pierre one of the top assistants in the country primed to become a head coach . <p> Moving forward : - <p> It is clear that Gottfried does n't  want to take any chances . Gottfried wants a proven commodity and Pierre fits that description beautifully . Another tidbit that I respect about Butch Pierre is that he knows the importance of education ; not only did he graduate from Mississippi State but he also earned- his Masters Degree from the Bulldogs . <p> Loyalty is evident in Pierres coaching history , as he has had long stays in both of his previous coaching jobs at Oklahoma State and LSU .

@@26404624 @104624/ <h> NC State vs UNC : Keys to the Game <p> NC State makes the short trip to Chapel Hill to take on the North Carolina Tarheels Saturday at 8 oclock . Not only will the rivalry game be front and center but so will the wintry weather . NC State comes into Saturdays game following an impressive win over Virginia Tech while UNC narrowly escaped Clemson 89-86 . What are the keys to the game for NC State to triumph over the Tarheels on Saturday night ? <p> Terry Henderson needs to be solid for NC State to win <p> Henderson has been having a great season for NC State averaging 16.2 PPG and giving Mark Gottfried a valued leader . Terry has been a welcome addition both offensively and defensively . Henderson will have his hands full this Saturday as he will most likely be called upon to guard Justin Jackson . Jackson has a height advantage over Henderson ; however , Henderson is athletic enough to make him work . Terry must be disciplined and not pick up early fouls that force Gottfrieds hand as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Dome NC State needs Henderson on the floor . Offensively Terry must be aggressive like he was aginst the Hokies . Aginst Virginia Tech Terry kept getting to his spots and fought through some early misses consequently leading him to find his rhythm . NC States offense is much more fluid when Henderson has it going . <p> Defensively NC State has to limit Carolina to one shot <p> Carolina ranks number one in the NCAA in rebounding margin at plus 14 . They also average 16.3 offensive rebounds per game which are a big reason why they average 87.9 PPG . The Wolfpack will need to box out and collectively win 50-50 balls if they are going to beat North Carolina . Malik Abu and company have to take away Kennedy Meeks who leads the Tarheels in boards per game at 9.9 . <p> The Pack needs to attack the paint <p> 62 is the number of points in the paint for NC State in their win over Virginia Tech . Malik Abu must keep being aggressive hunting for dunks and quick face-up attacks . Carolina is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to foul trouble . NC State guards need to feed the post as State has an advantage in the paint . An inside-out attack will allow NC State guards to have the needed space to create plays as well as yield open threes . The Wolfpack will need to be physical , not backing down or settling for jump shots if they are going to win Saturday . <p> Dennis Smith must allow the game to come to him <p> Joel Berry is tough and physical on defense . Berry likes to pick his man up early beyond the half court line forcing them to change directions as well as creating problems with entry passes . Smith needs to be patient and ready for this type of physical defense and be smart in attacking with the pass . He needs to trust that he will get the ball back and allow Dorn and Henderson to take pressure off of him by advancing and initiating the offense occasionally . Dennis has all the tools to beat Berry ; however , he can not embark on an individual battle of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiths complete arsenal on full display to knock off Carolina . <p> The Wolfpack are coming off their best game of the season heading into Saturdays showdown with the Tarheels . NC State must forget that performance as it has no bearing on beating Carolina . Focus and the ability to play through all circumstances will be critical for NC State to beat Roy Williams and company . The Wolfpack and the Tarheels will tip-off at 8 oclock with coverage on ESPN . <p> This game to me is a coin toss . Wolfpack are bad on the road , but unc not as good as advertised preseason . They are beatable . Would love to spank their asses in Chapel Hill . Dennis needs to continue looking for his guys . He mostly played really smart the last game . Using a combination of pump fakes , strong drives , and good passes to guys where they need the ball . 
@@26404626 @104626/ <h> Who is #1 Seed Villanova ? <p> Villanova secured a #1 seed by posting a record of 33-2 and enter the tournament on a 16 game win streak . It is like Coach Gottfried said in his post game comments , " they are a number one seed for a reason . " The way Villanova has posted such a dominating season record is by shooting lights out from beyond the arc . An astonishing 43% of their shots on the season have been from distance , and even more impressive is their team 3 point field goal percentage which is 39.2% . The Wildcats have a balanced attack as they have 4 players averaging double figures . NC State must be prepared to run the Wildcats off of the three-point line if they are going to have any chance at moving on to the sweet sixteen . But let 's take a look at Villanovas season and highlight how they have achieved a #1 seed . <p> Good Wins : - <p> The Wildcats won an impressive 13 games versus teams with a top 50 RPI . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss was equally astonishing . On the season they only lost once to a team with an RPI worst that 50 . <p> @ Seton Hall 66-61 ( January 3rd . ) <p> Recent Form : <p> In their last 12 games Villanova has gone 12-0 . In their current win streak they have managed to not only win the Big East regular season crown but also the conference tournament as well .

( 6-11 245 lbs. ) 9.4 PPG and 8.4 RPG <p> Summary : <p> Few teams can match Villanova offensively as they have an extremely deadly attack from beyond the arc . Their team boasts a handful of sharp shooters that are more than capable of wrecking a teams game plan once they make a couple of shots . Jay Wright has a great group of upper class-men that have stayed focused throughout the year . If there are a couple of weak points in Villanovas arsenal it is in their lack of size and pedestrian rebounding .

The rising senior was poised to be the catalyst for a team that many believed would open the 2015/16 season ranked in the top 15 nationally . Obviously there were a lot of broken hearts that dealt with the news in different ways . Some were angry , some were hurt , while others were happy that he would be chasing his dream of playing in the NBA , but all of them just could n't help but think it was just par for the course for the Wolfpack who seemingly have been so close to breaking through , but have fallen just short due to a number of different peculiar- circumstances . <p> But there were still a lot of questions . Was Lacey just set on leaving no matter what ? And if so , why ? Sure he s 24 years old , but it seems as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his way to peaking . As we outlined in our post season assessment of Lacey , he was great in many areas , but had room to grow . He played this season at a higher weight than he would have liked , he was still rounding into form as a vocal leader , and he could still improve has ability to score on the drive to keep defenders from committing to stopping his pull up . Lacey is an elite player , but he s not a finished product . This is why the news that he was declaring for the NBA was tough to understand . But maybe it was a matter of semantics that had Pack fans so perplexed . <p> Lacey reportedly told PackPride that he was n't necessarily gone for good . Here is their tweet : <p> NC State guard @TrevorLacey5 says that he has n't  signed with an agent . He could test NBA waters and return like CJ Leslie did after soph yr . <p> Now this does n't  mean he s coming back , but it does make a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NBA , this new break in the story- seems to imply- that he did not file paper work with the NBA officially declaring . Had he done that he would have not been able to return . By not filing that paperwork and by not hiring an agent Lacey keeps himself eligible through late April ( 26th or 29thcant find the exact date ) . This gives him time to get information from scouts , work out for teams and figure out where hed slot in the draft . <p> ( However if he DID file paper work and officially declared , then he is confused about rules- and he s officially goneand if that 's the case you can stop reading now . ) <p> Right now many projections have him going undrafted , which means hed have to catch on as a free agent or sign a deal overseas .

His two years at Alabama did not go as planned and then the transfer year off had him out of sight and out of mind for many NBA scouts . He had quite the showing this past season , but there were some stretches where he was going through adjustments and were marked down as flaws in his game . As good as he was this season , I think it was a learning year for him and the potential for a full on break out is in the cards should he return . <p> With the news that he s keeping the door open , it seems as if it will come down to his workouts and what the scouts have to say .

Anya , Freeman , and Abu played well and consistently play within themselves . Kyle sometimes has a tendency to play outside of the team given his aggressive nature on the offensive end . As he learns to play within his strengths I am confident that he will gain some of his minutes back . Most importantly for this team is to play to our strengths and not do too much .

guard who will be suiting up for Oak Hill to conclude his final two seasons of prep basketball . - This could be great news for Gottfried as he has had success in recruiting kids from Oak hill . - Most recently Cody and Caleb Martin , but also Tyler Lewis . - Let 's breakdown Shulers game and see what he could bring to the Wolfpack . <p> Offensively : - <p> Shuler excels at getting to the rim by utilizing a wide variety of hesitations , in-and-out dribbles , and mixing up his finishes . - One thing that Devontae does that is way beyond his years ( he is a rising junior ) is that he uses the rim to shield the ball which allows him to finish with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play in the open court , he is very fluid and has amazing body control . - He is capable of contorting himself to slither through double teams and big enough to absorb contact and still convert . <p> Playing at Oak Hill will help Shuler develop better play-making abilities through passing . - With his age he has n't  had much of an opportunity to play-make , as he as been looked upon to shoulder so much of the scoring load . - By playing with more talented players he should have more opportunities to be a true point guard ; however , I think he may be best suited as a combo guard . - He reminds me a lot of Trevor Lacey in his ability to create his own shot , and in the way he is built . - Check out Devontaes moves below : <p> One thing you will notice in the video is he is great at changing speeds , he is very comfortable at lulling his defender to sleep and then he bursts out of his moves . - This is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of guys- because he understands this principle . - I would say he is an above average athlete , but his understanding of pace makes him extremely difficult to defend . <p> Defensively : - <p> As good as Shuler is offensively he still has a lot of work to do on the defensive end . - He is not a terrible defender by any means , but he is prone to reaching and gambling unnecessarily . - This should n't shock anyone as he has n't  even started his junior season , and I am sure Oak Hill will demand more effort and teach Devontae the keys to being a great defender . - One thing he has going for him is the fact that he plays hard ! - He competes on defense . <p> https : //youtu.be/94Qks2q3gns <p> As you can see Shuler gambles at times and is beaten by his man , but this does n't  stop him from trying . - At the 50 second mark he picks Seventh Woods pocket and finishes a nifty layup which was contested . <p> Intangibles : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental prospective . - He knows how to use angles and pace in order to beat his defender . - By bringing that cerebral approach to the game you can tell that it rubs off on his teammates. - In the tape that I have watched it is clear that he is a coach on the court , he tries to teach his teammates throughout the game . - More importantly they respond to him because he does it in a way that is not berating them or talking down to them . - These are qualities that coaches love in players because all players need to be teachable . <p> Improvement : - <p> A couple things that Devontae needs to work on are defense and his play-making. - At the next level he will need to be able to play the point guard position at times which will require him to initiate the offense and get his teammates involved . - Thus far I have n't seen great court vison from him and he is prone to getting tunnel vision for his own shots , but its hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he plays with Oak Hill , where he will be surrounded by upper echelon talent . - He will have more opportunity at getting others involved as he will not be asked to shoulder as much of the scoring load . <p> Defensively he needs to brush up on his fundamentals of how to defend the pick and roll . - He must stop playing pick and rolls indecisively. - Sometimes he is unsure if he should go under or over the top . - This will improve with experience as well as scouting reports . - Lastly he will have to stop reaching in. - Defense is played with your feet not your hands . - Once again this should improve over time . <p> Summary : - <p> Watching Shuler play one can easily see why he is so coveted . - Things appear easy for Devontae on the offensive end as he is smooth with the ball and strong enough to finish in the paint . - Not only is he great inside the paint but has to be respected with his ability to knock down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously awaiting his season at Oak Hill to start , as it will give a more accurate sample of what we can expect from Devontae as he plays against top talent . - One thing that I love about Shuler is that he has lots of room for improvement . - He has tons of upside and should start to unearth some of this upside under Steve Smith at Oak Hill . - Time will tell if Gottfried can gain the commitment of Shulerit will probably be a while before a commitment comes from him .

For many teams this would be the toughest game they 've played all season , but not the Wolfpack . With the ACC so strong this season State has faced both Duke and Virginia twice , two teams who are arguably better than Villanova this season . So its not like State is going to come out and just be overwhelmed by talent , however Nova poses a threat that is a little unique . This is a team that has dominant guards . A team that has shoots the ball very well and is completely unselfish . They are a tough matchup , but actually are kind of similar to State . Here are our keys to the Wolfpack pulling off the upset . <p> Handle Their GuardsThis is really the biggest thing . Nova relies Dylan Ennis , Darrun Hilliard , and Ryan Arcidiacono . Ennis is the guy that creates . He s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He will certainly guard Lacey and at 62 could really bother him . Hilliard is the scorer . He s averaging 14ppg and can score in a variety of ways . The 66 senior is certainly going to be a tough guard for NC State . He can shoot is over top and he can use his size to take to the rim . Stopping Hilliard needs to be priority for Gottfried and company . After that you have Arcidiacono . He s averaging 10ppg and 4 boards . He too is shooting around 38% and can really heat up of he gets going . Those 3 guys are a handful , but that 's not all their guards . Aside form these main three you have sixth man Josh Hart . Hart is another one of these giant guards . He s 65 and is also averaging 10ppg . He does n't  shoot a ton of 3s , but hell light you up if you do n't  watch out . He s hitting 47% from outside . <p> So as you see this is a team of big guards that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are good , but State has some pretty good guards themselves . One thing Lacey and Turner will have to do is keep the Nova backcourt out of the lane . Ralston has had trouble keeping guys in front of him and if that happens here you might see a little more of the Martins in this one . <p> On offense State is going to have to move the basketball . So often State is trying to go one on one and isolate Lacey . Nova is too big for Lacey to do that and their length is going to make it hard for Turner to get clean looks . One guy that could have - huge game is Cat Barber . The uber-quick PG is a mismatch for Nova , who really does n't  have anyone to match his speed . Hell need to get into the lane and create havoc if - State wants a chance to win this . <p> Win the Front Court Battle This is where State COULD surprise some people . Nova has the experienced bigs in Pinkston and Ochefu , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right time . Abu is becoming a go-to guy in the post with his athleticism and physicality and you better believe Anya is feeling real confident after his game winner . But an x-factor here is Kyle Washington . The sophomore finally got back in the swing of things last game and gave the Pack a boost they sorely needed . This team really need Kyles intensity , hustle and ability to bring their bigs out of paint with this jumpers . He adds a different dimension to the Wolfpack and if he has a big night , Nova may not have an answer . <p> Play With Fire The Pack ca n't come out lackadaisical like they did against LSU .

@@26404700 @104700/ <h> Our Take : NC States weaknesses surface in loss to Miami <p> NC State fell to Miami in their ACC opener 81-63 . The story was somewhat simple . Miamis veterans knew what to expect and how to prepare , and NC States young guys did not . The youthfulness of the Wolfpack was glaring , and before they could recover , the game was already out of hand . Let 's take a look at the specifics . <p> Lack of Leadership Miamis vets ( Reed , Murphy and Newton ) combined for 52 points and answered the bell every time NC State rang it . On the other side , NC State looked shell-shocked . Instead of running the offense and getting good shots , they decided to go one on one and try to win it that way . That 's not going to work in the ACC . Miami owned the pace of play and the overall basketball game . If you 're wondering where improvements can be expected , I think its obvious . Dennis Smith Jr . is , whether its fair or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s only a freshman , he is the one whose voice , body language , and style of play matters and sets the tone for his teammates . He is still learning this part of the game.There is a fine line that Smith will find eventually , between " Coach on the floor " and " take-over scorer , " however , well just have to wait as he work this out . <p> Note : Smith did have 21 points and 5 assists , so he did n't  play bad on paper , however as we 've said in the past , Smith is a kid who is judged on a different scale ( again , fair or not ) , and the intangibles he shows will be the difference between a competitive NC State team , or one that 's lost in the shuffle . <p> Soft in the Paint First off , let 's say this . Abu ( 11pts , 9 rebounds ) was the lone bright spot in this game and it was a shame that the team went away from feeding this guy the ball . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . As for Yurtseven ( 5 pts , 4 boards in 24 mins ) , he we cruelly welcomed to the ACC . It was men against boys in there , and as harsh as that fact may be , Yurt was abused with physicality . You ca n't fault the kid since this is literally the first- decent opponent that he s faced in college , but if he s going to be the x-factor for NC State and get big time minutes , he s going to have to learn to love contact , and fast . He s a very skilled , very intelligent player , so I 'm positive that he is pouring over the film and plotting a better performance next time out . <p> The downside of a soft scheduleYou ca n't say that we did n't  warn you . Weve talked extensively about NC States scheduling . We have laid out the good and the bad . The fact that this team will have a pretty easy time in the non-conference as they learn to play together , but be rudely awakened in ACC play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , we said to expect a slow start before figuring it out right before ACC play , then a slight dip ( adjustment period ) in ACC play , before the team peaks mid-ACC season . Well see how that goes , but so far that is exactly what has happened . <p> The team simply was not ready for the physicality , the road game hostility , and the level of efficiency that comes with ACC play . They had been running through teams recently and thought they could simply play their way and win . That proved to not be the casewhich bring us to the next point . <p> Learning Lessons the Hard Way is Part of the PlanSome of you guys give Gottfried a really unfair shake , IMO . The thing is , if you expect Gott to simply take teams and have them peaking in November and sustaining that level of play until March , then yes , you have grounds for complaining . But , name a coach outside of maybe 2 or 3 elite guys who can do that with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't paid attention to Gottfrieds coaching style , its very player-centric . He is not a Bobby Knight , shove it down your throat , my way or the highway type coach . And to be honest with you , that type of Coach is rarely successful in todays game . Like it or not , kids have the decision now and they will choose a player-centric coach nearly every single time over a disciplinarian . Now , there are those who know what it takes to be great and want a coach who breaks them down from day one in order to build them back up , but those players are few and far between . You see the 2 or 3 of them coming out of HS every year going to UNC , Duke , Kentucky , or Kansas ( more established programs ) . <p> So- if you are Gottfried , what do you do ? Be a disciplinarian with kids who do n't  want to be disciplined and have the option of transferring out ? That 's simply a recipe for disaster . Sure you end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do you have enough talent to take on Duke and UNC , who have teams that are both bought in and uber-talented ? The answer is no and literally the situation Herb Sendek found himself in at NC State . <p> Instead , Gottfried takes a different approach . He brings in talented kids and gives them a chance to do it their way , and they respect that . Its why he lands a lot of the guys he s brought in . Sure , they have an offense and are being coached , but Gottfried let 's his teams take their lumps before laying down the hammer . <p> Its called learning the hard way and its why his teams historically peak in February and March . If you want to understand this you have to be able to remember back to when you were a child . It did n't  matter what your mom or dad told you , you werent going to listen because you knew how to do it . This led to learning many lessons the hard way.

Now , eventually hell have a group of veterans who take his way , make it theirs , and pass it down to the underclassmen .

We need to stop using that as an excuse when you have the talent that we have even in our freshmen . Do you hear any other top programs using that . We do have 3-4 Freshmen that get a lot of time but they are good ! They could have gone to any other program and been a starter . Plus we have 2-3 great vets ( Henderson , Dorn , and Abu ) <p> That 's technically one of many excuses . NVM the fact that pretty much every team has to deal with turnover . Especially when you recruit high level talent and have a lot of transfers each season . Initially it was " he does n't  have his own guys yet " , then its the team is too young , and of course blaming it on how good our neighbors are . Why even play then ?

Fanning dropped 21 on UConn and is averaging over 16ppg right now .

The sophomore shooter has been sorely missed , but that may change today . Gottfried said he was hoping to have Mav back in this game , but still was not 100% sure on if hed be cleared . <p> Getting Rowan back would be a big plus for NC State . They have missed his experience , his shooting and his ability to score in the mid-range . Lately the Pack has mostly been relying on drives to the rim or 3 pointers . It will be nice to have a big guard like Rowan who can exploit mismatches and score from multiple areas on the floor . Let 's hope he suits up <p> On Torin Dorn If NC State is going to beat Boston University , they are likely once again going to be leaning or Torin Dorn . Dorn has been great and really is coming on as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say glue guy you are talking about a player who is n't a super talent , but maybe is a hustle player who is good for team chemistry .

Gottfried also had these guys looking really good , and really active in a matchup zone that gave Barton fits . It was a promising showing for the new-look Wolfpack , but what stood out most was the team chemistry and the willingness to share the basketball . If this team can continue to play this brand of basketball , the sky is the limit . <p> This concludes the exhibition games .

NC State has fallen to 1-3 in ACC play after their loss to Boston College on Wednesday night . <p> If you listen to social media or message boards , then you 're left to believe that Gottfried is on his way out , this team has no chance and the season might as well be over . If you listen to Gottfried and his players , the narrative is quite different . The team improved . According to the coaches , NC State got a little bit better despite the loss because they fought through adversity and showed more will and want-to . <p> The truth is probably somewhere in the middle . NC State did do some things better in this game . The defensive pressure for most of the game was good . The hustle was there , however , communication on defense still left a lot to be desired .

Markell Johnson may have earned himself some minutes last night as he showed that he can coexist with Smith on the floor . This left Torin Dorn getting only 2 minutes in the 2nd half . Dorn has seemingly fallen in love with the jumper and it has ended up hurting his efficiency and scoring ability . <p> State also struggled in the paint . Yurtseven is simply not ready for ACC basketball . As harsh as it may seem , he is just too weak right now . He is getting pushed around and has shown very little aggressiveness or confidence over the conference season . Anya played well , but when he is on the floor the team is slower and more stagnant , at times they have to pull the ball back and wait for him to get down the court .

Kapita is still raw , and while he certainly works hard and is aggressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So what do you make of this ? Well , its hard to tell . Some of the blame certainly falls on Gottfried and company . This team is young , but mentally they are unprepared .

At the end of the day , these are guys who have the skills , yet mental mistakes , poor shots and lack of focus lead to them not getting everything they could out of themselves . <p> This season is far from over . The Pack obviously is not ready to compete on the road in this league quite yet . The good news is that with every game they grow up a little and the next 3 games are at home .

@@26404731 @104731/ <h> Gameday : NC State Looks To Regroup Against GT <p> NC State needs to get back on track and fast . The Pack has fallen to 13-9 and 4-5 in the ACC . While none of their losses have been bad ( RPI wise ) the guys need to start winning again if they want to be a lock in March . Todays game will be the first step in that direction . <p> What 's the Lineup ? Since Cody Martin has entered the Wolfpack starting lineup , the team has gone 1-3 . At the surface you 'd think its obvious that you need to put Cat back into the starting PG role , but look a closer and that might not be the case . In 2 of those 3 losses NC State was up by 18 or more early in the first half . In both of those games NC State started off very strong , but then lost their way . I think keeping Cody in the starting lineup is something Gottfried should stick with , but I think its playing with the lead that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lead GT is one of the worst teams in the league this season . They sit at 1-7 in the league and have just not been able to get anything going thus far . Its likely that the Pack is going to get a decent lead at some point today ( barring a repeat of that Clemson game last week ) . When they get that lead they need to learn how to play with it . In the recent games theyve dominated early the equation has been obvious . They are working inside-out and focusing on getting Abu in the paint . In the two games they did this , Abu got in foul trouble on the other end and they were forced to go with a different line up . This is when things fell apart . They can not abandon that type of play . They need to feed their bigs and allow their guards to play off of that . Teams are keying on Lacey and Turner and its making it hard for them to get off .

A big reason is that they do n't  have anyone attacking . Abu is doing it and he is getting to the line and the Martins have been on occassion doing it as well . Lacey has the ability to do it and so does Washington but those two lean on their jumpers a little too much . Of course , their jumpers are a big part of their games and should not be abandoned , but when you jump out to big leads you cant just sit back and shoot it , you have to put the pressure on the defense , wear them down and get to the line for some free points . <p> Now or NeverState deserpeately needs these next two games .

We live in a world with short attention spans , so remembering who a player is that sits on the bench in a suit every game is rather difficult . <p> So the question of 2015 is " Who is Terry Henderson ? " <p> Henderson is a 64 ? shooting guard that played high school ball in Raleigh at Neuse Christian Academy , who he led to 4 state championships . He was a 3-star recruit that was recruited by NC States Mark Gottfried , but never received an offer from the Wolfpack . He inevitably chose to commit to West Virginia over offers from Georgia , Maryland , Virginia Tech , Miami , Rutgers , Richmond , George Mason and others . <p> While at West Virginia , he made an instant impact . As a freshman , he averaged 20 minutes per game , and started in 11 contests. - He proved to be dangerous from three , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged 8 points per game . As a sophomore , he averaged 27 minutes per game , and started in 17 contests . Henderson averaged 11.7 points per game , and shot 37.6% from three-point land and 84.8% from the charity stripe . <p> In two seasons for the Mountaineers , Henderson averaged 9.8 points per game , while shooting 38.7% from three and 81.6% from the free throw line . He did this against some of the best talent in the country , facing Big 12 opponents . <p> If you 're not a numbers person , you might be wondering what to make of Terry Hendersons stats . Let 's compare his numbers to two other former NC State guards that were also transfers . Ralston Turner averaged 10.5 points per game at LSU in two years before transferring , but only shot 34.6% from three . Trevor Lacey averaged 9.4 points per game and shot 34.6% from deep in two years at Alabama . I cant guarantee what Henderson will do on the court this year , but from a statistical standpoint , Henderson comes to NC State as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this point in their careers . <p> When Henderson decided to transfer , Gottfried was able to recruit him again , and he said in his summer press conference that he regretted not doing so more back when he was in high school . Henderson ultimately chose NC State over Maryland and Richmond . <p> Like Turner and Lacey , Henderson brings instant experience to the wing position for the Pack . Take a look at this video of some of his high school highlights . You 'll see that he is more than a spot shooter , and actually brings more bounce and athleticism to the wing position than NC State has had in a couple of years .

So what are the keys to the game for NC State ? <p> 1 . Attack the rim <p> NC State needs to move the ball side to side and attack the rim with purpose , by getting the ball inside they will be able to overmatch the Cowboys . Malik Abu and Omer Yurtseven will have a tremendous advantage on the interior as McNeese State will not be able to match up with their size and skill . Dennis Smith and company need to exploit this advantage early by getting the ball inside . NC State had great success aginst Fairfield by running their offense inside out which yielded a high shooting percentage from three . <p> 2 . NC State needs to leverage their size advantage on defense <p> The Cowboys lack size , NC State needs to use their size and athletic guards to smother and force them into contested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wolfpack should be able to score quickly in the open court . Jamaya Burrs quickness allows him to penetrate ; however , NC States guards must take the challenge to prevent this . Burr will test Dennis Smiths discipline on defense because he will have to be in a stance to keep him from driving . The Pack should be able to notch another stress-free win as they use their size to overwhelm the Cowboys . <p> 3 . Dennis Smith needs to continue getting everyone else involved <p> Dennis Smith is the only NC State player to score in double figures every game this season ; however , he must keep getting others involved . In his last two games he is averaging 19.5 PPG , 7.5 APG , and shooting 61% from the field . The addition of Omer Yurtseven has helped Smith because he creates space and does the little things off the ball . Recently , Smith has been efficient since he has been crisp in calling his own number or deferring to his teammates . By allowing Henderson , Abu , and Dorn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game progresses . Experience will help Smith find the right balance of scoring and distributing . <p> 4 . Be decisive and continue to play <p> By not hesitating NC State has started to gain some continuity on offense that has led to some efficient scoring . Terry Henderson must build upon his last game as he was surgical in his offensive moves aginst Fairfield . Gottfried had to like Henderson attempting 6 free throws in addition to hitting threes . NC States big men made quick decisions in the post and tallied 9 dimes on the day . McNeese State will not stand a chance of winning especially if State continues to react in their offensive sets . <p> Yurtseven not fitting in well enough to defeat Miami . Mav looks to be coming around quickly . Love the jumping ability of Kirk . He needs to work with the first team more . His defense is picking up but looses focus sometimes . <p> I feel like even when Yurt7 is n't filling up the stat sheets his presence on the court helps spacing and gets guys better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rebounds and tipped it to another teammate . That ball entering the paint and not immediately becoming a turnover has been a huge difference since Yurt7 became eligible . <p> I liked how Mav played this game . The big difference was that he was getting clean looks at the basket . Last season he had to force up a lot of contested shots and I think that led to some inconsistent shooting nights . <p> Kirk wont get better coming off the bench with a minute left in the game . Luckily the large lead allowed him to get in early this game but yeah he should be getting more minutes . It was funny to see him jack up a 3 as soon as he got in with no rebounders under the basket . That 's what guys do when they do n't  know when theyll see the court again . <p> The key for me is Yurt7 staying out of foul trouble and staying in the game .

@@26404762 @104762/ <h> Our Take : On NC States rout of Fairfield 99-78 <p> Another game of NC State at full strength , another impressive win . The Wolfpack used big games from Terry Henderson and Dennis Smith Jr to topple the Stags 99-78 . <p> Better spacing - leads to hot shooting night NC State shot 53% from the floor and 52% from 3 point range in the victory . Henderson hit 6-10 from beyond the arc ( finished with 25pts ) - and Dennis Smith went 5-7 from 3point range ( finished with 17 points ) . You also had Abu going 6-9 from the field , Yurtseven going 6-11 and Dorn going 3-6 . <p> So yeah , you get the point . The team was hitting their shots . But this was more than a team that had a good night , it was the product of good , clean , open looks . You are starting to see just how valuable Omer Yurtseven is . All of the sudden the team is dying to dump it down to him or find him in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playmaker . He s not a black hole in the post . Yurt is catching the ball and reading the situation . Most of the time he s drawing attention and kicking it out for open shots , but sometimes if the help is late , he s making them pay by scoring . <p> This type of point-center brings an entirely new wrinkle to the Wolfpack offense and literally changes this basketball team . The spacing and opportunity that this kid is creating just with his presence is enough to make nights like this not so surprising . <p> Abu showing signs- of resurgenceWeve been admittedly hard on Malik Abu this season . I mean , its not like his stats have been bad at all , its just that Abu has NBA level talent , and he has the ability to literally take over the game on the inside . But this season , we 've seen him turn into more of a midrange shooter and someone who is not as interested- in mixing it up physically in the paint . We wondered if it was him trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showcase his jumper a little more . <p> Whatever it was , it seems like he s done with it and back to beasting . Sure , he still took a few midrange jumpers , and you know what , he s actually making them this season , so you cant complain . However , in this one , we saw him start really playing more physical . He attacked the rim and played a little more with his back to the basket at times . This versatility is what makes him so special . He needs to show teams he can abuse them in the paint , and then step out every now and then to flash his jumper. - With Yurtseven in the fold , it allows Abu to play his natural position and really gives him much more space to work . Offensively it was good to see him attacking and playing in the role that he s been so successful with in his year at NC State . <p> It was n't only on offense where we thought Abu looked better . It was also on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finishing with a team-high 8 . Overall , a big step forward for Malik in this one.Roles are starting to be definedThe keys to this season are going to be less about wins and losses at this point , and more about improvements and team building . This year Gottfried has a young team with very little true veteran leadership . The good news is that the schedule has been pretty easy . This is giving the team time to figure themselves out , find their roles , and get used to playing together . <p> With the team back at full strength , you are starting to see real roles emerge . Smith Jr is fitting in nicely as a lead guard who can and will score . He is really getting good at picking his spots and scoring within the flow . Henderson and Dorn have really not had too much trouble figuring out their roles . Henderson seems to have taken a little more of a scoring role as of late , and Dorn , who started the season red-hot , has since taken his foot off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their shot totals and final scoring numbers- but make no mistake , both are probably going to be near the top of the scoring leaders at seasons end . <p> Rowan is still a wild card at this point . Not so much a wild card in the sense of you do n't  know what he s gong to give you . I think that is very clear . I think its still to be seen how much he s relied upon to score. - Right now he s coming off of a 3 week hiatus ( due to concussion ) , and is being eased back into shape . In his absence , NC State has gotten big time minutes from Henderson , Dorn and Smith . Rowan at full strength will just add another capable scorer to the mix . The key is that it does n't  seem like anyone is going to have to shoulder the load as the go-to guy . Smith , Dorn , Henderson and Rowan can all give you elite scoring numbers on a given night . <p> Markell Johnson is seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected and it has nothing to do with his play . The kid is an absolute stud and going to be someone who is a major role player on this basketball team . He s going to slot in a lot more as a backup to Smith and a little less alongside Smith . There will be times when the two play together ( esp . if Smith keeps scoring like he is ) , but with Dorn , Henderson and Rowan playing well , Johnson becomes a 6th or 7th man who brings energy off the bench and heady , athletic floor leader who if it werent for Smith , woudl be the Packs lead guard . <p> In the front court , you are seeing the rotation start to become clear . Yurtseven is such a game changer that he s already seeing major minutes and becoming a major part of the offense . He is going to be the guy in the paint . Then you have Abu . The more Abu shows he can dominate the boards and attack the rim , the more minutes he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anya playing better as of late , Abu is still in a sense , fighting for minutes . If , however , Abu plays like he did against Fairfield then its pretty obvious that he s going to be a guy who State relies upon to lead them on the boards and be their workhorse in the paint . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> Gott better start thinking beyond this season . Dennis , Yurt7 , and Terry are probably gone after this season . He better start giving Shaun Kirk more minutes before we lose another kid to transfer . Markell , Kirk , Kapita , and Hicks are the core of the future . <p> No , Gott need to think about this season . Next season is next season . We need to focus on maximizing the talent we have this season . next season roster is way on the bottom in our priority list .

When they kicked it out to shooters , they simply failed to knock down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed them to dictate pace . <p> Luckily for the Wolfpack , a late surge by Torin Dorn and a consistent attack from Terry Henderson was enough to give them the 2 point victory , but it was n't before the flaws of this team were exposed . While many might feel a bit uneasy after game 1 , we feel as if this was exactly the type of game this team needed . Let 's see why <p> Learning to play at a slower pace Through much of the exhibition season , NC State was able to get on the break and use their athleticism to overpower teams . Georgia Southern used a- series of traps to slow down the Wolfpack . This really took the advantage away from Dennis Smith Jr and Torin Dorn , who flourish in space . The Eagles made them attack in 1/2 court sets , and they were much less effective . <p> This is good news for NC State . They have now seen how teams may play them and they can gameplan for that . For instance , late in the game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of taking contested shots , they started forcing the issue and attacking off the dribble . They got to the line , they got the Eagles defense shifting , opening up easy baskets in the paint and , in the end , got them their 2 point victory . <p> Learning how to play against a team that packs the middle is huge , since most teams cant match up athletically with the Pack . This means they likely will see a lot of zone and junk defenses , as teams do all they can to keep Dennis Smith Jr slowed down and off the break . <p> Coping with their frontcourt situation , and learning how to trust their bigs With Yurtseven still 8 games out from being eligible , the Pack is going to need to learn how to deal with what they have . On Friday night they were forced into a situation where they should have been trusting their bigs . Early on , the Pack guards tried to shoot their way out of the packed-in defenses . But after a while , it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were going to have to go through their bigs . <p> Gottfried tried a bunch of different lineups , some big , some small , but at no point did NC State really attack with their big men . As much as you want him to be a beast on the blocks , Abu still tends to be the most comfortable in the 8-10 ft range . His back to the basket game still needs some work , but he certainly has the build and talent to exploit smaller teams . <p> This game really showed that if this team is going to be as versatile as they can , they are still missing the physical and classic back to the basket big man . Yutseven will be a big addition when he gets back , but until they , what is State going to do ? <p> Well , the addition of Ted Kapita is going to be big . The freshman 4 star is now eligible and he is the huge , physical presence that they missed last night . Allowing him and Abu to be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in fixing the situation . <p> On defense and on the boards , NC State showed that they might not be where they envisioned. - With Beejay Anya still not really be able to say on the floor ( whether it be stamina or foul issues ) , Abu and Hicks were the only guys to turn to . Abu had 11 boards , but Anya and Hicks combined for 3 boards in 17 minutes . When teams take away States athletic advantage , they need to be able to turn to their bigs for a boost , both on offense and defense . On Friday night , they did n't  and it nearly cost them . <p> The harsh realization that this team is young You can have all the talent in the world , but it never makes up for experience , and that showed on Friday night . When things were going good , the Wolfpack looked confident and crisp . But when things started to veer off course , the gameplan started to fall apart . <p> Some wanted to point blame , but how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith Jr , was playing just his first college game of his career . While he s racking up accolades in the preseason , Smith is still just a freshman . That showed in this one , for sure . Smith did n't  look rattled , but he did look out of sync . He seemed to be trying to figure out his role with this team and there is nothing wrong with that . <p> Some pointed to Smith , wondering why he was n't more aggressive . The fact is , the kid is still feeling out his situation . Everyone praised Smith for his team-first mentality and his pass-first style of play , and while that is needed , there is going to be times when State needs Smith to take over basketball games . You could see that he was wrestling with his role . He took a few shots , missed and decided to go into distribution mode . Obviously , the fact that he shot only 3-13 from the floor played into it , but near the end of the game you saw Smith start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he needed to force his way into the lane and make plays in traffic.Its going to take a few games for this team to really feel comfortable together and for Smith to feel out when he should be a distributor and when he should take the game into his own hands . <p> This is all a growing process for this Wolfpack team . Most of these guys have never suited up for NC State , and some have never played a college basketball game in their life . Sure , they are talented but chemistry and teamwork are things that are built . An offseasn and some practices are n't  going to get you there . its going to take game like this one for this team to get a true grasp of who they are and what they are capable of . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> 2 Comments 73278 @qwx273278 <p> 2 Comments on " Our Take : NC State Sneaks By Georgia Southern In Opener " <p> I thought Torin picking up the 2 quick fouls turned the game early .

@@26404822 @104822/ <h> Getting to Know Appalachian State <p> NC State will face Appalachian State this Thursday night at the PNC at 7PM . Here are 5 things to know before tip-off : <p> 1 . Appalachian State has played a tough schedule <p> The Mountaineers have not shied away from playing tough teams to start the season . They have played the likes of Tennessee , Davidson , UNC Charlotte , and Duke . The tough slate is a big reason why they are 3-5 on the season . App State is dangerous despite their 3-5 record . Averaging 82 points per game on the season , and scoring 116 in their last game , making 40 field goals ( 16 three-pointers ) , on 30 assists . App State will have plenty of confidence following their most recent result . <p> 2 . Ronshad Shabazz leads this team with 15.5 points per game <p> Standing 6-5 and weighing 217 pounds the sophomore guard is a handful on the wing . He has proven in his young career that he can score against any team , last season he hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sportscenters top 10 for a vicious dunk he threw down on Brice Johnson . Adding fuel to the fire for Shabazz this Thursday night will be the fact that he grew up in the Raleigh area as he attended Knightdale High School . The Lefty has a diverse skillset and must be accounted for on every possession , the Mountaineers look for him to get them going . <p> 3 . Defense is not their specialty <p> Opponents have scored on average 73.9 points per game against the Mountaineers . One thing of note is that App State has played some tough teams that have inflated this average , Tennessee and Duke both scored over 90 points against them . <p> 4 . After Shabazz , the Mountaineers have balanced scoring options <p> Shabazz leads the team at 15.5 points per game , after him , they have 6 players averaging 7 or 8 points per game . This is unique to have such equality among scoring averages , this allows them to move the ball and play freely knowing that so many guys can knock down shots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the coaching position <p> Coach Fox arrived in Boone in 2014 and has spent the past two years rebuilding . Prior to his time at App State , Fox was a long time assistant at Davidson under coach Bob McKillop . In his 13 seasons at Davidson he helped them achieve great success . Coach Fox is widely regarded as an excellent tactician and a guy who gets the most out of his players . Come Thursday night App State will be prepared to take on NC State . <p> I think its important to point out that two of their three wins came from playing division II schools . Coincidentally , those were the only two games in which they scored over 100 points . Not saying they are n't  capable of putting up points ( ie. 94 at Tennessee ) but the number is slightly skewed as they have only one division I win this year .

Finding the right combination <p> Gottfried needs to lock in his lineup and decipher which combination of players gives the Pack the best chance to win . Maverick Rowan returns after his 7 game absence , it will be critical to reinsert him back into the rotation . One player who has benefited from Rowans absence is Markell Johnson , who has played over 20 minutes in each game since . After tomorrows game , Gottfried will have to learn how to integrate Omer Yurtseven into the lineup , as he will be eligible- following tomorrows contest . <p> 2 . Maverick Rowan is back <p> Gottfried spoke about the benefits of having another player- who can come up with a basket when needed . Rowan- should help NC State in this arena , even- thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on offense , as he- can help space the floor from beyond the arc . The added space should help Smith and company get into the lane . NC State should have more options to play small with Rowans size , - as- he showed- more willingness to attack the glass in the first game of the season . Do n't  expect too much from Mav too soon though , as it will take some time to get his legs back . <p> 3 . Use the energy of Reynolds to jump on Tigers early <p> Playing in Reynolds should give the Pack a little boost , the smaller confines should help the crowd to have more of an impact . State must stop allowing lesser quality team to hang around all game . The Packs goal for these games should be to have a big lead at half , and increase that lead each media time out . The lack of energy and effort is holding this group back . If they can expend the same amount of energy as they would if they were playing Duke or UNC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rebound the basketball <p> Tennessee State attacks the glass and secures defensive rebounds , this allows them to get extra chances and prevents teams from having extra chances . Personally , I want to see everyone find a man and box them out ; just because we play small does n't  give us an excuse to not rebound . Our leaders must speak up and demand everyone do their part . Wayne Martin and the Tigers take pride and gain momentum from- stealing offensive rebounds , State must neutralize this . <p> 5 . Defense <p> It takes time to develop the communication and experience of a sound defensive team . I realize this , - however , the team needs to put forth- a true concerted- effort . Thus far on the season , NC State is allowing 78.1 points per game . The good news is , the team has no where to go but up . It has got to start with the heart . Defense is about scheme and technique , but it usually boils down to competitive desire to stop ones opponent . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , however , think how much more efficient this group could become if they were forcing some easy turnovers to get into the open court ? Tomorrow , State will find itself almost at full strength , and we must start gaining momentum before conference play . <p> Be sure to make it out to see the Pack play in historic Reynolds , tip off is slated for 4PM . <p> This was a rough game to watch , and the first half statistics showed . But the positive I can point to is that this team actually showed some fire and passion in the 2nd half . This Tennesee State team was actually pretty good but make no mistake this was a team State had to beat . But with the youth , the injuries , Yurtseven being out and a variety of issues .

@@26404833 @104833/ <h> With Caleb and Rowan Struggling , Where does NC State Turn ? <p> The problem Gottfried faces When Trevor Lacey decided to forego his senior season it left a gaping hole in the NC State offense . Lacey was supposed to be States go to scorer , best shooter and team leader . Without him they were left relying on transfer Terry Henderson . Henderson is an athletic 2 guard who can score off the bounce and also fill it up from 3 point range . He was n't supposed to totally fill Laceys shoes , but he was supposed to play his role . <p> Unfortunately for State , Henderson suffered a serious ankle injury in the first game of the season and has been sidelined ever since . This has forced Gottfrieds hand in relying on sophomore Caleb Martin and freshman Mav Rowan as his secondary scorers . <p> What has been the outcome ? While Caleb delivered some big games early on and looked to be a nice stop gap until Henderson returned , he s since gone ice cold . This opened up the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorer . While he s had some great games himself , he s a freshman and has been hurt by poor shot selection as he assimilates to the college game . With the Pack now 0-4 in ACC play and Caleb and Rowan struggling shooting the ball , they may be rethinking their plan of attack . <p> Statistically , NC State ranks dead last in effective FG% among power conference teams . Let me repeatdead last . So there really is nowhere to go but up . That being said , allowing - low percentage shooters to take a majority of your shots from the perimeter is not going to be the answer . Caleb and Mav are capable of being very good shooters if they can square up and get clean looks , but off-balance , often contested high-volume shooting is not going to solve any problems . <p> So what are the options ? <p> Let 's take a closer lookNC State needs to make adjustments . Caleb Martin and Mav Rowan are talented players , there is no doubt about it . They are- going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 0-4 in the ACC you 'd have to think that there is going to be- some sort of reevaluation of how these guys are used . <p> The quagmire here is that Gottfried knows his team needs scoring . Early in the season it was Caleb and Rowan who backed up Cat in that category . Right now however , State is giving away too many possessions by settling for 3s from guys who simply are n't  really shooting it well . Instead of attacking the rim , getting to the line or dumping it down to the post and making the defense adjust , they are simply settling for 3s off of perimeter passes ( many of which are contested ) . <p> Watching the games and looking at the box score , Rowan and Caleb are producing at a very similar level . They are both streaky shooters who do n't  have much success getting to the rim , and who do n't  really put up great numbers across the board ( outside of points ) . Right now Caleb gives you better defense , rebounding and slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better ( especially since ACC play started . ) <p> Over the last 9 games Caleb Martin is shooting 22-80 from the field . That is 27.5% . He s hit 13-60 from beyond the arc , for 22% . He s grabbed 45 rebounds in that span and has 12 assists . He s also blocked 6 shots and 4 steals . All of that in 292 minutes of play . <p> Meanwhile , during that span , Mav Rowan is shooting 35-113 . That is about 31% from the field . He s hit 20-64 for 31% from 3 point range . Over that span he has 27 rebounds and has dished out 7 assists . He s also tallied zero blocks and 2 steals . All of this in a total of 294 minutes . <p> With Terry Henderson out , its obvious that the Pack needs someone on the perimeter than can help score it , but its really hurting them that they have guys shooting in the high 20s to low 30% range taking- a total of 193 shots over the span were looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over that span , that comes out to about 35% . That 's certainly too much . <p> So what are the options for Gottfried ? He does n't  really have another scorer to sub in . <p> One option is to split Caleb and Mavs minutes between the two . Which ever one is on that day gets the minutes . You then have the ability to play Cody at the 3 . While he is n't going to put up points , he is going to give you two things you desperately need : A guy who will be your best defender on the floor , and someone who is patient on offense and looks for high percentage scoring opportunities . Let 's look at Codys numbers over that 9 game span . <p> Cody is shooting 44% , going 15-34 from the field . He has 35 rebounds and 15 assists . Add in 6 blocks and 11 steals . He s done all of that in only 199 minutes of play over those 9 games ( almost 100 minutes less than Caleb or Mav ) . <p> So while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shooting a ton . The shots he is taking are of a higher percentage . If you look at points per minute , Caleb comes in at .22 while Cody is right behind him at .21 over the aforementioned span . He s rebounding , assisting , blocking and getting steals at a much better clip when you look at per minute production . <p> At this point you really are looking at 2 lines of thinking . Up until a few games ago , most fans were likely onboard with the idea that if you let Rowan and Caleb Martin shoot out their kinks , theyll eventually become the go-to shooters you are looking for . But as State finds themselves in a deep hole at 0-4 in ACC play , you have to start questioning this strategy . <p> By allowing Cody Martin to step in at the 3 and have the- 2 guard responsibilities shared between Mav and Caleb , you are losing a potential scoring threat on the perimeter . This would feel risky if these guys werent shooting a combined 25% from 3 point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other factor to consider is that while shooting percentages from these guys are a worry , there are other problems that are causing NC State to come up short . Their defense has been less than stellar , they are n't  creating turnovers at the rate they could ( considering their size , length and athleticism at numerous positions ) and they are simply not being patient on offense . These are all areas that Cody could help if given more court time . With Abu seemingly turning the corner and showing signs of being able to become a consistent scorer from the block , you could see Gottfried transition into a team that relies on Cat and Abu , supplemented by either Mav or Caleb at the two . <p> Sidenote : Over that span of 9 games we 've been talking about , Abu has gone 41-88 from the floor .

@@26404843 @104843/ <h> Stopping Grayson Allen <p> At their first meeting NC State got absolutely toasted by Allen to the tune of 28 points , 7 rebounds , and 7 assists . Most of his points came off of one actionthe elbow hand-off/screen . When looking at Allen I see a kid who has lots of physical gifts : strong , quick first step , an ability to elevate over defenders ( ask BeeJay ) . When watching the tape on Allen and the way he got his baskets , it confirmed a couple of thingsState is awful at defending ball screens and dribble hand-offs . This is troubling because our guys see this action constantly as Gottfrieds offensive scheme uses some of the exact actions that Duke uses for Allen . <p> What can State do to slow Allen down ? <p> Sell out on the hand-off <p> All too often the NC State big men do not guard anyone ( I know for all that have watched State play this season it is not anything new ) BUT this has got to change if the Wolfpack stands any chance- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-off from Plumlee who is not a threat offensively , especially in the area that the action takes place , this means that Abu or Anya need to hedge hard to keep Allen from turning the corner . There is no reason to hang onto Plumlee 17 feet from the basket ! <p> Play off and bait him into contested jump shots <p> Another reason Grayson was able to turn the corner is because whoever was defending him on the perimeter did not give him enough space . Yes , you want to pressure him but he is deceptively quick and can blow by defenders with ease . Cody Martin will get the assignment again and he needs to leverage his length more to his favor , last time out he allowed Allen to get into his body which knocked him completely off balance rendering him useless . If State can coax Allen into settling for long twos and threes they can have success . The type of players that Allen has struggled against are the long athletic wings , Cody fits this bill , but he has to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to date . <p> Summary <p> Duke does a great job at putting Allen in good spots to use his strengths , he loves to attack the paint and most of the action Duke runs is to create that opportunity . The dribble hand-off is a tough play to defend , especially giving the size of the screener and the Blue Devils ability to space a team with its perimeter shooting . State needs to take away the corner when Allen flies off Plumlee , that will mean Abu and Anya have to step out to force Allen towards the sideline . If State can disrupt this action then they will stand a chance- tomorrow- afternoon at Cameron Indoor Stadium . Oh and go at him on the other end !

In the mean time , what does that leave the Pack with ? <p> Henderson was expected to play big time minutes and will sorely be missed . He was needed as a ball handler , defender , and for his athletic ability . For those who doubted if his impact would be missed due he had a quiet exhibition game , remember that he was out of division I basketball for a whole season , it takes time to regain the touch and rhythm of basketball at a DI level . <p> Coach Gottfried is now left with a team that is extremely thin at guard and even thinner when drilled down to the point guard position .

In the exhibition game Gottfried used Cody Martin , who had an uneven debut , but spoke how he believes he has the potential to handle backup duties . <p> Something will have to give as Cat Barber can not play 40 minutes a game the whole season ? Its likely that the toll would be too great and he would be left with no legs towards the end of the season . That leaves Gottfried having to buy some minutes for Cat by using a combination of both Caleb and Cody at the point guard position . Neither are true point guards , but both posses enough skill to help the Pack survive a few minutes here and there . One thing that it gives State an advantage in is a big lineup that can cause mismatches with their size . As for defense , not too much is lost as Cody and Caleb can defend most opposing points guards . <p> Another result that would be a welcome side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big men . NC State will have to depend on Abu , Anya , and Freeman . In the game versus South Alabama the trio combined for 27 points , and 24 rebounds . Both Freeman and Anya showed some improved moves out of the post and Abu was effective given his limited minutes due to foul- trouble . State will need them to continue to improve and work hard at finding each other on offense . <p> One other important piece is Maverick Rowan . The freshman has shown he is not afraid to look for his shot , but he will have to continue to improve in his selection . Standing at 66 he has the ability to finish inside , and has shown a willingness to take his man off the dribble . As the season marches on do n't  be surprised to find him a top of the box score . <p> Patience will have to be a necessity when watching this team . They are young and have to forge their own path .

@@26404886 @104886/ <h> Why You Shouldnt Freak Out After the Ugly Illinois Loss <p> I 'll go ahead and admit a few things . Yes , this game was ugly , They forced the ball too much , the defense was terrible , the offense was out of sync , we turned the ball over way too many times . It was an altogether ugly loss to an Illinois team who had just lost 3 straight to Winthrop , WVU , and FSU . So what went wrong ? <p> While it was in no way pretty , I think we need to take a step back and remember that this is a brand new team . I thnk they deserve our patience as they slowly develop into a more refined product . <p> At this point , we have all seen the flashes that tell us they have the- talent to be a contender . Dorn has been great , Henderson has shown the ability to knock down shots , and Smith was averaging over 20 points in the past few games . Down low Abu has shown glimpses , Hicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on as a real competitor on the blocks . But Its Already Been 7 Games , What 's up with the defense ? - <p> We are still only 7 real games into the season ! Getting a defense to mesh takes a lot of time . A good majority of this team had n't  played together before this season and freshmen are getting massive minutes . These guys are still very raw and still need to get to know each other , learn how to communicate and move in unison on the court . Also , remember that a defense is only as good as its weakest link . There are alot of guys learning and one break down leads to a full defensive breakdown . <p> A good example of this is Duke during their last " NationalTitle " title season . First off , we know we are n't  that Duke team and our coach is n't Coach K. But remember , this team early in the season , with all the talent they had , still was an awful defensive team . Now , they were very polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , they still struggled a good deal on the defensive end for a good portion of the season , even though they were stacked with talent and garnished a future HOF coach . <p> -We are going for the homerun defense play too often . While we love the aggression and down the line should lead to TOs , right now guys are gambling too much , causing breakdowns on D. This is something else that just takes time as these guys are athletic enough to get steals but will learn when to pick and choose their times to go for a steal or blocked shot . -A great example from the other night is Terry Hendersons blowby on the baseline with the shot clock winding down and Smiths deep 3 foul at the end of the shot clock . Terry a little less excusable but Smiths was definitely a freshman mistake learned the hard way . <p> -Last is the ever rotation and addition of new pieces to our lineup . Due to injuries/NCAA Suspension , Gottfried has had to tinker with his defense with each added new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of occasions , losing our rim protection and rebounding . We have also gone with a bigger lineup as Kapita slowly gets accustomed to the pace of the game . These changes will slow the proggress of a team learning their defensive identity . <p> Well , our offense still looks out of sync <p> -Lets start with Dennis Smith . Do n't  forget that for all the accolades Smith has received , he is still an 18 year old kid . His first few games we saw that Gottfried was right in saying that Smith was going to have an adjustment period . Smith did adjust and was looking like the player he was projected to be . Facing Illinois , was a new challenge for him . This is a much bigger , stronger , experienced team . Smith will learn what he can and cantt get away with and how to attack better competition . It will just , unfortunately , be something learned by experience . Remember , Smith is still being seen as a lottery pick by guys who are paid to watch evalutate talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We just need to give him time . <p> -Early on , the Pack was able to get by on talent alone ( against the lesser competition . ) As the competition picks up , they will need to learn how to execute in the half court set . The more they run the offense to more familiar they will get with it and the better they will be . Running the offense in a game is much different than running it in practice . Early on we were watching this team just out athlete people . For now , - well need to be patient as they learn to trust the system and execute with efficiency and confidence . <p> Let 's wait until we are at full strength . Kapita is just getting started and Yurtsevens debut is still to come <p> -Kapita has looked very good in his minimal exposure so far for the Pack . The game against Illinois was his first true game in our - opinion ( the first was in an already out of reach game , the latter he saw minimal minutes due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes and a few tough shots he took . It will still take Kapita a handful of games to get into the flow of things and get in sync with the rest of the offense . Until then , expect alot of ticky tack fouls and lapses on both sides of the ball . But overall he seems to have alot of upside and should be a reliable- post player on both ends of the floor . <p> -Then we have Yurtseven . A five-star 7-footer who according to scouting reports and everyone around the program could really be a game changer for this Wolfpack team . Smith even quoted him as " The smartest player Ive ever played with " and that " People do n't  understand how good Omer is " . Though a breif glimpse , we saw how well Yurtseven got up and down the court for his size . He will be a huge boost on offense and defense and gives us one more guy in the post when we get in foul trouble . <p> Here is another tweet from Greenberg as well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your time evaluating @NCSU Hoops until Omer Yurtseven is eligible . @MarkGottfried Pack will be just fine . <p> Sorry for being long winded on this one , but we really think its important for fans to step back and understand that getting young teams to mesh is not a quick or easy process , especially with the unique scenarios tha Pack has seen so far this season . We also need to realize that this is not a thick-skinned veteran group . They need the fans support more than ever right now . Losses hurt , we all feel that , but the best is yet to come with this group and we need to remember that . - It will inevitably take longer than everyone hopes , but its not where this team starts , but where they are able to finish . Gottfried has proven that his teams start slow but peak in March . I think staying the course , staying positive and- holding off on the blame game is the role our fan base can play in helping this team reach thier full potential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play after an embarrassing loss .

@@26404923 @104923/ <h> 5 Things to Watch For in Tonights Season Opener <p> NC State opens the season tonight at 7pm against Georgia Southern , and while there is much anticipation , there are still a lot of questions to be answered . Here are 5 things- that we will be watching in tonights opener . <p> 1 ) What does NC States frontcourt look like without Yurtseven Without the 7 foot , 5-star freshman on the floor for the first 9 games ( due to NCAAs ruling ) , Gottfried will have to figure out how to use his existing frontcourt pieces . What he has to work with is Beejay Anya , Malik Abu and Darius Hicks . Ted Kapita has still not been cleared and its looking less and less likely as they continue to hold off on a decision . <p> So what route will Gottfried take ? I think it will go game by game . Sometimes Gott will run out his 4 guard lineup with Abu in the middle , in an attempt to out-athlete his opponents . There will also be times where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there . <p> What to pay attention to tonight is how and when he decides to go with certain lineups and how those lineups produce . Is Anya going to slow the team down on the break ? Will they get outrebounded with only Abu in the paint ? These are things to watch for in the Wolfpack frontcourt . <p> 2 ) Does team chemistry look good ? The talent is there for this team , and barring injury , the only thing that we feel could stop them is some sort of chemistry issue . Now , we definitely do n't  think this team will suffer from that . Smith , Henderson and Dorn spent much of last year on the bench , plotting this upcoming season , and by the early looks of things , this team is clicking unlike any we 've seen before ( this early in the season . ) They are sharing the ball , they are on the same page , and they look like they are having a blast out there . Sure , we only saw two exhibition games , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of attitude and teamwork into the regular season . <p> 3 ) What does Dennis Smith Jr look like at 100% ? - Weve seen Smith in the red and white game and we 've seen him in these early season exhibition games , but watching him closely , you could tell that he was holding back just a bit . Not yet ready to go all out for games that do n't  matter . So , what does Dennis Smith Jr look like when he s full throttle and taking no prisoners ? Tonight we will get our first glimpse . <p> 4 ) How disciplined is this team defensively ? This is a very fast-paced , athletic team , and they are going to do a lot of their damage on the break . But being a team that dominates on the break means you have to get stops on the defensive end . Is this team able to create turnovers , and if so , can they do it without gambling too much defensively ? The one thing you worry about is a team that wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessed with reaching for a steal or jumping the passing lane too quickly . Can this team sit and a stance and defend ? Can they stay in the passing lanes to disrupt offensively flow without jumping out of position on pass fakes ? Can they stay in front of their man without reaching , leading to blowbys and defensive rotations ? Will they switch on high screens instead of hedging and recovering , now that they have a more versatile group ? <p> This is a young team , so discipline on defense might still be a work in progress , but if this team is going to contend for any hardware , they are going to need to learn to harness that athleticism into become shut down defenders . Tonight well try to guage where they are and how far they need to go . <p> 5 ) How many highlight reel dunks will we see ? This is less about scouting the team and more about pure entertainment , but with Smith , Kirk , Dorn , Johnson and Abu , you 're sure to get your fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be very fun to watch . The athleticism is just off the charts and there could be an ESPN Top 10 moment at any time . 73283 @qwx273283 <p> Georgia Southerns coach threw everything in the book at the Wolfpack . Dude 3/4 court pressed/trapped pretty much the entire game , switched up defenses , and attacked . Our boys seemed to struggle against that zone D. Jacked up a lot of bad jumpers . Should have been busting that zone with dribble penetration the entire game . <p> Wow ! Not the start I had envisioned . Good wake up call for this team to come out focused and stay focused for 40 minutes . The FT shooting was atrocious until the end of the game . Luckily we hit the FTs when we absolutely had to . Anya is a waste . Abu played soft most of game . Dennis took a lot of bad shots . Torin is the man and Terry played well for most of game . This is not HS Dennis . <p> I expect to see some turnovers and sloppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow and start a run . We win by 35 . <p> As Lou mentioned , we likely play small ball considering the competition is also pretty small . I expect to see a lot of fast breaks and rim rocking dunks .

@@26404930 @104930/ <h> Debate : Are NC State fans more interested in Tailgating than Football ? <p> Its a talking point that has constantly been discussed for years at NC State . Most of the time the debate is over the student section . <p> The big time football fans are disgusted by the inability to get the student section filled by kickoff and the start of the second half . The more basic fan does not really see the issue and views football Saturday as more of a day-drinking , Bojangles catered party where a football game breaks out . <p> A few days ago , NC States student newspaper , The Technician , touched on this very issue in their commentary titled " NC State student section first to file out . " In this piece , the author touches on these issues from the perspective of a serious Wolfpack- football fan and makes some good points as to why this has become a problem in her eyes . <p> NC State has tried to fix these problems many times during the years , threatening to limit ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , - many believed that would decrease filling in the student section even more , since people may still leave and now would not be able to re-enter . <p> Reading the article , the Technician makes the case that Football is more important than tailgating and if you are lucky enough to get a ticket you should be in the stadium cheering on your team . A good point , understood by those who are diehard fans . <p> On the other hand , the argument from some students are that they are paying the tuition fees too and they can use their ticket however they please . To some , the tailgate is the draw . The time drinking or eating Bojangles out in the cool fall breeze is the fun part , and the football game is just the catalyst for bringing everyone together . Again , a fair point likely understood by those who have pride in being a Wolfpacker , but are n't  as diehard a fan of the actual sport . <p> Complaining about the divide in these two mindsets is fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its not going to change anything . Creating rules or regulations around getting to your seat on time or staying in the stadium might be counterproductive as well . So what 's the fix ? <p> I honestly do n't  know if there is a controllable fix . Tailgating is something that NC State does well and something they are known for . It holds a lot of memories for a lot of former State students . Its a part of the culture and something that makes attending college in Raleigh pretty special . I think the byproduct of that is that sometimes , for some people , - the excitement of the tailgate trumps the- excitement of - the actual game . <p> For instance , we at Pack Insider watch every single play of every single game , and we did that before we owned or worked at this website . We 'd consider ourselves diehard fans . However , some fans do n't  really feel like they need to see every single play to get the gist of what 's going on in the game . Do those people not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuition statement says otherwise . <p> Weve been around this program for quite some time , and while we do n't  have the exact attendance numbers , we can tell you that there is a noticeable- correlation between how good a team NC State has and how packed the student section stays . There is also a noticeable- correlation between how big the stakes are of an individual game and how packed the student section stays . If NC State builds a team that is an ACC powerhouse year-in-and-year-out every game will matter , and if every game really matters ( again this is subjective ) then I do n't  believe this conversation happens .

I could n't believe it when I saw he finished with 25 . I also was surprised that Johnson only had 9 . It was a very loud 9 , I guess . To me , he was the guy that made us go in this one and his play should take some pressure off of Smith and allow Gott some flexibility in our backcourt . <p> Gottfried showed once again that he can make adjustments at halftime but he s still not a good in-game coach . He really needs to be able to make those offensive/defensive adjustments on the fly to be considered a good coach .

@@26404950 @104950/ <h> VT Fights back , Nips Wolfpack in OT 73-68 <p> State started off strong , playing patient inside-out basketball and getting out to a commanding 16 point first half lead . But as the game wore on and the Seth Allen and Jalen Hudson got hot , the Wolfpack reverted to this teams #1 weaknesspoor shot selection . As the Pack settled for contested 3s and long 2s , the Hokies were attacking the basket and putting pressure on the Pack . <p> Caleb Martin and Mav Rowen combined to go 3-17 from beyond the arc in a game where NC State led for most of the game . State also outrebounded the Hokies 50-41 , but could not overcome the onslaught of Allen and Hudson down the stretch . <p> As far as positives go , Cat played well . He really has come on as a go-to scorer and play maker for this team . He once again got over the 20 point mark even added 7 boards . The bigs rebounded the ball well and Anya was a block machine ( 5 total ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement after this game , I am not fully in agreement . Abu and Anya did great work on the boards and State actually won the rebounding battle 50-41 . Yes , at the end of the game there were a few key missed rebounds that led to the loss , but overall I thought the bigs worked - hard on the glass . Lastly , Cody Martin filled his niche with 7 points ( 3-4 FG ) and 4 boards in limited time . I think its time to see more Cody . He s not ever going to be a big time scorer , but he really is the type of do-it all player who is n't afraid to get his hands dirty . He shares the basketball , has a great nose for it and constantly finds himself in the right place at the right time . I know this team is dying for scorers , but they are also in need of a guy who practices patience and runs the offense with ease and efficiency . <p> Gottfried harped post game on a few calls he wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooters could n't hit shots tonight , but when he goes back to watch the tape I think what might stand out is the decision making by his players when they got rattled . This is a young team , no one questions that , but they need to keep improving in this area . Tonight was an early step in the right direction , but then two steps in the wrong direction when the Hokies surged back in the 2nd half . <p> Weve taking a bit of heat recently for being too critical- of a team that came in 10-3 . Weve been doing this for a while now and we think that the fans of this site do n't  just want to know if we won or if we lost ( they watched the game ) , but they want to know why . How can this team let a 16 point lead slip away ? Why did we look so good early on and what happened in the 2nd half ? <p> Tonight you saw the points we have been trying to- make all season long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams early this season , but now we 've reached prime-time . Now every team is on the same level athletically , so intricacies of the game come into play . The small things start paying off , and being able to run faster and jump higher no longer gain you the advantage they did against teams like High Point or UNCG . <p> Tonight NC State came out and played Mark Gottfried basketball early on . They were patient , they were sharing the ball , dumping it down and causing VT to make decisions . Do they double down or allow Anya and Abu to go one on one on the block ? Buzz Williams chose to have his guys double down . This opened up some great interior passing and a few high lows . It also opened up- some great kick outs for uncontested 3s . They had the high pick and roll working and they were , allowing the ball to get into the high post . These are areas that the ball needs to go to make the defense react , and it was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the second half it was a different story . As VT started making their run , the Pack started to panic . No longer where they working the ball inside-out . They retreated into the thing that has plagued them since day one . They started settling for forced shots . They stopped running through the offense and really let the Hokies off the hook . Too much dribbling , too much one and one at the top of the key . All of the sudden there were shot clock violations , guys taking 3s with 2 hands in their face , not even squared up. - Youd have thought it was NC State team that was fighting back from a 16 point early deficit. - At the end of the day , this is what really cost them . <p> Now , do n't  lose hope. - Does this mean that this team wont figure out this issue and play like the team you saw in the first half ? No way . This team is slowly improving. - They are young , they are still finding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this level . The point we are trying to make is that we are now 14 games in . We are almost halfway through the season . This team has the talent to be a contender , they just need to focus on patience , execution and togetherness and they need to work on that until it becomes their default . When the going gets tough this team needs to rely on each other . Cat is a great scorer , but they need more than just him if they want to make a run this season .
