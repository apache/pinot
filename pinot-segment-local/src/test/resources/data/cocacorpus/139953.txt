Not everything needs to be an object . I tend to prefer simple scalar types for values unless I need to save a value into a container like an NSArray. 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 
@@98149747 @2349747/ <h> Quick Tutorial on how to add **27;0;TOOLONG <p> This process is fairly simple . The SDK includes the MessageUI.framework which simplifies this process to a few lines of code ; do n't know why you would want to send an email from the iPhone in another way . <p> Here we need to import **29;29;TOOLONG and the LONG ... We added the MessageUI.framework and we needed to import these two files from the framework into our viewcontrollers header . We also need to add the &lt; **39;60;TOOLONG . <p> Now , the IBAction class method named actionEmailComposer is what-s important . You can call this method however you want in your program . Here we-re going to call this method with the UIButton created in Interface Builder to simplify it . ( Save all files . Open up **30;101;TOOLONG with Interface Builder . Drag a UIButton onto the view . Give the UIButton a title called - " Mail Composer- " and then click on the Connections Inspector tab . Drag - " Did Touch Up Inside- " to File-s Owner in the Document window and link it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we added the IBAction method code . First we wanted to check if the current device-s state is able to send email so we are using a *if* function here to simply test it . **27;133;TOOLONG has a method called canSendMail that returns a boolean value of YES if the device is configured for sending email or NO if it is not . <p> If the device is able to send emails , we created mailViewController by initializing and allocating **27;162;TOOLONG and delegating the mailComposeDelegate to self . <p> I set the isHTML for the message body to NO . You can use HTML if you want by setting it to YES . <p> We are presenting the mailViewController , the **27;191;TOOLONG allocated , with as a modal view with **26;220;TOOLONG so when the button is clicked the mailViewController slides up to fill the screen . <p> The **35;248;TOOLONG protocol has a call-back method LONG ... and this method indicates if the user is finished with the mailComposerView , the **27;285;TOOLONG . MFMailComposeResult provides the vales of the action of the email composer : MFMailComposeResultSent , MFMailComposeResultSaved , **28;314;TOOLONG and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can retrieve the error parameter . <p> Here I just want to dismiss the ModalViewController and nothing else so I-m just calling **34;371;TOOLONG . <p> Build and Run and check it out . This is pretty simple for sending a e-mail with your iPhone with just a subject and message . Check out the class reference for **27;407;TOOLONG for additional goodies . <p> Ah , I never had to work in those situations before . I would just present the user with the same information filled out in the body . This gives them the option to send the report or feedback and look through the message to see what they are actually sending . <p> I 've run into a strange problem with this and I 'm hoping someone can she 'd some light on it . <p> I set up my app to allow sending e-mail just like this . It works perfectly in the iPhone Simulator . However , when using an actual device ( iPod running 3.1.3 in this case ) , the app winds up sort of stuck .

@@98149750 @2349750/ <p> In the first Section we will see some basic things about webservice , in Section 2 and 3 we will see 2 important architectures of webservice and how we can use these . In section 4 we will see some example to communicate with webservice , and in section 5 and 6 we will see how we can use what the webservice return . <p> Basically is a server that expose methods , you can call these methods with an input and you will receive an output . A webservice can be written in any language ( php , C# , VB.Net , Java , Python , etc ... ) . Really webservices are much more than that , but this is not the place to study the argument in dept . In iOS SDK there is n't a framework for consume webservice , so you need to create something from scratch , this can be " easily " done because webservice generally support HTTP + XML or JSON ( in some case HTTP is not enabled for default , you need to enable manually yourself ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first use SOAP messages ( subset of XML ) to communicate with webservice , so you will use http requests to sendreceive SOAP messages to communicate with the webservice . With REST you can use http requests using GET ( or POST , PUT , DELETE ) to call a method of webservice , and XML or JSON as input and output . <p> There are many other things to know about webservices , start reading from the link posted above if you want have a good explanation of the topik . <p> NOTE1 : This tutorial is not intended to be a perfect explanation of webservice ( so some term and phrase can be not 100% exact ) , it is just a guideline to consume webservice with iOS SDK . NOTE2 : My english is not so good , so if you find some error , tell me privately , i will fix it . NOTE3 : Feel free to add some usefull informations ( links , approaches , utility , etc ... ) , I will try to keep updated the thread with all options possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the easier to consume , it generally have a link , where you can specify a method and parameter directly with GET ( GET mean inserting parameters directly on the link ) Example : LONG ... So what you need to use a REST webservice is just to know the link with the right method and right input for that and then you will call it using an http request . Look Section 4 : HTTP Request <p> It is a great tool that generate objective-c code ready to use , starting from WSDL ( WSDL is a complete description of webservice , so in it you can read inputouput of all webservice methods ) Recently was not updated often but the developer said that he will update soon his project adding new features and fixing bugs . it can work , or can produce something that not fully work . Try it and see if you have some problems . In this case , you can try search on the forum to find some thread about sudzc . <p> 2 ) Create " manually " xml to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this solution , you should create the classes that represent the objects that your method(s) need ( you can also start from the classes generated by sudzc ) . and then you will create a http request to your webservice , it will reply with an xml to parse . <p> What you want try to do is call some method of your webservice , so you need to understand what webservice expect to have when you call that method and what the webservice will return as output ( so that you can parse it ) . You can read this information looking at the WSDL , but sometime when webservice is not easylittle , can be hard to fully understand what you need directly from WSDL . <p> So , you can use soapUI , it can help you a lot . <p> 1 ) download soapUI 2 ) filenew soap project , and insert link to your wsdl 3 ) expand method that you want launch , double click " Request " , you will see the xml that you should produce to call method . 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and variables ) 5 ) Send in post to your webservice link asynchronously ( you can use ASIHTTPRequest or NSURLConnection ) . Look Section 4 : HTTP Request 6 ) The server will reply with another xml that you can parse . Look Section 5 : Parse XML <p> Another way to know what you need to send in xml , is too use a sniffer ( wireshark ? fiddler ? tcpmon ? ) and see the xml that your " standard client " sendreceive ( assuming that you have a working client ) , and then use it as described in points 4,5,6 . <p> Section 4 : HTTP Request How you can do a HTTP request ? Easy , using NSURLConnection or ASIHTTPRequest . For REST webservice generally you need just to do a request to the link ( generally using just GET to specify input ) . For SOAP webservice generally you need to do a request to the link of your webservice and add your SOAP Message in POST ( that contain the method to call and the input for that method ) <p> You would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the request in background without block User Interface , so now we will see how to do asynchronous http requests with NSURLConnection and with ASIHTTPRequest . <p> NOTE : NSURLConnection is built in with iOS SDK so you do n't need to include nothing to use it , ASIHTTPRequest is a third party library that allow you to easily use http request and more stuff related . In order to use it in your project you must follow this ASIHTTPRequest Setup Instructions <p> Using ASIHTTPRequest for WebService ( when you do n't need to specify an input in POST ) <p> This example cover various situations ( when you need to parse an intboolean , or an array of value ( like friends , an array of strings ) or a value that is on an attribute ( like username ) Nice , so now we should just call this <p> We should have our user in myUser , now starting from that you should be able to make a parser for your objects . <p> NOTE : When a WebService return an error , return a particular object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a SoapFaultParser that parse your responseString searching for a SoapFault , and when you are sure that responseString is not a fault , you should call ParserUser to parse the string as a WSUser . I have n't done it in this tutorial just to keep it simple , you can see some code to do it from sudzc generated code , or you can just create it starting from my example . <p> In the same manner of xml section , we will se an example for JSON parsing . <p> But first we need to see how to setup project to use it , because there is any JSON framework included with iOS SDK , 1 ) you need to download here SBJson 2 ) add all the files on folder " Classes " with Drag&amp;Drop on your project , ( select the " Copy items into destination groups folder " option ) <p> Now you should only import SBJson.h in your class . <p> #import &amp;quot ; SBJson.h&amp;quot ; <p> Suppose that we have a webservice method getUser(id) that return the information about a user giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call that method will be something like this : <p> Explanation : responseString contain our json output returned by server , to parse it , we just need to call the method JSONValue , this return a NSDictionary with all the values . dictionary is a NSDictionary , in our case it have 1 element , that element is in " return " key and is another NSDictionary . We assigned that to dictionaryReturn. dictionaryReturn contain 5 objects ( 4 string : username , passwordmd5 , banned , numPost and 1 NSArray ) . The array contain 3 NSDictionary each with 1 String on it ( with key friendName ) , so we need to loop on the array , take the NSDictionary and then take the NSString from that . <p> NOTE : Since that our webservice return only info about 1 user , we have a NSDictionary returned , if webservice return more than a user , it would returned a NSArray , so we would used <p> NSArray *arrUsers = responseString JSONValue ; <p> and so we would looped on the array that contain X NSDictionary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill your classes that represent the user ( WSUser ) , or you can use directly what JSON Framework returned , as you prefer ! . <p> Cool tutorial , thanks very much . I just came up with another related question bit more to PHP . Let 's say I have index.php which loads me data from DB , creates JSON and does ECHO ( something like here : http : //app.vapa.cz/ ) . But then ... every user can easily see those data from DB . How would you protect it from others ? ? ? <p> My idea is that iOS creates a HTTP request which will include some kind of parameter like user name and password . Then my index.php page will check this name + pass whether user is allow to dig data and if so , index.php will make him JSON . Is that good way or is there something better ? ? ? <p> Thank you so much danydev , very helpful . Is there any way you could post the file source code or send them via email ? I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xcode . For example , where would the " envelope " script be located ? <p> Thank you so much danydev , very helpful .

@@98149766 @2349766/ <h> Apple and Cryptographic Export Certification - Steps to Follow <p> I have just submitted an app that does use cryptography , so for the first time I needed to answer " yes " to that question . Having never really looked behind the scenes of that question before , I really did n't give it much thought . I assumed it would be a matter of answering some questions and then off you go . Quite wrong . In fact if your app does dabble in cryptography at all you will need to get a certification from the US Department of Commerce . Those outside of the US are NOT exempt since Apple is located in the US . <p> You might be thinking that in order to check " yes " to this that you need to be engaging in major cloak and dagger activities , but you 'd be wrong . In fact if your app uses HTTPS you need to go through this process . Yes , something as simple and ubiquitous as HTTPS . Sure you might get through the Apple review process without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not answering this question properly . Even using Apple 's libraries does not exempt you . You are also not exempt if the app itself does n't use encryption but say a back-end server that is part of the overall service the app is there for , does . <p> Fortunately it is pretty simple to get the necessary document from the government largely due to the self-service systems they have in place to handle this . I would caution that if you are using non-standard or " roll your own " cryptography , the hurdles will be higher . Assuming that is not the case though and you 've just used say SSL , SHA , AES , etc. , you just need to acquire an ERN Number . <p> Step 2 : After registration you will be sent an email to the address you supplied . It took about an hour before I received this email . Click on the link to complete the registration . <p> Step 3 : Using the Snap-R system you will select your desire for Encryption Registration . Most of the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones for you to fill-in yourself . You will also need to supply an EIN ( or I suppose SSN ) . For out of US folks , you will need to get an EIN or perhaps TID . <p> Step 5 : Copy the text from the page above into a word processing document . Then go about answering the areas asked . You will need to submit this form as a PDF . <p> Step 6 : Go to the document attachments area ( link at the bottom of the Step 3 page ) and attach the document from Step 5 . <p> Step 7 : Check for errors and submit . You do n't want to make any mistakes as you can not correct information on-line . If mistakes are made you will need to call them . Does n't sound fun or efficient . <p> Step 8 : With the form submitted you will receive an email ( took a minute or two ) with the official ERN number . It is VERY IMPORTANT that you take a screen capture of this as you 'll use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 9 : Submit your app to Apple in the usual way . After answering the cryptology questions , you will be asked whether this app is going to be on the French store . If you say yes , you will also need a document from the French government . This part looks nasty and long so you might want to table it for now . Select " NO " to that question and you will be asked to submit proof of the ERN number . This is where you will attach the document from Step 8 . Important note at the time of this writing iTunes Connect handles this poorly and later in the submission you get a generic error and can not submit your app . I had tried to send it in PNG , JPG , and DOC and I did n't even know if that was the issue . Turns out providing it as a ZIP file works . So save a lot of time and ZIP the damn thing and attach that ! <p> Step 10 : The app goes into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is where I stand now so I can not say how much time that will add . Hopefully not much .... <p> Update to Step 10 : I have just made it out of " Export Compliance " . It basically came out to 2-business days . I am now in the standard " waiting for review " line . <p> ** Important note If you are not going through the French approval process for export , you can save time by de-selecting France from the stores the app will launch in . I recommend doing that prior to submitting your app . If not you will likely be asked before approval to go and do that and then come back to them . Save time and do it first ! <h> Replies <p> This seems a bit much for just using standard security like HTTPS . In fact it would seem that most apps would store external information on a server would be encrypted . Especially with a business app where you might store sensitive business information . <p> With all the hacking and malware out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh well , Apple will be Apple . <p> Completely agree that is indeed much . However , if you read the Apple FAQ they do require it . The good news is that the cert you get can be used again and again unless something substantial changes . It is n't bound to the app but rather to the kind of business you or your company engage in . So once you get it via the steps above , you can use it for other apps down the road by just giving them the screen shot from Step 8 . <p> A brief update that I also updated in my OP . I made it out of " export compliance " so that basically makes it 2 business days . I am now in " waiting for review " . So this will add some time to the overall review process but not too bad .

Just place the post variable name in single quotes in side the square brackets . <p> e.g. <p> &lt; ? php&gt; $myVar=$POST ; &lt; ? &gt; <p> You can then use the myVar variable which will contain the input sent as ' myPostedData ' in the obj-c code . <p> If you are sending a file then you need different obj-c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job coding a simple iphone app that I have n't time to do then drop me an email . Just sending 2 post items to a PHP web server and formatting/displaying the 3 response data on iphone . No need to be pretty as I have time to edit the xib file . It would pay a little if the code is good . <p> What do you want to upload ? It likely makes a difference as to the best way to approach it . <p> Actually , he did , when he posted this : <p> I have some NSMutableData , I need to figure out how to encode it correctly , and then turn it into postData . <p> jcafaro10 - since the data you have is in a NSData object , forget about uploading a file . You do n't have one now , and it 's more trouble than it 's worth to create one just to do the upload as a file . <p> spangat has the right idea . Use the code I posted earlier to create a POST URL that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spangat 's PHP code to get started on receiving it in the form submission . Once you have it in a PHP string variable , you can write that to a file on the server . <p> Quote : I have some NSMutableData , I need to figure out how to encode it correctly , and then turn it into postData . <p> That does n't tell us anything . He has some quantity ( how many ? ) of bytes that he wants to store on the server and retrieve . We knew that without him saying it . What ELSE would you upload to a server than " some quantity of bytes " ? <p> Anyway , looking back through the responses , I see it is application objects that he wants to store on the server and later retrieve . <p> The problem he has is really not on the iPhone side . It is , as others have stated , that he needs to learn something about server-side scripting , and needs to gain access to a server that will let him do scripting and store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is currently using will permit him to do that . <p> No , web servers do not simply , by default , accept any data you send to them and store it somewhere ! There has to be a program ( script ) installed on the server to do that . There 's no generic way to do this . <p> You need to write a " web service " that will authenticate the user , accept uploads , and send downloads . You need to design a " protocol " for this , which can be as simple as designated URLs for performing the various functions ( authenticate , upload , download , etc . ) . ( This is referred to as REST . But there are other schemes . ) <p> Most here are trying to solve the problem of how to encode the data for transmission , but that is a non-problem at this point . First , he needs a server that is suitable for the job , a server-side script , and he needs to learn how to write the script . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help if there is n't some script there on the server to do something with it ! <p> I know that he said that he needs to know how to encode the data . However , it is not uncommon for people to not really know what they need to know to solve a problem , or to really understand what the problem is . ( I am not exempt from this ! ) Later discussion revealed that he was assuming that if he could successfully encode the data , that somehow it would be magically stored on the server , and then he could get it back . Wrong problem . That is why I suggested stepping back , and fully describing the application . <p> Exactly what he is doing with the data and what is represents IS important . It will influence the design of the web service . <p> I urge people to step back and look at the bigger picture , rather than home-in on some minutiae that is not going to help at this point . <p> Finally , I note that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school " . Unless this is just a personal project , or something only for students of his school ( and with approval of the school ) they probably would n't appreciate their server being used as a back-end for an iPhone application ! You can get inexpensive commercial web hosting that will allow you to write scripts , and perhaps that is part of the solution . <p> Thanks for the responses ! I 'm resigned to setting up my own local http server . Just to see if it will work . Then I can write whatever kind of php script I want . I wrote the correct IPhone code I think to upload the data . My php script was for file handling so I guess what I need is php code to handle the IPhone data and then write that data to a file . The question is , how to I do that ? Also , once it 's written to a file , how to I download and use that file ?

Just have some statements around what you collect , why , and how it will be used . This is an important area to be transparent with and even if you do very little with user data , it will look good to have one . Do n't lose a single customer for something you could create in 10 minutes . Of course it needs to be accurate and something you will adhere to . <p> If you inadvertently collect the user 's email address via a support link , does that require a privacy policy too ? I have n't seen Apple 's new rule , hence my asking . <p> @dev666999 Your question about Apple 's policy is certainly valid and perhaps someone can share a link ( or I 'll go find it ) . However , regardless of what Apple says , it is worth having this policy anyway per the points I made above . I personally would n't advise anyone to wait on something like this for others to tell you to get it . Given it can be free and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . To answer your question about the email address ( from my non-legal perspective ) if you are capturing any PII ( which includes email address ) even for innocuous purposes , disclose it and what you plan to do with it in a simple policy . If it is only for support we are talking about a few sentences in a document . Perhaps you collect that email for support , use it as such , and then delete the email address from any storage ( including paper ) . Just say that . Looks good to customers and shows you take PII seriously . <p> @C6Silver05 Thanks for the reply . I agree , it will be easy and wise to incorporate a privacy policy . I will start doing that with my next app and of course updates to older ones . I have an update waiting for review , and need to get it approved ASAP . A rejection for lack of a privacy policy has me worried , hence the urgency in my asking . <p> Apps can not transmit data about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user with access to information about how and where the data will be used 17.2 <p> Apps that require users to share personal information , such as email address and date of birth , in order to function will be rejected 17.3 <p> Apps may ask for date of birth ( or use other age-gating mechanisms ) only for the purpose of complying with applicable children 's privacy statutes , but must include some useful functionality or entertainment value regardless of the user 's age 17.4 <p> Apps that collect , transmit , or have the capability to share personal information ( e.g. name , address , email , location , photos , videos , drawings , the ability to chat , other personal data , or persistent identifiers used in combination with any of the above ) from a minor must comply with applicable children 's privacy statutes , and must include a privacy policy 17.5 <p> Apps that include account registration or access a user 's existing account must include a privacy policy or they will be rejected <p> Well , I thought I may be off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since there 's no way for me or Apple to determine if a child or adult is using the app , then 17.4 will kick you out . Privacy policy needed . Here 's hoping ... got my fingers crossed ... will let you know if I pass . <p> I checked an older version of the guidelines , and 17.4 along with the rest of the privacy rules were there then . So I wonder why is Apple suddenly enforcing them now ? <p> @dev666999 You can submit a privacy policy without having to pull your app from the review queue . Perhaps you can put something quickly together , provide the link , and then update it more afterwards . Since you wo n't lose your place you have nothing to lose . <p> @C6Silver05 Does n't the app itself have to have or link to a privacy policy ? So I either need a button inside the app that pulls from my website , links to my webiste , or I post the policy inside the app as a hardcoded text . <p> To do any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , I may only be required to place it in my metadata at iTunes.Connect ? <p> @dev666999 If you look in the overall meta data there is a section under the Keywords for Support , Marketing , and finally Privacy policy . You can update this without having to resubmit the binary . I have seen nothing to indicate that the privacy policy has to be within the app . I will say that with mine I have it in the app ( it pulls from a website so I can update without resubmitting ) as well as in the meta data privacy link . I 'd do that on your next update , but again I do n't think that is required in addition to the link you provide on the app store . <p> @C6Silver05 . Thanks , that 's good to know . I 'll be putting it up tonight . Future apps and updates will have a button inside the app for the link , and also a link in iTunes.Connect . I certainly appreciate your help on this . 
@@98149782 @2349782/ <h> How long for Apple to Respond to Rejection ? <p> For the first time I have had an app rejected . I believe this to be a misunderstanding . They asked , reasonably so , where the " restore " button was for my iAP . I am actually using their Keychain in the cloud so the purchase will persist even if the app is reinstalled or they want to use it on another of their iOS devices . As a result a specific restore should not be necessary . I have not done iAP before so in retrospect I should have thought to let them know how I did this in the reviewer notes ( lesson for next time ) . <p> I got their notice yesterday and I responded in 9 minutes . I realize it is probably foolish to think they could also be as quick to respond , but I am wondering from those that have dealt with this before how long until they answer your response ? I assume they will either tell me why I am wrong and need a restore anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred as of yet . <h> Replies <p> If you mean by responding on the resolution center , then I would say to expect around 24 hours for an answer , that 's been my experience ..

Also , I think they will probably tell you to add the restore button anyway . <p> It will be interesting to see what they say as they still have not responded . The restore is completely unnecessary given my setup but it will be interesting if they still ask for it . <p> So Apple has come back and it is clear that after 24 hours they did not bother to read my reply . They said ( obviously copied from some canned text ) : <p> " " Users restore transactions to maintain access to content they 've already purchased . For example , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose all of the items they purchased on the old phone . Include some mechanism in your app to let the user restore their purchases , such as a Restore Purchases button . " <p> As I said in my original reply I store this to the keychain so everything they said above would work without the need for a restore button . I guess I will throw in a button that does n't actually do anything since there is nothing to actually do . I 'd feel better about it if they actually read my reply rather than ignoring it entirely and pasting in canned text . <p> I decided not to tilt and windmills . I felt funny about putting a dummy button in even if the real thing would serve no purpose , so I built the restore functionality correctly . Not that anyone would have the need for it ... I also uploaded my screen capture with the button prominently displayed so there is no confusion at the Genius Bar . Now I am sure I will have to wait another 7-days for something that should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> First , Apple has approved the app and it is the in the store now . I am shocked that they got back to this so quickly and actually faster than it took for them to respond to my question . So kudos to them for not making me re-enter the week long wait . <p> Kennic , I am not sure I understand what you are saying . If I understand correctly , the user 's purchase is tied to their Apple Account . As long as they have access to the account they purchased the app under they would have access to their same cloud keychain and thus the purchase they made . Perhaps I am mistaken but is the cloud not associated with their account ? If they change to a different account they would n't have access to the " restore " either as it is a different account . What am I missing ? <p> Best to not even wait for a response , as it will take forever and they will most likely give you a canned response and not give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them happy or hit the appeal button . <p> No reasoning with App Store reviewers , but perhaps that is a good thing ? <p> Kennic , I am not sure I understand what you are saying .

What am I missing ? <p> The problem is , their iClouds keychain account is not always the same as the account they used to purchase your app . They are two different accounts . If they change ( or lost ) their iClouds account , they will lost their IAP of your app too , and that does n't make sense . <p> Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed IAP for an app update but KEPT the restore button . Apple rejected because we had a restore button and no IAP . A quick email , from us , informing them that previous IAP purchases must still be restorable and it was approved in minutes .

I will be hiring someone to create it and am looking to find every method available to reduce the total cost of this process . From what I 've been able to research so far , providing the emoticons myself , opting for a smaller amount of emoticons , and having a well planned out layout for your app to avoid costly remakes during the creation process are the only things I have gathered thus far to keep costs to a minimum . <p> My budget will be in the $250-$800 range , is this a acceptable amount for an emoticon app that follows the freemium model with in app purchases ? This appears to be the most successful emoticon model according to the top apps in the store currently as I 'm assuming it allows a much larger amount of people discover your app and commit to it if they enjoy it . <p> Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Freelancer , Guru , and Elance which is the most highly recommended ? <p> As far as I 'm aware emoticon apps are still being sold in the app store even though the app store said , in November of last year , it was going to remove all emoticon apps because of the unicon emojis being available to all phones . Does this mean that emoticon apps which provide unique content are still a profitable app to pursue ? <p> As a professional software developer , it was all I could do not to spit my coffee all over my keyboard when I read your budget of " $250-$800 . <p> You 're not going to create a professional quality app unless you spend ten times that much , or more .

Further research showed many emoticon oriented designers with hundreds of reviews while only charging as low as $10/hr . Likewise there was a wide range of prices that seemed to top out around 4k .

Hopefully you did n't all quit . <p> It 's been really quiet for about 1-2 years now . The action here used to be fast and furious . There was an excitement to be a developer , in charge of your own business and destiny . Now , with so many apps and resultant lack of visibility , I think many developers have thrown in the towel , and have moved on to other things . <p> There are other boards where they discuss apps and programming . Just Google a programming problem and those boards show up . But the newness of it has worn off . <p> Me personally , I 'm in between apps , might not do another app , not sure . I really enjoy this site though , it 's been a big help and it 's been nice being able to discuss the non technical side of things with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely seeing is the free market at work . The app stores became a rapid race to the bottom as apps went from simple apps making money to a flood of work-alike clones and more spam than an email server . <p> At least two primary factors at play here , 1 ) the cost of creating a modern app 2 ) the return on that investment . 1 is about the time to learn all the new things . I 've been here for some 68 years , look at the changes over that time . Huge changes in what high end apps are expected to do and the amount of knowledge a dev has to have . 2 is the flooded app stores , Apple not doing much about cloned/knocked off apps ( CRApps ) . <p> Apple is actually doing us a favor by making the rules strict , who want 's more CRApps ? <p> 64% of the users download ZERO apps in a month . That 's a clue right there . The app store is a grave yard of dreams . <p> Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's about the marketing of the software . That 's very true with the app store as the store itself is NOT a store at all . It 's a distribution system that charges 30% . <p> Consider : If Apple allowed you to have your app downloaded direct from your own site , would you make more or less sales ? <p> Imagine having a choice , sell your app on Apples app store and/or sell it yourself and keep the 30% . <p> That 30% could go towards marketing and be much more effective than what Apple does to ' earn ' their 30% cut of the product you made . <p> It would be different if the app store was worth a dam , but given that it 's a ghost town , it 's clearly not working . <p> *********** The good news : After the weak go away , the strong can come in and take over . The strong can dump certain models that were forced upon us . Maybe free with ads can be scrapped or the ads can go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either pay for non-intrusive ads or run their ads on CRApps . <p> Just like eBay/CL and other markets , we control this . Let the weak die off , it 's for the better , all they did was spam up the app store . <p> Let Apple restrict the apps and let the better apps take over . It 'll become more and more expensive to develop apps and we 'll see the weak apps go to the grave yard where they belong .

I posted that to show that Apple has a reason for not allowing a user to extract code from the . ipa file . <p> This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once your code is compiled into binary - the compiler strips out things that are not important . Like method names / delectations etc . It 's all converted into 0 's and 1 's . So getting that back into a source code format is just about impossible . Also , as dev666999 mentions , this would allow other developers / hackers to easily gain access to what could be private code and essentially steal their work . <p> Tander , it might not bee impossible to do , but does not exist and will not exist , since it would be terribly difficult . Assuming the . ipa is not encrypted , one could in theory extract the executable code from it , however the code would be compiled code , just a collection of binary opcodes and arguments . This could be transformed into legible assembler code . If one really wanted , it could go a step further and convert the code from asm to C. Even converting to obj-c could be possible in theory but terribly difficult to do . And in any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no variable names , no comments , etc and in many parts it would be way different from the original ( eg : a For and a While loop are exactly the same when compiled down to asssembler/binary , so when reconstructing the code it would find ambiguity in some places ) . There are some programs like this to convert Windows . exe to C code for example , even if the original app was not made in C. <p> This kind of stuff is mostly how hackers do cracks for apps , they dissassemble the code and then edit it , to remove any protection , whatever . Anyway , there 's no way that OP can recover his code just from an ipa , you will have to write everyting again <p> This kind of stuff is mostly how hackers do cracks for apps , they dissassemble the code and then edit it , to remove any protection , whatever .

Any business worth anything will seek trademarks , copyrights , and/or patents to protect their intellectual property . <p> Not sure if there is any way within your app to prevent it from being copied , but I 'd suggest just keep searching the web every now and then and when you see someone hosting a pirated copy of your app , send them a threatening email .

@@98149804 @2349804/ <h> Adding Subviews to custimize a keyboard <p> ****** IMPORTANT******* Inside the code segements , some code i had was causing the code blocks to mess up and cut out code , so please not that when i write hasPrefix : @ ( lessThen ) UIKeyboard the ( lessThen ) should be replaced by the actual symbol . so like this hasPrefix : @&lt;UIKeyboard. *********************** <p> LONG ... * There is a code example a few posts down that has all this code in it * LONG ... <p> This tutorial will show an example of how to add content to a UIKeyboard by adding a custom button . The following will show you how to add a decimal button to the numeric keyboard so you can enter decimal values without having to use a full keyboard . The key idea to understand here is that although the UIKeyboard is not directly available to us through the current iPhone SDK , we can still reference an instance of the keyboard using its base class . <p> UIKeyboard is a subclass of UIView . This is handy because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like below : <p> myView addSubview:subview ; <p> This is how we will add a button to our keyboard , by referencing the keyboard and adding a subview . <p> In my program I only had one keyboard and on text area to use the keyboard , so the following code worked fine for me . This example is not robust enough to handle multiple keyboard and multiple text areas but hopefully it gives you a good idea how things work . <p> STEP 1 : Finding the UIKeyboard <p> The first thing we have to do is actually get a reference to the UIKeyboard . If your application uses a keyboard , you will find that they keyboard is not actually inside the UIWindow you create in your applicationDelegate , but in a separate UIWindow that is automatically generated . Each iPhone application you create has an array of windows . The example below shows you how to reference an item in your applications array of UIWindows . <p> The code above works fine if you know what window you want to reference . I am not 100% sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , but in general it is better to write smart code that can automatically find each window , instead of writing working code once and hoping that conditions never change . With that said let 's take a look at the following code example . The code blow shows how to iterate through each window in our applications <p> So now that we are able to loop through all of our application windows , we are ready to starting looking for the UIKeyboard . As mentioned before , UIKeyboard is a subclass of UIView . This is helpful because each UIWindow has an array of its subviews . All we have to do now is loop through each subview of the current window . We can do this with a nested for loop . Below is an extended version of the code above that will show you how to iterate through all the subviews in a window . <p> Now we are at the point where we can look for the view that contains the keyboard . There are a couple of ways you can check the content/type of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prefix of the view description . Through debugging I found out that a UIKeyboard description starts with the text " &lt;UIKeyboard " . Knowing this it is very easy to figure out if we have found the right view , by checking the description of each view we find in the code above . We can check the description of the view by using the hasPrefix method . This method will return YES if the string we are comparing against has the same prefix ( beginning ) as the text we provide . The following code is the complete extension of the last 2 examples . It shows how we iterate though each view for each window in our application and how to check each view to see if it contains our keyboard . Note how you can use the description of a view to determine its contents . <p> So there you have it . Using a couple simple loops , we can reference our keyboard . Next , we need to add content . <p> STEP 2 : Adding a custom button to the keyboard . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboard . Adding a custom button is actually really simple . All we need to do is add a subview to the keyboard view . Below is the code that I use in my application to add a peroid to my numeric keypad keyboard . Keep in mind that we are referencing the keyboard directly , so position 0 , 0 is not the top left of your screen , rather the top left of the keyboard . Remeber that the variable keyboard is the UIView we found in step1 . <p> The code is just as simple as adding any other button . The button has 2 images , one for when its not clicked and one for when it is . When the button is pressed I want to update my textbox by appending a ' . ' which is show in the code below . <p> Now this was a little bit more difficult in my case then what I showed , that is because where I add the button , and where the buttons textarea target are in 2 different classes . But there are plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forums so i wont get into that . If I can figure out how I will include the 2 images I used for this button in this tutorial so that anyone who wants to use them can . <p> STEP 3 : Where does all this code go ? <p> So here comes the point where I tell you that I am not 100% sure that what I am about to write is the best way to do things . There are most likely better places to add buttons to your text boxes , I just did it the following way . It will work fine , but you are more then welcome/encouraged to find a better solution . <p> Using notifications we can easily find out when a keyboard is about to be shown and attach a method to that event . Because a keyboard can not be show without this method being called , I figured it would be a good place to reference the keyboard . This way we do n't  waste any time creating a custom keyboard if the user never uses a textarea . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured it was a good spot because it will live as long as my application does . Below is the first thing you need to do . As mention before , I wanted to listen for the notification of when the keyboard will be shown . The following line of code shows how to do this . <p> As seen above , i just told my application that each time the keyboard is shown , I want to call the method keyboardWillShow . This method is where all the code from step 1 and 2 is held . As mentioned this method sits inside of my app delegate . The follow code is what my appDelegate looks like . As you can see I have a function keyboardWillShow that handles events due the the code above . Each time the keyboard is to be shown we will add our button . The way i have done things , if you do not do this each time , the button will not persist . I hope this all makes sense . <p> If you have any questions let me know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written so I understand if it was confusing . I 've also included a screen shot of the keyboard and the images for the buttons you can use to add a decimal . <p> I subclassed UITextField and want to share this ... Make sure that you import the AudioToolBox framework ! And copy the sound file to your project . The textField has to be of the type " NumberPad " . Otherwise it will look weird . This will also work with multiple textFields . <p> Attached is a quick little example project I made as per the request above . <p> I also included some code that moves the screen up and down as the keyboard is shown so that the textfield is never hidden . <p> The code is pretty much the same as the tutorial so its not super commented cause i wrote it quickly right now . <p> Let me know if there are any problems Thanks <p> This was a great Example Project , but it did n't do exactly what I needed for my App . Once I figured it out , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions . I also made it a little more Interface Builder friendly . <p> Thanks keyboardCowboy and brygruver ! You 're awesome . But I have this Question . Does any one has solved the cursor position problem ? What I mean is , suppose you write " 1234567890 " and then you press " . " and everything goes perfect . But how about inserting " . " somewhere else rather than the tail ? for example in order to write " 1234567.89 " you will have to delete 8 and 9 and then write " . " and then write " 89 " again . I know this is something it has to be with UIKeyboard , which 3rd party programmers are not allowed to play with . But maybe there is a good idea someone could have ... Any thoughts ? : D <p> In case of UITextView I think can calculate the actual position by a function of the tapped possition , and current font sizes . But I do n't know how accurate this method can be . I case of UITextField I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of UITextView I think can calculate the actual position by a function of the tapped position , and current font sizes . But I do n't know how accurate this method can be . I case of UITextField I am not sure whether I can do it . <p> Normally you do n't need to know the cursor position ahead of the keypress . The cursor position becomes available to you when the key is pressed . So assuming you can generate a real keypress event instead of using the method from the example , do the usual thing ... <p> Just implement a UITextFieldDelegate and in particular the method : <p> LONG ... <p> The range corresponds to the current cursor position and the string corresponds to the pressed key . If you want to allow the keypress at the given cursor position , return YES . If you do n't like it , just return NO . If you want to substitute something in place of the pressed key , use something like <p> Of course , since there 's no publicly documented way to generate a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck ! <p> Oh wait , never mind ... In just poking around , I see there 's a handy method/property if you use a UITextView instead of a UITextField : <p> myTextView selectedRange <p> That may be helpful , if you can dress up the text view to look more like a text field , and add the clear button to it , and so forth .... I still do n't understand why this method is n't available in a text field . It 's obviously very handy . <p> I used brygruver blog method , and I have it working except it only adds the decimal point to the same textfield . If you have an interface with 4 textfields ( textfield1 , texfield 2 ... texfield4 ) . How do you say in the - ( void ) addDecimal : ( NSNotification * ) notification Method to append the ' . ' to the selected textfield ? ? <p> This is great ! Im having a problem though .

Your code is formatted poorly , which makes it very hard to follow ( you need both pre and code tags on any multi-line code you post . ) <p> Next , any time you read something from NSUserDefaults , what you get is ALL immutable objects . <p> You can take a mutable array of mutable dictionaries containing mutable strings , write it to user defaults , and read it back . What you get back is an immutable array of immutable dictionaries containing immutable strings . <p> The code you posted in your didSelectRowAtIndexPath method is reading an array from user defaults , then getting a dictionary from that array , then fetching a string . <p> You never posted any code that tries to save changes back to your structure however . Nor do you post the code that generates the line <p> Yes I understand that objects sent to UserDefaults become immutable and that they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe that I have done that but must be overlooking something . <p> The code that attempts to save changes back to the structure is contained within viewWillDisappear of DetailViewController . It works fine on the first pass but fails on subsequent passes . <p> The code that generates " buttonArray class of type is : NSArray - dictionary class of type is : NSMutableDictionary " is simply an NSLog statement within viewWillDisappear of DetailViewController . I was verifying that the dictionary was still mutable prior to calling the setObject statement for the dictionary . <p> Let 's try this again with properly formatted code ... <p> I have a modal view ( ListViewController ) which contains navigation controller and tableview . The tableview pushes a view to DetailViewController : <p> Just because you cast buttonDict as NSMutableDictionary does not mean it is actually an NSMutableDictionary . Anything you get from that buttonArray will be immutable because it is coming from NSUserDefaults . To get a mutable dictionary , you need to call mutableCopy . <p> buttonArray will only contain immutable objects . So when you call objectAtIndex : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call mutableCopy and then call setObject:forKey : on the object returned from that . <p> Also the reason that your NSLog states NSMutableDictionary is that NSDictionary is a class cluster and it might not return an instance of the class you think you should get . 11624 @qwx871624

Like everything else it can be abused ; however , I am not convinced it is n't a clean way to handle asynch server events . Additionally , one can use " object " to interrogate the source and make sure that the receiver should process it . One can also use " userInfo " to inspect data that can also be structured to ensure proper and approved handling . The article offers food for thought and I want to take another pass over it but I am not seeing a reason to completely throw out this pattern that Apple has provided in favor of 3rd party code or more esoteric handling ( at least not yet ) . <p> Right . It does have a purpose . However , handling async network request responses is not one of them . Any object can register to receive notifications for a certain key . Even worse , any object can send notifications for that same key . That means Object A can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B , C , Z , XYZ receive it , when maybe B was the only one that should do it . Even worse , Object X can send an event , and B would receive it while it was waiting for an event from Object A. There is also no guarantee that anyone is listening , which is probably not something you want when making network request . Concept of promises has been around for decades , it is hardly esoteric . They also make writing tests much easier . <p> To me everything presented can easily be controlled . From interrogating the object to the data structure that is passed . However , I would quickly add that this is in the context of a developer and not of a team . Perhaps the issues mentioned are a bigger challenge and more apparent if we are talking a team of people working on a single app . As a single developer working on app these issues are either very remote or have to be the result of very sloppy work . When you post or receive you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object if you want to go further with that notion . Then you have to consume the data structure that comes with it ( I am assuming there is a data expectation here ) and of course to consume that data it has to be of a specific structure . I am having a very hard time seeing how to screw this up although again I can understand the dynamics would be more complicated if we are talking a team of people . <p> Frankly the biggest issue I see with notifications is properly removing yourself as an observer . Not doing so can cause the observer to fire multiple times . I am not sure of the case for a single observer to need to observe the same event more than once at a time but Apple allows it . Again not property removing/adding yourself is the real risk I have seen with this approach . <p> I do appreciate the alternative approach as I will admit it never occurred me to do it any other way .

Just would like to ask the first question , how do i perform step 2 using storyboard ? <p> In my XIB Sample code , the file owner is TrainViewController and WritingViewController is added into the XIB as shown in the picture below . and the IBOUTLET " Sign " from TrainViewController is connected to WritingViewController . Note : i annotated wrongly on the picture should be TrainViewController instead of TrainingViewController . <p> So in my Storyboard which i am trying to replicate the same code , i created two view controller scene which is TrainViewController as well as WritingViewController . I am unable to link the IBOUTLET " Sign " to WritingViewController as i believe they are not " link " like in the XIB sample code where the WritingViewController is in the same XIB as the TrainViewController.

If you are unable to submit an update within 30 days , your app will be removed from the App Store until you submit an update and it is approved . <p> If Your App is Removed Your app will remain fully functional for current users . They will experience no interruption to services , will still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app while restoring from an iCloud or iTunes backup . However , we recommend that you update your app as soon as possible to reinstate it on the App Store and ensure that it remains functional and engaging for new and existing customers . <p> You can continue to use your current app name , as your app has not been deleted from your account . <p> One of my friends who 's has a Developer account with old apps in it for years ( but never bothered to update them ) had 3 of his apps get the notice today . He 's only making $30 a month off of about 10-15 apps and will just let them drop off as the notices come in . <p> My guess is this is going to kill a TON of junk apps on the App Store . Finally ! <p> This changes would be good if Apple did it right . Does anybody have doubts that Apple 's geniuses behind their backends wo n't screw up ? So here we go . <p> I 've got 2 of those emails for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fair enough . I actually removed them myself . Today I 've got 2 emails for apps that I published in April 2013 , that have retina displays support , that work flawlessly on all the phones and OSes , including iOS10 .. Why ? Why do I need to update those ? Of course I can simply recompile and send the " update " , no big deal for me . What about those who actually pay somebody to manage and upload their apps ? If the app is fine , why should they now hire developers just because Apple ( seemingly randomly ) decided to remove the apps for no reason . The apps were published in 2013 .. <p> Funny enough , I have old and obscured apps on the SAME account that were never updated since 2009 , no retina display and so forth , I do n't even know if they work on latest devices . Of course I did n't get any email for those . Funny enough , the apps they sent the notices come in 2 flavors : free and paid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " does n't get the notice . <p> I just imagine how some " yes-man " manager at Apple reports up " we have finished implementing new feature " .. While the developers underneath sat on their a$$es and did nothing , they just implemented few quick-and-dirty " algorithms " to pick random apps and that 's it . So some devs will be thrown under the bus , while the rest of the junk will stay .. Or are they gon na require updates for all the apps released 2013 and prior ? there were 1.5 millions apps . Can they deal with 1 million updates/month ? No ? Then somebody gets unlucky ( as usual ) and the th$t stays . <p> I , personally , do n't care , but there are people who paid for their apps to be developed , polished and published . These apps work fine , but sometimes you ca n't just recompile the app , because the libraries get outdated , every release of Swift language the code breaks , etc .. So again the developers needs to be hired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time will soon come when some anti-trust regulators should take a good look at Apple 's policies . <p> Got the notice . Looks like I will have to update an app I issued in Mid 2013 . App no longer gets much revenue . May just let it die . Or do what @dre mentions ... do an update with the latest Xcode version and hope for the best . FWIW , the app works fine . <p> Yeah its good there are cleaning out the store . Sometimes you need a good spring cleaning to clear out junk . <p> Overall it is a good idea . But seriously , I do n't think it will improve discoverability . Most of those " dead " apps no longer show up in iTunes Search , due to the lack of downloads and reviews . Those are not the apps clogging the system . As they are long gone and forgotten . <p> I removed an app of mine in 2012 from sale . Now users updated to iOS 10 and the app does n't open anymore . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so now the users ca n't access the data anymore .

I was wondering when the user tap in the row I 'm creating only one instance of label and reusing it or it 's creating a new one every time the user tap the row and make memory leaks in my app ? <h> Replies <p> 1 . No , this is not the right approach . You should consider cell elements to be for display only , and should not be used for making decisions . You should use the index path to select appropriate data , and then use that data to make decisions . <p> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are referencing items that already exist . <p> No , that is not the way to do it . You should not query the data in the table view . The table view is a VIEW object . It 's for presenting information to the user , not saving state . <p> You should use the row ( or row and section , if you 're using sections ) to query your model and decide what to do from there . If your data is in an SQL database then you would ask the database for the value at that index . <p> Your code does not have any memory leaks ; You are fetching the value of a label in an existing table view cell , so you are not creating a new object . <p> However , table view cells are transient . As soon as the user scrolls to a different part of your table , that cell will scroll of the screen and eventually be recycled to display data for a different entry in your model . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> sorry , actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is holding data from my database not to get it , let 's say I open my uiview and it loads data into my uitableview from my server , then the row description will hold the item description and Label I 'd will hold the item i 'd from my mysql server after loads the information , then let 's say if the row 0 has i 'd label = newPeople then ... will open a new uiview of new people after the user tap in this row . what I mean is every item will have i 'd for sure because it will be a list of services that will not change . <p> so , looking at this way , is that correct way to compare when the user tap the row ?

( label == string ) code above . <p> My previous post still stands . No , it is not the correct way . You should not store data in view objects . It 's bad design . If your data comes down from a remote server , cache it locally in an array . Use the array to compare and see if the strings match . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> sure Duncan ... Thanks for the advice .. if you do n't mind another question , I still quite confused .. sorry Im just doing my first app and working with ios about 4 months only ... anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array and then put it in a tableview ? if yes , what could be the best option for me after the tableview receives the list data , to recognize what type of service the user tap/selected into the tableview ... I do n't  want the I 'd of the service to be showing in the tableview , only the description . So let 's say he selected row 2 has service Add New it will open the uiview for add new . I understand it would be just fine create a UIbutton and set segue to the view and let 's say user click button1 goes to new , button 2 goes to view add ..... but my list is kind of big it would be a lot of button , do n't like it . <p> I would create model objects and put the necessary data within those . Then create an array of those model objects that will be used to populate the information in your tableview . By using the selected index of a cell selected , you can retrieve the proper object with all of the data you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type of segue to perform . It sounds like you should look into MVC pattern in iOS . <p> Brian . what I have is a tbale in my server with about 50 items with I 'd and Description . what I want is put this services in a tableview and when the user select the service Add New , I do n't  know in what row it will be because the list can grown , and the description can change any time , that 's why i have I 'd for each one . so he selected Add New , i need to check what is the I 'd of the item user selected and based on this information I 'll open the uiview for this item . so user select Add new , when he tap in this item code will see what I 'd is , let 's say the i 'd for the item selcted is ADN001 , then comes if statment if row selected has I 'd == ADN001 will open the uiview for Add New . ( but i do n't  want to show the i 'd info on my tableview ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working now using cell information , index path , it really became less of a pain ... and it was little bit more difficult because I am using the tableview in a UIViewController , so it took little longer to get all the context . thank you guys for all advices . <p> 1 . We can see if there is room for improvement or if there is something you 're doing that might not be the best thing - you learn more . 2 .

But maybe I should look at developing it for my PC first ? <p> I am trying to work out the best place to begin , the mechanics behind my game would be nowhere near as complicated as the one described in the OP though . My idea is based around a number of decisions that essentially lead to a story playing out in different ways . To start with I would be happy just developing the one story and outcome so I would essentially building an app that tells a story . All graphics used would be stationary backgrounds behind the text . <p> I do n't know if it is relevant but I have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Any pointers about where to start would be much appreciated there is so much choice out there , I just want to choose a path and stick to it . I am not expecting fast results , happy for this to take years <p> I would strongly recommend , if possible , to find somebody to work with - whether it be another coder , a designer ( or both ) - do n't worry about ' sharing ' rewards - 1/3 of potentially nothing is very little as @kkkkkkkk said .. <p> The reason that I believe finding others is so important is that people lose interest and are disheartened a lot more easily as an individual than as part of a team - imagine spending all of your free time for the next year working on something by yourself , without anyone to push you forward , motivate you , help with problems etc .. It will also reduce the timeframe drastically . 3 people in 4 months is much more fun than one person in a year ! <p> Here 's an idea - @strictlyt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2D side-scroller .. ? <p> I want to develop an iPhone game in a similar vein/complexity to say Metroid or Castlevania on the SNES , but with better graphical effects and of course touch controls , maybe some touch mini games or something as well . <p> I have no programming experience whatsoever . <p> A 2D scroller as your first project ?

@@98149836 @2349836/ <h> Expedite review has not accepted from Apple , need urgent help .. <p> I need your help urgently ! Please share your thoughts and help me to resolve this ! I 've uploaded an iPhone app ( new app ) in Apple app store a day ago . It is a company Apple registered account . I am legal person and asked to " Expedite " the app by filling out the form from the below linkRequest an Expedited App Review - App Store Resource Center <p> But , today i received an email from Apple like below , <p> " While we do our best to honor all requests for expedited reviews , we unfortunately can not accommodate your request at this time as it does not meet the criteria for expediting a review . " <p> What could be the reason that Apple not accepting our expedite request ? Do i need to pay anything ? From the above link , i sent them the request which does n't ask me to pay anything . Otherwise , what are the guide lines that i might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help me on this to resolve asap . As its very urgent to release our app quickly , i do n't have any idea why the Apple not doing expedite review . <h> Replies <p> Expedited reviews are only done if the app was just released and has a serious issue that needs to be resolved quickly . There is no way they would do it for a new app that has n't even been released yet . <p> Hey dacapo , When you say the below two points , both are NOT applicable for newly first time uploaded apps right ? Because all others are saying , expedite is not possible for any new apps .. <p> 1 . A *critical* bug in a released that needs immediate correction . 2 . A *time sensitive* event that the app absolutely needs to be live by , maybe like a conference app or something like that . <p> I do n't have personal experience with #2 , but I would assume it would work with new apps if the app itself is clearly targeted to go live with a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some random date that your app needs to go live on . ) <p> I agree with the others that the ship has already sailed for you , but forums are not just about answering specific questions , they 're also for sharing knowledge . So , hopefully it 'll help someone else . <p> If you *really* need to get it live , it ca n't really hurt to reply to them and ask for a reconsideration due to reasons A , B , C. If it works , please do report back ! ( But to be clear , you 're essentially asking to jump your place in line , so you 'd better have a good reason . ) <p> I had one done in 4 hours from time of request to approval . It was for a crashing problem in an older model of iphone . I 've also had them denied , and that was for lesser problems . <p> They say you are limited to the amount of expedited reviews they can do for you , but i submit one everytime I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also mention I think this could be a showstopper for users . <p> New apps can be expedited , but only ( as has been mentioned ) if they 're time sensitive , such as coinciding with an already-paid-for TV advertising slot that ca n't be shifted , or to coincide with a physical book launch ( just two examples ) . <p> I 've seen them go through . But if you 're a ' first-timer ' , you would probably have to prove your worth , whereas if you are Chillingo or similar , or a carrier , they 'd sit up and take notice . <p> While this thread is a little old , I wanted to add our recent experience with the expedite review request . We submitted an expedite review request for v1.2 of our app ( LocalSpin ) because we had some issues after Facebook changed their API . This was a saturday . Monday morning we received an email saying the expedite request was approved and by Monday night the App was ready for sale . So pretty quick . We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard that if you try it too often they wo n't allow it . Hope this helps . <p> I have used expedited review requests multiple times for legitimate issues , and they were approved each time . If I remember correctly , it took them about a day to get back to me then another day to review the app . So , pretty quick . <p> I 'm resurrecting this thread - just in case anyone ends up searching for expedited reviews from Apple , and ends up here , as I did . <p> I want to say I got an expedited review from my work account for reason #2 - a new app , that needed to be in place before a board meeting . And that was approved to be expedited , and it did get reviewed the same day . Well that app had already been approved except for a metadata issue that needed to be corrected . <p> Now just a little while ago , from my personal developer account , I asked for an expedited review , citing an upcoming meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a board meeting , but it got rejected as not being a valid reason . <p> I then submitted another request for an expedited review based on a bug issue , and they said they would be on holiday December 21 - 28th and they would considered expedite review requests when they return from Holiday . <p> Well - the only problem with that is they said this on December 18th , meaning effectively they are shutdown for Holiday now - December 18th - 28th , since they are not processing expedited review requests already . <p> Right now it 's probably more likely that they do n't have the manpower for it . Everyone and their brother is cramming updates/new apps in right now before the shutdown . Last year ( and it seems this year again ) they pulled all the reviewers they could in to get review times up and get more done before the shutdown . <p> That said , I do n't blame them for cutting off expedited right now . They 've likely got the team that does expedited reviews also helping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Silus , I imagine it 's crazy manic in the review team right now . Every app/update we 've put up in the last two weeks has been sucked up for review and most come through ( esp updates ) in quick time . I 've got 3 more updates left so will be interesting to see if they make it . Did think about throwing my next app up their tomorrow just to see if that gets through by Friday

The code I wrote takes a desired precision , rounds the number to that precision , then strips trailing zeros. 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623

@@98149846 @2349846/ <h> Converting unsigned char array to NSString <p> Hi , I 'm trying to store a unsigned char array to a my iOS device but having slight difficulty . I need to be able to store this data to the device and read it back when the app launches and have decided the easiest way to do this is to store it in NSUserDefaults . <p> The issue i 'm having is that I ca n't seem to convert the unsigned char array into an NSString .

Log your NSString " string " to make sure you are getting it back correctly from NSUserDefaults . <p> Secondly , the docs state that the call cStringUsingEncoding will return nil if the string ca n't be losslessly converted to the desired encoding . <p> You might want to use NSUTF8StringEncoding instead , since that can convert any arbitrary string to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method **38;1163;TOOLONG : , which will return bytes for the string , skipping those unicode characters that ca n't be encoded in the specified encoding . Note that that method does not add a trailing null byte to the end of the data . You would need to append that null byte yourself if you are going to use it as a C string . <p> Thanks , this works perfectly - however , I have issues intermittently with this approach . <p> Is there a better way to store an unsigned char to the iPhone and load this up when required ?

Your method compares the result of multiplying the value by 10 until it 's an integer , which is likely to display rounding errors . The code I wrote takes a desired precision , rounds the number to that precision , then strips trailing zeros. 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623

When you say @synthesize dgBankController2 , the synthesizes a setter named setDgBankController2 . The first letter of the property is turned to upper case when the " set " is placed before it . So when you tried to send the selector " setDGBankController2 " , you were referring to a method that does not exist . <p> It uses the variable name you supplied but adds the word ' set ' to it and also capitalises the first letter of your variable so it sticks to camelCase rules .

You should use doubles , not floats , to do math on latitudes and longitudes .

You ask it to start updating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at some time in the future . <p> You have to wait for it to call you back . Even when it does call you back , you have to check the results that it gives you . The first reading from the GPS is usually a cached reading from the last time you used it , and may be hours or days old , and very wrong . You have to check the timestamp on the location readings and reject readings that are more than a couple of seconds old . Even after you get actual GPS readings , the first readings can be off by kilometers . It takes a while for the GPS to settle down and give reasonable readings . You have to check the horizontal accuracy reading and make sure it is decent . How accurate depends on your application . You certainly want it to be 500 meters or less in any case . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> Hello , I made a method as you suggested and i am getting a complier error on the method as i convert the UILabel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type float .

Some of my apps are literally 1/4 of what they were last year in terms of downloads , apps that got 4000+ downloads , now have 1000+ downloads a year , I know that does n't seem much over a year , but there are several apps , apps that have been around ages , and have been regularly updated . I started back in 2010 , and I believe 2013-2014 was a particularly good year for app development , and up until the middle of this year , it was n't so bad either . <p> When I look at the graphs , it does point to the September changes that Apple made , they have all but nerfed me completely , I look at the app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often the ones preceeding 50 characters do not have important keywords . <p> It 's been a rollercoaster ride in this business that 's for sure , but if things do not improve in a couple of months , i 'll be bowing out , demotivated and destroyed basically ! It 's nice to look back and think of what you enjoyed during app development but it 's so damn frustrating when the carpet is forever being pulled from underneath you , if you try to update the app , they knock you down anyway for losing ratings , it 's a lose-lose situation . <p> I am pretty sure ever since they sped up review times , that downloads have been worse as well , maybe just a coincidence , or maybe it 's just allowed more people to spam the store ... <p> What do you do ? Look at an app or game that has dropped since September , update it and hope for the best ? Rinse and repeat ? Is that the solution ? <h> Replies <p> at this point , I wish it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from then on , I lost 20% a month , so besides the normal summer slow down , it was 10 times worse , I literally had zero sales in the US one day Sept. which had never happened in the 6 or 8 years of developing .. also Europe and the US switched , then I was getting more downloads in Europe for several random days , which has never happened in the 6 or 8 years . <p> I also noticed that on the 1st of every month for the past year or so , it is like Apple flips a switch , on Oct 1st , suddenly a reversal , which continued for a month , Nov 1st , suddenly another reversal back ... literally on that day . unfortunately since it is so many apps in the app store , you will be lucky to get one of those months per two years to be in your favor . ( if that is what is happening ) <p> they appear to be randomly mixing the pot by suppressing apps , churning to see what bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app , on the second day , today , zero sales for all my other apps in the US. coincidence ? maybe US has not reported yet , I think not , I think Apple is taking total reviews , and total downloads as a company . dividing it by the number of apps you have , and determining , oh this company sucks ... look at how few reviews they have compared to last week , look how horrible this company is doing compared to yesterday , of course my new app has zero reviews , maybe fewer downloads , I ca n't tell , i 've had zero sales IN THE US. but Apple appears to think it is normal for developers to pay for reviews , and the normal fake momentum that companies pay to get on launch . so if you want to screw yourself over , release like two or three honest apps on the same day <p> want to do an interesting experiment . remove half of your apps from sale , the half with the fewest reviews .

A trust score is associated with your account that affects how reviewers asses your apps during " in review " . I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during review than submissions on the other account . I also get more rejections on the untrusted account . <p> 2 . Apple knows your likely download numbers based on the keywords and this affects the review process . My high download apps get rejected for silly reasons often whereas my extreme niche apps often only get opened and instantly approved . <p> I 've noticed a huge drop in sales the last 2 weeks . Anyone else seeing the same ? <p> Me too . For some reason the Downloads/PageViews ratio decreased significantly . <p> Do you think it may be because of the new search ... any keywords after the first 50 characters in the title , are ignored ? That 's the only obvious change that would affect our downloads . As for other reasons , Apple is not the most transparent company ... <p> I do n't think , that it 's my case , as by coincidence I updated my app at the day when they send the email , notifying about the future changes to the title length , so I had to shorten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than last weeks , however I 've been experimenting with keywords a lot , so probably that changed the picture .

Your map view delegate provides MKAnnotationView objects in response to a **25;1576;TOOLONG : delegate method . <p> An MKAnnotationView is a subclass of UIView , so you should be able to set its transform property to a rotation transform before returning it to the map view .

I have a controller with a subview that is composed of other subviews , if I want to trigger an event from the most nested subview to the controller do I have to set a delegate to every view in the hierachy ? Notifications can be better ? Thanks 11624 @qwx871624 <p> Well , thanks . I know how to use a UIButton , my question was just an example . Thinking about having subviews the only way is by propagating the controller ( or delegate ) ? Or NSNotification ? Is there some other way ? <p> I 'm sorry , I do n't get what you want to do . Can you explain a little bit more ? 11624 @qwx871624 <p> I 'm sorry , I do n't get what you want to do . Can you explain a little bit more ? <p> Sure , so I have a controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe this has a subview too . If I use the delegate I have to pass to all of them , fromt the controller to the most nested subview . I was wondering if there was some kind of way to catch from the controller the events triggered from any subview without passing itself as a delegate . <p> p.s : I know NSNotification , not sure is what I want to use in this case <p> If the innermost view does not handle the event , it will automatically be forwarded upwards its superviews , and if any of these views have a viewController , it will also be given the chance to handle the event before it is passed to the view 's superview . This is called the Responder Chain So , in other words , you can choose to handle the events in your view controller , as long as it has n't been already handled/consumed by the view / control that actually receives it <p> Sure , so I have a controller that has a subview , this subview has another subview and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate I have to pass to all of them , fromt the controller to the most nested subview . I was wondering if there was some kind of way to catch from the controller the events triggered from any subview without passing itself as a delegate . <p> p.s : I know NSNotification , not sure is what I want to use in this case <p> It sounds to me like you do n't understand how view ownership and target/action works . <p> A view controller manages a whole view hierarchy . It can have many levels of views inside views , inside views . In fact , it usually does . All those views can be thought of as belonging to the view controller . <p> When you edit a nib file or storyboard entry for a view controller , the " files owner " object for the whole view hierarchy is the view controller . When you control-drag from a button to the view controller , you make an action our outlet connection between the button and the view controller , regardless of how many levels down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user taps a button , the button gets the tap event , and then triggers a target/action message directly to the view controller . The button does n't need to care that it 's inside a scroll view , that 's inside a container view , that 's inside another container view , that 's finally inside the view controller 's content view . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> Ah the subviews could be reused in other views hierarchy , but I guess that does n't change much . <p> Standard UIView objects do not have a delegate property . You would have to create a whole family of custom subclasses of UIView that all support a delegate protocol in order to propagate messages up to your view controller . The minute you tried to a stock UIKit view , or a third party custom view , to your view hierarchy , your scheme would break down . <p> So , you 've got a scheme that 's complex and difficult to set up , requires a complex set of connections to make it work , and will only work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Edit . You said : <p> Ah the subviews could be reused in other views hierarchy , but I guess that does n't change much . <p> /QUOTE <p> I 'm not quite sure what you mean by reuse . <p> A view can only be a subview of a single view . It can only appear at one place in your view hierarchy . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> Why are you building your view hierarchy manually ? That 's a lot of work the first time you do it , and a nightmare to maintain . Interface Builder ( and now Storyboards ) are your friend . Learn to use them . <p> It 's worth hand-building your UI once , the same way it 's worth learning to write assembler code : So you can learn the gory details . However , creating your view hierarchy by hand really is the equivalent of writing all your code in assembler . Tedious , time-consuming , error-prone , and hard to maintain . ( I speak from experience . I have a number of years of assembler programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original IBM PC in DOS 1.0 purely in 8086 assembler. ) 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> I 'm building my views programmatically cause I think it can give me more control , but I agree it 's really old style : - ) <p> My subviews are the ones with controls like buttons ( or custom controls ) , so the controller class does n't see directly the button . So either I pass a custom delegate ( that is the controller itself ) or I expose every UI element as a property in the view , so the controller could access them . The idea is that any custom view class could be used in different hierarchies , not making any assumption on what level they are and what controller added them . <p> Looking on the web I found a solution that is ok with what I 'm doing but I do n't really like it . So basically get the corresponding UIViewController from a subview . Again , I do n't think it 's a good solution . Are there good alternatives ? Thanks

If you see my code this will become clearer . <p> As you can see , I have a reference to nameTextView inside nameCell.h . This is the element I want to access .

I have used the code tags , not sure why its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a text view property defined in the cell , so accessing it will just be a matter of cell nameTextView . So if I understand your question , you do n't know how to access the cells . See the UITableView documentation under the " Accessing Cells and Sections " area . <p> Seems like you should be using IBOutlets in your . nib cell and connect your textfield to some public property @property ( nonatomic , strong ) IBOutlet UITextField *textField ; <p> Then , you may need to introduce some delegate method for the table cell itself e.g. ' NameCellDelegate " . Set your parent tableView controller as the delegate with some method **26;1675;TOOLONG : ( NSString* ) value forCellAtIndexPath : ( NSIndexPath* ) indexPath . <p> Set your table cell as the UITextFieldDelegate of the textfield contained in the cell . When the user finishes editing the field , have that table cell inform it 's delegate that text has been entered . To get the indexpath.row of the textfield , simply use the . tag field of your table cell view / textfield to store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellForRowAtindexPath : " <p> Store that value off into an array locally at the index of the incoming cells row value . <p> Thank you both for the replies . I began looking in to calling my date picker from a button press last night and was able to do it successfully using a custom Delegate . <p> IronChef , your making complete sense to me there . I began thinking about using Delegates in this way last night so what you 've written is more than enough to get me started.As I have many textview cells , approximately 11 , I was thinking of making one delegate which all cells using a textview could implement . This would let me return the value of each textfield and store them in a dictionary using the row as the key.I would then be able to repopulate the textviews inside each cell using this dictionary

But Apple has refused to remove any of these reviews in EVERY SINGLE case . I just do n't understand how some of you are getting reviews removed . Are you just getting lucky and happen to be getting someone sympathetic to look at your case ?

It 's a great tool . You can set breakpoints , and use the " build and debug " version on a debug build of your app to trace through it . Make sure you use a debug build , because a release build gets optimized to the point where the debugger ca n't figure out what source lines correspond with the currently executing machine code . <p> As to the flow of control , that is a little complex . <p> iOS , like Mac OS , is event-driven . Your app has a main() function that gets called , just like in vanilla C. After that the similarities are few , however . If you look at your app 's main.m file , you will see a call to UIApplicationMain() . That method starts your app 's event loop , which is system code that looks for system and user events , and dispatches them to your app as needed . There is no obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point c . <p> Your application delegate 's +initialize method will get called very early in the launch process ( if you have an +initialize method . ) Your app delegate will get an **29;1703;TOOLONG message after its nib-file is opened and all the outlets and actions are connected up . After that , the flow of control will vary depending on how your app is structured and what the user does . If you have your app create a navigation controller , it 's root view controller will get an init message ( or an initWithCoder message if it was created from a nib file ) and then a -viewDidLoad message . You should then get a -viewWillAppear message before the view controller 's view is displayed . <p> In order to trace through your code , you have to learn about the conventions of iOS and the sequence of calls the system makes to your app. 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623

I 'm teaching iOS development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how others handle various topics . <p> As it happens , I just got the LaMarche beginning and advanced iOS 6 books yesterday from Amazon , and opened the box this morning . <p> As for making your parent a delegate of the child , follow the pattern I use in my sample . Create a parent VC protocol . ( Let 's call it ParentVCProtocol . ) Make the parent conform to that protocol . Add a delegate property to the child , and declare the delegate property as also conforming to your protocol : <p> @property ( nonatomic , weak ) i 'd &lt;ParentVCProtocol&gt; delegate ; <p> Then in your parent view controller , as you set up the child and add it as a child , also set yourself up as the delegate : <p> newChildVC.delegate = self ; <p> That should do it . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> Then in the button handler I already had , ( or whever you want to call it ) you call the parent method by using the code : self.delegate **28;2565;TOOLONG ; <p> I was n't done until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . h file , and then create the method to do whatever I want to do in the parent . m file : - ( void ) **28;2632;TOOLONG //do thing <p> Then the last thing to do to make it all work - after my parent view controller instantiates the child view controller , do the following : **32;2662;TOOLONG = self ; <p> As I said , I added the code to the button handler on the child window , so my button on the child view calls a function on the parent via delegation .

That is flat wrong . <p> Creating a user interface in code is tedious and error-prone . It 's also a maintenance nightmare in the making .

@@98149907 @2349907/ <h> In App Purchase review time ? <p> We recently had an app released but forgot to include an IAP in it for review . So , now the app is out , but without the IAP - it simply does nothing when you try to purchase something . We sent a mail to Apple about an expedited review on the IAP , but got back a reply that the app was already cleared for sale ( in other words they did n't even bother to read what we wrote ) . <p> So now that the IAP is " In Review " " Waiting for review " , does it take as long as an app review ? I guess it 's probably quite unusual to submit an IAP for review after the app itself is released ... <p> Ouch , really ? That 's horrible . Just 5 minutes after the app went cleared for sale we had customers emailing us " I want to give you my money but I ca n't " . And Apple is no help at all . And we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there goes my holiday bonus . <p> You have the option to remove your app from sale , until you get IAP approval .

But that would create another review cycle . But at least it would be a clean release . <p> Yeah , we 've gone over the options here and none look appealing . We 'll probably just hold out and wait for the IAP to be approved . What really pisses me off is how Apple did n't even read our message and automatically dismissed us because the app was already cleared for sale .

We know it is cleared for sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected the first time because of a technicality , when we submitted a new version we simply forgot to also re-submit the IAP . This ca n't be the first time that happens , but without being able to reach Apple or roll back to a previous version I have pretty much screwed us over . <p> I totally understand your anger and frustration . When it comes to the review process the pendulum swings both ways . <p> Yes , the reviewer should have caught the fact that you had not uploaded the IAP . If this had been a stringent review , they would have . But at times the review can be as slack as opening and closing the app , just to see/make sure it does not crash . So , for those who are careful in their coding , and prefer Apple to not nitpick the review process , these types of reviews are a Godsend . In your case it obviously backfired . <p> I too once submitted an app without an IAP . It was rejected , as the reviewer could not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what should have happened to you too . <p> Unfortunately , there 's no resetting the clock , and yes , you should have been granted that expedited review ... but with Apple , it can be somewhat of a crapshoot .

If apple does n't catch that then I suppose there is n't much hope that they regularly check that the bugs at the center of the request actually exist .

The question is whether the position data ever actually has any significant information beyond the first 3 or 4 decimal places . <p> I have n't ever looked at the CoreLocation data , so I ca n't attest to what the data looks like .

On rare occasions , when I am standing in the middle of an open field holding the phone in the air and the wind is blowing in the right direction ( yes , my neighbors do think I 'm nuts ) I can get an accuracy of about 17m ( as reported by CoreLocation ) - that 's acceptable but it only happens rarely .

Coordinates in the location manager use double PRECISION numbers , which are able to describe numbers to 14 or 15 decimal places of precision . That does not mean that they are that accurate . Far from it !

I have found that a " typical best " accuracy is around 55 feet . Sometimes , but rarely , I will get an accuracy of 29 feet . Accuracy values of 125 feet , 250 feet , or even greater , are also pretty common , even after the GPS has a chance to settle down .

The app has a tab bar with many navigation tableviews on each tab . The main tableview ( recipes ) has many view controllers with each having it 's nib file ( detail view ) . So I would need to implement the bookmark button to each view controller . I have done that in ( photo 1 ) . <p> I have two questions to continue with your instructions : <p> FIRST QUESTION- Regarding the bookmark button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code is inside a viewcontroller of the first recipe ) <p> My question in that matter is How do I link the action to the bookmark button ? I 've always used Interface Builder to link buttons , but there is no reference of the button in IB when I open the nib for this viewcontroller . So I do n't know if I should declare the outlet of the button or not because it may be already be created . ( I think it 's a confusion of doing it programatically and in iB ) <p> SECOND QUESTION- Regarding the new favorites array I created . I have created it in the main root controller . It 's important to tell you that I have all of my recipes in an array called " listOfItems " , that is my main data source . So here is the code to create that favorites array and add the listOfItems ( is it OK ? ) : *all of this is done in the ViewDidLoad method <p> First off declare your IBAction like this , it may be helpful in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> - ( IBAction ) addToFavorites : ( i 'd ) sender <p> In the IBAction you just declard , put the code that I wrote above inside of it . You link the IBAction and the button like you are doing it now . Do you see <p> action : @selector ( addToFavorites : ) ; <p> You are telling it , whenever this button is pressed called that method . <p> Do n't create the array in viewDidLoad . Do n't declare it in your header file . Put all that code that I wrote in your IBAction . <p> Basically this is what is happening . You are telling your button to call the IBAction method called addToFavorites . The method addToFavorites is checking whether or not an array has been created and stored in NSUserDefaults . If an array has n't been created , it creates one and stores it . Then , after we can guarantee that the favoritesArray has been created , we retrieve it from NSUserDefaults . All objects that come out of NSUserDefaults are NON mutable . So we need to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we can immediately get rid of and not have to worry about releasing anymore . After that , we add the currently selected recipe to it . Then , we save the favoritesArray to NSUserDefaults. 11624 @qwx871624 <p> Great ! ! ! , my button is now working . It 's good to know that the code above ( creation and saving to favorites in NSuserDefaults ) is all inside the IBAction , that way the message is done directly which makes more sense now . The one thing I seem to be missing is Adding the recipe , finding the correct path I think . <p> Okay what you want to do is add the recipe that the user wants to add to favorites into the favorites array . You say that you have one view with a list of recipes and then they click on the recipe which brings them to a detailed view . The add to favorites button is in the detailed view I assume . What you need to do is somehow find out which recipe the user selected , find it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorites array . <p> I 'm not going to write any more major code because it 's not going to help you out in the long run . 11624 @qwx871624 <p> Okay what you want to do is add the recipe that the user wants to add to favorites into the favorites array .

Could you please post an example from your final solution ? The class file would be extremely helpful but a few code snippets would probably suffice .

It could be as simple as : <p> myObject setFavorite:YES ; <p> It could also be a fair bit more complicated . Totally depends on your data . <p> Agreed . I only skimmed this thread . The last time I added favorites to a project ( our Kevin and Kell cartoon reader ) I used Core Data , and just added a boolean favorite flag to each item in my database . When the user clicks the favorite button , it toggles the favorite flag for that item . <p> The favorites screen just does a fetch on all records who 's favorite flag is true . 11625 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited yourself to object classes that can go into a plist , or you 've written a conversion method so that you can use that plist . Oh , and the user is choosing favorites from about 30K items .

If you had more experience , then you would already know the potential problems with your approach .

@@98149938 @2349938/ <h> Using Fetched Results Controller in Coredata One - Many Relationship <p> Attributes - customerName -&gt;&gt; monthNumber , amountDeposited I able to save and retrieve the data but am not able to categorize them into sections using **26;3362;TOOLONG and show them in a table View . <p> I have two tables and in one table I want to show customerName in the section and in another one I want to show the monthNumber . <p> Ok , the lack of code formatting confused me , so you can disregard what I said earlier about the code being wrong . <p> You are not doing an adequate job of explaining the problem . What is 20 ? What is 40 ? Where does it come from ? And I asked you for an example of what you are actually seeing right now , but you did not provide that . <p> Sorry about not being clear.I added transactions to the customer which is a to-many relationship.For instance i have added 6 customers and 3 transactions for each customer . I want the customer name in the header and the transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am getting only one row and only one transaction is being shown . <p> Notice that line 1 and 3 access the FRC the same way . Then you do it differently for 5 . These should all be the same . <p> In this particular case , it matters which way you do it , and #5 is the only correct one . #5 is the only one that calls your method here : <p> - ( **26;3390;TOOLONG * ) fetchedResultsController ... <p> The first two do not call this method . Since this method must be called in order to create the FRC in the first place , failing to call it means the FRC does not get created . You must be calling it from somewhere else , because in the code you have shown here , I 'm surprised you are getting any results at all . <p> This is the difference between instance variables and properties . And it is a difference that you absolutely must understand . This is not optional . <p> Lastly , your use of bracket syntax vs dot syntax : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For one thing , be consistent . Dot syntax is only supposed to be used for accessing properties . In this case , you have it exactly backwards . sections is a property , but count is not . So if you must use dot syntax , the correct way to do so would be : <p> I do n't believe you can achieve your goal using only an FRC . An FRC depends on a fetch request , and a fetch request can only fetch a single kind of entity . In this case , the entity that you want is the transaction . You would then be relying on the sort descriptor to adequately sort and section these transactions , but I do n't think you can do that with a relationship . <p> I think the easiest thing to do will be to continue to use the FRC with the customer as you are now , but then you will have to manually sort the transactions . You will also have to map between index paths in the table and index paths in the FRC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FRC so that it is not sectioning the results , simply sorting the customers as you want . This will result in a list of customers in the order that you want , but a single list , not grouped . Then you 'll need to adjust how you populate the cell accordingly . <p> For example : <p> - ( void ) configureCell : ( UITableViewCell * ) cell atIndexPath : ( NSIndexPath * ) indexPath // The section in the table view will need to be converted to a row in the FRC NSIndexPath *adjustedIndexPath = NSIndexPath indexPathForRow : indexPath section inSection:0 ; // Now retrieve a person using the adjusted index path XXPerson *person = self fetchedResultsController **35;3418;TOOLONG ; // Retrieve and sort the transactions NSSet *unsortedTransactions = person transaction ; // By the way , to-many relationships should be named with a plural , to indicate that there will be many objects . // to-one should be singular . // So this property name should instead be &amp;quot ; transactions&amp;quot ; . NSArray *sortedTransactions = unsortedTransactions **27;3455;TOOLONG : ... ; // I recommend making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using it a lot // Now we need to select the appropriate transaction for this row XXTransaction *transaction = sortedTransactions objectAtIndex : indexPath row ; // Populate the cell with the transaction cell.textLabel.text = NSString stringWithFormat : @&amp;quot ; %@&amp;quot ; , transaction ; <p> Number of sections will be the number of customers , and number of rows in each section will be the count of transactions for each customer . You will need to adjust the index path as I have shown here in order to provide that value . <p> So you 're still mostly using the FRC , but you 're having to do some manual additional work . I believe I have tried to solve a similar problem in the past , but was not able to do so using the FRC alone . <p> Trying to best understand the exact issue as well . However , what I am getting is that you have two tables with a " to many " relationship . It appears that your first table may be the customer and the second transactions . Of course one customer can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer 's name from the customer table as the section header and then you want to use the appropriate transactions from the relationship to populate the rows . Is this correct ? <p> Assuming the above you are indicating that you are only getting a single row returned ( transaction ) where you expected 3 to be returned ( assume 3 transactions ) . It appears to me that you are not looking into the relationship to ascertain this though . You are looking at the section header of customer which would show a single row as there is only 1 customer record . You need to look into the NSSet of the customer record that actually contains the relationship ( i.e. transactions ) you are interested in . The set will contain the correct number of objects related to the customer 's transactions ( in this case 3 ) . <p> To take my points above a little deeper . I do n't know the name of the attribute in your customer entity that contains the relationship to transactions . So for the purpose of this example I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity has an attribute called myTransactions that is itself an NSSet containing the relationship . I will also use Customer as the class name for the customer data . <p> Your one customer will return one row and so you can directly at that record in row 0 of the appropriate section . Now you use count to determine the number of rows for the section . The code above is contained in the numerberOfRowsInSection method . <p> You ca n't store the results in a property . Well , I suppose you could , but it does n't make sense . These will be different for each person , meaning you will have more than 1 set of transactions , so it does n't make sense to only hold 1 set of transactions . <p> As I said , make a property for this . Do n't ignore advice . If you do n't understand the advice then ask for clarification , but do n't ignore it . I did n't type that out just because I felt like typing more . You are going to bounce off of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This code needs to be fast . That means minimizing the amount of work done , and the number of objects created . So make a property for it :

You 're assuming that the view controller is the only thing responsible for creating and invalidating the timer , i.e. , if the view controller has n't invalidated it , then it must still be valid . This is probably the majority of cases , and you 're absolutely right , in this scenario there really is n't must use keeping what you know is a dangling pointer around . <p> The fact that the OP needed to explicitly check whether the timer was still valid made me just assume the more general case where some external object could be invalidating the timer before the view controller tried to call a method on it .

Saving a view object as data is likely to cause you problems , but hey , have fun . <p> Saving a view object in an NSArray is no different than saving the view object directly . <p> MVC divides the design of your application into 3 different parts : <p> The Model is the part of your program that stores data . For simple applications , an array can serve as the model . <p> The View is the part of the program that displays content to the user and gathers input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that controls the behavior of the application , serves data from the model to the view , and gathers input from the user . <p> A MVC group becomes a functional unit - sort of a super-object . You talk to the controller object , and it uses the model to get/save its data , and uses the view to display to/get input from the user . <p> A view controller is a controller object . It should be the only object that interacts with its views . It 's reasonable , and fairly common , for controller objects to share a model object between them ( e.g. in a master/detail table view design , the master view shows a high level display of entries in the model , and the detail view controller shows details of those entries and allows editing of the contents . Both the master and the detail view controller can , and probably should , read/write to the same model object . ) <p> Any time you treat a view object as a data container , you are not following the MVC design pattern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your image views as data containers ( model objects ) . <p> If you do that it will cause you problems later , I promise . At the least it will muddy your design and cause tight coupling between your model , view , and controller objects , which is not good . That makes your design less flexible and more fragile . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> It 's not layziness , i 'm involved in a project that has a short deadline .

And hey , we programmers tend to be lazy , there 's no shame in admitting as much . But as Brian and Duncan have pointed out , you 're certain to run into problems if you save your view object and read it back . Take a look at the Interface Builder and all the things you can set there . That 's what is saved when you archive your view as data . Cocoa Touch is a HIGHLY complex framework with numerous under-the-hood workings , and there is no guarantee that you wo n't mess up something at some point if you do n't follow the best practices . <p> And , another point altogether , the amount of data you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have implemented the saving and loading and view recreation by now . Saving and reading back the needed values is trivial , and the time you could possibly save by saving the view object directly has already been spent many times over on this thread . <p> Really ? They tend to be hard working and not appreciated much from my observation <p> To the OP , you might want to work with openGL or something like Cocos 2D instead since you playing to graphics , and coordinates . <p> OpenGL ? ! ? Good god man , no ! OpenGL has a learning curve that 's so steep it 's a learning Cliff .

This MapView has some pins which , when touched , show the typical annotation bubble with a title , a subtitle , a small image on the left and a detail button on the right .

( ideally i want to see the login screen which is **25;5087;TOOLONG scene first and nothing else . ) <p> Problem No. 1 : my iPad is in Landscape orientation , the LoginDBMinViewController scene pops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inferred . i even tried setting orientation to Landscape in storyboard for LoginDBMinViewController scene but it still pops out in portrait when the iPad is in Landscape . problem fixed when you change the orientation of the iPad physically and the orientation of the LoginDBMinViewController scene will get back to normal . ( not very ideal solution ) <p> which i believe is because i am calling the modal view to be presented while the MasterView and DetailView is in their midst of animation . So i shift the code to viewDidAppear in detailView.m instead . This move solved the problem(1) of the weird orientation of the **25;5114;TOOLONG scene mentioned earlier on but introduced another problem(3) . <p> Problem 3 : after shifting the code to viewDidAppear , every time i dismiss the **25;5141;TOOLONG , the viewDidAppear is called and will once again pops **25;5168;TOOLONG scene to the first view . so now it is in an loop that will not exit . <p> Problem 4 : i also want the **25;5195;TOOLONG to appear modally when the **35;5222;TOOLONG it got backgrounded ) so i placed the code there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the code be placed ? <p> Edit : I think the solution for the login screen to always appear when ever the app is close is to set the code in detailView.m viewWillAppear and set the application **27;5259;TOOLONG to YES . but problem of the weird orientation still persists . But i see other apps on the appstore not constrained to having to do that . their login page also appears as the first view ( but probably because they dun use a split view controller .. )

@@98149973 @2349973/ <h> iTunes Content Dispute - how long <p> The copyrighted content of one of my apps has been ripped off and is being used in two apps in iTunes store by a Chinese developer . I have gone through the process of completing the iTunes Content Dispute form online . In one case Apple sent me a copy of the email they sent to the pirate asking them to reply to the allegation . That has been over two weeks ago . In the other case I have not even received a confirmation of any kind from Apple . How long should this take ? It is totally clear cut that the content is mine - it was taken from a previous Apple " What 's Hot " app that has been in the store since 2009 ! It should be an open and shut case . Is there any way to elevate this or contact someone directly at Apple ? Apple is of course party to selling stolen material at this point , profiting in a small way from it . Thanks for any help . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute form I filled out that has been essentially ignored by Apple . As a side note , I found an Android app in the Google Play store today using my content and Google took it down within hours of my notifying them ! Hours vs weeks with Apple ... Thanks again . <p> Earlir it was 5 days and Apple removed the thief 's app . These days they seem to have too much work to control it . If the infringing app is n't removed within 5 days of the notice ( the email you 'll get from apple in CC ) drop them a mail so they can delete the thief 's app . <p> UPDATE for anyone interested . It is now 6 weeks since my original complaints were filed using the online forms for reporting copyright infringement in apps . Further , I have sent 5 emails to **25;5348;TOOLONG during this time ( separate emails for each app ) and also cc 'd developer support . During that time there was no response from appstorenotices@apple except for the first cc of an email they sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the app himself ( ! ) . He never responded and today , 6 weeks later , they sent him another email saying nicely that gee , they never heard back from him and could he please respond regarding the matter ... pretty please ... <p> In my DMCA Takedown Notice emails to **25;5375;TOOLONG I have attached pdf documents where I placed screen captures from the infringing app next to screen captures of my original content . I showed how the infringed app even attempted to photoshop out my watermarks and background but failed to eliminate them entirely . This is in addition to the content obviously being identical . ( These are original line art drawings . ) I gave them links to my original app with its publish date of 2009 and pointed out that the infringing app just came out . I even pointed out that the infringing developer 's " Support Site " is a non-related Chinese materials supply corp . That alone is a violation of developer terms , if I 'm not mistaken . I have pretty much done all the work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be polite with the perpetrator than to support the original content creator . <p> I further filed a copyright DMCA complaint ( using Apple 's online complaint form ) against the two Apple urls ( iTune store ) that show his screen shots , which use the same copyrighted thumbnail images that my app uses . That is technically a separate violation(s) on Apple 's part . Those urls should be taken down , though that still leaves the apps in the store . <p> So here we have 1 . Apple selling stolen material and profiting from it , 2. doing nothing to support a legitimate developer that created the original content , 3. taking no action against the developer that is profiting from the stolen material . <p> Am I expecting too much from Apple that I find 6 weeks with no progress to be frustrating ? Google has taken down infringing apps within the SAME DAY as I have reported them . Obviously Google values integrity of data . I do n't know what Apple values other than sales of devices . I would consider suing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delete my apps . But seriously , this sad story represents a true failure on Apple 's part to deal with this problem of copyright infringement and take care of their hard working developers . <p> This is a terrible story and you have every right to be upset . Apple is incredibly slow to do anything for its developers whom they claim at every conference to " love " . There is so much wrong here that I do n't know where to begin . Have you tried to actually speak with Apple on the phone rather than through forms and email ? <p> I would imagine their requirement to respond with any particular time frame or indeed at all might depend on the content of the developer agreement ? You can bet that thing is screwed firmly down in apples favour , and even if it is n't , if you want to continue selling on the app store you have no choice but to not assert your rights too strongly unfortunately , they can take your apps down for no stated reason if they like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to believe that they are actually reasonable people with just too much to do , so can appear uncaring from the outside . Simply sifting through the complaints they receive to determine which are genuine must be an enormous task in itself . <p> Hi C6Silver05 , yes I did speak with someone in Apple 's Developer Support department ( the phone number I found somewhere in this forum ) . She was very nice and very understanding but unfortunately did not have any means of control or power to do anything about it , it all rests in Apple 's " Legal Department " . She did offer to try to move my complaint up the food chain at Apple and I think that is why after 6 weeks of nothing , I got the ( 2nd ) cc 'd email to the infringing developer . Mind boggling that that is Legal 's idea of taking action - write to the guy again for comment ! Yesterday I put all of this in a written letter and attached color copies of the screen captures evidence and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to post here if I get any resolution ( or not ) . This is obviously taking a lot of my time . Should a developer really have to work this hard to get Apple to support him/her ? <p> I wonder if it would help to send something to Apple from an attorney . I realize this will cost you when it should n't but perhaps formalizing the complaint to an even higher degree is necessary . Under no circumstances should it be this difficult especially when Apple has 100% control of the ecosystem . It is one thing when it is a website and perhaps no one other than the owner has the power to access the content , but in this case Apple has the easy and quick ability to remove any app from the store . <p> Very sad story that shows Apple 's lack of concern . I understand the a company that has this many developers and apps must have a huge stack of stuff to deal with , but at the same time , they are one of the richest companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I wonder if we all removed our apps from Apple and moved them over to Micro$oft , would they give us more attention ? <p> Very sad story that shows Apple 's lack of concern .

I never heard directly from Apple but in monitoring the category I noticed that the two offending apps are no longer available . So after a lot of work on my part and a month and a half of time Apple finally pulled the apps . I 'm not sure but I think things started moving after I started cc'ing Apple App Developer Support and got someone 's attention there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with their lack of service . Anyway , I guess that the lesson here is if you have original content in your app and find it being infringed upon by other apps , you have to become a very squeaky wheel and keep after it until you get relief . Happy ending , sort of , for me . Thanks for all of your comments . <p> Cut Apple some Slack , There are over 1.4 Million Applications on the App Store , Do you know how many request they get per day ? <p> Yeah , poor overworked Apple . Google is able to remove copyright infringing apps within one day ( they have done so for me ) . If Apple needs to hire a few more folks to handle copyright infringement complaints so they do n't take 6 weeks and relentless effort from the developer , I think they can probably afford it with their $600 Billion value ... <p> Oh crap .

I 've submitted my dispute form 7 days ago and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime , the thief is causing me financial damage with each day that passes by . <p> This is so sad .

The first one was on December 1 , 2014 . Today , December 10 , 2014 - Apple got to the first one . I do n't know whether they have n't gotten to the second and third yet , or whether 3 complaints piled up with the same link got flagged and drew someone 's attention . <p> Anyway , the developer who ripped me off did n't apologise or something . On the contrary : He argued that my images were n't original , and therefore he can use them too . This is bullshit . If I showed a 1,000 random people , I guess 999 or 1,000 would spot a clear cut rip off . Lucky for me , I made a presentation with a detailed comparison that leaves no room for doubt . The " multiplicity of coincidences " led to only one logical conclusion . I 've attached this presentation to the email , and went on with extra details in the email 's body . I even showed that one picture had a glitch in it , and that glitch magically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He replied that he will remove the picture with the glitch , but will keep all the rest . This is where I got REALLY upset . I replied with more examples and legal threats , and cornered him . He replied that he will update the app , and by then will remove the current version from sale . And he did just that . So round 1 is over . <p> My takeaways are : <p> Apple answered after 9-10 days . Ca n't tell if multiple complaints just piled up , or they would have answered anyway . <p> You should provide clear cut evidence , like you 'd do in a court . <p> Do n't expect these guys to give up without a fight . <p> Make some research about the other party . It took me 3-4 hours , but finally I figured out , with high probability , where he 's working . I mentioned it in my second reply , and that may have helped . <p> Do n't take it hard . I was very upset and frustrated , and really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a walk in the park . No matter what you do for a living , you 'll eventually meet someone who is n't playing fair . Deal with it and do n't let your rage cloud your judgment . Calm down and provide evidence and arguments that support your case . Trash talk and idle threats wo n't support your case . <p> Make sure they remove the app from sale on all the countries . If they know where you 're from , they will remove it from your country only , so when you look for it on your device you wo n't find it anymore , tricked to believe that it 's gone . <p> Design your apps with safety measures in mind . Protect your intellectual property in advance . Mark it with unique elements that will later help you to prove your case . <p> Hi , I 'm glad that your case is resolved and hope it will be ok in the future . <p> From my experience , here is something that all developers should keep in mind . Any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 to 6 weeks if you want to dispute . ( 3 months for my case ) <p> Why ? because the support team does n't have a right to take other app down . They need to report to investigate team , legal professional team to open a case . By default , they will send email to both parties about it and ask you both to resolve the problem . Generally , other party will take down the app right away because they 're scare of " App Store Notices " ; - ) . If it 's not resolved by any reason then it will be escalated to next level . At every level it takes from 2-4 weeks .

I want to make it so that I kill my FifthViewController right when the tab bar is clicked . <p> Thank you all . <p> The reason I have a button is because its on my first view = the menu . The tab bar buttons just take you to like " book marks and options " type of stuff and " Favorites " for my app . The button is crucial to take you to either section a , or another button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tab bar it will look messy and the menu screen will be empty . <p> When I click the button while being in FirstViewController , it takes me to FifthViewController , then if I click tab and I go back to the FirstViewController , my FifthViewController is still there ontop of my firstviewcontroller . I just want to kill it .. I also do n't  know what my " item " number is , I just synthesized them using code and not interface builder .

He 's one of the brightest , most knowledgeable people on this board . <p> A tab bar controller has a delegate property . That 's not the same thing as the app delegate . <p> A delegate is an object that works in partnership with another object to do it 's job . <p> In the case of the tab bar controller , you set some object up to be it 's delegate , and it sends messages to that delegate to let the delegate know what 's going on . <p> In this case , the tab bar controller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controller . <p> Your app delegate is almost certainly NOT the delegate to the tab bar controller , and it should NOT be the delegate to the tab bar controller . <p> It 's pretty clear that you do n't understand the delegate design pattern at all .

This currently works really well , and will not prevent sleep when not connected to an external power source . <p> The second reason , for which I 'm querying the brains trust here , is that a new feature in the next version of the application will be to record locations ( waypoints ) at regular intervals ( and/or distances ) . This does not require anything on the screen , and would ideally be possible for long periods of travel time without an external battery source ( eg , when I 'm bushwalking/hiking ) . If I can have the screen disabled , but the iPhone not sleeping , that would maximise the battery life while still running the application .

Forum promotion , you can spread word about your app on iOS gaming forums like touch arcade etc. 2 . Create social profiles on Facebook , twitter , instagram , pinterest .

@@98149994 @2349994/ <p> All Objective-C classes have ( by convention ) a designated initializer , which is the initializer method that must be called , either explicitly or via an other convenience initializer . In the case of NSManagedObject this is -NSManagedObject LONG ... Failure to cause the designated initializer leads to undefined , and likely incorrect , behavior because the instance is not guaranteed to be properly initialized . I would guess that the NSManagedObject initializer sets up the machinery to support @synthesize 'd property access for the Entity 's attributes .

The poke app sends messages or photos and deleted them after a set number of seconds , but if in that time the user takes a screenshot , it alerts the sender that a screenshot was taken of the sent message . <p> I have a magazine app and would be great to know when a screenshot was taken . it would be fantastic to know when its about to be taken , apply a watermark , and after the screenshot is taken then remove the watermark . <p> I saw some sites say there as a darwin notification in iOS4 that notified when a screenshot was taken , but that disappeared in iOS5. another idea was to constantly poll the camera roll and check for new photos appearing , check the resolution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , and i know the facebook poke app is n't polling the camera roll as its test method , as the app has n't  yet asked permission to view the camera roll . <p> I cant find anything at all on how it could be done , but i definitely know its possible as the facebook poke app does it .. <p> The consensus is that Facebook Poke and Snapchat are probably calling " **30;5811;TOOLONG : " and/or accessing the Camera Roll to look for new photos added in the past few seconds . <p> Another blogger , chpwn , says that Facebook Poke-competitor Snapchat is able to track screenshots because it " relies on a quirk of iOS : taking a screenshot cancels all touches on the screen " . <p> He says that when **28;5843;TOOLONG has a state of cancelled , Snapchat tracks it , but then forgets about it in UIApplicationDelegate if it receives " **31;5873;TOOLONG : " or " **27;5906;TOOLONG : " , because those would represent multitasking or notification instead of a screenshot . <p> Firstly , It can be done , Facebook Poke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , you might not want apps messing with your screenshots , but maybe we do n't  want people taking screenshots of our photos in the magazine . <p> The consensus is that Facebook Poke and Snapchat are probably calling " **30;5935;TOOLONG : " and/or accessing the Camera Roll to look for new photos added in the past few seconds . <p> Another blogger , chpwn , says that Facebook Poke-competitor Snapchat is able to track screenshots because it " relies on a quirk of iOS : taking a screenshot cancels all touches on the screen " . <p> He says that when **28;5967;TOOLONG has a state of cancelled , Snapchat tracks it , but then forgets about it in UIApplicationDelegate if it receives " **31;5997;TOOLONG : " or " **27;6030;TOOLONG : " , because those would represent multitasking or notification instead of a screenshot . <p> Thanks for that , It does n't  seem to be with the camera roll as the app has never asked permission to see it . I also saw a post talking about screen shots cancelling all touch input , and one person suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finger on the screen to view images in the app .. how annoying that would be haha . clearly not an option . <p> Ill look into the **30;6059;TOOLONG and related methods .. thanks ! <p> Firstly , It can be done , Facebook Poke was just released recently and required iOS 5.1 or later . Secondly , you might not want apps messing with your screenshots , but maybe we do n't  want people taking screenshots of our photos in the magazine . <p> There 's a reason why Apple removed this functionality in the first place.So people like you do n't abuse it . <p> I think you have a lot of restrictions of what you do not want to do versus the options of what you can do . I would try to implement and test all suggestions given before saying you wo n't do something or wont try something . At least you will gain some experience with what you want to accomplish . And if it is working to an extent , you can always go back with a better solution and update your method to determine if a picture was taken .

I have an image view and a label in my uiscrollview , and in my app , I have arrows on the top bar , clicking those changes which image is visible . When this happens , I want the UIScrollView to zoom all the way out again , so you see the image and the label . Do I need to apply a transform somewhere to zoom back out ? I assume there 's a transform on the UIScrollView that causes it to zoom , or it applies a transform to the objects within it 's view ? I 'm not even sure how to do that , I just figure from my reading that may be where the answer lies ? <p> I have a few comments on UIScrollView . I do n't have any example code . This is what I know . <p> UIScrollView does n't zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows that user to choose a zoom value . Consider Google maps . There is a little control there that allows the user to choose the zoom value . If the user zooms in or out the web browser gets fresh content at that zoom level from the server .

If you use the transform the big text will look like crap .

Is there a fix for this , or am I just totally on the wrong path ? Why ca n't I just reset whatever the scrollview is doing and going back to a starting position ? Am I the only one who wants to reuse a scrollview to view different images ? Am I using the wrong control ? <p> No , that does n't help at all .

@@98150029 @2350029/ <p> Each object has a text .

@@98150033 @2350033/ <h> Replies <p> I 'm sure like any business it would depend on how profitable your business is . With an app business I 'm sure people would value your business based on how your sales are , the trending of your sales , and the forecasted sales . If you are only making a few dollars a day , I do n't really think anyone would be interested in buying . If it is making a few hundred to a thousand then someone might take you up on it . <p> What I am saying is that people buy pre-made apps from between $100-1k , which are pre-built and ready to sell .

If you are going to have to dump a lot of money into an app you might as well just pay someone to make you one that you have a direct interest in . You can hope that someone takes a shine to your apps and would want to try and promote them , but that possibility is going to be very remote . Most people will pay for an app that is ready to sell based on an assumption of what they think the app will do . Your app is already in the market and so there is already something to judge it on . Which are the sales . <p> I think your story is probably very typical with a great number of developers . People come up with what they think is " the next great idea " , and then spend months working on it just to have it completely flop in the app store . <p> And then the devleoper feels in his heart that its still a great idea and ca n't understand why no one wants to buy it . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MUST " be worth something to someone , so he comes up with the idea of selling the rights to the app . <p> but what he never quite understands and will never quite comprehend is that the idea was not such a great idea to begin with = ( <p> Having an idea is simply part of the spectrum . Building an app takes ideas , time , care , graphic desingers , etc ... Is this valueless ? I have invested less than I have returned already . I do n't personally build apps myself . I do n't code , I outsource . <p> Which brings the question , " Who needs a lawyer ? Let 's get a law book and learn the law , or go on a 5 year uni degree " . - The reason you wo n't ? Time , effort , expense , un-known contacts . <p> Okay so how much is an app worth that sells 10,000 copies a month at $1 worth ? Is there any precedent ? I 'm guessing we will all want to sell up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into it . If you already sold 1 million copies then a new owner might be able to sell IAPs to some of those . <p> It 's really hard to put a value on something like this . Instagram sold for 1 billion with no profit . <p> While it 's true that there are people out there that regularly pay for an app to be developed , and your app may be very close to what they want . It could be very hard to find that person . <p> Also , not all app sell for what they might be worth . Example , it could be the case that if someone bought your app , they could market it and make it sell very well ... but again it could be very hard to find a person willing to do that . <p> Your idea could be great , but once it 's been released , any developer can make a work-alike product . That means that you do n't have an idea for an app , you have an app that anyone can download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ask , if your app is that valuable , why are n't you putting the effort into making it sell . <p> Instagram was bought for it 's user base . They have over 40 million users . Being able to tap into that is worth something to a lot of companies . <p> No , instagram was bought because facebook wanted to remove a potential competitor . Agreed that the user base has value , but not that much . <p> as to the original question , i think the general trend has been to value apps like websites , and that is at 6-12 months revenue . So take your monthly revenue and multiply by 6 and that is what you might be able to get someone to pay . If this number is 12 , it 's unlikely anyone will be interested . <p> No , instagram was bought because facebook wanted to remove a potential competitor .

You might be able to put higher value if your source code has something meaningful in it or if you have a good app name though <p> the app store is fickel. there are no guarantees that a certain app will be making anything a year from now . that being said , most great apps that are very likely to be making money a year from now are n't going to be for sale . <p> 1 . Instagram is not an APP its a BUSINESS . A portfolio of apps does not equal a business anymore than a truckload of hamburgers = McDonalds . <p> 2 . The value of an normal app portfolio is probably 3-6x monthly sales . Websites go for 6x-12x monthly sales but app sales are far more unstable than website revenue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IP or business model that can guarantee consistent revenue . <p> 3 . You ca n't compare an app that has been created but not sold on the marketplace with an existing portfolio of apps that are being actively sold . Once the app is out there , the value of the app is established by the revenue . If it has n't been published , there is some uncertainty there that pushes the price up slightly if it 's a well made app . <p> 4 . Who would buy a portfolio of apps ? A seller needs a buyer . As far as I know , no one is walking around trying to buy portfolios of failed apps . Successful apps on the other hand , could probably find a buyer . But if they were successful , you probably would n't want to sell . Another factor that contributes to the lowered valuation . That 's why certain things on craigslist are just so bad they give them away for free . Sure there is still some non-zero value to a broken fridge , but there really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5. your best strategy if the apps are not selling well is to just sell each app individually as a learning tool for new developers . If you go with this angle then your app revenue does n't really matter , and you might get more money in the end . <p> Successful apps on the other hand , could probably find a buyer . But if they were successful , you probably would n't want to sell . Another factor that contributes to the lowered valuation . <p> Surely a successful app would only sell for a decent amount , ie larger than the 6x monthly sales . <p> You would n't sell it for less than that if it were a successful app . I do n't see that not selling for this low price contributes to a lower valuation . It means it is worth more . <p> An app is worth what someone is prepared to pay , and what the seller is prepared to accept . A seller wo n't accept 6x monthly for a successful app . And a buyer would surely pay more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful just for 6 months income . <p> That 's why I said " normal " not failed which I think would get zero or successful in which case sky is the limit . There probably are not that many buyers who can afford successful apps , so like you said the price is fairly elastic . <p> The 3x-6x figure is based on comparing the long term revenue potential of an app versus a website , which is well defined at 6x-12x revenues . <p> You also need to look at growth . A fast growing app would fetch more than one that was declining or flat . I can show geometric year over year growth so I 'm pretty sure I can fetch far more than 6x monthly for my portfolio . If it was declining then I would probably be able to get about that much on the open market . But then again the number of potential acquirers would be pretty small . <p> Surely a successful app would only sell for a decent amount , ie larger than the 6x monthly sales . <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a successful app .

The map kit ( or an other part of iOS ) does n't support address lookup . The good news is that doing this kind of request is REALLY easy . <p> The following 2 lines will return a lat/long for an address in theAddress : <p> Where lat and long are decimal latitude and longitude values . The 200 is a success code , and the 8 is a zoom factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an error , ignore the second number , and take the last 2 as your lat/long . You can use the NSString method **27;6599;TOOLONG to separate the returned locationString into it 's components . <p> A couple of caveats : <p> -This uses a form of the Google API that Google deprecated this spring . It may be shut down as soon as a little less than 3 years ( Google 's docs say that their deprecated APIs will continue to be supported for 3 years from the date of deprecation ) . That part of the google maps API has been replaced with a new version ( which is harder to parse ) . <p> -All the google maps APIs are subject to Google 's terms of service . You are only supposed to use the results to display addresses on a Google-branded map . The way I read the TOS , using the API to create annotations on a map-kit map meets those terms because the map has the Google logo on it . However , I am not a lawyer , and advise you to read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read them and advise you . ) <p> -The code above submits a synchronous request . If Google 's host hangs , your code will lock up until the request times out . It would be better to use an NSURLRequest and NSURLConnection to submit an async request , but that 's more work . You need to create a couple of objects for each request , teach your code to handle 3 or 4 delegate methods , collect the incoming data , handle success and error completion messages , etc . You also have to write code that either only allows 1 async request at a time , or handles multiple pending requests . That said , I took the easy way out , and used the sync request shown above .

But if it did , then I would join those with a stringWithFormat : method , as well as %20s . Would that be right ? <p> Actually , I just realized that characters like " &amp; " will likely mess up the google geocoding API . I have a routine that parses strings and escapes a set of characters that I specify . It looks something like this ( I reworked it slightly to make sense outside of my code library ) : <p> how ever i want to show my current location as well on that map only i can track my current lat and long using GPS but i do n't  know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above then i am getting just address from current lat and long <p> As the other poster said , you need to use the google maps web API to do this . The map kit ( or an other part of iOS ) does n't support address lookup . The good news is that doing this kind of request is REALLY easy . <p> The following 2 lines will return a lat/long for an address in theAddress : <p> Where lat and long are decimal latitude and longitude values . The 200 is a success code , and the 8 is a zoom factor . Treat numbers other than 200 at the beginning as an error , ignore the second number , and take the last 2 as your lat/long . You can use the NSString method **27;6686;TOOLONG to separate the returned locationString into it 's components . <p> A couple of caveats : <p> -This uses a form of the Google API that Google deprecated this spring . It may be shut down as soon as a little less than 3 years ( Google 's docs say that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the date of deprecation ) . That part of the google maps API has been replaced with a new version ( which is harder to parse ) . <p> -All the google maps APIs are subject to Google 's terms of service . You are only supposed to use the results to display addresses on a Google-branded map . The way I read the TOS , using the API to create annotations on a map-kit map meets those terms because the map has the Google logo on it . However , I am not a lawyer , and advise you to read the TOS yourself ( or better yet , hire a lawyer to read them and advise you . ) <p> -The code above submits a synchronous request . If Google 's host hangs , your code will lock up until the request times out . It would be better to use an NSURLRequest and NSURLConnection to submit an async request , but that 's more work . You need to create a couple of objects for each request , teach your code to handle 3 or 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and error completion messages , etc . You also have to write code that either only allows 1 async request at a time , or handles multiple pending requests . That said , I took the easy way out , and used the sync request shown above . In my testing , it works quite well , and only takes a few seconds . <p> Newbee , do you still need assistance with this ? I am actually using the newer Google API to accomplish this . I 've received the XML string from the Google API , and I 'm about to write the XML Parser using the standard Apple xml parsing routines . <p> Note that string strGeoCode has a parameter of " sensor=true " at the end of the string . That parameter is required . It says that the device has a location sensor ( GPS or Network ) . False obviously means that it does n't . The value also has to be lowercase . 
@@98150035 @2350035/ <p> That works , but also note that NSString stringWithFormat : is similar to printf and allows for great flexibility in formatting . Rather than using an if condition , you can just use this built in formatting ability . <p> The " 02 " specifies a minimum of 2 characters must be printed and to use 0 for padding ( if it was just " 2 " it would pad with spaces ) .

If you have to exchange credentials for developing iOS applications , I suggest creating a dedicated keychain to hold all public and private keys and certificates . Then just zip up the keychain file ( where ever you created it , but /Library/Keychains by default ) and send that around . It 's much better than having to re-explain this 3 year old issue time and time again .

This is a good formed question.Essentially , there are two ways to achieve this . The first one , is to have a object of type SecondViewController in your FirstViewController . From there , you can set the variables needed . Here is a quick example : <p> This is a good way to share something that only should be shared between two ViewControllers . If you are to have a bigger shared set of data , like username , password , userid , devicetoken , appcode +++You could use a singleton . The way that is implemented , is that you have a class derived from NSObject to store all that data . You are then referring to a static member of that class , which means it never changes . Here is an example .

@@98150076 @2350076/ <h> UITextField inside UIAlertView <p> Judging by reading the doc of the UIAlertView ( the alert pop ups ) , I do n't seem to see that there 's a way to add a UITextField inside the popup . However , on the AppStore , the BannerFree App uses it . So I 'm just wondering if anyone knows how to do it . Thanks <p> I 've been trying to figure this out also . I want a dialog similar to the iTunes purchase password prompt . The closest I 've come is with the UICatalog sample code . This seems to exhaustively demonstrate the capabilities of UIAlertView . I think the answer may be with another component . Please post the solution if you find it ! <p> I 'm pretty sure that adding a UITextField to an alert view would go against the HIG . That being said , if you want to do it , what I 'd try is setting a tag value for the UITextField , and registering yourself as its delegate before adding the text field as a subview of the alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own computer , or I 'd check for you ) to see if the UIAlertView has a contentView - if it does , you 'll need to make the text field a subview of the contentView rather than the alert view itself . Note that by doing this you may mess with the buttons it create for you , and you may have to manually create the okay button as well . Not sure about that , but it 's a possibility . <p> You can then implement text field delegate methods to get notified when the user begins or ends editing the text field , and when your alert view delegate method gets notified that the user has closed the alert view , you could use the tag to retrieve the text field from the alert view , or you could alternatively just assign the text field to a iVar . <p> I 've done something similar with table view cells , and it works , but table view cell is documented as working this way , UIAlertView is specifically not documented as supporting anything other than buttons IIRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let that stop you . Exploring and intelligently breaking rules is half the fun . Since UIAlertView is a descendent of UIView ( again , IIRC ) , it should be possible , but I do n't what the exact steps would be to do it . <p> Ok guys , here 's my experiences with adding a UITextField to a UIAlertView and the nuances associated with it . All of this is done in code , so there 's no interface builder to handle the layout , although I 'm not sure that something better could n't be accomplished using a custom view and XIB to display something that looks like an alert view . <p> Alright , first things first . Adding a UITextField to a UIAlertView is as simple as instantiating the UITextField and adding it as a subview of your UIAlertView . I set the background color of the text field to be white so you can see where it is . <p> Here 's a pic of the abboration that is your custom UIAlertView thus far . <p> After fiddling around with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings that allow the alert view to be displayed properly with the text field fully visible and functional . Since the UIAlertView is n't " made " to support this type of user interaction , you have to specify a message component for the alert view . This provides enough spacing so that you can insert the text field which will cover the message and thus keep things from over lapping . Here 's the revised code and a picture of the properly formatted UIAlertView . <p> After getting all that done , I ran into one more problem . When you touch the text field to enter text , the keyboard slides into view and covers part of the alert view . <p> To fix this , I created a translation transform and applied it to the alert view to move it higher up the screen so it would n't interfere with the keyboard . With that done , this is what it looks like . You still need to set up delegate methods for the alert view and the text field , but those are pretty simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the X coordinate to move the origin of the view to . The second parameter is the Y location to move the origin of the view to . 130.0 does n't exactly center the alert view between the status bar and the keyboard , but I like the positioning . You could always experiment with the values to find something that you like better . <p> Hi , I find this post today and i find it very usefull , i 'm a beginner with cocoa/cocoa touch and t I have a some question : 1 ) What about to manage the string in the textfield ? 2 ) The " return " key in the keyboard do n't works , how can i make it working ? 3 ) How can i set the textfield as a password field ? ( to hide the word win the starts ) <p> In my earlier post , I was just showing that it is possible to add a textfield to an alert view and achieve the functionality desired by the OP . However , the implementation that I gave is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The better approach would be to subclass UIAlertView and create the proper outlets and delegate methods for the text field instead of having all the glue code to make it work in one of your project files . <p> Missing symbol indicates a missing framework . It will just be what you link to . You can move views by changing the frame or center instead of doing a full transform . <p> If you do n't know what framework you need xcode-&gt; help -&gt; documentation and type in the name of the routine . ( You do this right ? There a lot of useful information to be had ) This will list where it comes from . <p> To add a framework : control-click on a framework already in the project . Select Reveal in Finder . A folder opens up with all the frameworks you can drag into your app . <p> Judging by reading the doc of the UIAlertView ( the alert pop ups ) , I do n't seem to see that there 's a way to add a UITextField inside the popup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses it . So I 'm just wondering if anyone knows how to do it . Thanks <p> Do n't make it hard on yourself try this simpler method that works for me : <p> I find this popup really interesting , but I just have a little question ( I am a newbie in objective C ) . I am currently using this in a rss feed reader , like you have a list of rss feeds , and upon clicking one , the ticket displays on screen ( through this popup ) . So I disabled user interaction and everything , all the functionalities are okay , but it does n't look good : As in many articles there are a few lines of text , I changed the height of the text field ( which I changed to a UILabel btw ) , but I ca n't find how to change the size of the AlertView so that it really contains the UILabel ( which is spreading out right now ... ) . Second question : I do n't want the Label to display the text on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : **25;8171;TOOLONG = 10 ; for example , but then I get an error of compilation

It 's just that i think there is no point in downloading the image twice if the user wants to save it to the camera roll . I know there must be a way to save that image and then get it from that temporary storage to make the save image function of the app much faster . <p> If you 've downloaded it once , and you 're displaying it , you definitely still have the initial download . Just grab it from your UIImageView . <p> Or , if you need to leave the view and return at any point , save the NSData to disk right after you download it , so that you do n't have to download it again when the user returns to your view ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a distinct possibility when you have an image loaded in it ) . <p> Also , you 're not really threading the process of saving the image right now , because your download is synchronous ( dataWithContentsOfURL is synchronous ) . Aside from not downloading the image again just to save it , it 's better to make this asynchronous even when you load your view . Easiest way to do this would be to use ASIHTTPRequest and make sure to call startAsynchronous rather than startSynchronous on your request object . And display only an activity indicator when you first set up your view ; then once the image download is complete , set the image into your UIImageView and hide the activity indicator . <p> All the actions of my app take place in the main view . I already have the activity indicator when loading the image . I really think your advice is the way I should go ... Really new on iphone development , I 'm a spanish restaurant manager playing programmer !

If anyone happens to know a tutorial or code snippet to do this ... I would appreciate . I the meantime I will go and try to " decode " apple documentation about these topics . <p> Well , if this is not an image you need to keep around for a while , just grab it from your UIImageView . Somewhere , I would assume , you have code similar to this : <p> imageView.image = UIImage **27;8198;TOOLONG ; <p> So then , to use that same image in your save-to-roll code , just take it from the image view : <p> LONG ... ... ) ; <p> Alternately , if you actually need to persist the downloaded image to disk , you can easily save it to disk after the download by using NSData 's writeToFile:atomically : method , and then later load it from disk ( if needed ) by using NSData 's dataWithContentsOfFile : method . <p> Although if you use ASIHTTPRequest to download the image , you can simply tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if indeed you need to persist it to disk .

I would argue that using user defaults is a bad way to exchange information between objects in memory at runtime , but anyway ... <p> It sounds like he has n't worked with storyboards , though . That 's a little different than creating a view controller with alloc/init and then pushing it . <p> Say the user enters text in viewControllerOne , and you want to segue to ViewControllerTwo on a button press . <p> Here 's what to do . <p> Add a string property to ViewControllerTwo for the text you want to pass .

Click on the segue and set it 's identifier to a name like " toViewTwoSegue " <p> When the user clicks the button , the system will create a new ViewControllerTwo view controller and get ready to perform the segue between view controllers . It will look for a prepareForSegue method , and if you have one , it will call it . That method gives you a chance to do any setup you need before the segue takes place . At the time your prepareForSegue method is called , the new view controller has already been created , so you can get a pointer to it and send it any information or messages that you need to send . <p> Does that clear things up ? 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> For this example , I got the text from a label called ' label ' and then retrieved is and put it in a NSString called ' string ' . <p> I agree with Duncan .

@@98150094 @2350094/ <p> For deleting everything in user defaults , it looks like you would need to call dictionaryRepresentation to get a dictionary version of user defaults . Then you 'd call allKeys to get an array of keys , release the dictionary , and then loop through the array of keys and then call removeObjectForKey for each key . <p> Note that this approach could cause a low memory warning or even a crash if there are large objects stored in user defaults . The NSUserDefaults method dictionaryRepresentation loads the entire contents of user defaults into memory at once .

@@98150099 @2350099/ <h> Resize Image High Quality <p> I have done lots of searching for a way to resize images via the iPhone SDK and I have come across a few methods which " work " but the resulting image does not look nearly as good as if you took the full resolution image and told it to draw inside a rectangle ; which obviously if you could use the same interpolation routines as that drawing call does you should be able to get the same result . So what I am looking for is a way to resize an image with minimal visual anomalies . I have found that if I use a re-sized image when drawing it is much quicker than using the full resolution image ( obviously ) . <p> Please make sure any links provided are current ; I have been given countless links to methods which are void given the current version of the SDK as well as some links that provide " questionable " means to accomplish this task using functions which are not fully supported by the SDK and could easily change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an image onscreen works is by CGContextDrawImage() . To scale an image create a bitmap context whose axial ratio is the same as the original image 's . CGContextDrawImage() , **28;8442;TOOLONG , UIImage imageWithCGImage . <p> I have not tried it using the CG library ; I am not terribly familiar with how to create a bitmap and draw to it . Do you have any resources showing a similar action or anything that may help me down the right path ? <p> I 've tried using the function provided by Phoney , and I 've found that the memory associated with " ref " never gets released . If I call this function enough times , I 'll get a memory warning from the system , and then a crash . It 's strange because ref is pretty clearly being released properly with CGImageRelease(ref) , but when I watch the object allocations with Leaks , I can see that the memory associated with it is never actually freed . Even more bizarre is that it does n't get detected as a leak by Leaks , it just never gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every time I call it , my memory footprint balloons up by 7MB or so , never to go back down . <p> Hi Phoney , thanks for writing . Ultimately , I 'm saving it to an sqlite database . The image is taken from the camera , reduced in size , and then saved to sqlite . However , if I change resizedImage to something like this , I do n't have the memory problem : <p> Does Leaks report this as a leak or just as memory that 's in use ? There 's no memory leak , per se , in this code . It 's what happens to the UIImage object after it 's returned that determines whether a leak happens or not . Do you add the UIImage to an array or a dictionary or a UIImageView or anything like that ? The db does n't have anything directly to do with this . Can you tell if it 's the CGImageRef itself or the buffer that it creates that 's living on ? <p> There 's a possibility that the images are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct . Leaks does not report it as a leak . It 's just memory that is never freed . What I 've found is this : <p> After this line ... <p> CGImageRef ref = **34;8472;TOOLONG ; <p> ... ref has a retain count of 1 . But after the next line ... <p> UIImage* result = UIImage imageWithCGImage:ref ; <p> ... ref has a retain count of 2 . I 'm not really sure why . The obvious answer of calling CGImageRelease twice to bring the retain count down to 0 causes an EXCBADACCESS later when I try to access the returned image . I think that may be what you were trying to handle with the autorelease above , which I just tried , but I do n't think CGImageRef is autoreleaseable , so no dice ... <p> The CGImageRef is retained by the UIImage . Most likely all UIImages are just a wrapper for CGImageRefs . I would expect that the CGImageRef would be released when the UIImage is released . That 's why I asked what you were doing with it when it was returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the UIImage should be the same . <p> If you do n't do anything at all with the UIImage , just let its lifespan expire when the autorelease pool is drained , then what happens ? If the memory goes away then it 's a bug in your code . If the memory still remains then it 's probably a system issue . <p> managing memory with UIImages is very tricky because the iPhone does so much to try to optimize the use of memory , including caching things behind your back . The more you can stick within the CG domain , the more you will have predictable control of your memory . <p> The code works great for me ... almost . I am doing something wrong because my image is rotating counterclock-wise . <p> I am grabbing an image from the camera , running it through this code to resample it to screen resolution , then displaying it . At that point , it is rotated . That was not happening before I started resampling it . <p> I think it must have something to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left corner . But I 've tried several variations on the rect I pass in , all to no avail . <p> Alones , your fix is wrong . The bytesPerRow parameter is independent of aspect ratio . Even if the image is wider than it is tall , that does n't affect the bytes per row . PhoneyDeveloper 's original code is correct . <p> The trouble is the images are rotated 90 degrees anti-clockwise . Is there an easy way to fix this ? <p> Yes , if you take a picture with the iPhone 's camera , the UIImage.imageOrientation property might be set to UIImageOrientationDown , UIImageOrientationRight , or whatever , and the resize code posted here does n't take that into account . For a fix , see this thread . <p> Phoney , there are some problems with your code . In particular , the last parameter takes a CGBitmapInfo type , but you 're passing a CGImageAlphaInfo type . This can chop off the byte ordering information stored in CGBitmapInfo , resulting in odd problems such as pink-tinted images . Also , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be based on the original image .

I have just patiently wasted 4 hours of my life trying to get this thing to work . <p> Everything seems to work up until the point where i try to put unicode characters in the form data or a query string . When I put it in the form for POST , it cuts of unpredictable chunks , when I put it in the query string , I do n't even get ANY response back from the server , I do n't even think the page is being hit ... <p> I tried using **41;8781;TOOLONG : with various types of encoding , nothing gives me a safe url with valid characters . Unicode characters get hopelessly converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When I create my NSData object using the above call to dataWithBytes , the data object seems to contain abridged request string , i.e. its not ALL THERE ! ! ! I have been able to observe this by converting the data back to NSString using this call : <p> See that UTF8String method I am calling ? It returns an array of bytes , or UTF8 representation of the string also known as C string . I think what 's happening is that for RUSSIAN characters it return 2 bytes per letter . This if the total string is 100 characters in length , 10 of which are russian , the resulting c string would be 110 characters . The second parameter to the dataWithBytes method of NSData is length . I am passing the original requestString length , which would not contain the extra characters , so the nsdata object ends up missing a number of trailing characters , equal exactly to the length of the russian string within ... <p> But this causes problems as the return type of UTF8String does not support the method length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to CHEAT and solve the problem by PADDING my request string with a dummy KEY and a number of dummy trailing characters that I do n't care whether they get cut off or not , like this : <p> There is a mystery to be solved here .

What type should I use to store the UTF8String ? <p> I think I have the very same problem . In my iphone application , I type " -Cami+n ! " and send it to a php server . I send UTF8 and then convert to Latin1 in php , but I get " -Cami+ " , like it lost the last 2 letters . I tried adding a space after all text and in some cases it works and in another ones it does n't . I 'll try adding more dummy text , or sending directly in Latin1.

Your app can listen for this redirect and dismiss the webview . Have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I have a question about all of this . I have a personal concierge business , usually everything is done by phone . You know , similar to what credit card companies offer , " hello I would like you to make a reservation for x restaurant " or " I would like you to send flowers to my girlfriend " etc . We are developing an app that will allow us to branch into the smartphone market and we plan to make it an iPhone business only . This is where I am confused . <p> The way we will charge our users is per task , in other words , they pay " x " amount of money and they get 10 credits , every time they have a task done for them , 1 credit is removed from the counter in the app . Once it reaches 0 , they need to purchase again in order to use the service . Technically , they ARE purchasing digital goods , because what they are buying is credits for their app , or as if they were lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits are being used for real life/world services , nothing is offered through the app itself other than confirmation messages from the concierges themselves . If a person requests to have a complete trip to Japan researched , using the cheapest airlines and the closest hotels to the Shinjuku area , this information will be researched and sent via email to the user . <p> So where exactly does this fit in ? I have been doing enough research and talked to people from zooz.com and other places and they themselves say this fits into a type of grey area , my development team do n't even know what exactly apple will approve . <p> My question is this . If apple denies the in-app payment they offer , will this mean they allow me to use my own method ? Like zooz ? or is there the actual chance of them not allowing their method but at the same time not allowing my own ? This would kind of be unfair as it would ruin my whole idea and business model . <p> Based on what you guys know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? Their own method of payment ? Or ask me to offer my own ? <p> 11.3 - Apps using IAP to purchase physical goods or goods and services used outside of the application will be rejected <p> Basically you can not use Apple 's StorKit to sell physical goods or real world goods . Since your ultimate product is a service to be outside of the app , you would not be able to use Apple 's StoreKit . Which means you would need to have your own payment gateway inside of your app , like PayPal SDK , and you would also avoid having to pay Apple a 30% commission . Lucky you ! <p> You CAN sell physical goods in mobile apps . You can not mix the digital and physical payment systems and you can not use any marketplace 's IAP payment system to sell physical goods .. <p> StoreFrontSDk ( www.storefrontsdk.com ) has been released which both let 's you design physical products and then spawn a shop in your app where you can sell them . It 's currently only Unity3D but we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . <p> It 's completely free - no fees - and you set your own commissions on each product sold . After it is implemented , you can administer the products and update the shop on the fly ( no need to resubmit the app for approval ) . <p> @kuhne i used paypal sdk for one of my apps that sold digital goods . the main thing is , you ca n't use iap for physical goods or if the product/service being sold exists outside of the app , its that simple .

Strangely I still get a movie and it moves correctly to my library and I can play it on my iphone 4 . <p> I know I had it working at some point so something subtle changed and I ca n't figure out what that is . One thing is that my images are 320x380 and I was unsure what differing image sizes have to do with issues . <p> Other things I 've read is that bad presentation times cause issues .

@@98150120 @2350120/ <h> Migrate existing Plist Data to Core Data <p> I have rebuilt my app to utilize Core Data and now need to migrate my users existing plist data to Core Data . A few of my users have over 1,500 records which has been causing performance issues with the Plist data store . <p> I have something working which basically checks for the plist file with a specific name ( Books.plist ) and if that file exists I then proceed with the migration . Once the migration has completed I rename this plist file to something different ( ezReceipt.plist ) so that the migration will never repeat again for the user . <p> My questions are as follows : <p> Am I on the right track with this idea ? Is there a better way to accomplish this ? What could go wrong ? What should I be doing to avoid a failed data migration ? How would I recover from a failed data migration ? <p> Obviously , the last thing that I want to do is corrupt my user 's data in the process of moving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . Am I on the right track with this idea ? 2 . Is there a better way to accomplish this ? 3 . What could go wrong ? 4 . What should I be doing to avoid a failed data migration ? 5 . How would I recover from a failed data migration ? <p> Same thing with the date formatter . You definitely do n't want to be making that every pass . <p> Now then , for the most part , you are doing the same thing over and over again , just with a different key each time . So this can be simplified . The date one is an exception , so you can handle it separately , but the rest can be streamlined tremendously and in a way that reduces errors dramatically . Simply make a list of keys , and then iterate over the list . <p> Now you have something that is much cleaner , easier to read , and far less likely for a typo to ruin your day . You might want to add a counter and save the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the context right after that which will help with memory pressure . <p> Oh , one more thing , if this really is a large amount of data , then you do n't want to trigger this from didFinishLaunching and run it on the main thread . The clock is ticking , and you have to get out of this method and put a view on the screen as fast as you can . If processing the data takes too long - think about older devices - the OS will kill you before you get a chance to finish . You probably want to do this on a background thread instead , or at minimum after the app has finished launching . <p> And the app delegate is really not an appropriate place for the Core Data stack . Make a data controller object , probably a singleton . <p> You say you check for your source plist file at launch , and the existence of the file tells you you nee to migrate . <p> If you get all the way through migration , you can rename the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source plist file tells you that you have migrated . <p> Another suggestion , though , is to handle the case where you get part-way through the migration and fail . In that case , your source file will still exist but so will the Core data backing sql file . <p> To handle that case , you might want to first check for the source plist , and then check for the backing sql file . If both exist , delete the sql file and recreate it . That way you start over with the migration after a failure . ( However if you fail because of something wrong with the format of the source plist , you 'll probably fail again , so in practice this might not be a big win . ) <p> You have to decide how much effort to put into error checking , reporting , and recovery , vs. speed of migration . More error checking and recovery code might make you succeed in migration more often , but at the cost of taking longer . <p> As far as how to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in didFinishLaunching is critical . <p> What I would do is display an alert with a " migrate " button on it , and when the user clicks the button , display another modal view with a progress indicator on it , and update the progress indicator as you work through the data . You should be able to find the number of records you need to convert , and update the progress indicator based on the number of records processed . Remember though that you have to service the event loop before your UI will update , so you might need to process a block of records , then call yourself again with a **38;9045;TOOLONG to process the next block of records . Even with a delay of 0 the app will service the event loop and re-draw the progress indicator . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623

I return a sql query and store it in a dictionary which then gets stored in an array <p> while ( sqlite3step ( compiledStatement ) == SQLITEROW ) //get sql data and store it in seperate strings called one called lName and another called contID , took this part out to shorten the code NSDictionary *peopleDictionary = NSDictionary **28;9439;TOOLONG : lName , @&amp;quot ; kLastNameKey&amp;quot ; , contID , @&amp;quot ; kContactIDKey&amp;quot ; , nil ; appDeleg.peopleArray **26;9469;TOOLONG ; <p> Now , the issue lies in the following : 2 . In my view controller , I have a search method that searches for what the user is typing as they type , which is then added to an array and called at didSelectRowAtIndexPath to show the results . I need to find a way to make a clone of my current array w/dictionary inside , but with only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched text in a variable NSString *searchText = searchBar.text ; //call the app delegate to bring back my array with a dictionary in it MyAppDelegate *appDeleg = ( MyAppDelegate * ) UIApplication sharedApplication delegate ; for ( NSString *sTemp in appDeleg.peopleArray LONG ... //get a range of all of the last names NSRange titleResultsRange = sTemp rangeOfString:searchText **31;9497;TOOLONG ; //if it 's greater than 0 , add it to an array if ( titleResultsRange.length &amp;gt ; 0 ) //add it to this array copyListOfItems addObject:sTemp ; //up to this point , it works fine when searching //but I want to get rid of copyListOfItems and put that //in a dictionary and then array , just like in the model //but only with results from the searched string so I can //bring them back up in the didSelectRowAtIndexPath ( replace copyListOfItems which is currently there ) <p> So , as stated , I have no idea how to do this in objective-c and am not sure if it 's even possible . Can anyone recommend a way to do this , a better method , or where I can go to find the answer ?

The quick way is to get a reference to the cell by calling cellForRowForIndexPath with the index path of the selected cell . Once you have a reference to the cell , then you can show or hide anything you want in that cell . This method works only if the cell happens to be showing at the time , which it is when it has just been selected . <p> This is quick , but it has a problem . If you use the normal reuse mechanism in a table view , then anytime a cell is scrolled out of view , it gets released to the reuse pool . Then that particular section and row is again scrolled back into view , the reuse mechanism will deliver whatever cell it wants to from the reuse pool . They are supposed to all be equal anyway , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will re-fill its contents in your cellForRowForIndexPath delegate method . The trouble is that you wo n't know whether or not to hide the label you were talking about . The memory of whether that label was hidden was stored in the particular cell that you modified in your selection method . And that cell is not necessarily the one you got back from the reuse pool . So that information is lost . <p> Note that this will not be a problem if your table is short enough that rows can not be scrolled off the screen .

And another noob question , how can I actually debug my code ? I set breakpoints but it never breaks anywhere ... <p> after recieving the final data what you have to do is you have to write that data to path i.e your apps documents folder <p> if your keeping breakpoint at a proper condition it will work definitely . if the breakpoint appears in light color i.e ignored . click on breakpoint button in toolbar and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thank u again , I know what I have to do , the problem is everything looks quite alright , but it just does n't work ... I 'm thinking if there is actually any data in the receivedData appendData:data ; line . <p> So finally , I got this thing half working now , there are still problems ... <p> Now when I run it , it downloads the data from a url , write it to an ' rdata.plist ' file under ' Documents ' . Next thing it 's supposed to do is to read from the rdata.plist and present it in the tableview and it does n't  do it ... BUT when I run it the second time , then it does it , why is that ? I 'll paste the RootViewController.m here , I think there 's some obvious mistakes here that I ca n't find them <p> Because you are calling your LoadCityData in y our viewDidLoad . That 's fine and dandy when the rdata.plist already exists ( which is why you see it load the 2nd time ) . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will load new city data right after the download completes . <p> Edit : <p> And just a side note , you are using createFileAtPath : each time your didReceive data .

According to the documentation " If a file already exists at path , then if the file can be overwritten ( subject to user privileges ) it will be .

That 's fine and dandy when the rdata.plist already exists ( which is why you see it load the 2nd time ) .

It sounds like yo uare assuming it will only get called one time for the entire download . That is not the case . It gets called multiple times during the course of the download ( each time a piece of data is received , in fact ) <p> You also need to make a call to reloadData for you table at the end of your LoadCityData .

I 'd prefer to work out my code first , since this is my ver first iphone project , I really want to learn how everything works , the basics , all these details . I 'm sure later on I 'll have to change a lot , maybe create something similar to that example , another class just for the downloading . But right now I want to know what should I do to fix the my code . Comparing with that example , I do n't have any buttons to trigger any downloading or playing events , everything will be fired when the view is loaded , it 's like : <p> Start the app --&gt; downloading data--&gt; store it locally--&gt;read the local file --&gt; show them on a tableview <p> right now I got that precedure mixed up it seems , it loads the view and show the table first , then download the data and save it . And if I just run the program in the emulator alone , it does n't  even do the download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simulator , first time I fire the app , it downloads the data but will not show anything in the tableview , then I delete the file from ' Documents ' folder and run the app again , it does n't download anything , so I have to restart the simulator . But if I just run it from xcode , it downloads everytime , and first time it does n't  show nothing , second time it shows the list . <p> I think it 's some pretty obvious mistakes I have , sorry , but for a beginner it 's not that easy to find and fix these mistakes , I 'd like to keep working till this bit works so I got the general idea of how asynchronous downloading works , then I can create a separate class just for the downloading part like Erika S did . <p> So , Thank you so much guys for ur patience to help a noob developer , may ur next project goes as smooth as Stewie 's head. ; ) <p> In the Rootviewcontroller , apparently , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related like numberOfRowsInSection go after , then it 's the asynchronous download , even tho u call the download function inside the viewdidload() , still it finishes in the end , that 's why first time run there is no data in the table , because data is actually downloaded after the whole view is rendered , as Smith said , the downloadprocess is called multiple times , so it just happened to finish downloading after the view is rendered . <p> The difference with Erica 's example is , in that example , it 's an undemond download , u press a button to load and another button to read and there is a progress bar , to prevent u from reading the file while the download is not finished . <p> So back in my case , is there a way to hold all the tableview rendering functions till the download is complete then fire them ? Or can we do the startup screen ? I do n't know how to do it tho , right now everything is inside rootviewcontroller . Or can I just show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> THANK U ALL SO MUCH ! ! <p> PS : I rewrote everything , now I have a separate class doing the downloading part . <p> The usual way to do this is to just append the data to an NSMutableData object as your didReceiveData method gets called ( repeatedly ) , and do n't write the file to disk until your **26;10085;TOOLONG method gets called . <p> It is possible to append the data to your file piece by piece in the didReceiveData method , but it will be slower . That approach is only really needed for downloading very large files that wo n't fit in memory . Your code is adding the incoming data to a mutable data object anyway ( receivedData ) so there 's no point in writing each piece of data to the file as it comes in . <p> If you DO want to write the data to a file as it comes in , I suggest you open the file at the beginning of the download and append each bit of new data to the end , but do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically , it says first download the file , then store it in a local file container , then read it from the file .

@@98150182 @2350182/ <h> Displaying images in TableViews cell <p> Hi guys , I 'm developing an app that retrieves data from an online plist that I have on my server , everything works just fine .. except for ONE big thingy .. I would like the app to display thumbnail images inside of each cell .. <p> When my app then loads it all looks beautiful .. but when i try to scroll down to see the other cells the app crashes .. and it highlights the first row in my code that i just showed you .. and it says : Thread 1 : signal SIGABRT ... <p> But it does exist .. in my plist there is 12 keys named " image " that holds a url ( string ) .. the app does actually show me the correct images for the rows ( cells ) that is visible when i start the app , its when i want to scroll down and see the other cells that the app crashes <p> But it does exist .. in my plist there is 12 keys named " image " that holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show me the correct images for the rows ( cells ) that is visible when i start the app , its when i want to scroll down and see the other cells that the app crashes <p> One of the rules of debugging is do n't assume anything . You think the string SHOULD exist , but that error message is telling you that it does not . Your job is to figure out why . <p> Do n't look at your plist , look at your data structure in memory . I gather that self.content is an array . Log the entire array to the console , and look at the contents . <p> Then add NSLog statements to your CellForRowAtIndexPAth that log the row , the dictionary at that index in self.content , and the string at the desired key . After all that , you will find missing string . Then you need to go figure out why it 's nil . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> Lines are shorter , easier to read , and the intent is much more clear . Additionally , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As far as your null array goes , refer to the documentation : <p> Returns nil if the location ca n't be opened or if the contents of the location ca n't be parsed into an array . <p> So you have two possibilities . Now you need to employ some basic troubleshooting steps . I would begin by grabbing that file manually , including it with your project , and loading it locally . If that works , then you have a network issue . If it still does n't work , then you have a file format issue . <p> But you ca n't just say " BAHH , why does n't my code work ? ? ! " Break it down into pieces ( I know it seems cool that you can pack lots of stuff into a single line of code , but do n't do it ) , analyze each piece to find the problem , and then solve that problem . NSLog is your friend . Referring back to your original problem , you had a nil string problem here : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes for this to be nil include : - The dictionary might not have a value for that key- The array might not exist <p> You answered by saying that your plist has a value for the key . Notice that I did not mention the plist in the previous two causes . The plist does n't matter until you address the other items . Why does n't the array exist ? Ok , now look at the plist , or at least how you load the plist . Why does n't the dictionary have that key ? Ok , now look at the plist . So break things out into pieces : <p> Anyways .. If I leave the images out of the game and only use the cell.textLabel.text and the **25;10202;TOOLONG it all loads nicely and I can scroll up and down without any crashes .. the issue is the images we now know .. <p> If the plist is n't possible to be parsed into an array the app should crash no ? <p> The strange thing is that the images load .. its when I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed right at application start ? I 've posted my plist but its waiting to be checked before published it said <p> At first I had five visible rows and it all worked fine .. I then added seven more the exact same way and they display like they should .. the problem is when I try to scroll down to the five " old " ones .. <p> If the plist is n't possible to be parsed into an array the app should crash no ? <p> The strange thing is that the images load .. its when I try to scroll when the app crashes .. should n't it have crashed right at application start ? <p> You keep making bad assumptions , and then proceeding as if those assumptions are facts without doing any testing . <p> No , the app will not crash if it can not parse the file . You will simply get back nil , as mentioned in the documentation quote I posted previously . That is a bad assumption , and you 've already been given the facts , so update your understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't not mean the contents are " correct " . Maybe you forgot to include an image key for one of the dictionaries . ( I 'm not seeing that here , but would be a good example of loads just fine , starts just fine , but then becomes an issue later ) . There are a variety of reasons that a table view would display normally initially and then crash upon scrolling . So saying it should have crashed at the beginning is again a bad assumption . <p> So again , we ( meaning you ) need to do some basic troubleshooting here. - Is the crash message the same every time , or does it change ? --- If it changes , what are other crash messages that you have seen ? - What are the contents of the dictionary for each row , as viewed via NSLog ? --- When it crashes , are those contents correct ? - What is the reason you are using LONG ... Why do you need the indexPath version of that method ? - Have you made this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash ? <p> You need to analyze each step between your plist and your table cell . Somewhere in there is the problem , and you need to break it into pieces to figure out where the problem is . Heck , remove the plist altogether and make the dictionaries by hand in code . Still have problems ? Then it has nothing to do with the plist . We 're not talking rocket science here . Analyze the problem and solve it .

For example , in the " AppDelegate.m " you would make sure to have <p> I too have used global variables for a very long time , and I honestly have never had any issues with them . I constantly see people stating that they should not be used , but I have never seen any good reasons why not . <p> For example in the article , the example of Shared Instances does not seem like it would be easier to follow than using the Globals.h/Globals.m classes that I use . All a programmer would need to do is look into the Globals class and see them all in one place . Not too difficult for me anyway . <p> One thing I forgot to mention about global variables though is that you should give them names that identify them as such . I always prefix a global variable with a lowercase " g " . This way , not matter where you are in your code , you will know which variables are globals . And if you wish to find where they are declared you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global var to pass data between two views but this seems not to work between two non-adjacent views . Let me explain . <p> 1 . I write the glob var in view 1 . 2 . I push down in view 2 , I can read the global var ok. 3 . I push down in view 3 , the global var are not there anymore . <p> I have also tried to copy the glob vars in view 2 to new ones , and these are not readable in view 3 <p> Any ideas why this behavior ? and are glob var really global throughout the whole app or just on one view controller . <p> Have you included the header for view 1 in view 4 ? I have seen on occasions global variable losing scope , but it 's normally due to the fact that I have n't reference them correctly . Globals can be dangerous in this respect . Hope this helps . <p> Have you included the header for view 1 in view 4 ? I have seen on occasions global variable losing scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't reference them correctly .

@@98150225 @2350225/ <h> Replies <p> CFURL is " toll-free bridged " with its Cocoa Foundation counterpart , NSURL . This means that the Core Foundation type is interchangeable in function or method calls with the bridged Foundation object . In other words , in a method where you see an NSURL * parameter , you can pass in a CFURLRef , and in a function where you see a CFURLRef parameter , you can pass in an NSURL instance . This also applies to concrete subclasses of NSURL . See Integrating Carbon and Cocoa in Your Application for more information on toll-free bridging .

When my app starts , I have an alert popup that 's a disclaimer which has " I Agree " and " I Disagree " buttons . <p> When the user clicks the " I Disagree " button , I want the application to quit .

I have the application terminating and I want to send the applicationWillTerminate message to the delegate from the view controller . How can I accomplish this ? <p> Well exit(0) kills your app , and as previously mentioned applicationWillTerminate wo n't get called so if you have any saving of files to do you can still put that in that event but you will need to call it yourself just before exit(0) . Also , if you are using preferences ( NSUserDefaults ) you will need to call synchronize before the exit(0) aswell otherwise they wo n't be saved . There might be other issues aswell so terminate is definately a cleaner solution because everything is handled and you do n't need to worry about stuff . Why this method is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I replaced exit(0) with the above and it seems to work fine ( it calls the necessary cleanup methods ) . But XCode gives me the warning " UIApplication may not respond to ' -terminate ' ( Messages without a matching method signature ... ) " . As far as I can tell , terminate does n't have any arguments so the signature should match . Is this fine , or should I pass something through ? <p> I 'd just say its because its not a published api . I do n't think they want you manually doing it but because exit(0) is allowed , I do n't think they 'd have a leg to stand on and they 'd just let it through . <p> I think the reason there 's no public terminate method is because it 's against the HIG for an app to just quit . They want the user to quit all apps by tapping the home button . <p> If your app has a situation where it ca n't continue to do anything useful that 's fine . Show an alert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the app ca n't do anything useful .

@@98150258 @2350258/ <h> Tic Tac Toe Tutorial - A Walkthrough <p> I have noticed a lot of people asking for help on creating a game . Everyone wants everyone else to basically build the game for them or they have unrealistic goals set on a big project . I realize that everyone wants to make Halo , F.E.A.R Files or Hello Kitty-s Island Adventure , but you got start small and get the basics first . You need to have fundamental understanding of how any program language works before you can create a BIG project . But no one developer is single handedly responsible for large games . <p> So I have decided to create a Tic Tac Toe game walkthrough for all of us NOOBs to game development . And that is the first time I have ever written the word noob in my life . I myself am no Objective-C master or whiz kid . I am a web developer with PHP , MySQL and Java programming background . I am attempting to learn Objective-C on the iPhone for fun . I have no idea what I am doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don-t either . So I figured we could all learn together by building a game that is - " simple- " . And because everyone knows the rules , we will all be on the same page for mechanics . We all have some unique experiences and I think that if we all contribute to one game , we all will learn something . <p> If those with greater experience sees that I am doing something wrong , or a better way of doing something , PLEASE by all means chime in . While I am not blatantly asking someone to basically do the code for me , it doesn-t hurt to have a guiding hand point us in the right direction . <p> On a side note , I am going to make mistakes . We may have to revisit what we have coded before and rewrite it . But that-s what learning is about . So be patient and I will TRY to answer questions if I know the answer . If you are reading this hoping to just get a copy of the finished product and don-t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then that is your choice . BUT you will miss the learning aspect of what I am trying to do , and you will not benefit from it at all . I also recommend not just copying and pasting the code into XCode . Try just typing out the code . This will aid in memory . I know it may seem like a lot of code at first , but just try it . If you want to learn something , you got ta practice it over and over again . I will try to be as clear as possible and post some images if I can along the way . If you want to add something to the tutorial that is great , and I encourage you to donate your information and I will include your code in the official tutorial . But for all intent and purposes MY posts will be the official walkthrough so anyone following along at home can skim through the forum to find my name and keep up with the tutorial . If you do put up some code for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible about what it is doing or why something will work . This will help everyone understand the reasoning behind your code . And its just good practice . ? So with all that said , let-s begin ! Start by downloading the zip file that contains the images . <p> TicTacToe <p> It helps to write out what we want it to do . Right now it will be as if there are two people playing the game . Later we may add an AI so the user can play against the computer . BUT let 's just getting it working right now . We want the user to touch a square on the board and place a X or an O depending on whose turn it is . <p> We want to check for a win after the user places their token on the board . If there is no winner , then update the text label to say that it is the next persons turn . We also want there to be a button that allows the user to manually reset the game . <p> Open XCode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called mine tictactoe . <p> Unzip the files and Drag them into the resources folder . <p> Open up **25;11503;TOOLONG and put in the following information : <p> Now open up the **27;11530;TOOLONG by double clicking it Drag one UIImageView to the window and resize it to be 300x300 and set its image to board.png by using the Attributes Inspector . <p> Then drag 1 more UIImageView to the window and resize it to 100x100 then check the box for User Interaction Enabled . <p> Then copy and paste that 8 more times . Move those boxes to be hovering over the spaces of the game board lining them up . <p> Drag a UILable to the window and position it under the board . <p> Drag a UIButton to the window and rename the text to RESET GAME . <p> Now that we have the basic layout , control click ( or right click if you can ) top left UIImageView starting and drag the + sign to the Files Owner and select S1 . <p> Then go to the top middle piece and do the same selecting S2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then control-click the Label and click the + sign and drag to files owner and select whoseTurn . <p> Then control-click the Reset Button and click the + sign from the TOUCH UP INSIDE and drag to the files owner and select resetButton . <p> Save and close the Interface Builder <p> Open up the **25;11559;TOOLONG and type the following code . <p> I have tried to comment a lot of it . And this is just a skeleton . <p> #import &amp;quot ; **34;11586;TOOLONG ; //the NSInteger holds a numerical value of the player //X is represented by a 1 ( one ) //O is represented by a 0 ( zero ) @implementation tictactoeViewController //since we created somethings in the header we need to synthesize them here . //just to keep things clean and in order I broke up the synthesizing but you could //have very well put them all on one line , or put everyone on its own @synthesize @synthesize s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 , s7 , s8 , s9 ; @synthesize oImg , xImg , whoseTurn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( NSString * ) nibNameOrNil bundle : ( NSBundle * ) nibBundleOrNil if ( self = super **28;11622;TOOLONG bundle:nibBundleOrNil ) return self ; //this is where we will put the touch event for the tic tac toe game - ( void ) touchesBegan : ( NSSet * ) touches withEvent : ( UIEvent * ) event //this is the button that will call the resetBoard method -(IBAction) buttonReset //method that will check to see if someone has won returns TRUE if someone wins -(BOOL) checkForWin //right now return 1 becuase we hav n't implemented this yet return 1 ; //this will reset the game , by clearing the board and reseting the playerTurn to 1 -(void) resetBoard //method that will change the player and update the label and place the X or O on the board - ( void ) updatePlayerInfo if ( playerToken == 1 ) playerToken == 2 ; //because now its the second players turn whoseTurn.text = @&amp;quot ; O can go&amp;quot ; ; //Update the label to tell who goes next if ( playerToken == 2 ) playerToken == 1 ; whoseTurn.text =@&amp;quot ; X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didReceiveMemoryWarning ; // Releases the view if it does n't have a superview // Release anything that 's not essential , such as cached data - ( void ) dealloc //we have to release all the stuff we created in the header for memory managment s1 release ; s2 release ; s3 release ; s4 release ; s5 release ; s6 release ; s7 release ; s8 release ; s9 release ; resetButton release ; board release ; oImg release ; xImg release ; whoseTurn release ; super dealloc ; @end <p> Now you should be able to build and run the project and see the board the UILabel and the Reset Button . <p> This is just a skeleton of the project so far . Nothing works right now . But we will get there . <p> This is all for now . If anyone has any suggestions or sees a problem with how I am doing it so far PLEASE say something ! <h> Replies <p> It is amazing that as soon as I start working on something , someone else comes out with the exact same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just re-made it in objC , its almost done . I was thinking about making a tutorial about it . <p> -(void)viewDidLoad //add the images , this way all we have to call is oImg or xImg instead of writing out UIIMage imagename : @ ..... oImg = UIImage imageNamed : @&amp;quot ; O.png&amp;quot ; ; xImg = UIImage imageNamed : @&amp;quot ; X.png&amp;quot ; ; //set the player token to 1 because we need to initalize the playertoken playerToken = 1 ; //update the text field to let player know who can go whoseTurn.text =@&amp;quot ; X can go&amp;quot ; ; <p> Also I need to correct the updatePlayerInfo method . Why ? Because if you look at it now when the method is called if the playerToken is 1 it sets it to 2 . Then it looks at the second if statment and sets the player token back to 1 . And we are n't actually setting anything , I have two == which is doing a comparsion . <p> So here is the updated updatePlayerInfo method <p> //method that will change the player and update the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ( void ) updatePlayerInfo if ( playerToken == 1 ) playerToken = 2 ; //because now its the second players turn whoseTurn.text = @&amp;quot ; O can go&amp;quot ; ; //Update the label to tell who goes next else playerToken = 1 ; whoseTurn.text =@&amp;quot ; X can go&amp;quot ; ; <p> Now for the fun part The touches method will check to see which UIImageView was touched and then update its view with the correct image . There has got to be a better way to do that than the way I have created it . <p> I 'm glad you 're doing this . I just did the same thing this past Sunday . ( not a tutorial ) but TicTacToe and it was extremely educational for myself . I 'd love to see you 're implementation of it . I came from basically the same background as you and this is all new , but I 've been at it for a few weeks now and I 'm starting to make some headway . So far , what I 've seen I like yours better : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok to see better implementations of something you already struggled through personally - so THANKS AGAIN ! : D <p> Well thanks ! I would n't call my way better than anyone else 's though . There is a lot I still do n't know . And since no one really has corrected me on anything i have done so far , I guess I am on the right track . I 'll be posting another part of the tutorial soon . <p> It 's really not much yet , but I think it 's just a notch cleaner . I tried to do a switch on the frame touches , but I ca n't figure out how to make that work : SWITCH statements only work on integers ( which is why it works on the playerToken variable . <p> I 'm going to switch gears for a second though and see if I can solve how to make this thing declare winners , losers , and cats games . Suggestions from others on the fastest / least complicated / best method for determining winner ? My first guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1=2=3 then winner if 4=5=6 then winner if 7=8=9 then winnerDiagonal wins if 1=5=9 then winner if 3=5=7 then winnerVertical wins if 1=4=7 then winner if 2=5=8 then winner if 3=6=9 then winner <p> Once you get a " winner " situation , then you look up which side won and declare it . This seems like a STUPID LONG way around the road . Help ? <p> I was thinking of a way to determine that too , maybe we could use an array to that gets updated with the playerToken . <p> For example <p> when playerToken is 1 and the player touches s3 , well in the IF statement that deals with the s3 image we could put in an array 13 , 1 being the player token and 3 being the slot touched . <p> and since we already have the logic AEDave provided <p> Horizontal wins if 1=2=3 then winner if 4=5=6 then winner if 7=8=9 then winnerDiagonal wins if 1=5=9 then winner if 3=5=7 then winnerVertical wins if 1=4=7 then winner if 2=5=8 then winner if 3=6=9 then winner <p> then everytime we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compares each of those 8 statements . <p> AEDave I really like what you did with the switch statements ! I am going to incorporate your style into the tutorial because it does help clean up the code a little . The only thing I am going to change is this : <p> I 'll be honest ; I 'm a tad bit stuck - how do I access that BOOL value ? ? ? I know that 's about as noob a question as can probably come . This is being called from -(void)touchesBegan ... as self checkForWin ; <p> What we may end up doing is changing the checkForWin method from BOOL to ( void ) that way we can do more things in the checkForWin . IE Updating the label to say who won . <p> But yeah , to call the checkForWin method to be called you would use self checkForWin ; <p> But I now do not see how just returning a BOOL will help us . We need to probably just change it to ( void ) . <p> Some ideas that I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store the locations and identities of who placed what were . That will give us some experience on working with an array . <p> Also when we finally settle on the proper way of creating the checkForWin , using an Alert pop up to display the winner . And " OK " ing the box will call the resetGame . <p> Another idea , just for shits and giggles is adding some sort of score counter , that keeps up with how many wins the X has , O has and Draw has . And storing that in an NSDictionary file that will remember the wins . Kinda like a leader board . <p> I usually get ahead of myself and think of other things I would like to add , well we WILL add as we progress through the tutorial . So here is a wish list of ideas for you all to think about and tinker with and see how to implement them . <p> Using the Accelerometer to clear the board by shaking the iPod/iPhone. and when the board is cleared the images kinda fall off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So do you any of you have any ideas you want to add to the wishlist ? I am sure our collective knowledge can pull off anything we think of . <p> Right , but even if I get that fixed , how do I call this set of actions to return the BOOL so I can use it ? <p> Obviously , the return = NO ; needs to be moved up to the top of the method , I just do n't know how to use what is being returned . Am I calling it wrong ? <p> Well right now we do n't have anything to utilize that BOOL . It can return TRUE or FALSE anytime but we still do n't have anything to do with it . We could have another method that calls the the checkForWin method , like a displayWinner method that calls the checkForWin. and from there we could go to do whatever it is we need to do . <p> The only thing left , just to get this thing humming , is to figure out how to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , I 'm about 10 seconds from changing it to a ( void ) function since I have at least a marginally better understanding of how those work ) and declare a winner ( I 'm guessing an alert would be a nice way to wrap it up ) . Also need to add in one simple function for a " cats game " in the win function .

@@98150265 @2350265/ <h> Moving UITextField When Keyboard Pops Up ! <p> Welcome everybody ! This tutorial is going to show you how to move a textfield whenever the keyboard pops up ! One of the biggest problems with textfields is that when the keyboard pops up , the content gets stuck under the keyboard resulting in the total or partial obstruction of the very textfield that your users are trying to write in ! ! There are several fixes for this problem , but I will only be showing you my version . So feel free to explain any methods that I did n't in the comments , or email me so I can include it in the tutorial ! <p> The easiest method of un-obstructing the textfield is simply by moving it . Here is what you do : First you need to make sure that the delegate is selected for the textfield in your interface builder file ( xib containing textfield ) . So under the connections tab in your inspector window , make sure that your text field has the delegate set to self . You can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /* UITextField Name */ . delegate = self ; <p> But you have to make sure you set it in the . h file in between the brackets like this , or else you get an error : <p> ViewController : UIViewController /* apparently this is also html code because it wo n't show up but it is the &amp;quot ; UIText Field Delegate&amp;quot ; without the &amp;quot ; ' s or the spaces . */&amp;lt ; **26;11708;TOOLONG ; <p> Most of the code here is unnecessary because we are simply moving the textfield 's y origin down 100 points , going up . The UIView animations are simply for visual effect , I personally dislike seeing a textfield appear out of thin air . You can also change the y origin 's movement from 100 to any size amount that you need . So go ahead and try it out to see what happens . You should see a nice textfield moving up every time you click on it to change the text , bravo . Now let 's move it back down when you 're done with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now let 's do just one more thing : Let 's have it so that the textfield will return whenever you click somewhere else on the screen . I personally dislike having to put text in a textfield every time before the Done button will show up . So here 's what you do : Simply add this code : <p> And .. Wallah that 's it ! Now you have a very professional text field that not only moves up and down to avoid being trapped behind the keyboard , it also returns whenever you click out of it . No more having to put unnecessary text in to see the done button ! ! ! Huzzah ! Well , that 's all I got for you .

If admob is paying between $0.15 and $0.80 per 1000 ad impressions then it depends upon how many ad impressions you are able to show - which depends upon how many times your app is run each day and for how many ads you show during a session . That depends upon both the type of app and the number of users . <p> Also , do n't forget to factor in that adMobs fill rate can vary from 15% to 90% as they do not currently have enough customer ads to fill all the available apps running their software to show ads . <p> At the lowest end ( .15 eCPM and 15% fill ) you would make 2 cents per 1000 impressions available and at the high end ( .80 eCPM and 90% fill ) you could make 72 cents per 1000 impressions - 36 times as much . <p> Just looking for approximate numbers from anyone who is currently using AdMob . <p> $1 a month ? $100 a month ? $1000 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheers . <p> My free application " Picture Map " that is showing thumbnails of your iphone camera roll content on google map have been downloaded 3000 times in 2 weeks is generating an average of 1.5$ a day on admob ... <p> Hi : How many sessions per day and how many ad impressions per session do you have to fill ?

As I said , you will need a UINavigationController on top of your main view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top , using which the user can dismiss the ABPersonView and go back to the main view . There is no code needed to dismiss the ABPersonView .. <p> Have a look at the ABPersonView in the Contacts app that comes with the iphone . They use the Nav bar method as well to show the ABPersonView and dismiss it . <p> generally with the personpicker and detail views , if you are using the API , then you should keep these things in mind <p> 1 . the API automatically saves changes 2. you do not use a navigationController , it should be presented as modal , create a detailView property for the persons detail view , then you can customize what is shown ( only phone and email ) you can also edit directly in there , and it saves without you calling any method . 3. you cant really change the overall look of the person picker , or the detail view , but you can control what properties are shown <p> the last one really got me , for example <p> there is no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i could not find a way to add such a button , even if you add a button to the peoplepicker , literally inside on the top , if you hit search , and then exit search , or finish , the done button is covered by the tab bar , and you can not find out what method is called when exiting search as to bring the button to front . <p> also , you can not change the title , i did not want ALL contacts , i wanted my own title . not possible <p> to be honest , i think that api is a bit restricted , you can only grab things , and show hide properties and set certain limited things , which is not in line with many of the other abilities of the phone . <p> Presenting the modal view makes sense in the case of " Prompting the User to Create a New Person Record " because you can dismiss the view with the save or cancel button . <p> In the case of " Displaying and Editing a Person Record " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the API ( and the view ) does not provide for ANY buttons within the said view to dismiss itself after you are done displaying it . So its a typo in the guide rather than any API restriction . <p> BTW , you can programatically add buttons/fields ( basically your own subviews inside ) and change the background of **27;11906;TOOLONG . Though I doubt Apple will be particularly happy about it ! ! <p> I still havent figured out how to handle the actions from the button though . And I dropped the idea of changing the background lest Apple became a bit grumpy about their API rules and so forth . <p> Looking back at Kareem 's problem in dismissing the view . Kareem , you will have to use either - **26;11935;TOOLONG method or pushViewController method to present the NewPersonView . Likewise , for dismissing the view , you need to use dismissModalView or popViewController depending on what method you have used to present the view . <p> Presuming the you have used self **36;11963;TOOLONG Animated:YES to present the ABNewPersonView . Can you try the following code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roller * ) newPersonViewController **35;12001;TOOLONG ) person NSLog ( @&amp;quot ; done&amp;quot ; ) ; // self navigationController **29;12038;TOOLONG ; &amp;lt ; - Do n't  do this unless u pushed it in //the first place self **38;12069;TOOLONG ; //newperson release ; I am assuming dismiss will be enough .. no need to release ? not sure though <p> correct , you have to use the presentmodal , for the people picker , and pushController for the person view , ther is no other way to do it . <p> in the case of the peoplepicker , you can not add buttons , in the personview , where you see all the details in the person view , yes you can . <p> i had a mare of a time with the peoplepicker API , i ended up having to make changes to my design , as i thought i could do a lot of the things i wanted , how wrong was I. <p> in the end , i got it all working thou , a minor adjustment to the design work flow , and it is fine . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you view the people picker , if they have 1 email , it auto selects that , stores in an array , if you click a person with no email , it shows the personview , and you must edit and enter an email address , if there are more than 1 email , you are again shown the people view , but you select the email , it also accounts for different mails in a multiple mail instance , so you can add all emails of a person .

But , it 's just a set of functions that use BSD sockets and integrate them with the run loop so you do n't have to create threads . You can still use BSD sockets yourself , and there are tons of C socket programming tutorials around . <p> You can also try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a lightweight Objective-C wrapper around sockets . Very easy to use , and it should compile and work on the iPhone . <p> Hi i read most of the iphone sdk and some threads but i still do n't  fully understand most of it .

What about non-blocking sockets ? it would be very helpful , please please help me . Thanks in Advance . <p> For this I use NSStream classes - Cocoa hi-level socket implementation ( based on CFSocket ) which are also available on iPhone . It uses delegation for handling stream events and it 's very easy to implement in your code . You have a stream programming guide in Apple 's documentation . Go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to stream programming guide which also shows you on how to read/write network sockets . <p> What I 've done in my remote control ( it 's used for controlling some electronic WLAN devices that we build in company ) app is something like this and it works perfect : <p> 1 ) created a Communicator class ( subclass of NSObject ) that sets NSInputStream and NSOutputStream objects for connecting to TCP socket 2 ) created a protocol CommunicatorDelegate in this communicator class for delegation 3 ) set the NSStream delegate method - ( void ) stream : ( NSStream * ) theStream handleEvent : ( NSStreamEvent ) streamEvent to handle reading and writing to socket 4 ) I 'm using a Singleton instance method for this Communicator class so that I can access socket from anywhere in my application . <p> I do n't know if this is the right method for implementation but it works great for me . The only downside of NSStream , NSInputStrem and NSOutputStrem is that they only work on TCP sockets and not on UDP . For reading UDP broadcast pockets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a real mess to program . <p> hey i had used code of NSStream that is given abovve and it works fine but when network or socket is unavaillable than application hangs . is there any way that we can show UIAlertview that socet is not connected and application does not hang . <p> Hi , is anybody try to secure the connection with TLS or SSL , I have a lot of problems with that , can anybody tell me how this can be done ? <p> but i get an error ( at input stream ) : Operation could not be completed .

Apple have said that they ca n't change the name on an individual account but that he can upgrade to a company account and add me as a member . He has not done it yet and wo n't reply to emails , can anyone think what problems he might have encountered or do you think he just has n't done it ? Thanks in advance .

@@98150300 @2350300/ <h> Comparing Swift performance to Objective-C <p> When Apple first announced Swift , they claimed dramatic speed improvements . <p> I was skeptical . I 'm an old assembler programmer . I know how to write code that runs fast . <p> When I write code that 's churning through large amounts of data , I tend to use C arrays and pointer math , rather than trying to use NSArrays . It seems obvious that the overhead of everything being an object and message passing is going to slow things down . <p> Thus , I suspected that Apple 's claims that Swift is faster than Objective-C was based on naive code written in Objective-C , where everything is an object . <p> Several years ago I wrote a prime number generator as a teaching aid for my son , who was starting to get interested in programming . It 's mostly in C , with some Objective-C wrappers for displaying information and such-like . <p> I decided to implement the same algorithm in Swift and see which is faster . This algorithm makes heavy use of arrays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tests each candidate number to see if it can be evenly divisible by existing known primes . If not , it gets added to the list of primes . It ends up doing millions of array accesses , and an array append for each new prime . <p> I ended up with a test project that let 's you run the same algorithm in either Swift or Objective-C , and use either array objects or memory buffers in either language . ( Swift has a collection wrapper for memory buffers that gives you array syntax . ) <p> With the standard Debug settings , where optimizations are turned off , Swift performance is horrible . Code that takes a few seconds in Objective C takes MINUTES in Swift . ( 6 min 7 sec for Swift vs about 9.2 sec for Objective-C ) . For array-intensive algorithms , Swift in debug mode is all but unusable . <p> All my tests therefore use release mode , with optimizations of " Fastest " ( or fastest+unchecked ; see below ) <p> C code beats out the fastest Swift code I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Xcode 6.2 , using Swift 1.1 , the Swift version takes about 1.45 times longer than the Objective-C code using C arrays . <p> If you turn off array index range checking with a compiler switch the Swift code gets a little faster , and if you use the Xcode 6.3 beta , it gets a little faster still . In that case the Swift code ( using memory buffers with an array interface ) is very close to Objective-C/C . Swift takes about 1.08 x times longer than my C/Objective-C code . That 's awfully close . However , turning off array bounds checking is dangerous , and I do n't know of a way to do that for only one array object . As far as I know this change is for the entire project . It 's probably possible to do change compiler settings for a single source file , but I do n't know how to do that off the top of my head . <p> Things are much different if you use the array classes in both languages . <p> In that case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To generate 2 million primes , Swift takes about 7.35 seconds , down to about 5.9 seconds if you use Xcode 6.3 and use the compiler setting that turns off array bounds checking . Objective-C using NSArrays takes around 31 seconds to do the same job . Objective-C with NSArrays takes about 4.3 times longer than Swift using it 's Array class . <p> So the bottom line is that if you 're using Array objects in both languages , Swift is much faster . If you 're writing optimized code to squeeze the fastest performance out of each , though , C/Objective-C still has a slight edge . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623

Those people are not " pirates " since they would be technically incompetent in the first place . <p> Also , when it comes to protecting code , I do n't know what you 're doing but it took me about 2 hours to implement something decent ( i.e. not obvious to remove by simply patching a string or force a jump over the test . ) I should also mention that I have quite some experience in what is " easy " to patch and what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in the first few weeks after its release .

For instance , for a game , you give the game engine for free but you then sell the different levels needed to play beyond the two or three free levels you included in the free game .

Even if most of these users would not buy it anyway ( we agree on this point ) , there are still a few ones that would ( if it took some time to crack it ) to make a difference to your bottom line and simply going from 10% legit / 90% cracked to 15% legit / 85% cracked would make a significant difference . <p> At some point , Apple will have to look into this . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem will take care of itself and many good developers will look somewhere else or we 'll all be moving to a version of the cable business model which is to distribute crap in order to sell ads . Maybe that 's what we should do . Stop trying to develop decent casual games and start pushing " free " junk with embedded ads and cash in on the number of eye balls that look at them .

There are very few of them with skills above the script kiddy level , most of them only know how to run crackulous on an app and upload to a file sharing site . <p> If enough of us implemented enough varied and difficult methods at once there is no way the few talented crackers would be able to hack and patch everything that comes out ( especially if you jumble things around a bit in each update ) . They 'd be completely overwhelmed . <p> For this to work right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone needs to implement a subset of them in *their own way* . If everyone takes a code snippet like this , or uses your canned solution it 's way too easy to defeat . <p> This will never happen if we do n't simply share what we know about the topic . <p> I 'm not sure I get what you are saying ... the four checks you are doing are obviously not effective if LuckyWheel has been pirated . Either that or the pirates just Hex Edited your game to disable your checks . That points out a flaw with your anticrack source , each of these checks you 've implemented can be defeated with IDA , a Hex Editor , and a couple hours of some teenager 's time . <p> I beg to differ . Not a single check has been disabled . All those people thinking that they are getting the full version are actually getting a Lite version . Thus they can test it for 10 rounds and will be prompted to purchase the game after that . <p> Great free advertising ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desktop containing : LuckyWheel as I built it , LuckyWheel as it was illegally distributed and LuckyWheel how it looks on my iPhone . <p> There are a couple of really obvious differences , I 'd estimate around 5 , that can be easily used to detect cracks . <p> Also the guys that have contributed to AntiCrack have already come up with two ingenious additional methods on top of what I thought of in just half a day . That 's exactly the scenario where a closely knit group of known people has it 's leg up over individuals sweating over how to do crack detection . Time that 's lost for the final product . <p> So , I summary : YES it is easy to crack an app that is not protected . YES it is also easy if you do n't spend much time on the crack detection . And YES , there IS a large enough group of people with - as you say - a large arsenal of possible methods that can be made into a constantly morphing crime fighting superbot. : - ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come with me if you wan na live " &lt;extending hand and looking like Arnold&gt; <p> Unfortunately , I can not discuss the details in a public forum . However , I wanted to tell people like you how your simple protections could be easily bypassed by patching the binary . <p> Think differently , build your code in such a way that you do n't do a test per se and make sure that if someone bypasses key portions of it then only a " lite " version will be running . Make sure that removing it implies much more than simply adding a JMP in assembler to bypass your test(s) . Make it painful to remove . <p> I am looking in the sig in this thread of Oliver Drobnik-AntiCrack : The easiest way to add copy protection and crack detection to your paid apps . <p> Is that any good , will it protect my apps from pirates ? I am a new developer , I have a bunch of apps in review , I work hard and without making money it is hard to justift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if one wants to keep developing that I can protect my apps . <p> Hmm , If i 'm lucky enough to get a best-selling app , I think I 'll make an ad-supported version . I think I 'll be the most active seeder and poster of the " crack " . It may even have content that Apple would have rejected <p> Anyway , seeing that Spore 's big-league DRM got beat before the product was even released , I do n't think I 'll bother with conventional warfare .

@@98150328 @2350328/ 11624 @qwx871624 <p> I would n't say an array of dictionaries is a horrible way of storing your data . It has pros and cons both . The major pro is that it is very easy to save such a structure to a property list or keyed archive , and read it back . That does n't require any effort at all . Arrays and dictionaries also play very nicely with XML and JSON . The new Objective C literal support that was added to Xcode 4.4 and fleshed out in Xcode 4.5 makes this style of coding easier to write , and much easier to read and maintain . <p> You can mitigate the problem with dictionaries and documentation by putting all your dictionary keys in a single place , in a keys.h file , where they are grouped by the structure in which they are used .

As you change your data structures you have to maintain your NSCoding methods , and once you release an app " into the wild " , adding new fields to your data structures or removing old fields becomes difficult . Now your NSCoding methods need logic to decide what version of data they are reading and adapt accordingly . Been there , done that . That 's not pretty either . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> I tend to use NSDictionary for data structures which contain only NSString objects , and custom classes for more complex data structures ( e.g. ones which may contain other objects or require helper methods ) . <p> I 'm considering moving away from this entirely in the near future since I 'm considering moving all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is that some of the data does not get stored properly in text files ( e.g. non-English text ) so I 'm thinking of moving it entirely to SQLite3 , which seems to be able to store any characters . <p> Edit - actually , thinking back I can recall some cases where I read in from a text file to NSString , split using newline as a delimiter , and then read the values using NSArray objectAtIndex : . These are hangovers from the early days of the development of a really complex app which has been in constant development for 2 years . I think it might be time for a rewrite ! <p> Property list and TableView are two completely different things . A property list is a data structure ( represented by a . plist file ) , and a TableView is a UI component which is used to display information on-screen to the user . You would retrieve the data from the property list , and then display it on screen . <p> If you do n't know how to display data in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch some videos on YouTube . Specifically , you need to look into the method tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath : . <p> Table views are fairly complex beasts . You have to set up a delegate and a data source . The data source responds to queries about the number of sections in the table view , the number of rows in each section , and creates and returns table view cells on demand as the table view needs to display data . <p> There is a good set of sample applications in the Xcode documentation called TableViewSuite that shows how to use table views in increasing complexity . If I remember correctly , it starts out with a simple , one-section table view that displays time zones around the world . <p> Do a search in the Xcode documentation on " TableViewSuite " to find it . <p> There are also lots and lots of tutorials available , online and in books , that show how to set up table views . <p> It sounds like your needs are fairly simple : a sectioned table view with 5 rows per section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line1 , line2 , name , and state . <p> ( Not 5 sections as you said , but enough sections for the entries in your array , and 5 rows per section . ) <p> Your **31;12579;TOOLONG method would dequeue a cell if it was available or create a new cell if needed , then use the section number as an index into your array . You 'd fetch the dictionary at the specified index . <p> You 'll need an array of keys into your dictionary , and you 'd use the row number as an index into the array of keys , fetch the item at that key from your dictionary , and install the string at that key into your cell . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> Can u please tell me how to add them to property list instead of TableView .. ? <p> If you already have an array of dictionaries , as you showed in your first post , then you 're done . A property list is just a way of saving objects to a file . <p> NSArray has a method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property list file . NSDictionary has a similar method . In order for those methods to work , every object in the array , and every object contained in those objects must be a " property list object " . ( A small set of object types : NSString , NSData , NSDate , NSNumber , NSArray , or NSDictionary objects ) <p> The array data you showed your first post appears to consist of all property list objects , so you should just be able to save it to disk using the NSArray writeToFile:atomically : method . 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 <p> I would n't say an array of dictionaries is a horrible way of storing your data . It has pros and cons both . The major pro is that it is very easy to save such a structure to a property list or keyed archive , and read it back . That does n't require any effort at all . Arrays and dictionaries also play very nicely with XML and JSON . The new Objective C literal support that was added to Xcode 4.4 and fleshed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write , and much easier to read and maintain . <p> You can mitigate the problem with dictionaries and documentation by putting all your dictionary keys in a single place , in a keys.h file , where they are grouped by the structure in which they are used . That is what I do . Then , when I modify a dictionary and add new key/value pairs , I ALWAYS define a new constant for that key . By ALWAYS defining a key in my keys.h file in order to use a new key/value pair , my code documentation is forced to stay current . <p> Creating a custom data container object also has some real advantages , and that is the way I tend to tackle this sort of problem , but not always .

If you have complex objects with lots of instance variables , it can be lots of work to write the NSCoding methods . Worse , if your object has instance variables that are not NSCoding compliant , you have to modify , subclass , or add categories to those objects to add NSCoding support . <p> Now imagine that you write a document-based application that uses NSCoding to save the root data object of a document to a document file . Say the app supports exchanging these documents , like Apple 's pages , numbers , and other apps do . <p> If you then update your application in the field and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph , you 've now got serious compatibility issues . The new version of the program will expect these new fields to be present in your documents , and the old version will not know about these extra fields . The old version of the app will drop newly defined fields on the floor if you open a new-format document with an old version of your program , then save the document back . <p> Worse , your new-version application needs special code in it 's initWithCoder method to check to see what version of a document file you are opening , and only try to read the new fields for new-format documents . Failure to do this can cause your new-version application to crash when it tries to read old-format documents . <p> ( I have been in this exact situation under Mac OS ) 11625 @qwx871625 11623 @qwx871623 
@@98150329 @2350329/ <h> Adding Views to Your Application <p> Hey Everyone ! Today I 'm going to show you how to add another ViewController and View to your application . Adding additional views is a key concept that many iPhone developers have trouble grasping . This tutorial will show you how to add as many views to your application as you like , simply and easily without hassle . So let 's get started ! <p> The first step to adding a view to your application is adding the viewcontroller files and the xib . In Xcode , click on File , New File , UIView Controller Subclass under the Cocoa Touch Class Tab . You can name your view files whatever you 'd like , I named mine Options . It should look like this : <p> Next , you 're going to open up your MainViewController.h file ( Or whatever View Controller header file you want to add the view to ) in your project and add this line : <p> - ( IBAction ) SwitchView : ( i 'd ) sender ; <p> The name does n't necessarily have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . This will add a button action to interface builder with which you can switch your views . <p> Note that if you want the new view to be animated , put YES and if not then put NO . What this code does is import the new view controller header file to your MainViewController.m file and put an action to the previously defined IBAction that we put in the . h file . <p> Now that you 've added the appropriate code to your MainViewController , the ViewController that is going to open the new view , you need to create a button and link it to the IBAction(SwitchView) in Interface Builder or the equivalent in XCode 4 . This step should be pretty self explanatory , but I 'll explain it , add a button to your MainView.xib in interface builder , name the button , " Next View " , next right click the button and click-drag from touch down to the view box in interface Builder or Xcode 4 and link it with SwitchViews . <p> Now you can click build and run your project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new view opens up ! ! ! Just one more step though , and you 're good to go . <p> Open up the Options.h file in your project ( Or whatever you named your new viewcontroller.h file ) and add this line : <p> -(IBAction)back : ( i 'd ) sender ; <p> this line creates a new interface builder option to go back to the main view <p> Note that you can always dismiss the view without animations by changing the YES to a NO in the above code . What this code does is add an Action to the previously defined IBAction that we put in the header file .

I am developing a table view app where the table displays one list of insects then the next view is a table of plants specific to the users selection . When the user selects a plant in cell in the second table I want view to go to a view specific to the plant like a jpg or some text for ex .

Appreciate any suggestions . <h> Replies <p> According to the docs , the title property on a UIAlertAction is readonly . Thus your question should be " why does UIAlertController let me change the titles on my actions " rather than asking why you ca n't change the title of the entire alert/action sheet .

I did n't pick up on the read only aspect . As I mentioned it works in 8.3 but nothing in the API diffs saying it changed from read only to read write . I 'll have to use a custom view instead . <p> So I used one of my support tickets and asked about the fact I was able to write to the readonly property . <p> This is the reply from Apple <p> The reason your code compiles without any warnings is that objects returned from an NSArray are of type ' i 'd ' . Because ' i 'd ' is the generic type , able to hold a pointer to any Objective-C object , the compiler can not enforce selector checking . Thus , the compiler will allow you to send any message with a known selector to an object of type ' i 'd ' . This will of course produce a runtime error if that object does not actually implement the corresponding method . As you have discovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at runtime . However , there are no guarantees that it will continue to do so .

Do n't quote me , but from my recollection is may be 3 max at any time . <p> If you do it on a computer , and create multiple accounts , you 're limited too . Used to not be that way . But Apple started cracking down on too many accounts . <p> Obviously you are allowed a few .. since many users share their devices and computers with family members .

Set the segue type to push in both cases , and then click on the segues and give them unique identifier strings , like " PushOptionsSegue " and " PushPickerSegue " . <p> Then , in your didSelectRowAtIndexPath method , use code like this to trigger one of those segues : <p> Then , in your prepareForSegue method , have a switch statement that figures out which type of segue is firing , fetches the destination view controller , and passes the appropriate info to it .

Also being featured by Apple helps , but that 's hard to come by . <p> Not to be a downer , but because you are doing your due diligence , you should know that the majority of developers on the App Store probably do not make any money . It will be an uphill battle for the get-go ( as it is with any business ) . But right now supply for apps vastly outstrips demand , so the gold rush days are indeed over . <p> ofc ofc i totally understand its just i do n't  know whether i should bother spending 100 quid ( dev fee and books ) on something i wont get my money back , however at the end of the day ill have the power to create apps on mac platform and on iphone i guess <p> No problem . There is definitely a good chance that you wo n't make that 100 spot back , but like you said it will be a learning experience and something you can put on your resume if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed up to the dev program nearly a year ago I was told the same thing .

I set a benchmark of success as making back my developer fee ( The post is still on here somewhere I 'm sure ) . I have since made back my fee many many times over , to my very great surprise . <p> Granted , I put a LOT of thought and hard work into the app , and I learned much more than I ever expected in the process . I actually began the project on the simulator with the intent of expanding my programming knowledge , not ever thinking of selling it .

If you build it ( and build it well ) , they will come . <p> So in a month I would pay back my dev fee and aslong as I have polished apps then i should make some revenue ? which type of app seems to produce the most profit ? <p> Yes . <p> The difference is when the App Store first opened you would have paid that off before lunch time on the first day . <p> About a year ago you 'd stand a very good chance of paying it after 2 to 3 days . <p> Now it 's pretty much like the others have described .

To start with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where as now it must be close to 100,000 apps . <p> The App Store is now like an over crowded corner store rather than a large super market . Basically everything is crammed into a small selection of categories . Your best chance now of exposure is search keywords . I would much rather see more detailed sub categories ( ie : increase the store size so people can virtually walk down more isles , rather than crappy search terms ) . <p> As long as you make stand out application with good interfaces , people will buy it . You need to build yourself up as a brand and a person/company that can be relied upon to deliver a quality product . <p> Coming out with a crappy product wo n't sell . In the beginning of the app store there were few apps but now there are multitudes to choose from . <p> How Am I Feeling ? - The Mood Analyzer , our first app released , is n't a groundbreaking piece of software but it IS better designed than the competition ( in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We did n't come out first so we have to make sure we come out BETTER and those are the types of apps that are going to sell and be successful . <p> so it does n't  matter if my app is n't original is what your saying ? and that aslong as its different in a sense and has features no other apps have im good ? so i could be making money FOR EXAMPLE making a calculator or some item like that ? <p> Although cutting-edge originality is overrated , you 'll run into trouble if you try to squeeze into an overcrowded category .

The new satellite dish pointing app , for example , has ( when I checked last ) 4 5 star reviews ( all glowing , well written reviews ) , one 3 star , and 5 1-star ratings . <p> Now , there is no competition that I can see for this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating does n't seem to make any sense unless they really did n't like the app , and were upset with having had to pay so much for them .

I did n't bother with the other 5 star reviews , but they all looked like advertisements for the app as well . <p> Maybe its just me , but that turns me right off of buying from companies like that , and really makes me wonder about the quality of their apps . <p> Some Apps or Games are just naturally polarizing in their reviews .

With each new update you can do an unfair thing - use each promo code to create new account to rate yourself . This gives you up to 50+ ratings for each version E.g. if you used 50 codes for that for the 1st version and 50 for the second - you will be able to generate 100 rates for the current version just by yourself . <p> However I 'm too lazy to go with this and I do a bit different way . <p> I 've noticed that writing a really good/polished app is a bad thing if rates/reviews are your concern . People just install it and use w/o deleting and rating . Good reviews are rare . Bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished apps . <p> But I can not overcome myself and create bad product so ... For my apps I 've got in average only 1 ( one ) 5* review plus 2-3 5* rates per each 1000 sales that were done by customers themselves . And when there was a rare bug/crash it produced 1 1* rates ( w/o reviews ) for each 2-3k sales . In total most of the rates 5* a few 4* and a few 1* . <p> But then I 've come to the idea how I can get more good rates reviews . I 'm receiving e-mails from my customers with questions/suggestions and etc . Mostly they state that the apps are really good ones When I 'm replying to them I 'm writing somethinkg like " thank you very much for good reply ... that 's very motivating ... as well as good reviews/rates in itunes " And thanks to those customers - they leave positive reviews Some of them do it quite creative so it could look like a friends review . <p> I agree , these people who leave 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean if an app is bad , then it deserves it , but I just launched my app and I am getting 5 star reviews from real people - and bogus 1 star reviews from people who get to remain anonymous . <p> This is another reason we created " RateMyApp " - a review service for app developers . The concept is pretty simply -we bring a team of 25-50 people in to review your app and leave comments . We provide you demographic data so you can see how your app is doing with men , women , families , age groups , etc .
