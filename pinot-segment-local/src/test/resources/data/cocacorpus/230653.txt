@@43426023 @3426023/ <h> How to Thaw Chicken Safely <p> Have you asked yourself what is the safest way to thaw chicken ? - Over time , I 've had a lot of community members ask what is the proper way of thawing chicken . Today , we are going to cover those options . <p> While the MOMables meal plan helps you with the menu , recipes , and some of the planning , sadly , we cant actually prep and cook it all for you . There are however , built-in kitchen tips and time-saving ideas to help you along . <p> Since we are n't  all as organized as the Chief Mom here ( har har ! ) , some of us might be faced with a situation where we need chicken breast for dinner tonight , but only have frozen chicken . Did I mention that we need it tonight ? ! <p> While it might be tempting to leave it on the counter to thaw while you go about your day , leaving meat at room temperature can be unsafe and cause illness . <p> Here are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The safest way to thaw meat is by moving it to the refrigerator first , but that involves some planning in advance , and can take days depending on a few variables . <p> Allow up to 24 hours per 1 to 5 pounds of frozen meat . <p> Some areas of the fridge stay colder than others . The warmer zones are the front and middle , but its best to keep meat in the bottom drawer so that if anything leaks , it does n't  contaminate food stored below it . If your meat has already been unwrapped , place it in a bowl or pan to catch all the juices . <p> Refrigerators set at 35F take longer to thaw than those set at 40F . <p> Fridge-thawed items remain safe for a day or so and can be refrozen if needed ( but there might be some loss of quality ) . If you 're not cooking right away , store thawed meats in the coldest parts of your refrigerator ( the back of the top shelf where the cold air is blown in and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best method to thaw frozen meats if you 're short on time . <p> Your meat must be in a leak-proof package or baggie ( zip-top bags work great ) . The air-tight bag is needed to prevent bacteria around your kitchen from leaking in and also to avoid the water getting in and making your meat soggy . <p> Submerge your bag in cold tap water , changing the water every 30 minutes . <p> Small packages ( around 1 pound ) may take up to an hour . A 3- to 4-pound package may take 2 to 3 hours . <p> Foods thawed using this method should be cooked before re-freezing . You 'll want to cook your meat fairly quickly after thawing , depending on how long your meat has been out of the fridge , but thawing in cold water is safer for a little longer than meat just left at room temperature . <p> MOM Tip : - If you need to cut frozen boneless meats into smaller pieces , partially thaw using this method , ( thaw enough that there is less than 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bag , and cut . The frozen core in the meat helps keep it from sliding around as you cut , allowing for neater , more uniform slices . Put the pieces back in the leak-proof bag , seal , and finish thawing . Check the pieces , and change the water more often to thaw faster . Plan to cook right away after thawed because by opening the bag , you 've introduced bacteria that could be breeding in there ! <p> Microwave <p> This is the least ideal of the " safe " thawing methods because the meat gets heated unevenly. - This method is not considered safe for whole chickens . <p> Set your microwave to " Defrost " or 50% Power to prevent the outside from getting cooked while the inside remains frozen . Times vary based on weight , but if you are n't  sure , defrost for 2 minutes , let stand for 1 minute , then check the progress . Repeat . <p> If your frozen meat is in pieces , pause the defrosting every few minutes to break the pieces apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook immediately after thawing because parts of the meat reach the " danger zone " temperature for breeding bacteria ( between 40F and 140F ) . <p> Foods thawed using this method should be cooked before re-freezing . <p> Cooking from Frozen <p> When there just is n't enough time to thaw frozen foods , just remember : Its safe to cook from the frozen state ! The cooking time will increase by roughly 50% over the recommended time for fresh or thawed meats . <p> **Perishable foods should never be thawed by being left on the counter or in hot water , and should never be left at room temperature for more than 2 hours . <p> Get access to a FREE week of menus This Hawaiian Crockpot Chicken is a great <h> About Kendra Peterson <p> Kendra has two daughters on a gluten free , dairy free , and dye free diets .

We have received many e-mails with questions on how to help children overcome " stages " of picky eating. - Is it a disorder ? - Is it temporary ? What can I do to help my child ? - These are just a few examples of questions many parents have e-mailed us. - Today , well begin with the " texture " issue , one many parents have found difficult to overcome . <p> What is a texture issue ? - If your child will only eat soft or pureed foods , such as bananas , cream cheese , PB&amp;J , yogurt , etc. - Or , your child will only eat crunchy foods- such as- pretzels , carrots , chips , and apples. - If your child has no signs of difficulty swallowing , teething pain , a sensory problem ( difficulty being touched ) , or autism , think of this picky eating as temporary ( otherwise , please consult your doctor ) . - How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem and move your child toward a more tolerant stage ? <p> Research shows that if you can get kids to eat most foods by the time they are in high school , they will eat nearly everything by adulthood. - My husband will not eat cold and crunchy ( to this day ) , and I am happy with sprinkled Grape Nuts over Jello. - Our kids ? Picky eaters in every sense of the word . So , believe me when I tell you that I 've tried everything in our household . <p> Here are seven MOM tips to help you if your child has " texture " issues : <p> Get your child involved in sensory activities. - We 've all heard the " get your child involved in cooking , and they are more likely to eat the food . " Well , that does not work on my uber-picky children. - They are happy to help cook but not eat. - Try instead : If you have a " crunchy " kid , get him involved in " soft " sensory activities- such as- play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - If you have a " soft " kid , try playing with textured items such as cooked spaghetti ( older kids can " braid " the spaghetti or make knots ) . Another activity to try is gluing or coloring uncooked pasta onto a paper or board. - With toddlers , the high chair is your friend ; get them to play with food . The key is to familiarize the senses with the opposite texture . <p> Match food to their senses. - My son does n't  like crunchy anything or meat texture , so much of his food takes a trip through the mini food processor ( another reason we suggest one in the MOMables store as a kitchen essential ) . - Many foods get mixed with whipped cream cheese ( to introduce taste slowly ) or- hidden in tomato sauce , and he eats lots of warm " dips . " - Taco night ? - He eats " dip " and chips . Everything cooked that- you 'd put inside a taco is now a delicious dip ! Want to have more sandwich options ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salad in a mini chopper ; you 'll get a creamy consistency this type of kid tends to like . With a kid who complains about food being " slimy " or " squishy , " you need to modify items so they have the texture they need : crunch. - Instead of mashed potatoes , try baked wedges or baked potatoes. - Soups ? Chunky. - Sandwich fillers ? Also chunky . <p> Reward your child. - Set up a reward system. - Give your child tokens , coins , or stickers for trying new foodseven if they only take one bite. - They can trade them in for a new toy , an outing , or something they have been wanting for a long time. - Your 10-year-old wants a new bike ? - Establish a price and a deadline ( such as- birthdays ) . - The key is finding a reward system that will work for your child and sticking with it . Consistency is key. - Once you find one new food they like , add slowly to their repertoire . <p> Give your child some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat ? - Instead , offer her two choices , no more. - We have carrots or peas . Which one would you rather eat ? - Remind them that they only need to take- two or three bites ( depending on your rules ) . When asked open-ended questions , a child will always answer with a " safe " food . <p> Make sure your child is hungry at mealtime. - Sounds like a no-brainer , but I know many parents who ruin it by offering their kid a snack around 4 pm , and then expect their kid to eat dinner at 6. - Then , frustration builds up because he refuses to eat. - Really ? They are just not hungry enough. - I 've learned that my kids need at least 3 hours before they are willing to eat a non-favorite dinner ; therefore , an after-school snack happens between car line and 3:30 pm . <p> Give your child free rein of the condiments. - Whatever gets them to eat them at first is what has worked best. - While there is a difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not going to make a fuss if he eats his peas. - Eventually , the food item goes into the " safe " list , and that 's one more MOM point for that texture . <p> Praise , praise , praise ! - No one told me that I would need to buy a set of pom-poms when I became a parent . The truth ? - We all like to be praised , even in the little things. - Why should I expect my husband to tell me " the house looks nice " after 4 hours of tiding up , when I do n't  praise my child for eating peas ? - Praising is an ongoing thing that reinforces the behavior we want to establish. - After a while , this behavior becomes a habit . <p> Texture is one of those things that can really frustrate a parent. - Everything we eat has different textures , and when you have more than one child , you can begin to feel like a short-order cook real fast ! - Go ahead , take the pledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , consistency is key , and soon your child will learn the rule and what 's expected , and he will begin to feel good about the eating process. - Next week , well continue this four-part series with the " color " problem . <p> So what 's next ?

Cooking with your kids is the perfect opportunity to get them involved in making healthy food choices . My daughter is 5 years old now , but she has been in the kitchen helping out since she was 2 . <p> I usually get asked " could n't you just cook faster without her in the kitchen ? " And the answer to that is yes . Of course , I could get things done faster . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While she is busy drying the lettuce with the salad spinner , or sifting flour , I quickly do some of the steps that she can not help me with yet . <p> Every child is different , and while some of these gadgets my daughter could use at the age of 2 , they may not all be appropriate for a different 2-year-old . As always , be cautious while cooking in the kitchen with your children . <p> Here are our top 10 kitchen favorites and how we get our kids to help in our MOMables kitchens : <p> 1 . Salad Spinner. - A salad spinner can be used to dry lettuce and herbs , but what it can also do is occupy your little one for up to 10- minutes ! At age 2 , my daughter loved to play with the salad spinner . I would have her spin the salad while I would quickly go through the rest of the steps that she could n't help me with . <p> Now that she is 5 , she 's learned how to stop the salad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the lettuce in order to make the executive decision if the salad is dry enough . <p> 2 . Garlic Chopper. - I bought a rolling garlic chopper right around the time my daughter turned 2. - With this gadget , you open the- compartment- to put a- couple- of peeled garlic cloves inside . You then roll it around on your kitchen counter ( or floor , like a toy car ) . The blades inside chop the garlic and allow you to cut garlic without a knife. - Your child has to be of the age to understand that he/she can not open up the contraption without an adult , but they can roll the garlic chopper all by- themselves ! My daughter at the age of 2 understood not to open it and absolutely loved to use it . <p> 3 . Egg Slicer. - An egg slicer can not only be used on eggs , but on strawberries , olives , bananas , and other soft fruits . Give these items to your child for them to cut . <p> 4 . Mini Chopper. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make salsa , make breadcrumbs , dice onions , etc . The blades are enclosed in a cup , and your child can help make a meal with just a push of their hand ! <p> 5 . Peeler . A peeler can be used with older kids . You can use a peeler to peel fruit and vegetables , or to shave chocolate or hard cheeses . <p> 6 . Garlic Press . With a garlic press , you 'll need a good grip , but you can easily set up your kids to press a few cloves of garlic on their own . <p> 7 . Flour Sifter .

Theyll keep longer when frozen , so you can make extras without worrying about having to use them all right away either . <p> These work great for any meat and cheese combo , whether you plan to toast them or notjust cheese , ham and Swiss , turkey and cheddar , even a tuna melt ! <p> If you do n't  want to bother making them into pockets ( why not ? Pockets are way more fun ! ) , just build your sandwiches normally and skip ahead to the next section . <p> After cutting your crusts off or using the cutter on a pocket sandwich maker , use your fingers to smush down the middle section of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1/2-inch " frame " around the outer edges . <p> Add in your fillings . You can layer them a little thicker than you normally would . Be sure to keep everything within the flattened area , leaving the outer edge free . <p> Use your pocket sandwich press to seal the edges . If you do n't  have one , you can use a fork to seal the edges , going around the whole thing like you would to seal a pie crust . <p> There are a few ways to freeze sandwiches : <p> Put each sandwich in a zip-lock sandwich baggie and push out all the air , then place those in a large freezer bag or double-bagged bread bags . ( Re-use the bags your loaves came in ! But be sure to put one inside the other ! ) <p> Separate each sandwich with a square of waxed paper , and stack them in double-bagged bread bags or layer them 2 to 3 deep in a freezer bag ( and use a straw to suck out all the excess air ) . <p> Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2 hours , then stack them or lay them in the double-bagged bread bags or freezer bags . <p> Okay , now what ? <p> Thaw and Eat : When you 're ready to eat them , just pull one out of the freezer and let it thaw right in the lunchbox for a regular meat and cheese sandwich . <p> Grill : - Spread a thin layer of butter or margarine on the outsides of the frozen sandwich . Then grill in a double-sided grill or panini press until the outsides are golden brown ( about 4 to 5 minutes , depending on your grill ) . <p> Fry : - Cook in a skillet on medium heat for around 3 minutes per side . <p> Bake : - Preheat the oven to 400F , and cook on each side for 5 to 8 minutes . I like a toastier look , so I then turn the oven to broil and keep the tray on the middle rack and broil for 1 minute . Watch outit burns fast ! <p> I would not recommend using a toaster , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . There are better ways to get everyone to hustle out the door in the morning . <p> MOM Notes : For sandwiches where the filling might soak through , spread a thin layer of soft ( not melted ! ) butter or thick dressing ( not mayoit tends to separate when thawing ) on what will be the insides of both pieces of bread for each sandwich . <p> Need a healthy and extremely easy lunch treat that is sure to put a smile <h> About Kendra Peterson <p> Kendra has two daughters on a gluten free , dairy free , and dye free diets .

@@43426243 @3426243/ <h> 10 Picky Eater Strategies from the Specialists <p> While most parents are just trying to get their kids to try something new- at home , some of us have had to hire " experts " to guide us through the process of introducing new foods since the journey can be a bit more difficult for some of us that have kids with sensory issues , special needs , and special diets . <p> The endgame , though , is the same for all of us and the following are some of the things that I 've learned along the way from our specialists . I know all of these will work well for all picky eaters , regardless of what stage you are in. <h> 1 . Keep your cool . <p> No matter how frustrating dinner time might be , many kids like the attention that the dinnertime struggles bring . Smile throughout the meal and ignore the call for attention . Kindly remind the child that you 'll be very excited to ( play , read a book , talk to them ) after dinner but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Put on your best poker face . <p> When a child decides that they might want to try something new , its important that you do n't  get overly excited about this . Making things a big deal often results in a major letdown when they do n't  like it , or worse , a deep interrogation by the parent on the " why . " <p> The more casual you are about them wanting to try something new , the more likely they are to follow through with actually trying the food . <h> 3 . Keep track of progress . <p> Its easy to feel like you are not making progress when you are not keeping track of the " small wins . " Keeping an ongoing note or journal about new tastes , new items a child tried , what he or she liked about food , and how it was prepared . This way , its easy to see progress , and it will help you make more meals with similar flavor profiles . <p> When you re-introduce food that the child has eaten , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casually say something like " Oh , I thought you might like carrots again with your chicken since you ate them with macaroni and cheese and you thought they were okay . " <h> 4 . Slow and Steady Wins the Race . <p> You might think its crazy to add a cheese sauce to broccoli , peas , carrots , green beans but sometimes that 's exacly what is done at feeding clinics . Once they find a vessel that the child finds appealing , they use it to re-introduce foods with the same taste they already like . <p> Or , sometimes it can be crazy to puree soup to a smooth consistency , but if a child prefers a smooth texture to their soup , this might be the best first step . Eventually , you 'll puree it chunkier and chunkier until they can adjust to the new texture . <h> 5 . Overcome Color with Creativity . <p> We 've all heard of the kid that eats " only white and yellow foods " and nothing else . You can mix mashed white potatoes with a few mashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eventually , the color gauge moves to the opposite side , and your child will accept the change since the transition has been gradual . This method works great with yogurt . Mix pureed fruit or veggies ( from the baby food section if you do n't  make your own ) with plain vanilla yogurt . It will slowly add color acceptance in a vessel they already love . <p> Some kids , love spaghetti and tomato sauce but ca n't stand pesto because its green . Adding a little bit of pesto to the tomato sauce and gradually making the switch will get them used to the taste and accept the transition from red to green . <h> 7 . Focus on Flavor . <p> One of the things I learned from my picky eaters is that while they could eat homemade mac and cheese , chicken nuggets , and pizza every day , they do n't  necessarily like bland foods . I 've slowly learned what flavor profile they prefer and now I can introduce new foods with the same style recipes . <h> 8 . Provide Equal Treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picky eater is that you get a lot of special foods and special one-on-one time with mom and dad or a specialist ; basically , a lot of special treatment . <p> Its important that not a lot of emphasis is put on the specially prepared meal , its simply the way they prefer to eat food . What 's most important is that you do n't  make a separate food for the child , instead , provide something he will eat from the meal you 've prepared . <h> 9 . Build on Success . <p> There are many strategies specialists use to introduce new foods ; most of which focus on using a food that the child prefers to get them to try something similar . <p> Other strategies for getting kids to eat chicken that is n't breaded include making the nuggets with less breading each time . As time goes by , you 'll eventually get to a place where the child learns to eat seasoned , grilled chicken . And next , you can pair that grilled chicken in a meal , etc . <p> You can also change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fries to sweet potato or carrot fries , chicken " fries " to fish " fries . " <p> 10 . Give it Time . <p> Understand that it will take some- time to get kids to like new foods . Overcoming picky eating is n't something that will fix itself in a month or two . Its easy to see progress when you keep track of the small wins ( as mentioned in #3 ) but its just as important to give it time to cal it a " win . " Rushing from one texture to the next does n't  seem to work well for most picky eaters . Instead , accept this for what it is and have fun with the process ! Eventually , you 'll be rewarded with a much better eater . Laura 31379 @qwx441379 31384 @qwx441384

@@43426287 @3426287/ <p> What often happens is that families resort to instant rice from a box because it just is n't working out . Of course , another easy answer to this problem would be to purchase a rice cooker . If you are like me then that option just is n't in the budget . <p> I 'm here to share some tips on how to make perfect rice that does n't  involve an instant box mix and does n't  require a special appliance . <p> There are many different varieties of rice , make sure you are cooking with the right kind of rice for the result you are after . I typically use long grain white rice . <p> Rinse rice with water before cooking . Rinsing rice actually rids the grains of surface scratches , and prevents clumping . <p> If you are cooking 1 cup of rice , use 1-3/4 cups of liquid . A common misconception is that it is 1 cup of rice , 2 cups of water- this is incorrect . The 1:1 -+ ratio is especially helpful in producing fluffy rice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Depending on what you are making it for , you may want to consider cooking your rice in chicken or vegetable broth or beef stock , as it adds more flavor to the rice . <p> Follow the cooking instructions carefully ( either what is on the packaging or as instructed in the recipe ) . While cooking , lift the lid as seldom as possible . Many think it is good to stir the rice frequently while cooking , but this actually disrupts the cooking process . <p> Once the rice is cooked and tender , remove the pan from the heat , but keep the lid on . Let it sit this way for approximately 5-10 minutes . <p> Fluff the rice with a large fork and let any resident moisture evaporate out . <p> Now you 're ready to dig in ! I promise , you 'll never want to go back to a box of instant rice again ! @ @ @ @ @
