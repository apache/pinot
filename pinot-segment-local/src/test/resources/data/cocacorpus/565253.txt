I interviewed a wide range of artists , designers , creative entrepreneurs and architects. - Everyone I met with had a unique and interesting background , having his or her own special story to tell about his or her experience and object creation process. - It was intentional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as makers of objects that were not all the same. - I felt that by doing this , the research and information gathered would be varied. - I wanted to find commonalities among a seemingly disparate pool of creative people to see where the real trends in process , materials , color and technology would emerge . <p> Q.- Where are the artists located and what are they designing ? Although most interviews took place in the Pacific Northwest where I live , many of the artists hail from other parts of the U.S. and a few are from other countries . The people I interviewed are making objects ranging from decorative lamps and stylish hats to nature-inspired note cards and sustainable stacking chairs. - Some of the interviewees are educators , ceramic artists , architects , industrial designers , graphic designers , design consultants , and textile designers . <p> Q.- Can you describe the interview process ? - I wanted to keep the process organic and casual. - It was important to me that the designers and artists led the conversation and told me what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstructured enabling me to really connect with each person on an individual level and to ask questions based on the information they each chose to share with me. - Typically the interviews were conducted in the designers ' or artists ' studios , which was great. - It was fun to see everyone 's workspace and to see , first hand , how these objects were not only designed , but also made. - Each conversation was also recorded so I could go back and listen to each interview and tease out the most interesting quotes , commonalities and trends .

We were motivated in part by personal reasons. - One of our children was about to transition into a newly placed modular classroom at her school and many parents and teachers were concerned about the quality of the environment that these kinds of classrooms provided . We 'd all heard about the negative aspects of these classrooms so we thought it was time to investigate . <p> Q.- You were able to leverage the talents of architecture students at Portland State University. - Can you describe that process and the outcome of that type of group design and collaboration ? We were fortunate enough to be in the business of architecture and the teaching of architecture. - And so , as with all significant questions , we posed the challenge to our students to find out what could be done better in the realm of modular classrooms. - We hosted a community design charrette with school administrators , modular industry representatives and many local professionals along with well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the process and the groups came up with some very intriguing and considerate solutions. - We also had a number of classes and design studios focused on the issue. - Much of the students ' work influenced the final design of the SAGE classroom. - In fact , several of the students involved continued to work on the project through to the building of the first prototype years later . <p> Q.- You partnered directly with the manufacturers of the portable classroom when you were producing your SAGE model for Greenbuild in 2014. - Tell us about the process of utilizing the capabilities of the manufacturer and bringing in a new , more modern and healthier perspective on the design of the classroom . We were lucky enough to connect with Blazer Industries , an Oregon-based modular manufacturer. - As experts in the field , they were critical in helping to direct our design efforts in areas where we could make the most significant changes where needed while maintaining the perspective of efficiency and affordability that makes the classrooms accessible to schools with real and challenging budget issues. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in moving toward greener and healthier spaces but are often required to respond to extremely tight budgets that lead to cheaper quality solutions. - As a result , Blazer was very supportive and engaged in the entire process . <p> Q.- What type of local support have you received in your efforts to reestablish a baseline requirement for what a healthy portable classroom should look like for schools ? In efforts to reestablish this baseline , we found that we had an abundant group of local individuals and organizations with the same concerns and willing to donate their time and expertise , including the Governor 's office. - With Governor Kitzhaber 's support through the Oregon Solutions Process , we were able to bring together all the various stakeholders that could make this process move forward. - The group included various departments from Portland State University , state and local code officials , green building and energy conservation groups , school districts and a host of green building design engineers and designers. - It was a true collaboration and we feel that this classroom is really a home grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the country . <p> Q.- How did you determine which color and materials were most appropriate for the SAGE portable classroom ? Each school will be able to choose their own colors , but our prototype is a bright yellow " our way of saying look at this sunny , light-filled and fresh new idea for schools ! - The materials were all chosen with the health of students in mind. - As small active bodies , students are more vulnerable to the toxins contained in a host of common building products. - A number of companies have stepped up and offered to include their greenest products in our classrooms at affordable costs allowing us to pass the savings on to the schools when they buy the classroom. - The interiors include bio-based flooring tiles , cork pin up walls , sheetrock walls , and no-VOC paints. - The exteriors have robust cement siding and aluminum windows. - There are no vinyl-based products in the classroom . <p> Q.- Have you had the chance to see what students and teachers think of the SAGE classroom ?

We came up with the idea of exhibiting all of the objects made by the 21 creatives interviewed before the presentation so that attendees have the chance to see , engage with and to fully appreciate all of the special details that do n't always translate in photographs . The idea was to elevate the workmanship of each object and to highlight each one for the unique artisanal qualities. - These are all works of art and we wanted to exhibit them in a manner that would appropriately communicate that concept . <p> The presentation has already been given in Chicago .

Artisans first and foremost , Jason and his team make 100 percent of their products from the handcraft style , and all are made to order. - In this blog , Jason provides more insight on his company and its approach to design.Q. - Tell us about the Clayhaus design aesthetic and how it originated . Our name is derived from the Bauhaus movement and its impact on modernist architecture and modern design .

Although it is important to be aware of the current color trends , our decisions about what glazes we choose to create and add to our color palette are internally driven. - We are a color-based tile company geared toward modern and mid-century design . What we are inspired by as artisans does play a significant role into what we develop and offer , not necessarily what is " trending " because we all know trends come and go . <p> Q.- What is Clayhauss creative process for developing new tile patterns ? - What inspires the concepts for new patterns ?

Clayhaus welcomes these types of partnerships to make the creative process more interesting . <p> Q.- Do you have any external sources of inspiration ( books , media , movies , artists , musicians , etc. ) that influence your philosophy about design and ultimately the work that your company produces ? I am particularly fascinated with the pop art movement that emerged in the mid-1950s and am influenced by artists such as Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns. - - A source of inspiration that we refer to as our " Bible " is a book by Lesley Jackson called , " The Sixties-Decade of Design Revolution .

Nothing is more rewarding to an artist than exploring the creative process and having the end result bring joy and happiness to someone else. - In our case , the tile we make from scratch becomes a permanent fixture in someones home or commercial space that lasts forever . How cool is that ? <p> Q.- How long does it take you to make a batch of tiles from beginning to the end ? This totally depends on the quantity amounts of the order and the complexity of the size/shape . Our standard lead time is 4-6 weeks since all our tiles are custom made-to-order . <p> Q.- Is there a particular geographic market that is your biggest customer base and if so what where is that market located ? - Mostly the West Coast ( Bay Area , Seattle , Portland ) and Austin , Texas .
