Since then , it has flourished and now teaches thousands of children ( K-12 ) about wildlife and conservation through certified curriculums taught by Texas-certified teachers . The Zoos year-round programs provide opportunities for children to receive hands-on application of conservation principles and up-close and personal views of the Zoos animals . Recently , new leadership and technology have afforded the Zoo the opportunity to reach students of all ages with many of the electronic resources they are now accustomed to using . Students in programs such as Zoo Careers Camp and Summer Zoo Camp now have access to the type of equipment often seen in modern classrooms . This hands-on learning style is important to implement since tactile learning is often the most underused and , many times , the best way students learn . <p> There 's always an adventure waiting for you at the Fort Worth Zoo !

A Wilder Vision will also allow the Zoo to guarantee for future generations the survival of many endangered species . <h> Zoo History <p> The Fort Worth Zoo was founded in 1909 with one lion , two bear cubs , an alligator , a coyote , a peacock and a few rabbits . From these humble beginnings , the Zoo has grown into a nationally ranked facility , housing more than 7,000 native and exotic animals . From 1909 to October 1991 , the Fort Worth Zoo was owned and operated by the City of Fort Worth . During the city 's tenure , a long-standing tradition began of collecting money from the community to purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society ( now the Fort Worth Zoological Association ) formed as a nonprofit organization to help raise additional funds to purchase even more animals . <p> In October 1991 with the Zoo facing decreasing city support , demands to replace outdated animal housing and declines in attendance the Association assumed management of the Zoo 's day-to-day operations under a contract with the City of Fort Worth . Since 1991 ( and up until fundraising began for this campaign ) , the Association has raised more than $186 million from private entities , foundations and corporations for Zoo improvements and new exhibits . In 1992 , the Zoo hosted a grand reopening , unveiling two new exhibits World of Primates and Asian Falls and numerous improvements throughout the Zoo . Within the first year , Zoo attendance soared to approximately 1 million visitors in a fiscal year almost double that of the previous year and has maintained ever since . In fact , the Zoo just celebrated 25 million Zoo visitors in 25 years this year . <p> Since 1992 , the Zoo has opened 16 major exhibits and support facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these new exhibits , substantial improvements have been made to Zoo facilities , including handicap accessibility as defined by ADA standards , as well as improvements to restrooms , shade structures , walkways , food outlets , picnic areas , animal areas and exhibit space .

Planning for A Wilder Vision began in 2011 and developments have already begun . Divided into stages African Savanna , Elephant Springs , Hunters of Africa &amp; Asian Predators and Forests &amp; Jungles the plan encompasses not only a mission for conserving the animal kingdom , but also for educating and motivating future leaders . <p> The African Savanna will open to the public in the spring of 2018 and will imitate the natural ecosystem of east Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very excited to bring multiple species together to mimic life in the wild , " said Zoo Executive Director Michael Fouraker . " Although most of these species already call the Zoo home , guests will be able to come face to face with these animals and engage in ways that theyve never been able to before . " Two main features Zoo officials are excited to share with Zoo guests will be the African Savannas giraffe feeding experience and underwater hippo viewing . <p> Other areas will be completed over the next nine years and will change the way visitors explore the Zoo and interact with the animals . Reimagined and modernized exhibits will change the physical landscape of the Zoo , allowing guests to wind through shaded trails during their visit . The Zoo will also become home to new species , like wild dogs , African leopards , clouded leopards and okapi , which the Zoo hopes will help continue to strengthen the bond between humans and animals . <h> Conservation <p> A cornerstone of the Fort Worth Zoos mission is conservation .

@@26939268 @639268/ <h> Conservation at Home <h> Arthur A. Seeligson Jr . Conservation Fund <p> Since 2001 , the Arthur A. Seeligson Jr . Conservation Fund ( SCF ) has awarded $61,647 to conservation projects fighting to retain Texas rich biodiversity . The Fort Worth Zoo manages the fund , which was named in honor of Arthur A. Seeligson Jr. , father of Zoo Board Co-Chairman Ramona Bass . Seeligson instilled a life-long love for the land in his family that has been passed down through generations . The Zoos Texas Wild ! exhibit represents the spirit of the SCF , teaching the importance of land stewardship and of conserving the biodiversity found in our own backyard . <p> The SCF encourages collaborations between Texas conservation groups and private landowners , and has worked to protect native Texas species such as bobwhite quail , sea turtles and bats . Recently , the SCF awarded $2,500 to the project " Using dogs to find endangered Houston toads ( Bufo houstonensis ) . " <p> Its been a long road to recovery for the Houston toad , which has been listed as federally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Texas county just east of Austin . The Houston toads habitat was hit hard when wildfires raged through Bastrop State Park in 2011 . The catastrophic wildfires made it all the more important to explore other habitats where Houston toads currently reside . <p> Though the majority of Houston toads live in Bastrop , many toads also live on privately owned Texas land . The challenge is finding them . Studying toads and assessing population numbers are tedious and difficult tasks . Herpetologists are only able to locate toads during breeding season when they are especially active and vocal . Researchers have yet to find an effective way to locate dormant Houston toads , but the latest SCF conservation program is hoping to change that . <p> The Caesar Kleberg Wildlife Research Institute/Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville , in partnership with the Houston Zoo , Dogs for Conservation and a private landowner , joined forces to use one animal to help save another . Dogs for Conservation , an organization operated out of Brenham , Texas , is training a scent-detecting dog to react to the scent of a Houston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colony of Houston toads , is carefully collecting scent samples to supply to the program . Precautions are also being taken so the dog learns only to respond to the Houston toad and not similar species , such as the Woodhouses and Gulf Coast toads . <p> The final test will be to take the dog into the field , where it will hopefully lead researchers to wild toads . This portion of the program will take place in Austin County on a private landowners property , which harbors a known Houston toad breeding pond . Researchers have several goals for this project : gain a better understanding of the Houston toads habitat requirements outside of the breeding season , locate Houston toads in areas where they have not been recorded and estimate Houston toad population sizes . The study will continue through 2013 . <h> Texas Horned Lizard <p> Through a partnership with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department , Texas Christian University and a private landowner , the Fort Worth Zoo located the first reintroduction site that fits the environmental and habitat models needed for Texas horned lizard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Zoo have been released at various ages and tracked to determine the most effective reintroduction methods . Although translocation projects have been attempted , there has never been a successful ongoing horned lizard reintroduction program . Staff continued to track horned lizards with transmitters in recent years . Horned lizards will be released at various ages and will be fitted with different sized transmitters to determine the best reintroduction methods . The Fort Worth Zoo is one of the only zoos in the country to successfully breed the Texas horned lizard . Since 2005 , the Zoo has facilitated more than 200 hatchings . <h> Chiricahua leopard frog <p> The Chiricahua leopard frog ( Lithobates chiricahuensis ) is a threatened species found exclusively in isolated areas within Arizona , New Mexico and northern Mexico . The Fort Worth Zoo is one of two zoos working with this species and celebrated the first-ever successful Chiricahua leopard frog breeding . This is the first time this species has been bred in an entirely captive , indoor environment . Thanks to the careful manipulation of environmental settings , three females laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent 456 captive-hatched Chiricahua leopard frogs to New Mexico for release at a reintroduction site . This was the first reintroduction in New Mexico , where the wild Chiricahua leopard frog population has suffered significant declines . Since that first successful reintroduction , the Zoo has released hundreds of Chiricahua leopard frogs back into the historic habitat . <h> Hellbender <p> The hellbender ( Cryptobranchus alleganiensis alleganiensis ) is the oldest living amphibian in North America and is experiencing declines throughout its range in the eastern United States . This large salamander is a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service candidate for threatened species listing . As part of a headstart program , the Fort Worth Zoo received 20 hellbenders as small larvae in 2007 that were hatched from an egg mass in West Virginia . Four years later , those hellbenders were transferred to Purdue University for reintroduction in Indiana . In 2012 , that same group of hellbenders was outfitted with internal radio transmitters and reintroduced . The transmitters track the salamanders in the wild in order to develop methodology for reintroducing this species into the wild .

But my " official " career began in 1981 at the Bronx Zoo . <p> What do you enjoy most about your job ? As an animal keeper , you never know what will happen during the course of a day because animals are not 100 percent predictable . I love that each day is different , and usually has surprises in store ! <p> What is the most challenging aspect of your job ? One of the most challenging aspects of my job is the task of becoming familiar with each animals temperament , but still being prepared to expect the unexpected . <p> What 's the most interesting thing about the animals you work with at the Fort Worth Zoo ?

If you choose a career working with animals , time and dedication is the name of the game . Some of my happiest and saddest memories come from sharing my life with captive apes . <p> What is a " typical " day like for you ? My day usually begins at 8 a.m. as I check on the animals , prepare their diets , set-up exhibits and shift the animals from their indoor habitat to outdoors .

After bringing them inside for dinner , I clean the exhibit areas for the next day . <p> What is the most fascinating animal in your care ? I specialize with primates and they are all fascinating to me ! They are intelligent animals , so I enjoy watching them try to figure out how to use a new enrichment device . <p> What is your favorite amazing fact about apes ? One of the most amazing things about apes is the way they communicate with each other using body language and facial expressions , just as humans do . After all this time , I can read them fairly well but they seem to read me even better .

Found in several South American countries , the Toco toucan is the largest member of the toucan family . While this bird may appear to stick out , its bright coloration actually helps the toucan to camouflage into the fauna within its habitat . The young Toco toucans beaks will eventually grow to be almost 8 inches long , and the prominent beak is used primarily to forage for food . The lightweight bill is composed of thin , bony struts , giving it little solid substance . Unlike many animals , the Toco toucan does not use its tongue to swallow food . Instead , it holds food at the tip of its beak and tilts its head back so the food falls into its throat .

The chicks are all hand-reared by bird staff and fed a specially customized formula made of egg , vitamins , minerals and other components of the birds natural diet . Roseate spoonbills were over-harvested to the extent that by 1890 , all Texas breeding colonies had been wiped out and the Audubon Society reacted with a push to protect the species . Now plentiful on the Texas Gulf Coast , the species is also found on the east and west coasts of Mexico , along the western shore of Florida and throughout the Caribbean Islands and South America .

The Fort Worth Zoo was the very first to successfully breed this threatened frog species in a captive , indoor environment . In 2012 , thanks to the careful manipulation of environmental settings within the Museum of Living Art ( MOLA ) , three females laid eggs naturally without the use of hormones . Since that first successful hatching , the Zoo has bred hundreds of the threatened frog species and has reintroduced the tadpoles to a designated site in New Mexico , where populations had been diminished to nearly one-third of the original number . The newest tadpoles were housed in a specialized environment at the Zoo and released into the wild in early June .

This snake is nonvenomous and spends 90 percent of its time underground in self-dug burrows or those made by other animals . This elusive snake can grow up to 7 feet in length . This species only breeds one time each year , during the spring . Although this snake lays the largest eggs of any North American snake , it produces the smallest number , usually only four or five in a clutch . This snake is considered the rarest large snake in North America , as less than 210 have ever been found in their native habitat , which stretches from east Texas to western-central Louisiana . The Fort Worth Zoo participates in a breeding program that maintains a healthy , diverse population of the species . Since 2010 , the Zoo has assisted in providing hatchings for release back into its native habitat in partnership with the U.S. Fish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Forest Service , and other stakeholders .

Native to Australia and New Guinea , this species can be found in shallow waters where they use their slender physique to squeeze through reef crevices on their nightly prowls for prey . We all know that sharks can swim , but have you seen a shark walk ? A unique feature that separates it from other shark species , the epaulette shark has a muscular pectoral fin that allows it to " walk " and wriggle on its paired fins to get around to hunt . Perhaps the most distinctive feature on these slender scavengers are the large , black dots just above each pectoral fin , which resemble the shoulder decorations on military uniforms , which are called epaulettes hence the name . Be sure to stop by the shark tank in the Great Barrier Reef on your next visit to see our two epaulette sharks .
