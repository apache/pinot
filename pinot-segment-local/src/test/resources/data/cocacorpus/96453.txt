@@102172705 @6372705/ <h> This new rule could make it a lot easier to sue your bank <p> With looming existential threats from both the Trump administration and the federal court system , the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau went ahead on Monday with a controversial rule that will change the way nearly all consumer contracts with financial institutions are written . <p> The rule will ensure that all consumers can join what CFPB Director Richard Cordray called " group " lawsuits generally known as class-action lawsuits when they feel financial institutions have committed small-dollar , high-volume frauds . Currently , many contracts contain mandatory arbitration clauses that explicitly force consumers to waive their rights to join class-action lawsuits . Instead , consumers are forced to enter individual arbitration , a step critics say most do n't bother to pursue . <p> Consumer groups have for years claimed waivers were unjust and even illegal , but in 2011 , the U.S. Supreme Court sided with corporate lawyers , paving the way for even more companies to include the prohibition in standard-form contracts for products like credit cards and checking accounts . <p> Photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Monday 's rule is slated to take effect in about eight months , meaning most new contracts signed after that date ca n't contain the class-action waiver . Prohibitions in current contracts will remain in effect . <p> Consumers who want to ensure they enjoy their new rights can close current accounts and open new ones after the effective date , the CFPB said . <p> " By blocking group lawsuits , mandatory arbitration clauses force consumers either to give up or to go it alone usually over relatively small amounts that may not be worth pursuing on ones own , " Cordray said during the announcement . <p> " Including these clauses in contracts allows companies to sidestep the judicial system , avoid big refunds , and continue to pursue profitable practices that may violate the law and harm large numbers of consumers . Our common-sense rule applies to the major markets for consumer financial products and services under the Bureaus jurisdiction , including those in which providers lend money , store money , and move or exchange money . " <p> The ruling was several years in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 , which called on the CFPB to first study the issue and then write a new rule . But it almost did n't happen : With the election of Donald Trump and Republican control of the White House , the CFPB faces major changes , including the expiration of Cordray 's term next year . <p> Also , House Republicans have passed legislation that would drastically change the CFPB 's structure . Either of these could lead to the undoing of Monday 's rule . When I asked the CFPB at Monday 's announcement what the process for such undoing would be , the bureau did n't respond . <p> " I ca n't comment on what might happen in the future , " said Eric Goldberg , Senior Counsel , Office of Regulations . <p> Cordray cited the recent Wells Fargo scandal as evidence the arbitration waiver ban was necessary . Before the fake account controversy became widely known , consumers had tried to sue the bank but were turned back by courts citing the contract language . <p> Under the new rules , consumers would have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . No lawyer will take a case involving a single $39 controversy , but plenty will do so if the case potentially involves thousands , or even millions , of clients . <p> Consumer groups immediately hailed the new rule . <p> " The CFPBs rule restores ordinary folks day in court for widespread violations of the law , " said Lauren Saunders , association director of the National Consumer Law Center . " Forced arbitration is simply a license to steal when a company like Wells Fargo commits fraud through millions of fake accounts and then tells customers : Too bad , you cant go to court and cant team up ; you have to fight us one by one behind closed doors and before a private arbitrator of our choice instead of a public court with an impartial judge . ' " <p> The CFPB and Monday 's rule also face an uncertain future because a federal court last fall ruled that part of the bureau 's executive structure was unconstitutional . The CFPB is appealing the ruling , and a decision may come soon . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fire Cordray immediately , and companies may have legal avenue to challenge CFPB rules . <p> On the other hand , enacting the rule now may give supporters momentum that will be difficult for the industry to stop a situation similar to the Labor Department 's fiduciary rule requiring financial advisers to act in their clients ' best interests . While the Trump administration took steps to stop that rule from taking effect , many companies had already begun to comply , and simply continued with that process . <p> Photo : Thinkstock ( Photo : PashaIgnatov ) <p> The U.S. Chamber of Commerce was heavily critical of the new rule . <p> " The CFPBs brazen finalization of the arbitration rule is a prime example of an agency gone rogue . CFPBs actions exemplify its complete disregard for the will of Congress , the administration , the American people , and even the courts , " the Chamber said in a statement . <p> " As we review the rule , we will consider every approach to address our concerns , and we encourage Congress to do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we call upon the administration and Congress to establish the necessary checks and balances on the CFPB before it takes more one-sided , overreaching actions . " <p> But consumer groups called Monday 's ruling a victory . <p> " Forced arbitration deprives victims of not only their day in court , but the right to band together with other targets of corporate lawbreaking . It 's a get-out-of-jail-free card for lawbreakers , " said Lisa Donner , executive director of Americans for Financial Reform .

The SODO arena would send an estimated $103 million ( inflation- adjusted ) of new tax revenues to the City General Fund over 35 years . Under the same base case assumptions OVG would generate just under $34 million . These estimates are also consistent across different scenarios . For example , under an " aggressive " set of assumptions SODO would send just short of $111 million to the General Fund , where OVG would send just short of $47 million .

The City admissions tax has historically financed the publics share of capital investments in publicly-owned Seattle sports and entertainment facilities .

OVG asks the City to redirect to the City Arena Fund approximately $167 of new City retail sales tax , construction sales tax , admissions tax , parking tax , and the leasehold excise tax . If OVG asks the state and county to redirect their respective portions of those same taxes , then under the OVG plan the total taxes redirected exceed $200 million .

They were killing a lot of livestock in that particular location , " he said . <p> Wielgus monitored the pack last year .

We were made aware of it by WSU graduate students operating the trail cameras . It did not change Department 's assessment of the situation . The majority of the known wolf packs in Washington overlap livestock , and many overlap active grazing allotments . That is one result of wolves recolonizing of Washington state . However , the fact that livestock and wolves overlap and actively use the same landscape does n't necessary mean there will be conflict . In fact , experience in Washington and other western states shows that wolves and livestock coexist without conflict about 80 percent of the time , " Martorello said . <p> For Kretz , Wielgus did more harm than good , further dividing the state over wolf management . <p> " We all got tired of the death threats .

He found wolf attacks on livestock are extremely uncommon , and that the more humans kill wolves , the more wolves kill cattle the following year . Depredations , he says , typically follow lethal removal of wolves due to disarray in the social dynamics of the apex predators . <p> " My agenda is scientific truth , and that 's what 's gotten me in trouble in this case .

Nor is it the closest to Iberostars cluster of resorts on the northern stretch of the beach , which includes Paraiso del Mar . <p> When the McGowans arrived , Austin was sedated . Doctors said he was stable . He had a golf-ball sized lump on his forehead and had suffered a severe concussion . But he had been conscious . He would be OK . <p> The outlook for Abbey was not so good . She was on a ventilator . Unresponsive . No reflexes to light , touch or pain . She was in a coma . And her collarbone was cracked . <p> Doctors were preparing to move her to a hospital in Cancun . From there , she was flown to Broward Health Medical Center in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . <p> After a couple of days of testing , doctors in the U.S. confirmed what those in Mexico had concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear years earlier when she got her driver 's license that she wanted to donate her organs when she died . <p> On Jan. 12 , her family decided to withdraw life support . <p> * * * <p> Six months later , the family still does n't  know what happened . Barely two hours at an exclusive resort they had booked thinking it was the safest way to enjoy the beaches of Mexico , and Abbey was dead . <p> Theyve been searching for answers ever since and getting little information , if any , from anybody . Not the resort , the police , the medics or the doctors , and not the FBI . <p> Maybe it was an " accidental drowning " as Abbeys death certificate says . But the McGowans are n't certain . <p> Did both Abbey and Austin get so drunk in one hour before meeting their parents for dinner that Abbey drowned in chest-deep water , unnoticed by staff or tourists ? Did everyone just disappear that quickly ? Where were the witnesses ? <p> The last thing Austin remembers was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of young guys around as well , doing flips into the pool and drinking . When they invited him and Abbey to join the group in doing a shot , they all drank one together . And that was it . <p> Austin does n't  know what was in the shot . It looked like a " JSgerbomb " a shot of JSgermeister commonly mixed with beer or Red Bull but he couldnt be sure . He and Abbey had already had four or five tequila shots . <p> His next memory is of waking up in the ambulance . <p> " I 've been in college for five years and had my fair share of drinks before , " he said . " No way in hell I 'm putting my face down in a pool and going to sleep . " <p> He said neither he nor Abbey had taken any type of relaxant or other pills on the plane or once in Mexico . And although they had smoked marijuana in the U.S. , they had not smoked anything in Mexico . <p> At 6-foot-2 and 155 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't  feel it , anyway . They were getting ready to eat with their parents . They werent trying to get wrecked . <p> " Knowing that we got played or are victims of some sick person drugging us is almost surreal , " he said . <p> Toxicology reports from the Playa del Carmen medical clinic show his blood-alcohol level was 0.26 , more than three times the limit considered by Wisconsin law to be impaired . <p> Abbeys was 0.25 . <p> Blood-alcohol content of 0.25 and higher can cause severe drowsiness , confusion , vomiting , slurred speech , lack of balance , loss of motor skills , even to the point of inability to stand or walk , and unconsciousness . <p> At 130 pounds , she would have to drink about seven shots in one hour to have a level that high . <p> " Somebody had to slip them some type of drug , " said Bill Conner , Austin and Abbeys father . Conner lives just outside Madison ; he was not at the resort . <p> The blood tests did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with date-rape drugs , though the panel did n't  test for every type . <p> What would the motive be for drugging the kids , anyway , the McGowans wonder ? They werent robbed . It does n't  appear as though they were sexually assaulted . Ginny asked the Cancun hospital to conduct a rape test . The doctor said they did but there 's no documentation included in the materials given to the McGowans . <p> Could it have been a botched kidnapping attempt ? Possibly , but it seems like kidnappers would do better to just snatch someone from the street rather than going into an exclusive resort , the McGowans reasoned . <p> * * * <p> At least two blog postings from other travelers who visited Iberostars nearby sister resorts in Playa del Carmen in the last two years report eerily similar incidents , though nobody died . <p> In one case , a husband and wife celebrating 13 years of marriage were sitting on the beach at Iberostar Paraiso Maya , in the same cluster of resorts where the del Mar is , in January 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar . Her husband had three beers . <p> They were talking to a couple who said they were from Oregon . They all ordered another drink and within a few minutes she began seeing black spots and told her husband something was n't right . Then she blacked out . She remembers being on the bathroom floor , vomiting and feeling like she was dying . <p> The next thing either of them recalls is waking up in their hotel room , more than five hours later . Her husbands hand was broken . Neither had any idea what happened . Their belongings were still on the beach . They had not been robbed . <p> " I felt as if I had just been terrorized but did not know how and by who , " she wrote in her posting on the website , **27;94;TOOLONG . " I knew we came close to something evil , we were grateful to be alive , but filled with fear not knowing who did this to us . " <p> She said when they reported the incident to the resort staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take cash . <p> * * * <p> When Abbey and Austins stepdad , John , and Austin hired a translator and went to file a police report a few days later , they say the police resisted launching an investigation , insisting it was an accidental drowning . How could they say that without at least interviewing the hotel staff who found them , the family wondered . <p> When they left the police department they werent certain whether any investigation would be done . <p> Within weeks , the McGowans hired an American law firm with a sister office in Mexico to help get answers . On Monday , they received their attorneys report . <p> It raises even more questions . <p> On May 30 , an attorney in Mexico inquired at the police department and found they had done a limited investigation . Police had interviewed three hotel staffers . The attorneys report does n't  say when the interviews took place . <p> The McGowans ' American attorney , Florentino Ramirez , said he puts little credence in the police report . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an accident , where was everybody ? It just does n't make sense . There are too many open ends . " <p> He suspects there could have been a fight , maybe with another guest or with hotel staff , that Austin can not remember . " He gets hit over the head and goes down . That happens in 15 seconds . ... That 's one possibility . " <p> The police report did not contain any statements from hotel guests , the bartender or a woman who reportedly alerted hotel staff after seeing Abbey and Austin having trouble getting out of the pool . It does not contain key details from the medical clinic that received Abbey and Austin by ambulance . <p> The statements from the three staffers the pool manager and two security guards all indicate they arrived on the scene , pulled the kids from the water and performed CPR on Abbey . She was unconscious with a low pulse and spitting up foam from her nose and mouth as they tried to revive her , they all said . <p> Austin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they pulled him out , they said . <p> Abbey " was seen " drunk at 7:03 sitting on the edge of the pool , they said , where the water was less than 4-feet deep . The report does not say who actually saw the brother and sister . It also notes security guards were nearby , 20 to 30 seconds away . <p> This does n't  make sense to the McGowans for a number of reasons . <p> They were in the lobby at 7 . If two people were being transported by ambulance , would n't there be some commotion ? Then again , maybe there was a back route out . <p> What about video surveillance ? Is it true the hotel does n't  have or use video cameras around the pool , as resort officials told John ? Why wont the resort help them get answers , let them interview the bartender and other guests ? <p> What 's especially upsetting to the family is that Iberostar not only wont answer their questions , nobody from the hotel ever reached out to say they 're sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think this was serious , " Ginny said . <p> An Iberostar representative did n't  immediately provide answers to questions from the Journal Sentinel . <p> Ginny said when she reached out to the local FBI in Milwaukee she was told the agency could not help them . Crimes on foreign soil are out of their jurisdiction , she recalled someone from the office telling her . <p> Leonard Peace , a spokesman for the local branch of the FBI , had no comment on this case . But he said the agency follows up on all complaints , depending on the facts presented . He said the office might also refer someone who is a victim of a crime in a foreign country to the U.S. State Department . <p> " They were very unhelpful , " Ginny said of the FBI .

The weeks he spent pedaling helped him work through some of his grief and at the same time raise awareness about the importance of organ donation . All of Abbey 's uninjured organs were donated . <p> " I still ca n't believe this happened , " Conner said . " I 'm still waiting for my daughter to walk through the door .

While shows like " Dallas , " " Baywatch " and " The Simpsons " all drew large global audiences , international television trade required delays : A television series could air in different countries , but it often happened months even years after it would air in its country of origin . <p> As I explore in my book " We Now Disrupt This Broadcast : How Cable Transformed Television and the Internet Revolutionized It All , " many of those practices have changed in recent years . Its now possible for a series to release new episodes for viewers around the world , and the result is a global watercooler a shared media culture that transcends national boundaries . <p> While you might think that Netflix or Amazon Video would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thrones " that 's at the forefront of this phenomenon . <p> Its fantasy setting takes place in a world that is n't geographically or culturally distinctive to the U.S. , which also broadens audience appeal . Television shows that are n't  country-specific miniseries such as " The Odyssey " and " Gullivers Travels " tend to be among the most successful in international trade . There was also a built-in global fan base from the popular series of novels that inspired the show . <p> " Game of Thrones , " however , did n't  start out as a global blockbuster . <p> HBO debuted the show in 2011 for its U.S. cable channel . Following standard practice , the network sold the series to channels around the world that would air the series with the typical delay . For example , Canal+ airs it in France , Sky Atlantic airs it in Italy and Foxtel airs it in Australia . There are also several HBO branded channels around the globe such as HBO Canada , HBO Central Europe , and HBO Asia . Some are owned fully or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . <p> We 'd expect changes wrought by the internet to have played a key role . They did , but not in the way you 'd expect . HBO did n't  use the internet to distribute " Game of Thrones " to subscribers around the world like Netflix and Amazon Video have done with their series . Instead , the internet was important to the series global growth because of the opportunities it gave fans to interact with one another . <p> The intricate , surprising storylines on " Game of Thrones " inspired instant dissection and analysis on social media feeds . This encouraged fans in TV markets outside of the U.S. to seek out unauthorized video sources : It was the only way they could avoid spoilers . While news stories about the high rates of piracy highlighted the popularity of the series a form of free promotion HBO certainly would prefer viewers to watch through authorized channels . Eliminating the delay in access was one solution . <p> In 2015 , just before the start of its fifth season , HBO announced that it had deals in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its U.S. broadcast . This was not unprecedented . " Dr. Who " did the same in 2013 with a 94-country simulcast in honor of its 50th anniversary a one-time event . <p> Arguably no network other than HBO could have pulled it off . <p> Because HBO is both the producer and distributor of the series , it can adjust the timing of its international availability . Making shows ( the job of studios ) and presenting them to audiences ( the job of channels ) are two different businesses , and their interests do n't  perfectly align . If a different studio produced " Game of Thrones " for HBO , the studio might be too concerned that the simulcast would diminish its ability to sell the series to other distributors . Moreover , HBO had significant international reach and relationships that provided it with a direct pipeline to viewers outside the U.S. <p> Not the new normal for now <p> While HBO has shown that global TV blockbusters are now possible , they are n't  likely to become common practice . Internet-distributed services that are building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a clear advantage in this regard . They have customers around the world and can act as the producer and distributor of their series or negotiate for worldwide rights . Its notable , however , that neither has succeeded in creating a true blockbuster hit . For example , Netflixs " Marco Polo " had a huge budget and a premise that appealed to audiences around the world . But it never caught on . <p> While blockbusters can be incredibly lucrative , there 's no magic formula for making one . The odds of success are far greater when making series that speak specifically to the cultural experiences of people in individual countries or with particular tastes . <p> Once Netflix and Amazon Video have firmed up a strong subscriber base outside of the U.S. with local programming , look for them to also wade into the risky but rewarding business of global blockbusters.

Social media was still blowing up on Thursday with theories and thoughts about electors going rouge in the electoral college and overthrowing President-elect Donald Trumps victory . <p> Here is the deal : That is highly unlikely . <p> Earlier in the week , another Washington state elector added herself to the list of electors trying to stop Donald Trump from becoming president . The group is encouraging Republican electors to vote for another Republican in the electoral college later this month . <p> KREM 2s Alexa Block verified these claims and got an answer : the effort will not change anything . <p> So how did we get to this answer ? <p> Thirty-seven . That is the number of Republican electoral votes for another Republican that are needed to reject Trump . Right now , Trump has 306 electoral vote , while his opponent , Hillary Clinton , has 232 . A total of 270 electoral votes are needed to win . <p> According to the National Archives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partys vote . Why is that ? <p> Perhaps it is the fact that many electors are bound by laws or pledges to their respective parties . In Washington state , electors could face a misdemeanor and a $1,000 fine . <p> CBS News reports that an elector has actually never been punished , however . In the last 100 years , there have only been nine electors that changed their votes and they have not decided an election . <p> With that being said , if by some small chance Trumps number of votes slips under 270 , the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives and they would likely support the Republican president-elect . <p> So . In the end ? <p> Electors changing their votes is rare and it would be nearly impossible for it to actually affect the outcome of this election .

The post says do A , B and C and you 'll supposedly avoid criminal charges for breaking into a car . But we found out this post - and similar posts - often pop up in the spring and summer months . <p> KTVB talked to Idaho State Police and the Idaho Humane Society to Verify whether the post is fact or fiction . We also researched information from the Animal Legal and Historical Center about what other state laws say . <p> Based on those sources , we found out the viral Facebook post is NOT true - particularly in the state of Idaho . <p> The post states , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you see a dog locked in a car in hot weather , take a picture of the dog and the car . If someone is with you , have them pull up the weather for your area on their smartphone so you can screen shot it . Then , break the window to get the animal out this way you wo n't be charged with criminal damage and it gives police evidence to press charges against the animal 's owner . <p> " Each state is different in how it deal with laws pertaining to animals , " Idaho State Police Capt . Bill Gardiner said . <p> According to the Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center , " only 24 states have statutes that either prohibit leaving an animal in confined vehicle or provide civil immunity ( protection from being sued ) for a person who rescues an animal from a vehicle under certain conditions " . <p> " Idaho is not one of them , " Capt . Gardiner added . KREM 2 looked into it and Washington State is not either . <p> SCRAPS said last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however the public is not . <p> Idaho State Police says if you damage someone else 's property to get an animal out , it 's not guaranteed you will be immune from criminal charges . <p> " Idaho does not have a law that protects people from damaging someone else 's vehicle in order to save a dog , " Gardiner said . <p> We found out : The rules are not black and white ; actions and outcomes are situational . <p> " Each one is a case-by-case basis , " the captain said . " The absolute last resort is to break somebody 's window . " <p> Police say if you come across a dog in a hot car and feel the need to do something , first check with the business the owner might be in . They may be able to call for the owner over the loud speaker . If the business can not contact the owner , police advise you to call 911 or non-emergency dispatch . <p> " Let law enforcement make that decision , " Capt . Gardiner said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 911 dispatcher on the other end of the line will know what to do . They 'll tell you how to handle it , they 'll know if they have an officer or somebody close by . " <p> In addition , take detailed notes of what you see . The viral social media post we mentioned above says take pictures and screen shots . In fact , police do say that can only help when officers get to the scene . <p> You can also notify animal control . The Idaho Humane Society says animal control officers responded to about 150 calls of dogs left in hot cars last year and they always see a spike starting this time of year . <p> " Animal control will go out any day that 's above 70 degrees , " Maier said . " When it 's 70 degrees outside within an hour it can be 100 degrees in your car . And when it 's 80 degrees outside , even in 10 minutes it can be 100 degrees in a car . And then let alone when it 's getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a car and that 's very , very dangerous . " <p> Under Idaho 's animal cruelty ( animal care ) law - Section 25-3504 you could be cited for leaving a dog in hot car . The statute also gives law enforcement or animal control officers the authority to " take possession of the animal cruelly treated and provide care , " essentially allowing officers to break into cars to save pets . <p> " Each officer , deputy , trooper will look at every situation individually and it may mean that they get into the car themselves based on what they see , " Capt . Gardiner added . <p> The overarching message : it is getting increasingly warmer and if you plan on shopping or stopping somewhere , leave your pet at home . Studies show cracking your windows wo n't cool the car enough to protect your pet . <p> Also , do n't take legal advice from a viral post ; different states and countries have different laws . <p> Police say it is an entirely different discussion when talking about children left in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel a child is in dire straits , you can break a window to get them out , but be careful with that .

Wasson was a full time mom and fan . 25 years before the Zags made the post season , Wasson was at every game . <p> " Miss it " became a familiar phrase at Zags games . When opponents were at the free-throw line , all she would yell was " Miss it ! " <p> The tradition would continue until 2008 when Wasson passed away . At the time , Gonzaga vowed not to give up her seat at McCarthey for a year . On the base of her seat , it reads , in memory of Coach Emma . But nearly a decade later , the tradition stands . <p> If you were to go take a look , one of the seats in the front row would be empty . <p> " I take her jacket to the seat every game , that 's just Gonzaga basketball to me , " Hawkins said , " that they would include her still after all this time .

Only two other squads can say that : University of North Carolina and Wisconsin . <p> Anything can happen in March and nothing is certain once you get to this point in the tournament .

If they do n't , there will be enough scorching hot takes on Twitter and Facebook to melt your smart phone . As ESPN 's Jeff Goodman knows in the eyes many outsiders , it 's Final Four or failure . <p> " Its not fair but it 's the reality right we put so much emphasis on the NCAA Tournament what you do come March and April that 's just the way it is , " said Goodman . <p> That kind of thinking drives Mark Few nuts , and he 's not the only head coach that feels that way . Who would want to be graded solely by their ability to reach the national semifinals by surviving an incredibly unpredictable month of the season ? Guys like ESPN College Basketball writer Myron Medcalf know that 's not how this game should work . <p> " Making the Final Four should not make or break any team it should not change the perception of any team , " said Medcalf . <p> And here 's the other thing , why is this program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na judge teams according to who made it to the Final Four or who did n't make it to the Final Four well go criticize Sean Miller and Arizona because they 've had some troubles making it to the Final Four , " said Medcalf . <p> This year some big names had trouble making it to the second week . Top seed Villanova is gone . Duke , one of the trendy picks heading into the dance , was bounced by South Carolina . Another two seed in Louisville is also out . Of course those three have the benefit of recent national titles to quiet the rumblings . But as far as both Goodman and Medcalf are concerned , it 's the full body of work beyond one season , much less one month , that really matters . <p> " To me consistency is what I 'm all about and no one has been more consistent in the entire country than what Mark Few has done , " said Medcalf . <p> " Look at what they 've done over the last 15 or so years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in a place like Gonzaga it 's ridiculous to me , " said Goodman . <p> That 's not to minimize the impact of getting to a Final Four and putting yourself in position to win a championship . As Goodman mentioned , it would take the monkey off their back . Imagine if Gonzaga haters could never again take the lazy shot , Well they 've never even made it to the Final Four. Hopefully this is the year that changes . But it might not be . If they fall short of Phoenix , and the trolls emerge from their holes to feast on low hanging fruit , remember these words from Myron Medcalf about the idea of throwing out a historic season all because of what happened during one week in March . <p> " That 's the dumbest thing I 've heard all year people who think that , that 's dumb , " said Medcalf.

AMR can do it cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Spokane has an agreement with AMR to provide ambulance service . To make sure patient care is a priority , the agreement lays out several standards the company must meet , including getting to calls on time .

@@102173291 @6373291/ <h> Eagles defense has to be good , not great <p> The adage that defense wins championship in the NFL is false , or at least not as true as everyone is led to believe . <p> ( Photo : AP ) <p> The defense does have to be good , however . <p> According to the website sportingcharts.com , the Super Bowl champions from 2004 through last season had defenses that ranked an average of 12.9 out of 32 teams in yards allowed . The average offense ranked 10.8 in yards gained . <p> Just look at the last two seasons . Seattle allowed the fewest points in the NFL each time . The Seahawks won the Super Bowl in the 2013 season after dominating the high-powered Denver offense . In this past season , the Patriots scored 28 points against that same defense and won the Super Bowl . <p> New England was right in the middle of both rankings as the Patriots were 11th on offense and 13th on defense in 2014 . So unless they were deflating footballs , stealing opponents ' signs or scrambling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eagles have the offense . They have ranked in the top five in both seasons under head coach Chip Kelly , setting team records for points each season . And the offense should be even better this season , assuming quarterback Sam Bradford can stay healthy . <p> The overriding question , then , is the defense . The last two seasons , the Eagles defense ranked 29th and 28th , respectively , in yards allowed per game . They were especially putrid against the pass , ranking 32nd and last in 2013 and 31st last season . <p> That 's definitely not Super Bowl material . <p> So the Eagles revamped the secondary , traded for Kiko Alonso at inside linebacker and tried to add depth all around . One of those new players is cornerback Byron Maxwell , whom the Eagles lured from Seattle with a six-year , $63 million contract . <p> " We 've got the potential to be a cold-ass unit , " he said . " We 've just got to do it . " <p> Can they ? <p> After four preseason games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Sure , the Eagles only gave up two plays of 20 or more yards in the first halves of the first three preseason games , when the starters and first reserves were typically in the game . This was a big problem area for the Eagles last season , when they allowed 72 " X plays " , the most in the NFL . <p> But in the preseason opener , Indianapolis quarterback Andrew Luck was in for 11 plays and left while the Colts were driving . In the second game , the Eagles faced Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco for just one quarter . The Eagles did intercept him twice , however . Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers did n't play at all in the third game . <p> Eagles coach Chip Kelly said his defensive backs the last two seasons too often would " bite the cheese . " That , of course , can be seen as a parting shot at safety Nate Allen and cornerback Bradley Fletcher . The Eagles also did n't bring back Cary Williams . <p> " I just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X ' plays last year , what happened was we were biting on underneath routes when we were supposed to play on the deep part of the ball , " Kelly said . " Or biting on ball fakes or things that we should n't do . " <p> The Eagles ' secondary will be tested right away in the opener against the Atlanta Falcons ' receiving duo of Julio Jones and Roddy White , with quarterback Matt Ryan running the show . <p> It 'll be the same against NFC East rivals . The Eagles will face Dallas ' Dez White , Washington 's DeSean Jackson and the Giants ' Odell Beckham Jr. , twice each . The lasting image from last season was all three of them burning the Eagles deep in the final weeks of the season , when the Eagles went from 9-3 to 10-6 and out of the playoffs . <p> " That 's the key , when you 're talking the secondary , is no deep passes , " Maxwell said . " That 'll kill your defense . That 's our job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts there and trickles down . It was stressed in Seattle . When the defense works , the opposing offense is n't getting easy ones . They have to work for everything they get . We 'll see how it works . " <p> The Eagles ' defense should improve to rank in the top 20 . That should provide the offense with enough of a cushion to have a successful season . The prediction here is the Eagles will go 11-5 , win the NFC East and advance to the NFC championship game , where they 'll lose to the Detroit Lions .

Keselowski asserted many times that he was n't . But Johnson says his rival will . <p> " At some point , the magnitude of it hits you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consecutive championships from 2006-10 . " He may be very comfortable and calm now . It may not happen until he 's in the car . But at some point , that magnitude hits , and I 've lived through it five times . That 's a turning moment , and we 'll see how he responds . " <p> Keselowski might not be as battle-tested as Johnson , but he still is the presumptive favorite entering Sunday 's Ford EcoBoost 400 . <p> Trailing by 20 points , Johnson must win on a 1.5-mile superspeedway that he has yet to conquer while hoping for a collapse by Keselowski , who has averaged a finish of 5.1 during the first nine Chase races . <p> But the season finale will be unlike any yet experienced by the Penske Racing driver , who is in only his third full season in Cup and has n't faced such a pressure-packed situation . <p> " I do n't think Brad knows yet this is a different race , " said Rusty Wallace , an analyst for ESPN who won the 1989 championship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the one . I 'm not sure Brad knows 100% about that yet . " <p> Johnson made sure Keselowski was cognizant of it during a news conference in which he incessantly needled him with subtle jabs : <p> Though Keselowski , who has finished lower than 11th only once in the past 19 races , needs only a 15th or better to clinch the first Cup title for team owner Roger Penske , Johnson insisted it was n't " a layup . " <p> Unprompted , Johnson mentioned that he had drawn inspiration from Ryan Hunter-Reay 's stunning comeback to win the IndyCar championship two months ago when Will Power squandered a lead with a spin . Power happens to be Keselowski 's teammate . <p> Johnson also reminded him that the points leader entering the finale has lost the championship the past two years . <p> " Brad , if you 'd like me to call later and remind you of any other examples , I certainly can , " he said with a laugh . <p> In 2010 , Johnson entered the season finale trailing Denny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week earlier at Phoenix International Raceway . It seemed to throw Hamlin off his game throughout the weekend , and the Joe Gibbs Racing driver qualified 37th , spun early in the race and finished 14th to hand over the crown . <p> Though he is coy about it ( " I did n't come in here with a huge agenda thinking that I was going to make a difference , " he claimed Thursday ) , the mind games likely wo n't cease until the checkered flag falls . <p> " This is just the start of it , " Johnson said . " Every camera in Florida will be on us in every practice session , on the walk to and from the transporter . All of that just ramps up . It 's tough , and you have to do things that make you feel uncomfortable . " <p> Keselowski , 28 , said he relishes it . <p> " I want the pressure , " he said . " I thrive in it . " <p> A tireless work ethic <p> He seemed unaffected Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media obligations . <p> " A lot of stressed out people in here , " he said , entering a room of reporters late in the afternoon .

You can read Detroit Bad Boys blogs every Friday and find Sean on Twitter @seancorp . <p> Admit it , Pistons fans , you expected Detroit to lose Wednesday night . The home opener against the Utah Jazz was the type of game the Pistons of the past six years lost . A close game , a fourth-quarter collapse , players looking lost in crunch time -- it had all the markings of what has made the Pistons one of the NBA 's most hapless franchises for half of a decade . <p> But something is different . Owner Tom Gores likes what he sees with this team , something special . Whatever it is , it has been on display in the first two games of the season -- two games against quality opponents and two wins keyed by superior defensive effort . <p> The Pistons are 2-0 for first time since 2008 and , more remarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games over .500 since March 13 , 2009 -- before Gores even bought the franchise . <p> Yes , it is too early to draw any firm conclusions , but victories against the Atlanta Hawks and Jazz should not be discounted . The Hawks had the best record in the Eastern Conference last season , and the Jazz was one of the most dangerous teams in the NBA after the All-Star break . <p> Through two games , Detroit 's expected high-powered offense is a no-show . The team is shooting just 39.4% and is playing at one of the slowest paces in the NBA . A lot of that has to do with Detroit 's opponents . The Hawks had the sixth-best defense in the NBA last season , and the young Jazz team had the NBA 's best defense in the second half of the season . <p> The Pistons now seem to have enough defensive ability to weather scoring droughts and make opponents work for points . The Pistons rank No. 11 in defensive efficiency in this extremely young season , according to nba.com . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boards . Detroit has the third-best rebounding percentage in the NBA , thanks largely to Andre Drummond ( 14.5 rebounds per game ) . By controlling the boards , Detroit has virtually eliminated opponents ' ability to get second-chance points . The Pistons have only given up 4.5 second-chance points per game , fewest in the NBA . <p> Detroit also has transformed its perimeter defense , which was one of numerous trouble spots last season . The Pistons have held high-powered scorers such as Jeff Teague , Kyle Korver , Gordon Hayward and Rodney Hood in check . <p> Already established as Detroit 's best defender , Kentavious Caldwell-Pope seems to have found another gear in his third year . Caldwell-Pope kept the NBA 's most dangerous three-point threat in the East , Korver , silent in Atlanta and secured the game-securing block against Alec Burks against Utah . <p> Reggie Jackson might be struggling on offense , but he seems committed on defense , consistently fighting through screens and staying in front of his man . With Jackson , Caldwell-Pope , Stanley Johnson and Marcus Morris , Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch on pick-and-rolls and ably guard the wing and the big man interchangeably . <p> While the Pistons ' big men have struggled to guard the paint , the team is holding opponents to 32% shooting outside of it . <p> While so much focus was spent on how coach Stan Van Gundy 's four-out , one-in offensive system would supercharge Detroit 's offense , it 's really the defensive principles he 's installed that have made the difference through two games . He finally has the players who can execute his system , and it 's the reason Detroit has its best record in 6.5 years . With sights set on the playoffs , it 's only with defense that this team will reach its goals .

Part of that is Lane Kiffin 's playcalling , but another part of that is that the offensive line has n't been consistent enough to allow that to happen . <p> The kicking game has been disappointing , of course .

@@102173330 @6373330/ <h> Byron Moore : Gauging when to take Social Security <p> Question : When should I start taking Social Security ? I turn 62 next week and I 'm not sure if I should take it sooner or later . I 'll probably work till I 'm at least 70 if my health holds out . <p> Answer : The first thing to do is get your facts straight . <p> You can start by going to www.ssa.gov , setting up an account and obtaining a report from Social Security of what your specific benefits will be at the various ages you can take them . <p> Generally speaking , you can begin taking Social Security benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70 . It is n't possible to take them earlier for normal retirement and there is no benefit to waiting after age 70 to take them . <p> Before looking at the particulars of early or late benefits , I think it is helpful to determine what you are trying to achieve . Based on hundreds of conversations I 've had over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen : <p> First , some people want to win the contest . They see themselves as having paid into the Social Security system for all their working lives , and now they want to get the most out of it . For them , determining when to take Social Security is all about winning " how can I game the system so I get the most out of the system ? <p> Others just want to be done . These folks see Social Security as their ticket to the world of nonwork . It feels a lot like free money , so why not take it now ? <p> I would encourage another view : you should take Social Security in whatever way maximizes your happiness and security . Any other approach will see the motivation for their approach fade into the sunset , while the longer-lasting issues of happiness and security grow larger and larger over time . <p> Let 's look broadly at some options for when to take Social Security retirement benefits . <p> You could take them early . Age 62 is generally earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do choose to take benefits at 62 ( or any time before the so-called normal retirement age ) , two bad things happen . <p> If you work and earn enough money , your benefits get hammered . It gets complicated , but for example , if a 63-year-old starts taking Social Security benefits , and also works and earns more than $15,480 that year , he 'll give up $1 of Social Security benefits for every $2 he earns . <p> And even if you do n't work at a wage earning job , your benefit is reduced pro-rata for every month you retire prior to that normal retirement age ( NRA ) . For anyone born after 1960 , their NRA is age 67 . So if you would have received $1,000 in monthly Social Security benefits at age 67 but decide to retire early ( age 62 ) , you 'd be looking at a 30 percent reduction in benefits . Your monthly check would be $700 , rather than $1,000 . <p> This is just one more reason to get your benefits statement from www.ssa.gov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly benefit if you retire at the normal retirement date , take benefits early or take benefits late . <p> This is a big topic , so let 's finish next week by looking at what happens if you either choose to take benefits at the normal retirement age or choose to delay . <p> For now , just remember that your choice of what to do should not be based on a math formula , but on what you believe will make you the happiest . <p> Sometimes there 's a difference . <p> Byron R.

He was hopeful the pain would subside before he starts working out again in mid-April.
