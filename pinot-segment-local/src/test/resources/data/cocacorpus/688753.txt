This was noticed and corrected so the black on subsequent issues adds some shadow/depth to the white letters .

@@83495057 @4995057/ <h> Gold Certificate No Number <h> Blue Cert . <h> U.K. Edition <p> First of all it is worth pointing out that the " gold " and " blue " comics are in fact ordinary first print copies of Miracleman #1 and tend not to be recognized in the various price guides ( or by CGC ) as variants . What makes them different is that these were apparently the first 1,000 off the printing press , which were used as promotional copies for the San Diego comic con in 1985 . There is also evidence to suggest that these early copies all had a printing crease on the cover , just to the right of Miracleman 's head . <p> The first 400 were accompanied by a gold colored ( and numbered ) certificate of authenticity . Each of these comics was signed by Alan Moore and the same individual numbering ( out of 400 ) was also present next to the signature within the comic . Note that some of the numbered copies have " PRESENTED BY : " with a vendor name such as " Sunrise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand written on the certificate , which were given out as prizes at the show . A winner of one of these gems could feel very lucky indeed as these rare items were being sold at the convention for an unbelievable $50 ( note that the blue variant went for $20 but even this was a large sum to pay for a comic back in 1985 ) . <p> Below are example signatures from inside three of the comics : <p> Anecdotally Alan Moore signed more than 400 in case someone messed up adding the numbering and this also allowed them to pick the best 400 . The additional comics were n't chucked so there are a few copies in circulation that bear the Alan Moore signature , have gold certificates , but no numbering on either the certificate or the comic : <p> The second batch of 600 comics were accompanied by a blue certificate of authenticity and the comics themselves were signed by the then Eclipse editor Cat Yronwode and also by Dean Mullaney , one of the founders of Eclipse : <p> Note that any of above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the standard edition , however , each will bear the classic : " name written on 1st page in pen " on the label ( generally , only signatures on the cover get the qualified grade ) . <p> As a side-note , Stan Sakai ( of Usagi Yojimbo fame ) put together the lettering on the certificates , which also bear his signature , and he was paid in comics for his work : he received two of the gold-certified comics signed by Alan Moore ! <p> The print run on the standard version of Miracleman #1 was around 135,000 world-wide and these are easy to come by . However , there was a U.K. variant produced with a small print run of 1,000-2,000 making it pretty rare ( CGC only have thirty graded in May 2016 ) . Note that the standard version was also imported into the U.K. so there was a mixed distribution in Blighty .

It is becoming hard to find and even editor Dez Skinn ( who still owns Quality Comics ) has no more copies available from his extensive back issue stock . <p> With Marvel re-printing the entire Miracleman/Marvelman series ( from January 2014 ) it will be very interesting to see how this affects the back-issue prices for the Eclipse copies . With new collectors coming to the series , the original Eclipse issues could become even more collectible , sending prices skywards especially on the key issues . <p> Below are a couple of covers released by Marvel for the third printing of the initial stories by Alan Moore : <p> It is likely that some of the variants of the new comic will have small print runs and could be pretty rare themselves so watch this space ! 185709 @qwx805709

During this time many memorable characters emerged such as Batman , Green Lantern , Flash , Captain Marvel and Captain America ( many of whom had stories battling with the Axis powers , some before the U.S. had even entered World War II ) . Comics were not just dominated by the superhero at this time , however , and covered many diverse subject areas such as " true crime " , horror and romance , some featuring drug use , sexual expoitation and violence . <p> After the end of World War II , the superhero genre lost popularity entering an interregnum . During this time campaigns against comic books were abound with a focus on juvenile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas by the late 40 's . In 1954 , psychiatrist Fredric Wertham , published Seduction of the Innocent , asserting that crime , sex and violence depicted in comic books encouraged the same behaviours in the children reading them . A Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency suggested the comic industry should tone down its content and this pushed the comic industry into forming the Comics Code Authority ( CCA ) . This all lead to the loss of many titles and the sanitization and censorship of others ( including the attempted censorship of a story on the evils of race prejudice ! ) with distributors refusing to carry books without the code approval . <p> With the CCA well established , 1956 saw the publication of DC Comics ' Showcase #4 and the introduction of the modern version of the Flash , which ushered in the second coming of the superhero .

During this time the infamous Air Pirates Funnies parody comic was produced leading to eventual litigation with Disney and banning of future sales and reprints of the comic . <p> The 80 's saw a maturing of comics with a focus on the older reader ; writers such as Alan Moore took stories to a darker level , deconstructing the superhero ( Marvelman , Watchman etc ) and bringing horror to a new depths in Swamp Thing .
