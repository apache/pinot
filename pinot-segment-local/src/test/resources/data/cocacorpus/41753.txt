Since 1603 , Scotland and England had shared a monarch , although both countries kept their own parliaments . From 1685 it was King James " VII of Scotland and II of England " who ruled both nations . He was unpopular , both for his Roman Catholic faith and for his highly autocratic behaviour , and a revolution in 1688 forced him to flee to France while his Dutch son-in-law , William of Orange , took over the throne of both England and Scotland . <p> King James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who called themselves Jacobites ' ( derived from the Latin version of his name ) .

Their rising failed , but the Jacobite threat remained . Determined to impose order on the clan chiefs , King William ordered a military fort to be built in the Scottish Highlands , at what became Fort William . In 1692 the crown punished the recalcitrance of the Chief of the MacDonalds at the infamous Massacre of Glencoe . <p> In addition to political discontent , there was also widespread resentment about economic affairs in Scotland . Since the Union of the Crowns , Scotland had become progressively poorer , neglected by its King in London and dragged unwillingly into England 's wars . In 1632 Scotland lost her only colony " Nova Scotia in Canada " as a result of an English war against France .

He had been instrumental in the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694 , but his new plan aimed to bring financial prosperity to Scotland , his homeland . He proposed that the Scottish Parliament , following the passing of ' An Act for Incourageing Forraign Trade ' in 1693 , should grant a Scottish monopoly on trade with Africa and the Indies to a trading company , enabling it to harness the lucrative Far Eastern trade . <p> A key part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Central America , at a place called Darien ( now part of Panama ) , so that merchant ships could reach the Pacific more easily , without having to make the long and perilous journey around Cape Horn or the Cape of Good Hope .

English investors soon raised their share , but the powerful directors of the East India Company , fearing that their monopoly would be broken and their business ruined , used their influence to turn King William and the English Parliament against the venture . Indeed , the King did not need much persuading ; he was anxious to be on good terms with Spain , and was conscious that the proposed Scottish colony would be located on Spanish-claimed land . The directors of the Company of Scotland were threatened with impeachment and English investors quickly withdrew their money . <p> The Scots , enraged by the duplicity of the King and English Parliament and carried along on a tide of national pride , resolved to raise all the capital alone .

Ships , provisions and trading stock were bought in cities across Europe , crews were recruited and the expedition 's five ships assembled in the Firth of Forth . Apart from the former French vessel Dolphin , their names " Caledonia , St Andrew , Unicorn and Endeavour " reflected Scots patriotism and hope .

They were to proceed to the Bay of Darien , and make the Isle called the Golden Island ... some few leagues to the leeward of the mouth of the great River of Darien ... and there make a settlement on the mainland ' . <p> The Darien colony <p> The colonists reached Darien , which they called New Caledonia , in November 1698 . There they built Fort St Andrew and began to erect the huts of what they hoped would become their permanent town , New Edinburgh .

A second expedition , with a further 1,300 settlers on board and the newly-built ship The Rising Sun at its head , set sail in August 1699 . The second expedition arrived at Darien in November to find the huts of New Edinburgh in disrepair and the jungle reclaiming the land . Nonetheless , the colonists decided to rebuild the settlement .

Later that year the English ship Worcester was captured in a reprisal raid and its crew accused of being the pirates who had sunk another company ship , Speedy Return , in 1703 .

After lengthy negotiations this was finally achieved by the Acts of Union of 1707 . <p> Many Scots supported the Union because the Darien disaster , coupled with a series of bad harvests after 1695 , had caused huge distress in Scotland . To its supporters , the Union seemed vital to Scotland 's economic survival , with its provisions for free trade and navigation and its payment of -398,000 ( known as the Equivalent ' ) as compensation for Darien and to support Scottish industries .

@@71731838 @431838/ <h> 1745 : John Campbell and the Jacobite occupation of Edinburgh <p> On 23 July 1745 Charles Edward Stuart landed on the Scottish island of Eriskay , on a mission to win back the British throne for the Stuarts . Despite initial reluctance , Highland families who favoured the Stuart claim to the throne gradually gave the Prince their support , and a Jacobite army was formed .

He worked for The Royal Bank of Scotland from its foundation in 1727 , and was its cashier , 1745-77 . <h> Background and early life <p> John Campbell was born in about 1703 . His parents were Colin Campbell of Ardmaddy , youngest son of the 1st Earl of Breadalbane , and Grizelda Douglas . He was believed to have been illegitimate , although some evidence suggests that Colin and Grizelda were in fact married , but that the Earl disapproved of the match and therefore had all evidence of it destroyed . <p> Colin Campbell died when John was still an infant and it is not clear where John was brought up . He certainly remained closely connected with the Breadalbane Campbells . Grizelda Douglas died in 1732 . <p> In 1718 Campbell was apprenticed to Colin Kirk , Writer to the Signet , for a term of three years . Kirk was the son of Robert Kirk , famous in Scottish lore as the Fairy Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after which Campbell seems to have remained at Kirk 's chambers . Colin Kirk died in 1725 . <h> The Royal Bank of Scotland <p> In 1727 , Campbell joined the staff of the newly established Royal Bank of Scotland , initially working in the accountant 's office . He was appointed assistant secretary in 1732 and second cashier in 1734 . It is probable that Campbell informally took on many of the day-to-day responsibilities of Allan Whitefoord , the first cashier , during this period . <p> In July 1745 Campbell succeeded to the post of first cashier , also known simply as cashier . During the Jacobite occupation of Edinburgh in September and October that year he was engaged in protecting the bank at a time of significant threat . The diary he kept during this time is preserved in the RBS Archives , and is an important source for studying Edinburgh during the 45 Jacobite Rising . <h> The Jacobite Rising of 1745 <p> John Campbell 's diary recounts how the Jacobite army took control of Edinburgh on 17 September 1745 .

At first , it had been possible to get access to the Castle when necessary , but by this time the Castle " still in government hands " was locked down , while the rest of the city was under Jacobite control . Just a few days earlier , Campbell and some colleagues had been refused access to the castle , despite waiting at the gates for an hour . <p> Campbell sought and obtained a special pass from the Jacobite authorities permitting him to pass through the streets safely on his way to the castle . He also wrote ahead to the castle warning its commander that he would be asking for access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but refused to guarantee it in writing . <p> Campbell , accompanied by colleagues and directors from the bank , made his expedition to the castle on 3 October 1745 . He successfully gained access , withdrew the gold to meet the Prince 's demands ( which by now had risen to over -3,000 ) , and more to meet any imminent further demands . He also destroyed a large quantity of unissued notes to remove the risk of them entering circulation and becoming an additional liability . While he worked , shooting went on between government forces in the castle and Jacobites outside . <p> He paid the money to the Prince 's secretary at his office later that evening . The Jacobite army left Edinburgh on 1 November , marching on into England in a bid to claim the British throne .

William Hog thus became the world 's first recipient of a cash credit , the forerunner of the modern overdraft . <p> Like many merchants , both before him and since , Hog found that he had a problem ; his business finances were made up of payments received and payments made , but these two sides of the deal did not always happen in the most convenient order .

By the later years of the 18th century , a revolution was coming ; the Industrial Revolution .

Blanchard was joined by Francis Child in around 1665 , and in 1673 Blanchard &amp; Child moved , taking their trade sign with them , to a new building on part of the site where Child &amp; Co still trades today at the west end of Fleet Street . The firm gradually diversified into banking . <p> In 1681 Francis Child , who had joined Blanchard in partnership by 1677 and had also married Blanchard 's step-daughter , inherited the entire business .

The firm survived many acute banking crises thanks to its aristocratic partners and their connections . The bank 's proximity to the Inns of Court attracted many customers from among the legal profession and links were developed with a number of Oxford colleges . <p> Francis Child 's grandson Robert had no male heirs and so the Child fortune was eventually settled on his granddaughter , Sarah Sophia Fane , who married the 5th Earl of Jersey . Sarah acted as senior partner of the bank from 1806 to 1867 . <p> When Temple Bar was removed and the street widened , Child &amp; Co built an elegant new banking house which opened in 1880 . <p> In 1924 the 8th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Currie , Holt &amp; Co for -74,372 plus life annuities to the partners totalling -7,200 per annum .

@@71731956 @431956/ 76810 @qwx696810 <h> Object 5 : Photo of Catford branch , 1908 <h> Banking has a long relationship with Britain 's suburban communities , in many cases stretching back almost to the moment when open fields gave way to district railways , semi-detached homes and the commuter lifestyle . The new suburbs needed local services , including banks , and bankers were keen to meet that need . This photograph of Rushey Green , Catford , depicts one such suburb in 1908 , with a newly-opened branch of London &amp; County Bank on the right and a tram " the very service to which Catford owed its expansion " on the left . Between the two , we see a snapshot of everyday life in an Edwardian suburb . <p> Britain 's suburbs were a product of the 19th and early 20th century transformation in the way many people lived and worked . Jobs became more concentrated in urban areas , while cities themselves became less attractive places to live . Fortunately , new developments offered an alternative , because as railways and trams were introduced , it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in more pleasant and affordable surroundings . <p> Victorian and Edwardian suburbs were not all the same . They ranged from broad leafy avenues of detached villas to narrow cobbled streets of terraced houses , but whether rich or poor , they had certain characteristics in common . They all needed shops , schools , churches , doctors , pubs , post offices , undertakers , builders and all manner of other businesses . The professional and trades people who served these new communities , as well as the residents themselves , needed to manage their financial dealings . Banks became adept at identifying this kind of demand and expanding their networks accordingly . If a bank did not immediately move into a new suburb , local citizens themselves often approached one to ask it to open up in their neighbourhood . <p> Banks became adept at identifying this kind of demand <p> London &amp; County Bank was established in 1836 .

Branches were established in emerging communities such as Elephant &amp; Castle , Hackney , Harrow , Bromley , Blackheath , Crystal Palace , Brixton , Ealing , Surbiton , Penge and Chiswick . <p> Catford was a typical Victorian suburb . Its development was prompted by the arrival of the Mid Kent Railway line to Catford Bridge in 1857 , which encouraged the construction of homes for middle class city commuters . Its growth gathered pace at the end of the century , when trams were introduced , providing a cheaper direct link from Catford to the West End . It was this new service that really put Catford on the map , and London &amp; County Bank 's new Catford branch , located at 159 Rushey Green , opened not long afterwards , on 9 June 1908.

The partnership was known as Basset &amp; Clarke by 1812 and by 1829 the partners were Sir Richard Basset , his nephew Charles Basset Roe and Thomas John Blackford . By 1837 the business was being carried on by Charles Basset and Thomas Blackford under the name of Sir Richard Basset &amp; Co . <p> In 1842 Isle of Wight Joint Stock Bank was formed with the co-operation of Sir Richard Basset &amp; Co , apparently to ' restore public confidence ' after the failure of local bank James Kirkpatrick &amp; Co ( est. c.1793 ) of Newport .

It was a joint-stock bank founded by a group of MPs and other gentlemen , including Daniel O'Connell . Frustrated by the exclusivity of the Bank of Ireland ( est. 1783 ) , and the English orientation of the Provincial Bank of Ireland ( est. 1825 ) , the founders aimed to form a bank both to provide capital for Irish economic development and to serve the needs of small traders and tenant farmers , as well as those of the gentry . <p> The bank 's head office was located in the City of London , at 39 Old Broad Street and , although the majority of backers were English , the banking business was carried on entirely in Ireland . The bank 's London agents were Barnett , Hoares &amp; Co , bankers of Lombard Street , City of London . <p> Lamie Murray , manager of the bank , modelled the organisation on Thomas Joplin 's Provincial Bank of Ireland - a joint-stock bank with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly by the parent bank and partly by local people . By the end of 1835 the bank had opened 11 branches and 18 sub-branches and an unsuccessful attempt had been made to establish a subsidiary company in Belfast , as the Belfast National Bank of Ireland . By May 1836 the bank had a paid-up capital of -374,140 , of which -133,125 was subscribed locally in Ireland . In 1837 , however , owing to administrative problems , the principle of the semi-autonomous branch was abandoned and the capital consolidated . <p> In 1845 the Irish Banking Act ended the Bank of Ireland 's monopoly in and around Dublin , and a chief office of the National Bank in Ireland was immediately opened at 34 and 35 College Green , Dublin . The Act also fixed the banknote issue of the National Bank at -852,269 . In 1847 the National Bank of Ireland also absorbed the London &amp; Dublin Bank of Dublin , regaining a number of branches which it had established in 1837 and had had to dispose of because of their proximity to Dublin . In 1854 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Broad Street in the City of London , where the board had met since 1839 . In 1856 , the bank 's name was changed from National Bank of Ireland to The National Bank Ltd and , in 1859 , with a paid-up capital of -500,000 , it was invited to join the London Clearing House . The expansion of the London business continued , and , by 1888 , The National Bank was the eighth largest British bank in terms of authorised ( -7.5 million ) and issued ( -1.5 million ) capital and only four other banks had more branches in London . This growth was sustained with over 60 further branches opened between 1888 and 1922 . <p> After the First World War the board , preoccupied with warding off take-over bids and coping with problems caused by the political and economic situation in Ireland , began to consolidate . The depression of agriculture had a detrimental effect on business , whilst the subsequent establishment of the Irish Free State had implications for the bank 's shareholding , tax affairs and note issue . In 1922 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bank formed an Irish board to manage the larger Irish side of the business . This did not however , solve all of the bank 's problems , rather they were further compounded by the general economic recession of the 1920s and 1930s and the Second World War . <p> During the 1950s and 1960s , the expansion of the Irish economy provided much business for the bank , but , by the mid-1960s , it was apparent that it was no longer appropriate for such an important Irish bank to be controlled from London and operate as a member of the London Clearing . In 1966 , therefore , the bank 's business in Ireland was transferred to a new company , National Bank of Ireland , and sold to Bank of Ireland ( est. 1783 ) . The 36 English and Welsh branches passed to National Commercial Bank of Scotland , although The National Bank , with a paid-up capital of -3 million , continued to operate its branch network independently until 1970 , when the branches became part of the new Williams &amp; Glyn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Welsh branches and sub-branches between 1835 and 1966 , located in South Wales , London and other key English cities such as Liverpool and Manchester .

If you 've been employed before , try to make this sound positive . So if you want more responsibility or more training , say so . If you 're changing sectors , show how your skills and knowledge can be transferable . Do n't say that you were fired ! <h> 2The STAR Technique <p> Tell me about a time when <p> The best way to answer these questions is to use a formula called STAR to structure your reply clearly : <p> S = situation , what is the situation ( place , role etc ) you are explaining <p> T = task , what is the actual task you are referring to <p> A = action , what did you do and how <p> R = results , what was the outcome as a result of your actions ? <p> Here is an example : <p> Last summer when I was working as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job of improving front of store promotions to increase sales of our new product ( T ) . I decided to visit competitor stores and research how they use their promotions and put new ideas for our store that would keep us a head of the competition , such as a new offer and staff wearing branded clothing to promote it ( A ) . My manager took my ideas on board and after a week of the new promotions , our sales increased by 10% ( R ) . <h> 3Competency Based Questions <p> Here are a few examples of competencies you may get asked about <p> Tell me about a time when you used your initiative . Think about roles you have had in clubs or societies . Maybe you organised events for your school sports team , or you were head boy/girl at school and made some good decisions . <p> Tell me about a time when you made the wrong decision . This is something that is very difficult to answer . Whatever you choose to talk about , it is important to remember to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this experience . Again , do n't say that you were fired ! <p> Why do you think you 'd be good at this role ? Here you should talk about your skills and qualities and how theyll help you handle the job . So if you 're a clear and confident speaker and your job will involve taking phone calls , then this is the sort of thing you should talk about . <p> What can you bring to this organisation ? Use words like dedication , initiative , motivation and enthusiasm . Research the companys values and show how you could fit in through what youd bring . <p> Do you feel you can work well unsupervised/in a team/both ? Talk about times where you 've worked in a team or on your own , perhaps a group drama performance or a big project you had to deliver by yourself . <p> How do you cope under pressure ? Give some examples of occasions where you were under pressure and you succeeded like exams , public speaking or a busy time at a previous job . <p> Give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough thing to be asked ; try to be positive , but do n't be afraid of throwing in one slightly less positive one to talk about . Remember , if you use a word that 's a little bit negative be ready to spin it into a positive . Good examples you might want to use are motivated , cooperative and cautious or enthusiastic , committed and decisive . Show your personality professionally too ! <h> 4Questions to Ask <p> An interview is n't just about answering questions . You should also think about what you want to know . This shows you 've done your research and that you 're really interested in working for the company . Make sure the questions you ask are relevant to the job role and the organisation . Here are a few to get you started : <p> Apart from what is written in the job description , what else are you looking for in the ideal candidate for this position ? <p> Translates to : Am I the kind of person they are looking for ? <p> How many people at my level are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What chance do I have of getting this job ? <p> What is the company culture like ? <p> Translates to : Would I fit in here ? <p> What kind of work would I be doing on a day to day basis ? <p> Translates to : Is this the sort of work I want to do ? <p> What do you offer to your customers and employees that other companies do n't  ? <p> Translates to : Why should I work here ? <p> What does your company value ? <p> Translates to : Do we share the same values ? <p> What training and development will I get ? <p> Translates to : How will I be trained and assessed ? <h> 5Prepare for Interview Success <p> Top tips <p> Dress for success and look sharp try to dress the way you would if you were showing up for work <p> Be sure to get there on time <p> Get to bed early the night before so that you look rested , healthy and alert for the interview <p> Take a copy of your application , CV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could easily get the answer from the job description or company website it may look like you have n't done your research if you do ! ? <p> Pre-interview checklist <p> Do your research , be ready to back up the points you make and make sure you practise answers to common questions <p> Think up example answers for competency based questions structure them using the STAR method . Think about the Situation , the Task , the Action you took and the Result you achieved <p> Make sure the experiences you choose are ones you can talk about in detail and have back-up examples to give , just in case

In it , he introduces many ideas that have underpinned economic thought ever since . He writes at length about the economic conditions of his native Scotland , including the significance of its banking system : ' I have heard it asserted ... that the trade of Scotland has more than quadrupled since the first erection of the two public banks at Edinburgh The Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland ... That the trade and industry of Scotland ... have increased very considerably during this period , and that the banks have contributed a good deal to this increase , can not be doubted .

Even after their return , the two men remained friends for life . Buccleuch gave Smith a pension which enabled him to give up teaching and concentrate on writing what would become his classic work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) . <p> The bond between academic economist and bank governor was in some senses emblematic of the time and context in which it was formed ; a period known as the Scottish Enlightenment . Throughout Europe and beyond , the Age of Enlightenment brought a blossoming of intellectual , literary , scientific and artistic achievement , springing from a fundamental belief that people could use their own powers of reason to understand themselves and the world around them .

Although it is known to have belonged to the bank for very many years , no information survives about how or when it was received , so it is impossible to say whether it came from Smith himself , perhaps via his friendship with the bank 's governor .

@@71732042 @432042/ 76810 @qwx696810 <h> Object 53 : Garibaldi letter of credit , 1860 <h> In the mid-19th century Giuseppe Garibaldi , hero of the struggle for Italian unification , was one of the most famous men on the planet . This letter of credit is a testament to his international popularity . It probably represents the proceeds of one of the many fundraising initiatives that took place up and down Scotland in support of his cause . Improving global communications meant that people were increasingly aware of events overseas , including Garibaldi 's struggles in Italy . Many people were moved to send money to show their support for his cause . <p> It was not practical or safe to send large donations in cash across Europe . A letter of credit was a more secure alternative . Fundraisers could deposit money in a bank in Scotland . The bank then issued a letter of credit in Garibaldi 's name which , upon receipt , he could fairly easily exchange with a banker or merchant for local cash at current exchange rates . The letter might pass through numerous hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the Scottish bank 's London agents would pay the value and settle up with the bank in Scotland . Most of this chain was , of course , invisible and irrelevant to Garibaldi and his Scottish supporters . All they cared about was that the money had been transferred safely . <p> The annotations on the back of the document tell its story . It was issued by National Bank of Scotland in Edinburgh on 22 August 1860 . In Naples on 24 October Garibaldi signed it over to his secretary Giovanni Basso , no doubt so that Basso could handle the money business on his behalf . This was just two days before one of the most famous events of Italian unification , the ' Handshake of Teano ' , when Garibaldi met Victor Emmanuel II and hailed him as the King of Italy . <p> Weeks later , in Genoa , Basso passed the letter on to a Michele Piaggio , who passed it to F Gruber &amp; Co , a firm of Austrian cloth merchants who specialised in importing English wool to Italy for tailoring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schunck Souchay &amp; Co , another merchant house with strong links to England , and they sent it to their London office . They presented it for payment at the banking house Glyn &amp; Co . Glyn 's passed the letter to the bank in Scotland and received the -115 payment . All debts along the way had been settled , and the money had passed safely from Scotland to Italy .

The recordings could also be used as a way of encouraging positive peer assessment e.g. What has X explained well ? or Were there any areas you felt X explained less clearly ? <p> Calculations on the worksheets : Pupils are asked to make calculations relating to the finances of the Company of Scotland .

Within two decades , the Glasgow branch was already conducting more business than head office in Edinburgh . <h> 1820-1860 " Banking on notes <p> In the early years of the 19th century England suffered a succession of financial crises , the most devastating of which , in 1825 , ruined 60 banks . <p> By the mid-1840s , the contrast between the English and Scottish systems of banking was already well-established , but the gulf was widened by legislation in 1844 and 1845 .

@@71732168 @432168/ <h> Changing Times " A Brief History of Recruitment at RBS : Part One <p> In the 290 years since The Royal Bank of Scotland first opened its doors , there 's been an astonishing amount of social and technological change : from the Industrial Revolution to the civil rights movement and the dawn of the digital era . So much about the way we think and work and interact has changed , and the world of recruitment is no exception . <p> With the help of Sally Cholewa from our Archives team , we thought it would be interesting to trace how recruitment in banking has changed with the times : to consider where we are now , and what the future might hold . There 's a lot to take in , so we 've split the story into two parts . Next week we 'll bring things right up to date , but for now , we 're going to take a leap into the past . <p> Our journey starts in Edinburgh , in 1727 ... <h> The Days of Patronage <p> When The Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprised of eight officers and servants ' . All were men , and all were chosen because of family or business ties . It really was a case of who you know ' . <p> This way of recruiting " referred to as patronage ' " was commonplace , and continued for a long time . But not all appointments followed this trend . Our records show that in 1812 one James Douglas was appointed to a role in the accountant 's office of the Commercial Bank of Scotland because his abilities recommended him ' , despite having few friends and no influence ' . <p> Douglas secured his position through merit rather than patronage , in a world where old ideas and customs were gradually coming under challenge . But it would take a long time for recruitment practices , in general , to become more inclusive and meritocratic . <p> Today , at RBS , we 're committed to building a diverse , inclusive workforce , where everyone feels welcome , and we 'll talk more about this leg of our journey in Part Two . <h> Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanding rapidly and an increasing number of junior roles were being created . Patronage was still a big factor in the recruitment process , but a more structured approach was also emerging . <p> Applicants had to have an introduction from a person known favourably to the bank and references from reputable figures . They had to write a formal letter of application , pass an entrance exam ( on subjects ranging from arithmetic to Latin ) and attend an interview at head office . <p> That said , if a candidate had influential enough connections , the entrance exams and interviews were often mere formalities . <p> A career in banking was seen to offer prospects and respectability , so there was no shortage of applicants . But banks had a very narrow idea about the kind of candidates they wanted . <p> Applicants for a junior clerkship had to be men , aged between 15 and 21 . They had to be from a respectable middle class family ' , of good character and appearance , and even , in some cases , have reached a certain minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posting today ? ! <h> Effects of War <p> The outbreak of the First World War was a key turning point . Millions of young men were called up , and many of the jobs they left behind were filled by women . Parr 's Bank , a NatWest constituent , was among the first British banks to employ female staff in 1914 . Many others followed suit . <p> Most positions were filled ad-hoc , by female friends or relatives of existing staff , in what was considered an emergency measure . The terrible loss of life during the war , combined with a post-war economic boom , meant that many women who had been employed as temporary clerks stayed on , and were eventually offered permanent positions . <p> The make-up of the workforce may have quickly changed , but conventional ideas about gender roles did n't . Women workers were subject to restrictions , reflecting the norms and biases of the time . Communication with male employees was to be avoided and female staff had to be unmarried . Women were paid less than men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resign her post ( a rule which was n't changed until the 1950s ) . <p> The outbreak of war in 1939 again resulted in millions of men leaving employment , either voluntarily or through conscription , and women were again called upon to take the roles they left behind . This accelerated social changes that were already underway , and led to a significant rise in the post-war female working population . All this lay the grounds for a more diverse and mobile post-war social landscape . <h> Tune in Next Time <p> So , what changes took place in the post-war era ? How have we got to where we are now , and what does the future of recruitment have in store ? <p> Keep an eye out for the final part of our Brief History of Recruitment , coming out on January 19th .

We saw the role patronage ' played in recruitment , and observed how the World Wars sparked the growth of a female workforce in the banking sector , even though traditional mindsets were slow to alter . <p> Here , we pick up where we left off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post war Change and the Swinging Sixties <p> Among other things , the post war years saw the introduction of the first training and graduate schemes , and the beginnings of modern recruitment practices . The Royal Bank of Scotland 's first official staff training policy was introduced in 1954 . <p> Around this time , many banks set up dedicated training centres . National Provincial Bank opened Chalfont Lodge in 1955 , where new entrants stayed for a month , learning the basic principles of branch banking . <p> Model branch used for training at Chalfont Lodge , 1950s <p> The way people communicated about career opportunities was also changing . Previously , banks had relied on personal introductions or responses to the odd advert in newspapers . In an increasingly mobile and competitive job market a more proactive approach was needed . <p> Banks started to seek out applicants and offer attractive benefit packages , wage structures , staff sporting and social activities . <p> Linked to this , recruitment advertising campaigns were launched . In the 1960s a number of these were aimed at reaching out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the swinging ' spirit of the times : <p> The language and approach may look dated by today 's standards , but adverts like this mark an important shift . They show banks attempting to engage with candidates and appeal to their aspirations , rather than just asserting their own expectations . <p> This advert also reflects changing attitudes towards women in work . Women now had the choice of a career in banking , not just a job until marriage . With the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimination acts of the 1970s , the percentage of women in the banking workforce continued to rise . <h> Into the Present <p> The pace of change has n't slackened . Since the 1990s , we 've seen the expansion of graduate schemes and apprenticeships which give graduates and school leavers a great variety of career paths to explore . <p> We 've seen the introduction of legislation to ensure that everyone at work " and applying for work " is treated fairly and without discrimination , regardless of sexuality , gender , age , religion , or disability . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , we 're actively striving to build a diverse , inclusive workforce , where everyone can feel at home . We know that drawing on the widest range of talents and perspectives is crucial to our success , and we 're not alone in this . <h> The Information Age <p> Computer technology , the dawn of the internet , and most recently , the rise of social media , have also revolutionised how banks recruit and how we all look for jobs . <p> Gone are the days of trawling through national newspapers for job adverts and posting handwritten applications . Information about all kinds of careers has never been more easily accessible , and thousands of jobs are now just a few touches away . <p> Online recruitment initially developed around job boards , but more recently the rise of social media has shaken things up again . LinkedIn has created a vast and evolving professional network that directly links candidates and recruiters all around the world . Alongside LinkedIn , Twitter and Facebook have contributed to creating a dynamic digital recruitment space , where candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This blog is a case in point . <p> The upshot is that job seekers can now build a much fuller picture of the organisations they 're applying to , and the opportunities they offer .

So , what does the future hold ? <p> Innovations in technology and approach will continue to surprise us . Video interviews are already a thing . . .

NatWest Chief Economist Stephen Boyle takes a look at the cost of hosting the event . <p> What else could the money buy ? <p> The Eurovision Song Contest is a costly endeavour . With countries like Azerbaijan spending -48m on hosting the event and with the IMF persuading Hungary to withdraw in 2010 due to the cost , the financials of hosting ca n't be overestimated . Ahead of tonight 's competition , I 've attempted to work out the real economic value of winning and hosting the Eurovision song contest . <p> SVT , Sweden 's national broadcaster has set aside a budget of -11 million for this year 's show .

Like other major events , the ESC attracts visitors and publicity for the host city and country .

In 2012 Baku in Azerbaijan spent a total of -48m hosting the contest . The high cost can be partly attributed to the Baku Crystal Hall which was built specifically to host Eurovision . The construction of the Hall contributed to the creation of over 500 full time jobs " a welcome boost for a country that was less appealing to traditional Eurovision tourists . Last year 's host Vienna created the equivalent of 416 jobs in the hotel and restaurant sectors as well as in the arts , broadcasting , advertising and market research . <p> So " is it worth it ? <p> It 's hard to be conclusive . Every host city has seen a modest boost in both short-term tourism and in their local economy .

@@71732192 @432192/ 76810 @qwx696810 <h> Royal Bank of Scotland mobile branch celebrates 70th anniversary <h> Ruth Reed <p> On 5 November 1946 Royal Bank of Scotland constituent bank , National Bank of Scotland , launched the world 's first mobile bank . Archivist Ruth Reed tells the story of the branch . <p> The van itself was an American Studebaker , left behind by the US Army at the end of the Second World War . <p> November in the Western Isles can be bleak . The days grow shorter and the cold weather draws in . It might not feel like the best time to start something new . But it was on just such a day in 1946 that a driver and a clerk set off together in a van from National Bank of Scotland 's Stornoway branch , on a brand new mission to meet and serve the bank 's customers - in their own communities - all over Lewis and Harris . <p> The van itself was an American Studebaker , left behind by the US Army at the end of the Second World War . Shortages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to pick up army surplus equipment played a big part in making the enterprise possible . <p> The Studebaker had been used during the war as a mobile pay office , travelling around to issue wages to soldiers wherever they were stationed . It is thought that this practice was the inspiration for the mobile bank idea . <p> The initiative was particularly applicable to the customers of Stornoway branch . Many of them were crofters or tweed weavers . They worked in their own homes , which stood alone or perhaps clustered with one or two other houses , all over the island . Few had cars of their own , so a trip to the bank in Stornoway could take a whole day . <p> The bank realised that it could save people all that time and effort by going out to meet them " quite literally going the extra mile ( or more ) for its customers . It set up a regular route , covering an average of 50 miles a day , nine days a fortnight . Customers could go to their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their banking business in a matter of minutes . <p> The new service was immediately popular . Press coverage was overwhelmingly positive , and before long enquiries began pouring in from banks in Africa , Europe , India , New Zealand and the United States , all asking to know more about the service and how it worked . <p> The bank 's second mobile branch started its rounds in 1947 . Like the first vehicle , it made use of war surplus " this time a former Air Raid Precautions control wagon " which was converted to bank use . It was based at Fort William and served remote villages in the Lochaber and Ardnamurchan areas . As press coverage at the time pointed out , Ardnamurchan contained an area of about 100 square miles that had never before had banking facilities , so the new service was most welcome . <p> Although other banks in Scotland and beyond imitated the idea , it was National Bank of Scotland that remained famous for its invention . It went on to develop the concept in new ways . In 1962 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scotland , it introduced a boat bank in Orkney . Eight years later " following the bank 's acquisition by Royal Bank of Scotland " the service was superseded by the flying branch which still operates today . <p> In more recent years , mobile branches have come into their own once again . Today NatWest , Ulster Bank and Isle of Man Bank , as well as Royal Bank of Scotland , all operate mobile bank routes . Advances in digital technology have increased the functionality the vehicles can offer , while the flexibility they provide has become more important than ever as smaller rural branches become unviable and are replaced with mobile services . <p> It 's fair to say that the mobile branch has travelled much further " and had a greater impact on customers " than the original driver and clerk could ever have imagined when they first set off from Stornoway , 70 years ago today . 76813 @qwx696813

@@71732258 @432258/ 76810 @qwx696810 <h> Banknotes : 8 things you might not know <p> As the production process for the new -10 note featuring Mary Somerville begins , we dig into the story behind our banknotes and share eight facts that might surprise you . <p> Our new -10 note will be the first time a non-royal woman has been unveiled as the face of one of our banknotes . <h> 1 . Face value <p> These days almost all notes have someone 's face on them . That 's because our brains are so attuned to looking at faces that we easily spot tiny differences - and that makes them an excellent anti-counterfeit measure . The first British banknote to make a main feature of a face was issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland in 1727 " our very first design , in the year the bank was established . It bore a portrait of the king at the time , George II . <h> 2 . A bank of firsts <p> Other features that we think of as standard today were also pioneered by the Royal Bank of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe to issue multi-coloured banknotes ( black , red and blue ) and in 1826 we became the first British bank to issue a double-sided note . <h> 3 . What makes Scotland different ? <p> Centuries ago , almost all of Britain 's banks issued their own notes " it was a key part of banking business . However , irresponsible note issuing could cause problems for the economy , so in the 1840s the government changed the law to encourage the gradual ending of English and Welsh banks ' notes , leaving just the Bank of England as an issuer . But in Scotland , the banks had been good at regulating and organising their note issues . The system was very stable , and people depended on it . The banks and the public together persuaded the government that the Scottish system did n't need fixing , so the same controls were not applied to Scotland . That 's why Scottish banks can still issue their own notes to this day . <h> 4 . RBS through and through <p> Each note the bank issues incorporates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the naked eye . Many are also machine readable . Did you know , for example , that if you hold an RBS banknote up to the light the bank logo at the bottom left of the front of the notes will fill neatly with colour ? And if you were to take a magnifying glass and study the block of colour at the bottom of the front of the note , you 'll find it is n't really a block of colour at all . It actually reads RBSRBSRBSRBS ' and the line immediately above the block of colour reads The Royal Bank of Scotland ' . <h> 5 . Notes not legal tender ... <p> Contrary to popular belief , Scottish banknotes are not actually legal tender . And Bank of England notes are n't legal tender in Scotland either . Officially , the phrase ' legal tender ' means money that a person is obliged to accept if offered it in payment of a debt . Under Scottish law , that does not include banknotes , which are classified as ' legal currency ' but not ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was during the two world wars when , as a temporary measure , the government made banknotes legal tender in Scotland , to reinforce people 's trust in them . This was important in a time of shortages , when the government needed to be sure people would n't hoard gold . <h> 6 . When is a -10 note not a -10 note ? <p> The Scottish banks have always undertaken to accept - at face value - any of their old banknotes , even after designs have left circulation . Many notes are , of course , worth much more than their face value , because they 've become collectors ' items over the years . <h> 7 . Sign of the times <p> Every one of our banknotes was hand-signed by a bank official until 1936 . The tradition lasted a bit longer on high denomination notes ; the last Royal Bank -100 note to be signed by hand was issued in 1949 . Originally , this task was a responsibility of the bank 's most senior officers , but as circulation grew , more junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Ilay series <p> The Royal Bank 's current designs are called the Ilay series ' , after the bank 's first governor , the Earl of Ilay , whose portrait appears on them . On the back , each denomination has an illustration of a different famous Scottish castle . This series has been in circulation since 1987 . Traditionally , the Royal Bank did n't issue a -50 note , but one was added to the series in 2005 , depicting Inverness Castle . <p> The Royal Bank of Scotland has today announced that James Clerk Maxwell , Mary Somerville and Thomas Telford have been shortlisted to appear on its new polymer -10 note , set to be issued in the second half of 2017 . The final decision will be made following a public vote running from Monday 1 February to Sunday 7 February . 76813 @qwx696813

@@71732265 @432265/ <h> Leadership at Lombard " An interview with Leigh Risley , Director of Asset Finance <p> Many people have leadership potential " perhaps more people than realise it themselves " but one thing is certain : no one is born a leader . It takes experience , determination , the support of others , and the willingness to challenge yourself and keep learning . <p> This was one thought I took from my recent conversation with Leigh Risley , Director of Asset Finance for the East , in our Lombard business . <p> Since joining the bank as a graduate in 2001 , Leigh has had six different roles and gained a wealth of experience . She 's been in her present role just six months , and she 's relishing the adventure of leading a diverse team of 14 colleagues . <p> We had a fascinating discussion about her career journey so far , team culture at Lombard , and the meaning of good leadership . <h> On the road <p> Leigh : My first role with RBS was in Leeds , as what would now be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commuting 40 miles a day " taking the train , until I could afford an old car " but it did n't matter because I loved the job . I loved the variety of supporting different customers , learning about their businesses , working together on big deals . I decided quite early on that this was the career path for me . <p> I really wanted to keep developing , and whenever I got to a place where I was doing well , but getting a bit comfortable , I started looking for the next challenge . <p> Rob : Despite moving roles , I see you 've been with Lombard for ten years now . What 's it been like working here over the years , and what is it about Lombard that 's held your interest ? <p> Leigh : There 's something about the team culture here that 's quite special . Everyone helps each other out , and that goes right across the business . You really feel like you can go to anyone with a question and they 'll make the time for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced people here , and when you experience that , you want to help people yourself . <p> There 's a great support network to fall back on , but people are also given the freedom to deliver , to take the initiative , to put forward new ideas , regardless of levels and grades . Our leadership team is always open to new ideas , whether they 're about big strategic issues , or little details . <p> Rob : That 's an interesting approach to leadership too " not just setting a direction , but trusting in and listening to the people around you . <p> Leigh : Exactly . And when we have that opportunity to get involved , we all feel positive about the work we 're doing and where we 're heading . <h> First impressions of leadership <p> Rob : Let 's talk a bit about your current role . Can you give us a sense of what you do as Director of Asset Finance ? <p> Leigh : Sure . I manage a team of 14 colleagues who are spread across the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience , from some just starting out , to Relationship Directors who are managing large portfolios . Their job , in a nutshell , is to support our customers , and mine is to support them " to make sure we 're on track , that strategically all the pieces join up , and to help each of them develop . <p> Rob : After six months in the role how are you finding it ? <p> Leigh : It 's been brilliant " really fun . And different to what I expected too , perhaps just because of the sheer variety of people and places I 'm looking after . That means a lot of remote management , and we 've having to think creatively to find the best ways of keeping connected . <p> There 's 14 people each doing different things in different places , each needing different kinds of support . As a manager I 've had to adapt to that and learn to be flexible , while also focusing on what unites us . <p> Rob : Has that been the biggest challenge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . . . I think it 's also that a lot of this is new territory for me . This is the first team I 've managed . I 'm still learning and relying on that network we mentioned before . One thing that I had to learn quickly was to get used to letting go of control and taking a step back . You definitely have to fight the temptation to micromanage . <p> Rob : Which goes back to what we were saying before about giving people the freedom to deliver . <p> Leigh : Right . You 've got to be there to give guidance when it 's needed , but also to have faith in your team to do a great job . And there 's different ways of doing that " everyone 's got a slightly different approach . What works for one person wo n't always work for another . <p> Actually that 's one of the best things about my job . Getting to see how other people work , and hearing the great feedback that comes from their customers , learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not all just about careers either " when we discuss development , it can involve all kinds of things .

We have a bank wide leadership training programme , which has been an invaluable resource . <p> I 'm also involved in our Women in Leadership ' programme , which has been fascinating in terms of putting together the big picture " learning how the bank operates on a holistic level . It 's also been a great way of meeting female leaders from every area of our business and sharing skills and ideas . It 's been eye opening to work with so many talented people , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own development plan . <p> Rob : Thanks for taking the time to talk with us Leigh ; it will certainly be interesting to see where those paths lead . You 're always welcome to come back and tell us more ! <p> Lastly , I wanted to ask what advice you 'd have for people interested in taking on a leadership role ? <p> Leigh : Thanks Rob . From my experience perhaps the single most important thing would be this . Take the time to decide where it is you want to be . Be clear with your manager about it , and then you can start building the skills you 'll need to make it happen . <p> That sounds obvious , but I assumed for ages that , if I performed well , my managers would somehow know what I wanted without me saying it . Turns out they 're not mind readers . Once I shared my goals , it was amazing how much support and opportunity were there to draw on . <h> Want to find out more ? <p> If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out our current vacancies .

@@71732288 @432288/ 76810 @qwx696810 <h> The surprising history of financial education <h> Ruth Reed <p> Archivist Ruth Reed explains how financial education as we know it today is a fairly recent concept , but the seeds of the idea took root well over a century ago . <p> Stopping people from being at a disadvantage is a big part of financial education . <p> For NatWest , it started with James Gilbart , a Victorian banker who did much to deepen the public understanding of banking . He was general manager of London &amp; County Bank , one of the banks that eventually became part of NatWest . Outside working hours , he was a prolific author on banking matters , writing not only for his fellow bankers , but for laypeople too . <p> Gilbart believed passionately that everyone " not just the rich " should have a bank account , because they were such an important tool for helping anyone to get the most out of their money . <p> One of his most influential pieces was Ten Minutes ' Advice about Keeping a Banker ' ( 1849 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of having an account , but the very simple , basic things that might intimidate someone who 'd never been into a bank before . He described what to expect when walking through the door for the first time ; what to say ; how to act . He wanted to be sure that nobody felt at a disadvantage . <p> Stopping people from being at a disadvantage is a big part of financial education , and banks have become much more aware of its importance in recent decades . It was only in the 1920s that banks began to realise the diversity of our potential customers , and to see the need to adapt our services according to their needs . We started offering Home Safe accounts , which were tailored to children and other small savers , helping them to feel welcome in the bank and encouraging them to learn the habit of saving . <p> In the 1960s we became more sophisticated in our understanding of our customers ' diverse needs . One key group we began to cater for was students . These young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many opened their first current accounts as part of that process , and we realised that we had a role in helping them to get the hang of money matters . We published booklets and brochures aimed at students and school leavers , encouraging them to seek further advice at their local branch . <p> More recently , personal finance has become more complex than ever . There are more choices and opportunities " but also greater risks of getting it wrong . Financial awareness is a key skill in our society today . <p> NatWest recognised this development in 1994 , when it launched the Face2Face with Finance programme , aimed at helping young people to become successful , financially capable adults . Unlike previous financial education , which had been offered in conjunction with bank products , this programme was delivered in schools and community groups , independent of the bank 's products and services . <p> Today , the programme " now called MoneySense " has been running for 21 years , which means the children who benefit from it today might very well be the sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the 90s . There 's still work to do , and that 's what MoneySense is all about . <p> NatWest 's Huddersfield branch , as featured in ' The Bank " a Matter of Life and Debt ' , may look fairly modern , but its heritage stretches back well over a century .

Today only 10% of the total number of transactions is undertaken in a branch vs. 25% four years ago - despite the fact the number of transactions has increased dramatically . Because there are more ways to bank than ever before , branch transactions overall have reduced by 30% , while online and mobile usage has increased by an unprecedented 232% . <p> With our customers choosing these other ways to bank with us , the need for the traditional branch has changed .

We 're investing -1bn over the next few years to upgrade our mobile and online banking but also to improve our branch network . We 're creating space so our customers can sit and do their banking online and have conversations about important moments in their lives and we are equipping branches with new technology and increasing the number of points where our customers can bank with us . <p> We are not hiding from the fact that we 've had to close branches as our customers choose other ways to bank with us .

No closure decision is taken lightly - we know that each one will impact staff , customers and communities . <p> But we 're open about the process and we are committed to working with local communities and customers affected to minimise the impact so that our customers can access our services through other means . <p> For example many elderly people prefer to do their banking face to face and some local businesses need to get change so we 've reached a deal with the Post Office so that our customers can do basic banking in any one of their 11,500 branches across the UK . We also leave an ATM where possible and provide mobile branches to communities who need them . <p> Our ATM network is the largest in the UK and will be undergoing a major refurbishment this year . 80% of our customers are within 3 miles of a branch and if you add in the Post Office network 90% of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do their day to day banking . <p> Over the course of my 30 year career with the bank I 've seen a revolution in the banking services we provide .

A one-stop-shop for personal banking services available on practically every platform imaginable . I genuinely believe that all these changes , and the choices they give , have fundamentally improved the service to our customers and I 'm determined that RBS and NatWest continues to lead the way in this . <h> Related news <p> Managing your personal finances has become a 24 hour possibility , whether it is paying your bills when you wake up on pay day or transferring money to your friends at the end of an evening meal , modern technology makes it all possible . 76813 @qwx696813 <h> Comments <p> I bank at Natwest Hove Town Hall branch , number 53-61-02 .

@@71732315 @432315/ 76810 @qwx696810 <h> Statement <p> In response to press speculation in relation to re-domicile , The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc ( " RBS " ) confirms that , as set out in the risk disclosures in RBS 's Annual Report , there are a number of material uncertainties arising from the Scottish referendum vote which could have a bearing on the Bank 's credit ratings , and the fiscal , monetary , legal and regulatory landscape to which it is subject . For this reason , RBS has undertaken contingency planning for the possible business implications of a Yes ' vote . RBS believes that this is the responsible and prudent thing to do and something that its customers , staff and shareholders would expect it to do . <p> As part of such contingency planning , RBS believes that it would be necessary to re-domicile the Bank 's holding company and its primary rated operating entity ( The Royal Bank of Scotland plc ) to England . In the event of a ' Yes ' vote , the decision to re-domicile should have no impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isles . However , RBS believes that it would be the most effective way to provide clarity to all our stakeholders and mitigate the risks previously identified in our Annual Report . <p> The vote on independence is a matter for the Scottish people . Scotland has been RBS 's home since 1727 . RBS intends to retain a significant level of its operations and employment in Scotland to support its customers there and the activities of the whole Bank . <h> FAQs <p> Does this affect me as a customer ? <p> No . There is no impact or change and our everyday banking services continue as usual . In the event of a Yes vote , Scotland would remain part of the UK while a long period of negotiations take place ( at least 18 months ) , and we will have all the same guarantees that exist for customers of other UK banks . <p> Do I need to do anything ? <p> No .

If there is a Yes vote in the independence referendum there will be a long period of time ( at least 18 months ) while negotiations take place where Scotland will remain part of the UK . During this transition customers would continue to be protected in the same way as other UK banks , including the UK 's Financial Services Compensation Scheme , which covers deposits up to the value of -85,000 for eligible customers . <p> Can I still use Scottish bank notes ? <p> Yes . The status of Scottish banknotes has not changed .

It will be a relief to all RBSs customers and investors , knowing that their money will be safe . RBS is the first of many to confirm they will relocate south of the border . <p> JGSeptember 11 2014 9:29AM <p> One of the main reasons that Scotland is voting on independence is the economical differences between London and the rest of the UK and the political obsession and fear by all parties that London must be the priority and protected at all costs even to the detrimental effect to the rest of the country . The decision taken by a Scottish institute to upsticks from a country that has given it a home from the 17th Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name within it to now move to the very city that has been instrumental in creating the atmosphere of a country potentially breaking away from the union is a cowardly disgrace and I am embarrassed today to be associated with RBS ...... or is it now RBE ! ! <p> meSeptember 11 2014 9:55AM <p> oh dear , i think the RBS has done some serious damage to your business in Scotland .

It 's comforting to know that you will still have the protection of the Bank Of England . <p> JonSeptember 11 2014 10:22AM <p> Will this have to be decided by the annual meeting , or is it within the authority of the board ? <p> To answer ' do n't wish to say'September 11 2014 10:23AM <p> " How will that affect staff in Scotland ? " As the statement says - " RBS intends to retain a significant level of its operations and employment in Scotland to support its customers there and the activities of the whole Bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to staff , the bank 's chief executive said there was no intention to move operations or jobs .

Will people and jobs actually leave Scotland ? Will operations return to Scotland once governmental negotiations have taken place and markets have returned to normal ? Regards , James Keenan. ( concerned voter and customer ) <p> Jennifer September 11 2014 11:08AM <p> Does RBS consider within its risk disclosure section the number of customers who will instead opt for the new banking option that will arise in its place , and that operates more robustly , reflecting the values of the people and the place ( its customers ) rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already uncertain fiscal landscape . An Independent Scotland will give Scottish people more choices , and political shock jockeying like these from businesses just makes the difference between the choices much easier for people . With such a momentum for change happening in Scotland , I would not be surprised to see eventually new banking options arise with more contemporary values . Lastly , this is not in response to press speculation , it is in addition to press , there is no new content here which disagrees with the presses original article . <p> Chris KentSeptember 11 2014 11:15AM <p> If this move would have no impact on everyday banking services - why do it ? <p> MichaelSeptember 11 2014 11:25AM <p> And if the UK decides to leave the EU - What 's the next port of call ? <p> Alex MonaghanSeptember 11 2014 11:44AM <p> Thanks for clearing this up , RBS !

However , I feel you should be concerned that it is not being very accurately reported in the media . It is being seized on by the ' no ' side as evidence of corporate hostility to the idea of an independent Scotland and as a risk to thousands of jobs .

What we need is an explicit statement that makes the position absolutely clear . <p> Margaret McGrathSeptember 11 2014 2:42PM <p> Thank you for your statement . I had intended to change banks in light of the press announcement but I think I will stay having read the CEO statement <p> James BoagSeptember 11 2014 2:41PM <p> What about the treasury releasing market sensitive information prior to you reporting to the stock market ? <p> Colin IzattSeptember 11 2014 5:15PM <p> If the yes vote wins next Thursday ( and there is now a strong possibility they will ) I wonder how RBS will react to the decision of many thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Scotland . RBS are wrong if they think it is acceptable to desert a country they have had an association with since 1727 just because it does not suit them ! I think also there will be a request that they drop Scotland from their name . <p> bob steelSeptember 11 2014 7:41PM <p> Will you rename yourself the bank of England ? You will be an english bank in essence so you should be in name also . <p> What a lot of gobbledegook ! What does this mean ? If there are inaccuracies in the media reports ( BBC this morning and elsewhere ) stating that the RBS is planning to move its headquarters to London in the event of a " yes " vote , with resulting job losses in Scotland , the RBS needs to say so in clear , everyday language , and to issue a statement across the media . <p> John ThackerySeptember 11 2014 8:45PM <p> Should n't you change your name in that case ? RBE <p> Sandy JohnstonSeptember 11 2014 9:34PM <p> I am not happy with the bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No doubt politically inspired ... hope it backfires big time , and if you do relocate your head office to England here is one customer who will be seeking a new bank ending a 35 year relationship . <p> David ScottSeptember 11 2014 11:19PM <p> I have to agree with the majority of people in that the report of the RBS departure from Scotland following the YES vote has been severely misquoted and as such I would expect the Bank to issue a strongly worded statement to the press to indicate that it would not be a mass exodus of its workforce to the other country merely a registration issue and that it remains neutral in terms of both campaign parties vote canvassing and that it will respect the right of the people to choose . Unless of course you are using smoke and mirrors to try and reduce the loss of custom should you follow through with the reported outcome <p> afzalSeptember 12 2014 8:31AM <p> People ! This is purely a paper exercise . Each country has a credit rating , which impacts the cost of borrowing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating impacts RBSs credit rating hence its ability to borrow and the interest rate it will pay . Scotland does not ( yet ) have a rating , hence uncertainty . And when it does get a rating , it will likely be worse than the UK rating , hence cost of borrowing for RBS will rise , hence makes sense for RBS to " relocate " to England . <p> ian hendersonSeptember 12 2014 8:35AM <p> Please let us all know who we should vote for at the next general election . You have put your nose into politics , so why not go all the way <p> Kevin JamesSeptember 12 2014 10:00AM <p> Clearly this is a media stunt by anti-independence Westminster , using a near nationalised RBS to do its dirty work . RBS knows full well that it has played its part in an orchestrated assault by the " NO " Campaign to undermine confidence and the democratic process . The memory of this will weigh heavy on the minds of individual and business customers of RBS long after the September 18th vote .

Perhaps it is time I pursued those mis-selling and mis-handling cases . <p> Michael LynchSeptember 12 2014 11:51AM <p> I think RBS has been deliberately misrepresented by the BBC and much of the press , with possible loss of custom in Scotland . Since the move would only be of the location of its registered Group HQ , to benefit from the certainty of support from the BofE and UK/rUK government There would still be the Scottish banking network and its operational support and HQ functions I 'm surprised there 's no mention of moving Group HO functions to London though - I 'd have thought the BofE would want them there . Unless they 've quietly moved already ? <p> Mr GraySeptember 12 2014 3:02PM <p> Disgraceful timing - a disillusioned and formerly loyal customer . <p> John JamiesonSeptember 12 2014 4:21PM <p> I was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to concern over the effect that your move would have on my savings and access to them after independence . It appears from the media that there will be a wholesale exodus of staff from Scotland after a " Yes " , and your statement regarding the transfer shows that the move has been blown up out of all proportion to what will happen in the short to medium term . I would like to see an official statement issued by RBS contradicting the reports on TV and in the papers in order to show good faith and reassure ordinary account holders , as opposed to those in the corporate sector who should be able to ascertain the true position . <p> Ian HSeptember 12 2014 4:12PM <p> And what happens if Scotland does get the Yes vote and becomes more prosperous than the remainder of the UK , will it mean moving back ? <p> BaybarsSeptember 12 2014 4:38PM <p> Considering that RBS is some 63% owned by the UK Government and given that Scotland can realistically claim less than 9% of the UK 's family silver , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rUK . Therefore , RBS is Scottish only in name , really . Therefore , it makes sense that , in the event of a Yes vote , both the corporate domicile and the jobs that are serving the rUK should ideally move to the rUK . That is not to say that some of those jobs should not be outsourced to Scotland if such a proposition proves commercially viable . However , it would be acceptable that the rUK savers be subjected to Scottish financial regulators , which is why the domicile of RBS should be moved to rUK in the event of a Yes vote . <p> anne tempestSeptember 12 2014 5:09PM <p> disgraceful timing rbs <p> George McGill September 12 2014 4:57PM <p> So what will happen after the transition period of 18 months when Scotland becomes independent if a yes vote wins , will jobs and our money be affected <p> ShakilSeptember 12 2014 5:28PM <p> The Royal Bank of Scotland confirmed it will no longer be based in Scotland if Scotland becomes the sort of country that should really have a royal bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the UK government so its not like were going to move to Hawaii .

This is The Royal Bank of Scotland not England . Obviously it 's the ' no ' voters who are saying they will stay with you , but in the event of a yes vote they will be in the minority .

If so , how and when can I apply for a role ? <p> RBS ModeratorApril 29 2014 4:01PM <p> Williams &amp; Glyn is building new teams in many areas including Operations and Facilities . We will advertise roles during 2014 and 2015 on our careers site http : //uk.jobs.rbs.com/ where you can search for jobs and also register your interest in working for our bank . <p> Derek AddisonMay 01 2014 12:00PM <p> I will be delighted when my Branch returns to be a Williams and Glyn 's branch . I enjoyed many happy years banking under the ' old banner ' and the staff were always noted for their friendly and efficient approach -- as I must say are the present staff at my branch . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent years and I hope the new executive recognise the value of the branch staff who have helped to keep the ship afloat . <p> As a customer of one of the RBS branches in London which will not be transferred to Williams &amp; Glyn , will I still be able to obtain the limited access to my account as I can at present via Natwest branches and ATMs and Tesco ATMs ? Furthermore , will a similar facility be available at Williams &amp; Glyn branches ? On a different note , will there be a Williams &amp; Glyn branch in the Medway Towns , possibly the largest conurbation in Kent , which have never had an RBS Branch ? <p> R G GallingMay 28 2014 5:21PM <p> Is there any hope that this " new " bank will offer any better service and terms for small companies who run a credit balance than the existing big banks which have such poor service and poor reasoning . . <p> manoj abrolMay 31 2014 4:03PM <p> may i suggest standard contactless visa debit card to be issued on the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a/c , cheque book but rbs fails to issue contactless visa debit card which i fail to understand . <p> RBS ModeratorJune 02 2014 1:21PM <p> @John Adams . We do n't know your circumstances but if you have access at Tesco ATMs and NatWest then this is unlikely to change . It 's too early to say if we 'll provide the same access in W&amp;G branches . We 'll contact all customers well in advance if any services change . We continually review our branch network to ensure we have branches in the right places for customers , but we 're unable to say now if we 'll open a W&amp;G branch in the Medway Towns . Our nearest branches are Maidstone or Dartford . <p> H2L . Expert LettingJune 14 2014 9:45PM <p> We 're closing our account and wo n't be moving to Williams &amp; Glyn . We are now in Day 5 of having no access to our business account due to one particular member of staff in a NatWest Branch not reading notes on the account and putting a No Operation marker on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who to speak to . The " Customer Service " Centre in Liverpool dealing with Project Rainbow customers is horrendous and the staff there either do n't know what to do or just hang up . <p> Oliver GeeJune 21 2014 12:43PM <p> Please can you confirm that if Contactless cards are going to be issued for account holders migrating to " Williams and Glynn " : That account holders will be able to opt for a non-contactless card if they are not happy with using one due to various concerns over contactless-based card security ? <p> Oliver GeeJune 21 2014 12:44PM <p> Please confirm " Chip and Signature " cards will be available via special request for any customers whom do not want or can not use " Chip and PIN " cards for any reason ? I do not want to see customers having to justify why they need to have a " Chip and Signature " card issued ; it should be available to any account holder upon request . <p> Loopy LooJune 30 2014 1:59PM <p> I know I can enter my sort code to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W&amp;G ( it is ) but I rather like being a customer of RBS . Is there a list anywhere of RBS branches that are NOT being sold ? <p> ArthurJuly 01 2014 9:39AM <p> Williams &amp; Glyn 's is definitely the correct name . I had an account at the Reading branch in the 1970s/80s . I recall that queues were rare , as staff moved onto the tills as necessary to prevent queues forming . These days I rarely use a branch anyway . <p> C kieransJuly 09 2014 7:38AM <p> As I have not needed to use a branch for a few years I would still like to stay with RBS as I have not had any problems with the bank in the 38 years I 've been a customer but my concern is if the vote is Yes is September what would happen to my account in the future as Scotland would be a separate country . <p> Mr IqbalJuly 17 2014 11:32AM <p> Please look into updating some of the Branches . The Levenshulme ( Manchester ) Branch is old and tatty , has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened at any time . The front customer area is so small that we 're queuing up outside which beats the time latch purpose on the door 's . The cash machine is terribly outdated ! I love RBS but having sub-standard facilities does not do a family who hold 11 Accounts there any favours , when there are three alternative Banks . <p> jaspaAugust 04 2014 11:10PM <p> As yet another part of the group is being sold off , with no value being given to shareholders who suffered great losses in the banking crash , will shares in W&amp;G be given to RBS shareholders to compensate for further dilution of our holdings ? <p> Chris MarshallAugust 08 2014 10:20AM <p> It would have been nice to have been sent a letter to tell me I was being transferred to Williams &amp; Glyn rather than discovering when I phoned up customer services and was told to phone a different number as I will not be an RBS customer soon . Bit of a shock I can tell you ! <p> PJ SharpAugust 08 2014 10:44PM <p> After Scottish independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation or Scottish-based and thus at risk ? If the latter , my money is coming out .... fast ! <p> Mick ChapmanAugust 09 2014 2:16PM <p> I still have my original William &amp; Glyn 's cheque book wallet which is about 46 years old and still in perfect condition with an RBS cheque book in it , I must have known that Williams &amp; Glyn 's would be back one day , please put the " s " back where it belongs . <p> Ed DirbenAugust 22 2014 3:39PM <p> It is not possible to pay in cheques or cash at a Post Office for credit of my RBS current account . RBS are always boasting about their great customer service , but they are out of step with the other major banks because those banks all allow their customers to make deposits at a Post Office . This is very convenient and helpful after all the majority of people are not too far from a post office either at home or at work . Will the facility to make deposits at a Post Office be available with W @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the missing " ' s " - it 's gone for good , please get over it ! <p> Ed DirbenAugust 22 2014 3:51PM <p> @ Mick Chapman August 09 2014 2:16PM . If you can bear to part with it you should auction your W&amp;G cheque book wallet on eBay after the bank opens for business . Your original wallet may well be the last one left in the country and it could fetch a tidy sum , being no doubt of a superior quality to the wallets which are manufactured today ! <p> Ed DirbenAugust 22 2014 4:24PM <p> @ manoj abrol May 31 2014 4:03PM . I asked my branch about this and was told that contactless visa debit cards are now being issued as standard to replace customers ' existing non-contactless cards when they expire . I told them I did n't want to have to wait until my existing card expired and asked if I could have a contactless card now , and I received one within a few days . Hope this helps . <p> Gary RobertsonAugust 26 2014 4:22PM <p> Is this an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is this due to Scotland maybe getting Independence ? Worrying times . Any info would be gratefully accepted . <p> Ed DirbenAugust 28 2014 10:07AM <p> @ Gary Robertson . Banking is international and if Scotland goes independent and even if it loses the pound , W&amp;G will still be able to operate in the UK without any problem . The Republic of Ireland banking group , Allied Irish Banks , has operated a successful subsidiary bank in the UK for many years without any problems . The international banking giant HSBC swallowed up Midland Bank of the UK . In the same way the UK based banks own subsidiary banks in many countries , ranging all the way from the USA to countries in the developing world . In addition , the consortium which is going to launch W&amp;G consists of UK institutions and investors . Nothing at all to worry about . <p> Ed DirbenAugust 28 2014 10:11AM <p> The RBS Moderator seems to have disappeared from this thread . He/she has n't commented on here since June 2nd . <p> Eric MearsSeptember 01 2014 3:45PM <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though alas the chequebook wallet fell apart around thirty years ago . Have to say I was very impressed with customer service last week when I had been in a Lloyds branch with 5 teller positions but only 3 manned ( should one say personned these days ? ) and a queue of a dozen or more and then one of the cashiers closed up ! When I moved round to a nearby RBS branch there was only one person in the queue ahead of me but even so the ' customer enquiries assistant ' came out and offered to pay in the cheques I was holding . I mentioned the state of the Lloyds branch to her and she suggested I might like to contact the RBS business team to see if they wanted to take on my organisation 's account . To be continued ! <p> Eric MearsSeptember 01 2014 3:47PM <p> Continuation - mod : please try &amp; keep both together ! Alas , customer service took a nosedive at that point as the 0345 number she gave me was obviously for Scots customers only and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 0845 ( aka revenue sharing ! ) number . I have as it happens now found the W&amp;G 0345 business contact number and will probably be in touch soon . I 'm also somewhat annoyed that your page limits inputs to 1000 characters but does n't  bother telling one until after the full message has been typed . Even eBay manage to incorporate a character counter into their input boxes . Why cant you ? <p> IanOctober 02 2014 4:12PM <p> Please do n't embark upon marketing campaigns which focus on the acronym WAG ... <p> Marco Goetz October 26 2014 9:34PM <p> I 'm looking forward to the move . Ive been with ( RBS ) sins 's 2010 .. I hope the ( W&amp;G ) will have . The right staff to help its customers . In more ways then rbs can . I'e overdrafts &amp; loans &amp; credit cards ... Better staff more up-to-date Technology in its bank 's . Also to be able to offer card design features . To its customers . Like Barclays . And really good customer services on the phone .. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E H WillisNovember 09 2014 11:32PM <p> Will the Holt 's Farnborough Branch also become a Williams and Glyn bank or is it exempted ? <p> Victor HuttDecember 09 2014 12:15PM <p> I make regular international transfers . Will I have to set everything up again when my account is moved to the new bank <p> Charlie RussellJanuary 16 2015 1:17PM <p> I welcome the return of Williams and Glyn 's - I was originally with them before it being absorbed by RBS . However , I will probably die before it actually happens . Why is it taking so long ? <p> Ravi S TallamJanuary 28 2015 9:41PM <p> I have been a customer since 1997 , found the bank very friendly &amp; helpful , hope it will continue . A suggestion can you introduce customer 's photo on the debit &amp; credit cards would avoid fraud to a very grate extent . All the best for the change over . <p> RaMcNeillFebruary 25 2015 8:28PM <p> I am very happy to see the return of Williams and Gly , n Bank after 30 years . RBS has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hope the new bank would continue that service . Especially the pin number which I would like to retain . Otherwise , carry on ! RA <p> Billy GlynFebruary 25 2015 10:55PM <p> I started with Williams and Glyn 's Bank as a student , and will be happy to return as a getting-on-a-bit , but wow what a gruesome logo you have come up with ! <p> Jack FFebruary 26 2015 8:33AM <p> We currently have an agreement with the local Nat west branch ( through RBS ) to pay cheques/cash etc. into our RBS business account because there is no RBS within 50 miles here in Wales . Will this facility still be available when we are fully transferred to W &amp; G , as we know we are to be , because we have already had notification . Or as another comment mentioned will it be available through the Post office or another medium ? <p> Denis O'ConnorFebruary 27 2015 9:59PM <p> Your new senior directors hardly inspire confidence . . John Maltby was CEO at Kensington Mortgages - left them after two profit warnings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer charges going back to Maltby 's time in charge . Mervyn Davies was CEO and later a Board Director of Standard Chartered , who were fined $650 million by the US authorities , again going back to Davies ' time in charge . United Utilities were repeatedly fined by the regulator for poor water quality while Green was in charge . During his time on the Lloyds board , the bank was merrily misspelling PPI and interest rate hedging products . Green was also on the Board that approved the Lloyds takeover of Halifax/Bank of Scotland - a decision that led to Lloyds being bailed out by the UK government . Hardly a track record to inspire confidence in the WAG leadership ! ! ! . <p> AnthonyMarch 15 2015 4:06PM <p> Where are the branches going to be ? <p> j.r.townsMarch 22 2015 6:46PM <p> wheres the branch fo glenrothes , please&gt; <p> James WorsnipMay 29 2015 3:58PM <p> Is there a list of postcodes for the locations of each of the branches that will be divested ? <p> Colin HopkinsJune 16 2015 12:47PM <p> I am quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced into Williams &amp; Glyn . <p> Mike TaylorJuly 04 2015 11:49AM <p> I recently had to visit my local RBS branch for help with my account . The staff were extremely helpful . I hope when this change happens , the same level of service is maintained .

I will be pleased to see it back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems that people are being forced to change to this new bank and not given a choice this seems wrong . on a personal note I would like to know if I will keep my current bank account number and sort code and do I have an option to stay with the Royal Bank of Scotland if I choice not to go with the change over . <p> harry cheethamJuly 16 2015 12:12PM <p> H !

It still seems very unfair that we are being forced into this by Europe . <p> Tim H August 09 2015 9:35PM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans and overdrafts to their customers ' needs . It would be great to have that back again . The obviously computer scored " one size fits all " application form has had its day . The old Williams &amp; Glyn 's was much more flexible than any of its competitors and managed that with fewer staff . Fees were charged fairly with the agreement of customers . This recipe should appeal to customers again ( and perhaps the new venture capital owners too depending on what their return on capital requirements are ... ) . I would love to transfer to such a bank . <p> Steven HollandOctober 13 2015 12:46AM <p> I will not be arbitrarily moved to a bank I have not chosen . Happy to stay with RBS but if , due to living in England this is not possible I will chose a bank for myself . <p> Julie Gordon October 20 2015 5:48PM <p> Will current RBS customers be compensated when Williams &amp; Glyn 's take over ? <p> Thomas James RoyleNovember 02 2015 2:15PM <p> I am at the moment with RBS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over other than another name ie my current account with what advantages <p> steve petleyJuly 04 2016 5:36AM <p> will williams and glyns be giving existing rbs customer customers cash insentive to stay with them , the reason i ask is why stay when other banks are offering cash to change current accounts with them <p> B DicksonJuly 13 2016 3:01PM <p> I , like may other RBS account holders would really like to know when William &amp; Glyn 's will be taking over . As account holders I feel that we should be kept up-to-date on a month by month basis as communication is all important in any new venture . I personally will give this new bank a go , but I will also look at moving all my accounts if I feel that it does not meet the standards/services that I have come to expect from RBS <h> What 's your opinion <p> Please let us know what you think about this by leaving a commentRequired information is marked with an asterisk *
