@@97684308 @1884308/ <p> The Universal Charge and Discharge Curves are curves that allow the user to graphically determine the capacitor voltage or inductor current at a particular time after a circuit event , such as a switch closure , has occurred . The two curves are usually presented together on the same graph and the user will choose the correct curve to use . A typical set of curves used for capacitor circuit analysis is shown below . <p> The graph is referred to as universal since neither the X-axis or Y-axis has values specific to one circuit , but are rather calibrated from 0 to 1 on the amplitude ( Y ) axis and in terms of time constants on the time ( X ) axis . These calibrations allow the curve to be re-calibrated to match the parameters of any circuit being analyzed . <p> Procedure For Using The Universal Charge Curve <p> 1 . Determine if the circuit action will cause a charge or discharge . This will determine the curve to be used . 2 . Determine the time constant for the circuit 3 . Calibrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value by the time constant . 4 . Calibrate the Y ( amplitude ) axis by multiplying each grid line value by the maximum voltage ( current ) value . 6 . Find the time of interest on the X-axis , then draw a line vertically until it intersects the curve . 6 . Draw a line horizontally from the intersection to the Y-axis. 7 . Determine the voltage ( current ) value from the Y-axis . The value can be found by taking the nearest major division that the line is above and adding the number sub-division by which the line is above the major division time the value of a sub-division . <p> Value = Major div + ( sub-div * value/sub-div ) <p> Hint : The easiest way to determine the value of a minor division is to go to the first major division and divide that value by the number of sub-divisions . <p> ExampleCapacitor Circuit <p> Find the capacitor voltage 480 us after the switch is closed in the circuit below . <p> 1 . Closing the switch will cause the capacitor to charge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = 1k*0.2uF = 200 us 3 . Multiplying each X-axis grid line by the time constant ( 200 us ) yields : <p> 4 . Multiplying each Y-axis grid line by the maximum voltage ( 20V ) yields : <p> In a circuit containing an inductor the current will build and decay exponentially , just as the voltage did in a capacitor circuit . Therefore the charge/discharge curves will be used for determining the instantaneous current in an inductor circuit . <p> Determine the current in the circuit below 5 ms after the switch is thrown to the right . The inductor has a steady state current of 40 mA prior to the switch being thrown . <p> 1 . The current will decay after the switch is thrown so the disharge curve will be used . 2 .

@@97684435 @1884435/ <h> Tips to Relieve Stress <h> College stress is a normal part of life . Here are some tips to help keep it at a minimum . <p> GET ORGANIZED : Having to remember where something is , when you 're supposed to do it , or what someone said taxes your memory unnecessarily . So plan it , schedule it , file it , take notes on it and write it down . Save your memory for more creative things . <p> TAKE BREAKS : To maintain peak performance , you should take a two-minute break after every fifty minutes of work . Do n't mistake working hard for working good and work past the point of diminishing returns . When you 're fatigued , your effectiveness quickly declines . <p> REHEARSE : When you 're facing a situation that you know will be stressful for you , rehearse it . Either mentally or with a friend , anticipate what might occur and plan your response . Being prepared reduces stress . <p> DO IT NOW : Do your most difficult or most hated task at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress of dreading it all day . <p> Procrastination breeds stress . <p> KNOW YOUR LIMITS : Be realistic about what you can accomplish in a day or a week . Do n't expect yourself to be superman or woman . It 's better to do less and do it well than to do more poorly . <p> CHANGE YOUR ATTITUDE : Avoid stress by changing the way you look at things .

Here 's some advice on putting your best foot forward at NCC . <h> 1 . Go to New Student Orientation . <p> If you want to make a good start at Nassau , attending Orientation is a must ! You 'll learn about the College , tour the campus , meet other students , and go home with some good ideas on succeeding in school and enjoying yourself at the same time . <h> 2 . Get a campus map . <p> On a fairly large campus , it helps to have a good map to find your way around . If you do n't want to wait until Orientation to get a campus map , you can pick one up in the Information Center ( Tower ) , the Public Safety Office , or the Office of Student Activities ( College Center ) . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **35;1504;TOOLONG <h> 3 . Be smart about parking . <p> Leave at least 45 minutes to park and get to class . Also , pay attention to signs in campus parking fields . While most spaces are available for student use , some parking is restricted . If you're- traveling to Nassau by NICE bus , pick up a schedule from Public Safety , the Office of Student Activities ( College Center ) , and the Information Center ( Tower ) and become familiar with campus bus stops . You can also check the NICE schedule at LONG ... <h> 4 . Use your Daily Planner . <p> The Daily Planner , distributed at Orientation , is an essential publication .

Quizzes and tests will be upon you before long ; there 's no time to waste . <h> 7 . Get to know your professors . <p> Though college faculty have busy lives , most welcome the opportunity to get to know students in their classes . They are especially interested in students ' responses to material being studied in class . Do n't hesitate to speak with your professors , either after class or during their office hours . Developing positive relationships with professors is an important part of your college experience , <h> 8 . Use campus services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services , everything from help with writing and math skills to career counseling and financial aid assistance .

@@97684652 @1884652/ <p> Windows Script Host ( WSH ) is a scripting host for ActiveX Scripting Engines such as PerlScript . As a host , WSH enables you to use the scripting language from the command-line and from within the Windows desktop with the WSH features . <p> In order to execute a WSH-file , use one of two executable files depending on your needs : WScript.exe for Windows desktop files and CScript.exe is for command-line scripts . You can set the behavior and appearance of these executed scripts by running the executable without providing a file ; if so , WScript will display a properties page that you can modify , and CScript will show the available switches . At work , WSH enables you to use more than one scripting engine in the same file , include typelibraries , and run more than a single job from one file to name a few . <p> Installing ActivePerl on Windows registers the . pls extension for use with the Windows Scripting Host . <p> Implemented as an object-model , WSH provides a simple interface for its tasks . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for separating the elements . Let 's look at a simple WSH file that prints " Hello World ! " . <p> The XML Job-elements encloses the I 'd of the Job that is run , and the script elements define PerlScript as the script language to use . You will experience different results depending if you execute this from the command-line or from the windows desktop . The first instance will print text to the screen , but the Windows desktop will pop up a messagebox with " Hello World ! " Next , let 's look at what the WScript object has to offer . <p> The WScript object is a built-in object ; therefore , you do not need to create a specific instance of it within your WSH . On the contrary , the object in place is used to create instances of most other objects exposed through the WSH programming interface . <p> The CreateObject method will create an instance of a given object . In the following example , we 'll see how an ADO Connection object is easily created within WSH . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parameter in the call to CreateObject . This parameter contains a string which defines a prefix that you specify . By doing so , the object 's outgoing interface is connected and any time an event is fired from the object , you can intercept it within the WSH file . For example , in the ADO connection object , there are a number of events . Sparing the details , WillConnect is called before a connection starts , and Connectcomplete is called after a connection has been started . They can be easily intercepted within the WSH file . <p> For the same result as above , you can use the ConnectObject-method whose syntax is **33;1601;TOOLONG , Prefix ) ; . The method **37;1636;TOOLONG ; will disconnect its event handling provided that the object is connected . Some other methods are as follows : $Wscript-&gt;Echo ( 1 , 2 , 3 , n ) ; Print text to the standard output defined by WSH . Separating the arguments cause only a space to separate the items in a desktop environment and a newline to separate the items in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; <p> Retrieves an Automation object from a file or an object specified by the strProgID parameter . <p> **32;1708;TOOLONG ; <p> Quit and process and optionally provide an integer which represents an error code . <p> **36;1742;TOOLONG ; <p> Places the script process into an inactive state for the number of milliseconds specified and then continues execution . <p> And its properties are : <p> $WScript-&gt;Application ; <p> Provides the IDispatch interface on the WScript object <p> $WScript-&gt;Arguments ; <p> Returns a pointer to the WshArguments collection or identifies arguments for the shortcut to the collection . <p> $WScript-&gt;Fullname ; <p> Returns a string containing the full path to the host executable file or shortcut object . <p> $WScript-&gt;Name ; <p> Returns a string containing the friendly name of the WScript object . <p> $WScript-&gt;Path ; <p> Provides a string containing the name of the directory where WScript.exe or CScript.exe resides . <p> An interesting method of the WshShell object is the ability to activate an application window and putting it in focus . This is done by calling AppActivate either with the title in the title bar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task I 'd as a parameter . <p> The WindowStyle can be an integer between 0 through 10 , and WaitOnReturn is a boolean value or 1 ( TRUE ) or 0 ( FALSE ) . FALSE is the default value it means that an immeditate return to script execution contrary to waiting for the process to end is preferable . It also returns an error code of zero while TRUE returns any error code generated by the active application . <p> In addition , you can create shortcuts . Either you create a dekstop shortcut or a URL shortcul . The method call **26;1780;TOOLONG returns an object reference to a WshShortcut-object . Keep in mind that a dekstop shortcut has tbe extension . lnk and an URL shortcul has the file extension . url . In the latter case , a WshURLShortcut object is returned . <p> With the WshShortcut-object , one method exists , so it is mainly properties regarding the shortcut that you need to set . The Description-property contains a string describing the shortcut , Fullname returns the full path to the host executable , Hotkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for shortcuts on the Windows dekstop or windows startmenu , IconLocation is a property that you set to " Path , index " to provide the Icon location of the shortcut . In addition , use the TargetPath-property to set the path to the executable file pointed to by the shortcut , WindowStyle can be set to either 1 , 3 , or 7 for the shortcut object , and WorkingDirectory defines the directory in which the shortcut should start . If you are shortcutting a URL , you have only the Fullname and TargetPath properties where the latter one is a URL . All shortcut objects are final when you call the Save method . <p> The WshShell object provides functionality for working with the registry . The three methods for this are : RegRead , RegWrite , and RegDelete . Simply provide either method with a string such as the short form HKCUScriptEngineVal or longer variant **31;1808;TOOLONG . Notice that a key is returned if the last character is a backslash , and a value is returned if no backslash is at the end . The RegRead method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> REGDWORD <p> REGBINARY <p> REGMULTISZ <p> RegWrite requires a few extra parameters : <p> **27;1841;TOOLONG , Value , Type ) ; <p> The name is a fully qualified string such as HKCUScriptEngineVal where the same rules apply for key and value as previously mentioned . The Type-parameter is optional , but if used , it must be one of the following data types : <p> User and password are two parameters with given meaning . Localname and Remotename are the names of the printer resource . Set UpdateProfile to TRUE for storing this mapping in the user profile . Next , **29;1870;TOOLONG adds a printer just as you would add one using the control panel . On Windows NT/2000 the only parameter you need to call this method with is the path to the printer while windows 9x requires you to specify the driver to use , and optionally specify which port to which it is connected . In the last event , the syntax is : <p> Like Windows Script Components , the Windows Script Host has a set of XML elements that can be deployed . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to the section about Windows Script Components . <p> The Job element is used to define the beginning and the end of the components . It encapsulates all other tags .

@@97684662 @1884662/ <p> In order to install a distribution using Module : : Build , users must have Module : : Build available on their systems . There are two ways to do this . The first way is to include Module : : Build in the configurerequires metadata field . This field is supported by recent versions CPAN and CPANPLUS and is a standard feature in the Perl core as of Perl 5.10.1 . Module : : Build now adds itself to configurerequires by default . <p> The second way supports older Perls that have not upgraded CPAN or CPANPLUS and involves bundling an entire copy of Module : : Build into the distribution 's inc/ directory . This is the same approach used by the Module : : Install manpage , a modern wrapper around ExtUtils : : MakeMaker for Makefile.PL based distributions . <p> The " trick " to making this work for Module : : Build is making sure the highest version Module : : Build is used , whether this is in inc/ or already installed on the user 's system . This ensures that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixes . This is done using the new the inc : : latest manpage module . <p> A " normal " Build.PL looks like this ( with only the minimum required fields ) : <p> The same approach works for other configuration dependencies -- modules that must be available for Build.PL to run . All other dependencies can be specified as usual in the Build.PL and CPAN or CPANPLUS will install them after Build.PL finishes . <p> The inc : : latest module creates bundled directories based on the packlist file of an installed distribution . Even though inc : : latest takes module name arguments , it is better to think of it as bundling and making available entire distributions . When a module is loaded through inc : : latest , it looks in all bundled distributions in inc/ for a newer module than can be found in the existing @INC array . <p> Thus , the module-name provided should usually be the " top-level " module name of a distribution , though this is not strictly required . For example , the Module : : Build manpage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packlists , allowing users to do things like this : <p> use inc : : latest ' Devel : : AssertOS : : Unix ' ; <p> even though Devel : : AssertOS : : Unix is contained within the Devel-CheckOS distribution . <p> At the current time , packlists are required . Thus , bundling dual-core modules , including Module : : Build , may require a ' forced install ' over versions in the latest version of perl in order to create the necessary packlist for bundling . This limitation will hopefully be addressed in a future version of Module : : Build . <p> Before bundling a distribution you must ensure that all prerequisites are also bundled and load in the correct order . For Module : : Build itself , this should not be necessary , but it is necessary for any other distribution . ( A future release of Module : : Build will hopefully address this deficiency . ) <p> For example , if you need Wibble , but Wibble depends on Wobble , your Build.PL might look like this : <p> use inc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : latest ' Wibble ' ; use inc : : latest ' Module : : Build ' ;

Performance will vary depending on the environment in which they are run ( hardware , memory , web server configuration , etc . ) . It is also important to note that these examples are with a single client accessing your web server . For more extensive performance testing we have provided links to some free performance testing software at the end of this section . <p> This example compares the execution times of loading 25 pages . Each page requires a connection to a database via the DBI module , however , no database access other than the connection is executed . This shows the overhead of making the database connection in regular CGI , and how persisting those connections with PerlEx : : DBI can improve overall performance of your website . To run this example , you will need to have DBI and DBD : : ODBC installed . You can install these modules by running " ppm install DBI DBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Web Service Client benchmark uses SOAP : : Lite to access a SOAP server running under PerlEx .
