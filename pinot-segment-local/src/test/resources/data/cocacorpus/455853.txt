But if you stick with it , you 'll notice a gradual loosening , and eventually , seemingly impossible poses will become possible .

Increases your blood flow Yoga gets your blood moving . More specifically , the relaxation exercises you learn in yoga can help your circulation , especially in your hands and feet . Yoga also gets more oxygen to your cells , which function better as a result . Twisting poses are thought to wring out venous blood from internal organs and allow oxygenated blood to flow in once the twist is released . Inverted poses , such as Headstand , Handstand , and Shoulderstand , encourage venous blood from the legs and pelvis to flow back to the heart , where it can be pumped to the lungs to be freshly oxygenated . <p> 4 . Ups your heart rate When you regularly get your heart rate into the aerobic range , you lower your risk of heart attack and can relieve depression . While not all yoga is aerobic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , it can boost your heart rate into the aerobic range . <p> 5 . Makes you happier Feeling sad ? Sit in Lotus . Better yet , rise up into a backbend or King Dancer Pose .

Essential summer fabrics include cotton , chambray , rayon , and poly-blends . <h> Cotton <p> With its soft , fluffy fibers , cotton is the ideal fabric for the summer .

Avoid heavy accessories , lined clothing , and dark colors to ensure that your summer is light and fun . <p> Accessories , especially large beads , studs , and metal embellishments , weigh down your clothes and trap the heat inside .
