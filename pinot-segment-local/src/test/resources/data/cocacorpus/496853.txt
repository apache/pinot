Richard Bradley reports . <p> Teagles C12 Tomahawk is aimed at large livestock farmers and contractors . <p> Teagles 75 year history has predominately been made up of equipment for livestock farms , and its latest development is set to be the firms most sophisticated machine to date . <p> Sales director , Tom Teagle , says : " Livestock farmers are becoming ever more technical and discerning when it comes to feeding their animals , and while our current range of Tomahawk dual-chop bedders and mills provide the ability to bed loose-pens and chop straw for feeding , they are not suited to accurately processing large volumes of straw for inclusion in total mixed rations ( TMR ) . " <p> Aiming to fill this gap , Teagles latest Tomahawk C12 Calibrator has been driven by demand from the UK , Germany , France and Eastern Europe , for a high-output machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Teagles UK sales manager , Jim Squires , says : " While other machines are available , either they do not feature a sieve-like system as fitted on our machine or they are produced in North-America , and require costly adaptions to be homologated for our roads . " <p> Mr Squires adds many farmers use mixer wagons to process straw , which takes a long time to chop most of the straw , does not provide consistency in chop lengths and can cause excessive wear to the mixers knives and tub . <p> Following four years of development by a team of 15 engineers , the latest prototype Tomahawk C12 machines have undergone 18 months of on-farm testing . <p> Throughout this time , Teagle says it has worked with Three Counties Feeds nutritionist Andy Hawken , to ensure the machine is providing value to the end-user . <p> Mr Hawken says : " Cows require structural fibre in their diet to give rumen-fill , and accurately chopped straw is a quality source of this . To ensure cows do not sort and pick straw from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any other fibre in the feed , such as silage . " <p> He adds any sorted material is a waste of costly feed , and is also likely to cause a reduction in yields , animal health , or both . <p> To find out more about the Tomahawk C12 Calibrator , we headed to a Cornish dairy farm , where the firm has been testing machines for the past 18-months . <h> Farmer 's view <p> In the past 18-months Cornish farmer Gavin Rodda , has been feeding chopped straw from a Calibrator to his 600 strong herd of young stock , dry and milking cows . Previously , Mr Rodda was chopping straw with his TMR mixer wagon , which has recently been re-lined due to excessive tub wear . <p> Mr Rodda says : " Previously we would clean feed troughs out daily , and infront of dry-cows 90 per cent of wastage would be long straw . Since chopping with Teagles machine , cows sort feed less meaning we have less waste . <p> " We have seen definite improvements in herd health across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had big uplifts in butterfat , which has provided increased milk price . After testing the machine , I will use a contractor or look to find a group of local farmers to join together and share a machine as we would never go back to trying to process our straw with a mixer wagon . " <h> Tub and Chopping rotor <p> Where Teagles traditional Tomahawk mills are rear-loaded , the Calibrators lozenge-shaped tub can be loaded with round or square bales from the top . The firm says this allows larger volumes of straw to be loaded in a shorter space of time . <p> Rubber damping mounts are used to reduce machine vibration from the chopping rotor . <p> At the heart of the Calibrator is a rotating chopping mill , which uses 56 swinging hammer-flails to grab hold of the bale and pull in down through its sieve cutting section . <p> Each flail is made of boron steel and features a tungsten-carbide facing to increase service life . Thanks to two sets of mounting holes , the fails can be turned three-times to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000rpm , each flail has a tip speed of about 73 metres per second ( 160mph ) , which the firm says provides an aggressive cutting action against the two sieves . <p> Removing two bolts allows the two sieves to slide out on rails for convenient removal . <p> Sieves can be easily removed and changed from ground level ; the firm offers different sieve hole sizes to chop straw to lengths 20-100mm . <p> Teagle says as the sieves are split into two halves , fitting a larger diameter sieve on the second-half of chopping area reduces the machines power requirement and also increases throughput . <p> Driving the rotor requires a 1,000-speed pto from a 120-200hp tractor . Teagle says typical uses will find 160hp is sufficient , with up to 200hp to increase the machines output . <p> Ensuring the rotor is constantly fed with straw , the tub rotates via a hydraulic motor and chain drive system , with rotation speed set through the wireless control box . Thanks to a sensor on the chopping rotor , an automatic system can be used to slow/stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preventing excessive load on the tractor . <p> Allowing the chopped straw to be loaded into trailers up to 4.2m high , the Calibrator features a conveyor , which folds for transport . Drive to the tub and conveyors motors is provided by an on-board 150-litre hydraulic system which takes its drive from the tractors pto , and features an oil cooler with an electric reversing fan . <p> Folding and unfolding the conveyor requires two double-acting spools from the tractor . <h> Maintenance and control <p> Wireless connectivity means the Calibrators control box can be fitted in the loading machine , removing the need for an operator to stay in the tractor . <p> Bluetooth control box appears straightforward to use . <p> The box allows the operator to control tub rotation speed , stop or reverse the tub , and if required , set the sensitivity of the automatic tub control system , or disengage it altogether . <p> In case of emergency , a kill-switch is fitted to the machine to stop tub and conveyor drive . <p> For ease of maintenance , flails can be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greasing points are banked together in two locations .

@@106567181 @1967181/ <h> Sponsored Article <p> Maize Matters is a sponsored series brought to you in association with KWS . <p> Most experts agree a starter fertiliser will help to maximise the yield and quality potential of their maize , but there are a number of options available and John Burgess of KWS has strong views on the subject . <p> " It had been standard practice to apply a di-ammonium phosphate ( DAP ) starter fertiliser at drilling until a couple of years ago , when we saw a move towards a cheaper system of using the lower rates associated with branded micro-granular products , like Umostart and Optimaize , " says Mr Burgess . <p> " This was mainly due to DAP price volatility and the drive to cut ration costs . " However , the original system was popular because it worked very well and there has been a return to the practice . Mono-ammonium phosphate ( MAP ) fertiliser has also been used in the past . It may be slightly cheaper , but it is less effective than DAP and has therefore remained out of favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 125kg/ha and placed about 5cm below the seed , he says , although a lower rate can be used in certain circumstances . " A reduced DAP rate of 90-100kg/ ha can be used for late-season drilling when the soil temperature has risen to 10-12degC . Otherwise , there is a risk plants may suffer scorching . <p> The application rate can also be trimmed back on farms which adopt a 5 per cent cut in seed rates , in order to manipulate plant populations . It should be applied down the spout and placed about 5cm under the seed . <p> " Nitrogen is obviously important , but phosphorus is also essential for producing a healthy crop , especially at three to six leaves when the developing root is nourishing the young plant and the nodes and leaves enter a period of rapid growth . <p> At this stage , plant population density is being fixed and any deficiency will cause the leaves to turn purple , with a negative effect on yield , " says Mr Burgess . Procams Guy Peters warns against the dangers of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money to apply phosphate to any soil with an index of more than three and this is also relevant on farms which drill later in the season as uptake will be greater in warmer temperatures , " he says . " This type of opportunity highlights the benefits of soil testing before drilling . <h> Phosphate run-off <p> " Environmentalists have expressed their concerns over the potential damage caused by phosphate runoff , especially on fields which are adjacent to water courses . We have all heard of nitrate vulnerable zones and it is possible that phosphate vulnerable zones might be introduced in the future , especially if we do not act now to prevent the risk of pollution . " <p> When it comes to varietal choice , Mr Peters favours earlies . " The overall aim should be for crops to reach 33-35 per cent dry matter by the end of September , " he says . " This will help to ensure a successful harvest and limit the risk of soil damage . <p> Therefore , it is best to push for the earliest variety which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions permit . A long period of growth will encourage the crop to accumulate dry matter and lay down starch . " Another tip is to prioritise high dry matter figures , he adds . <p> " When choosing a variety , dry matter yield should take priority over projected fresh weight tonnage , because maize silage with a high water content is more likely to over-ferment and become acidic , which is not good for ruminants . " <p> " The use of film on maize should be considered , if the dry matter targets are unlikely to be achieved due to the farm situation , or where an early harvest is a priority , in order to avoid soil run off and to establish an early crop of grass or cereals . " <p> Brendan Paul , of Agrii , stresses that the level of maize silage inclusion should be taken into account , when selecting a variety . " Dairy farmers who use maize silage at an inclusion rate of more than 50 per cent should pick slightly later-maturing varieties which will produce bulk yields and relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of acidosis . It may be necessary to add straw to the diet to create a better environment in the rumen . I can not see the point of growing a high starch variety and then having to add a low feed value ingredient like straw , as a balancer .

Sales of the thiacloprid-based seed treatment , Sonido , continue to rise , as it is currently the only chemical treatment left available to maize growers . <p> He recommends that a separating crop is sown , between maize following grass , because the wireworm thrives in established grassland . Another rotational solution is to grow wholecrop cereals , such as rye or winter barley

Ewan Pate reports . <p> Rosemary Champion <p> There can be few smallholders as enthusiastic as Rosemary Champion . Her website , the Accidental Smallholder , attracts about 700 regular visitors . <p> Some contribute through forums , others are quite happy to read the diary entries and blogs outlining the trials and triumphs of running a small farming enterprise . <p> A major feature is Rosemarys willingness to share her experiences in a self-deprecating way , while at the same time offering useful tips to beginners to the smallholding way of life . <p> It is no coincidence the website is professional in appearance and easy to access , as her husband Dan is a website developer . <p> The couple run a five-hectare ( 12-acre ) holding at Dalmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the railway and the sand dunes between them and the North Sea . They also rent a further 4ha ( 10 acres ) of grazing further inland . <p> The Accidental Smallholder moniker reflects the Champions own journey into running a smallholding . <p> Rosemary has a degree in agriculture from Edinburgh University , but her early career was with Tesco , then in various posts in local government . <p> By 2000 , they had bought a house near Alloa , central Scotland . It just happened to have some land with it and the seeds of a new lifestyle were sown . <p> She says : " By 2007 , I had really become a full-time smallholder and had started the website . I also worked for the Royal Highland Educational Trust RHET in Forth Valley for a year , before we came up to Angus in 2010 . " <h> Visits <p> The interest in educating children about food and farming persists with regular RHET and local school group visits to Dalmore . <p> " I think RHET is a terrific organisation . In many ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is close at hand and children can see a whole range of livestock within easy walking distance . " <p> The website is entirely a labour of love and is only supported to a limited extent by advertising . Rosemary says the purpose is to help people avoid mistakes . <p> But this is not the full extent of Rosemarys espousal of the smallholding cause . She was very much the prime mover behind the first Smallholder Festival held at Forfar mart six years ago . <p> Now relocated to Lawrie and Symingtons Lanark mart , it has become an annual event run by Smallholder Events ( Scotland ) , but is enthusiast-driven . <p> It is to be held on September 23 this year . As well as a range of stands and attractions , the festival offers a great chance to see some of the rarer breeds of livestock and poultry in show classes . <p> A companion conference is now held in winter , with this years event held recently in Perth . <p> Rosemary says : " We have chosen the name Smallholding Scotland and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We want to be the body Scottish Government comes to when it wants to discuss smallholder topics . No-one else quite fills the role , but we do want to work with other organisations where possible . <p> " In some ways , crofting and smallholding are not that different , and we do not want to be in competition with , for example , the Scottish Crofting Federation . " <p> As an example of the sort of issues Smallholding Scotland will tackle , Rosemary cites the Small Farms Grant Scheme . It is a capital grant scheme offering up to 40 per cent support and , in some ways , is similar to the crofting scheme . <p> For lowland smallholders , however , there is a 30,000/annum income cap which is not replicated in the crofting scheme . <p> Rosemary thinks this stifles demand and puts up a barrier to those with ambition to take their businesses further . <p> There were further shortcomings in the Small Farm Grants Scheme , with only 50 per cent of applications being approved , despite a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not worth the expense of going to a consultant when the chances of success are so poor .

The holding , which is amid the belt of links golf courses which makes the Carnoustie area famous , is therefore better suited to livestock . <p> The couple rent a further 4ha ( 10 acres ) , located four miles inland , to give them enough grazing for cattle and sheep , but the main daily income comes from the 100 Rhode Rock laying hens . <p> A constant flow of locals arriving at the back door of the house keeps cashflow regular at little expense in terms of marketing . <p> On a nice spring day , the hens and Nugget , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors to comply with bird flu regulations . <p> Rosemary says : " We cull after about two years and buy-in about 40 pullets every April .

It works because nothing is wasted , but we do not have the benefits of scale . " <p> As an example of the waste nothing philosophy , every aspect of the 15-strong flock of Ryeland ewes is commercialised .

@@106567193 @1967193/ 119573 @qwx979573 <h> Utilising new technology to reduce costs of production <p> Ahead of the CropTec event on November 19-20 , Farmers Guardian hosted a roundtable to discuss how technology can reduce costs of production on-farm . <p> With price volatility constantly looming over the industry and low current prices , reducing costs of production is as topical as ever . <p> Although many growers across the country have readily adopted new technology , technology on-farm is not always welcomed , nor used to its full potential to cut costs of production . <p> Setting the scene for the discussion , BASF head of business development and sustainability , Rob Gladwin said : " Economics dominate everything , and there is already lots of talk about cost cutting in the industry . <p> " But I think it is critical at CropTec we cast some doubt on the hawks in the industry who say cost cutting is the way to go . It is an easy way to go and appeals to a farmers nature . " <p> In response to this point , those around the table discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using technology to apply variably rather than as a blanket treatment , costs could be cut while still supplying the inputs crops required . <h> Variability <p> Although growers are increasingly introducing variable rate application technology on to their farms , the general feeling around the table was they were reluctant to completely trust the recommendations made by variable rate technology . <p> Yara company agronomist Ian Matts said trying to encourage growers to cut back on nitrogen applications , for example , was a harder message to deliver on-farm than advising of a need to increase nitrogen application rates . <p> He said : " Nitrogen is one of the single largest costs in arable cropping and also one of the most cost effective typically increasing yield by 50 per cent , providing we are using it at an optimum rate and timing , and focusing on the right source . <p> " We have seen in the last two years of nitrogen-based response trials the potential negative impact of farming by averages . Over the last two years the average optimum over different sites and soil types has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The average has masked some big variations within that , from about 100-300kg of N/ha . <p> " By applying that average you are going to be over-applying in places , wasting input costs and possibly causing a detrimental environmental impact without realising the yield from it , and vice versa you wo n't get the optimum yields when under-applying . <p> " The trials show the importance of a field specific approach and that is one of our messages at CropTec and one of the reasons we will be focusing on some of the tools Yara have to offer which focus on a tailored approach rather than applying blanket averages . <p> " Something important we have seen in oilseed rape in particular over the last decade of trials is the close correlation between the amount of nitrogen being taken up by the plant in the spring , and the optimum rate of nitrogen the crop requires . Our tools take the decision away from the farmer , but are based on robust data not on a whim . " <p> Agrovista technical manager and agronomist Mark Hemmant agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates and apply variably was a difficult message but an important one . <p> To which Mr Matts added : " Yes , it is a very important one . For 10 years that correlation has clearly shown the link , but it is just having the confidence to make that decision to use the recommendation . <p> " Our smartphone apps help to show the decision is based on science and what is right for the crop . " <h> Application <p> Moving on from fertiliser application to application of crop protection products , Mr Hemmant said Agrovista would be sharing its recent findings from trials looking at optimum spray application , at CropTec . <p> The company has been looking at different nozzles , water volumes and boom heights for applying herbicides and fungicides . <p> Mr Hemmant said : " For a small cost application can have a big impact on product performance which is important because we are struggling , whether it is with black-grass or disease control . <p> " We do not want to take the chemical we have got away because we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing , so application can make a big impact we are seeing one-tonne/ha yield difference just from application and a big difference in black-grass control . " <p> Mr Hemmant said changing approaches to spray application was an easier message to share with growers because it could be portrayed visually . He had noticed growers increasingly were prepared to change their methods , he said . <h> Black-grass <p> Delving deeper into this point , the discussion moved to how the challenge of black-grass had forced farmers to change their control methods , adopting new or sometimes older approaches or technology . <p> Head of cereals at Syngenta North Europe Robert Hiles noted the introduction of winter barley into the rotation as a tool against black-grass , while Mr Hemmant highlighted the resurgence in use of Avadex ( tri-allate ) . <p> Mr Hiles said : " If 10 years ago somebody had suggested you would be using winter barley for black-grass control nobody would have believed you . But hybrid barley has clearly demonstrated it has a place as a black-grass tool . <p> " Its flag leaf is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black-grass , and we have seen a 91 per cent reduction of seed return to the soil compared to wheat when treated with a pre- and post-emergence herbicide . " <p> Improved technology meant it was a lot easier and quicker to bring a variety to the market , enabling breeders to respond to grower challenges faster , he said . <p> Mr Hiles added it was important to use varieties to help increase yield and help meet challenges such as black-grass , disease control and OSR establishment . <p> Lisa Harlow , of Adama Agricultural Solutions UK ( previously MAUK ) , said it was important black-grass was managed with an integrated approach . <p> She added : " Managing black-grass requires a fully integrated approach which uses all of the available tools , including rotation , cultivation practices , sowing dates , application technology , chemistry and most importantly a willingness to think differently . <p> " While the costs associated with managing black-grass are increasing , it is important these are considered in context with the rotation and not necessarily the individual crop . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage growers to make crop decisions based on the current season . <p> Mr Hemmant said : " You can not plan to cut costs if you are experiencing a black-grass problem , you have no option but to go down the full belt and braces route . " <p> Mr Matts added : " It is rare something producing yield does not pay for itself . And when prices are low it is even more important it pays for itself . " <p> Commenting on the role of a distributor , Mr Hemmant said : " In a way we sell insurance ; we sell herbicides and fungicides to protect against a possibility . All farmers attitude to risk is different but it is important to make the best decision at the time . " <h> Versatility <p> However , basing machinery purchases on the current season was not recommended , suggested Vaderstad UK managing director Michael Alsop . <p> Recent developments to the Vaderstad product range have had one main focus versatility he said . <p> " When you are buying machinery you should be buying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A range of removable add-ons was part of the new machinery portfolio at Vaderstad and allowed the user to change the implements to suit their system or field . <p> " This offers more choice and versatility to the grower so they can make more use of what machines they already have . Quality , flexibility and value is what a farmer should invest in , " said Mr Alsop . <p> One example of the way Vaderstad was developing its machines for improved flexibility and efficiency was the BioDrill , which could be added to a standard drill to combine drilling the crop and a cover crop in the same pass . The drilling and physical destruction of cover crops would be a key focus for V Vaderstad at CropTec , added Mr Alsop . <p> Although the idea of cover crops was often talked about , they were still largely an area of unknown , said Velcourt regional farms manager Nick Shorter . <p> Discussions also extended to companion crops in oilseed rape . Mr Hemmant explained how three to four years worth of Agrovista trials had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the use of companion crops was still being worked on , he said . <h> Knowledge transfer <p> As the roundtable drew to a close , the importance of knowledge transfer was discussed . Mr Shorter said it was vital to ensure growers understood all of the knowledge being delivered was proven . <p> He said : " A crucial point in exposure of the reasearch and development ( R&amp;D ) work we do is ensuring what we are delivering to our clients is independent and crucially , actually works . " <p> Ms Harlow said Adama invests heavily in an integrated communications programme , combining various methods of interaction , to ensure field trial results were communicated with its customers effectively . <p> She added : " Underpinning this is the opportunity to tour our trial demonstrations during the season to see first-hand results from any refined agronomic practices , along with the chance to talk over the issues with our specialists . " <p> It was agreed when talking to growers about new technology or results from R&amp;D , growers should understand the information was sourced from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proving to be brilliant , it did need somebody to ground it , said Mr Hemmant <p> In response Mr Hiles concluded : " Data is key but how you interpret it is critical . " <p> Mr Gladwin felt expertise was needed to understand technology and rather than try to understand it all , growers should ask for experts help . If you were not trained in agronomy you would use an agronomists expertise , and likewise a technology expert should be hired to interpret data and help reduce costs of production , he said . <h> Understanding costs of production <p> In order to cut production costs by utilising technology on-farm , it was important to understand costs of production , and what to do with the information , said Velcourt regional farms manager , Nick Shorter . <p> Cost of production was something Velcourt had focused on a lot over the years , he said . " Its crucial as a farmer you know what your cost of production is and why it is important and once you have got that information to know what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed with the data , Mr Shorter recommended putting together a business strategy or mechanism of applying that figure to how you use that technology and how you grow crops . <p> Explaining how Velcourt used cost of production data to aid its business , Mr Shorter added : " We compile cost of production data across all of our farms ; and across 80 different sites . Its soil specific and we use that to benchmark all of our farming businesses to see exactly where we are spending and why we are spending . " <p> Briefing Media group agricultural editor Emma Penny asked how many farmers knew their average cost of production ? <p> Mr Shorter replied : " Very few , to the fine detail , but it depends how you look at it . Most people will know what they spend per hectare .

Mr Jones says : " The silage area had 100 units/ac of urea applied earlier in the season and while covers are not as high as I would like , I would sooner go for quality than quantity than risk being put back with weeks of rain . " <p> A contractor will be used to pick up mown grass with an aim of having it clamped between 36-48 hours after mowing . <h> Future growth performance needs careful management <p> THERE is still a large variation in grass growth rates nationwide , with a 56.2 kg DM/ha difference being noted this week across a number of beef and sheep units in the south of the country . Some farms have now achieved Magic Day , whereby grass growth equals demand by the herd or flock on the grazing platform . <p> Bill Reilly , AHDB grass and forage scientific officer , says : " Growth is beginning to surpass requirements and needs careful management to make sure future performance is not limited . Making sure the sward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Utilisation is a measure of the proportion of grass consumed versus what is allocated , and grazers should be targeting 85 per cent utilisation of grazed grass . Given the current rate of grass growth , some producers may decide to increase the rate of movement in a rotation . <p> Mr Reilly says : " Leaving excessive residuals after early grazings will limit the future performance . For beef , the target entry should be 2,500-3,000 kg DM/ha ( 8-10cm ) with a residual of 1,500 kg DM/ha ( 3-4cm ) . In simple terms , put them in when swards are at ankle height and take them out when they are at toe height . Of course , this will be subject to ground conditions , which should be continuously monitored . <p> " Cutting to control paddocks that have gone beyond the ideal height for grazing ( &gt;3,000 kg DM/ha ) , or resetting the sward , is common practice in other parts of the world . Paddocks should not be ignored and just left to grow . It is important that producers focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting value for money from the contractor by producing a bulky , stemmy crop . " <p> Regular monitoring of silage swards is just as important . The digestibility or D value of silage is largely influenced by the growth stage at which the grass is cut and ensiled . Like residual grazing heights , cutting height will also influence sward regrowth . By raising the cutting height , grass plants are not forced to utilise energy reserves in order to produce a new leaf . This also reduces the interval between silage cuts or subsequent grazings . <p> Mr Reilly says : " Unfortunately , some producers still see topping as an effective way of controlling sward growth . Recent research suggests that a cow can achieve the ideal residual grazing height of 3cm , whereas a topper can only ever cut to a height of 3.7cm . Allocating grazing areas and allowing for optimal utilisation means the need for sward control by mechanical means is reduced .

Cab layout could not be simpler either , with a high degree of predictability as to what all the controls do . The dash is clear and concise using a mixture of analogue dials , including one for the load indicator , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and service intervals . <p> Joystick control is pretty self explanatory incorporating proportional roller switches for boom extension and third service . However , it is positioned quite close to the cabs right-hand cladding which means your knuckles can occasionally get bashed . <p> Like the Merlo , the Dieci also requires a consent switch to be pressed on the joystick for functions to work . For the most part , you can do this almost without thinking , only really noticing it when reversing and looking over your right shoulder and the switch gets harder to hold as your arm is stretched . Instead of a switch , a sensor which detects hand heat can be specified . <p> The interior looks well put together and its light grey cladding gives a good sense of airiness , just as well too , because the high mounted position of the boom does feel imposing . Cab space , particularly around the shoulders , is also reduced by the use of a right hand mid-mounted pillar , something which none of the other machines have . <p> Between the pillar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromised and easily the worst out of the four machines . <h> Powertrain <p> With a top speed of 30kph , the 25.6 uses a single stage hydrostatic transmission with a twin speed function which automatically switches from a high torque mode to a high speed mode . Conveniently , this means no manual range changes are required , with the transmission adapting to the changing conditions without operator intervention it is an increase in transmission oil pressure , about 180bar , which triggers the change up to the high speed mode . <p> It works well too and is a very jump on and drive system . The transmission does , however , require a few revs to get going , but the payoff is decent control of transmission at low speed . <p> If more speed selection accuracy is required , it does come with a separate inching pedal . <p> On the downside , the transmission does have a tendency to run on after you have taken your foot off the accelerator pedal , unlike the other three machines which do eventually come to a standstill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> To keep up traction , each axle employs limited slip differentials which conveniently do a good job of shifting power to the wheels with the most traction , rather than having to remember to engage a differential lock , which is often too late by the time you realise you need it . <h> Hydraulics and handling <p> At the heart of the 25.6s hydraulic system is an 80l/min pump . Compared to the other machines tested it does need a few revs to make it really dance . However , thanks to the joystick being mounted directly on top of the valve chest , feel of hydraulics and response is good . <p> Like the JCB , there is also the option of a constant pump system , useful for powered equipment such as bedding dispensers and feeder buckets . As standard it does have the ability to hold its revs via a hand throttle controlled by a rocker switch . <p> Upfront , you will find Diecis own headstock ; however , the firm will fit any type you desire including Manitou , pin and cone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractor and loader ) .

" <p> Richard Sibley of West Ridge Veterinary Practice told the symposium he was one of the few people who make money from bovine TB , leading a team of 14 which mostly dealt with cattle in the South West TB hotspot area . <p> He said while his practice tested thousands of cattle each year , he was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a test which was part of the plan , adding a test should determine the difference between an animal being infected and infectious . <p> Mr Sibley , who is also the director of myhealthyherd.com , highlighted the importance of good biosecurity and creating a risk profile for each herd . <h> How good are the current TB tests ? <p> Prof James Wood , infectious disease epidemiologist and head of the University of Cambridges veterinary school , said with current tests being quite imperfect it was vital to use all the tools we have while seeking new ones . <p> He said : " We need improvements to the skin test . We need more sensitive tests so we can detect more infection and to differentiate between infection and vaccination . " <p> He said the blood test was effective at finding early infections but warned against using it routinely as it had a high percentage of false positives . <p> Slaughterhouse surveillance was assumed to be 100 per cent specific . <h> Did you know ? <p> M. bovis can survive in soil , meaning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liz Wellington , University of Warwick , said research from badger and cattle faecal sampling had showed the bacterium could survive in soil and be a risk to animal and human health for up to one year .

" <p> He also highlighted annual badger mortality rate was about 33 per cent . With such a large turnover in the badger population , the challenge of controlling bTB cases was even greater , he said . <p> Badger vaccination <p> Dr Freya Smith , APHA , said global supply issues with the BCG vaccine had halted most badger vaccination schemes , for example in Wales . <p> She said her department had been working on a peanut-based bait to encourage badgers to ingest the vaccine , rather than being cage trapped and injected . <h> The situation in Ireland and Northern Ireland <p> James OKeefe , Department of Agriculture , Food and the Marine ( DAFM ) , said from 1965-2000 , about 30,000-40,000 cattle had been removed from the national herd each year after testing positive for bTB . <p> " We realised the problem was being spread by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national badger culling programme in areas where the disease was endemic had destroyed an average of 6,000 badgers each year . <p> Densities were maintained at about 0.5 badgers per sq.km . <p> " By 2010 we were convinced badger removal reduced the risk of bovine TB in cattle herds , " he said . <p> DAFM was also running a badger vaccination programme on 5 per cent of agricultural land , though farmers were concerned this would be less effective than culling . <p> In Northern Ireland , a badger test , vaccinate or remove approach had yielded good results , said Dr Fraser Menzies , Department of Agriculture , Environment and Rural Affairs . <p> He said the trial , which started in 2014 and cost about 1 million each year , had universal support from farmers , vets and wildlife groups .

It can be seen as extra expense , but it is worth keeping on top of it as prevention is often better than cure . <p> " Biosecurity has become even more essential during the recent avian flu outbreak .

By producing veal they have been able to tap into an emerging market and make dairy-bred beef calves a profitable enterprise . At the same time , installing a milk vending machine on-farm has proved a profitable and increasingly popular move . <p> Mr Hares says : " Expansion when margins are so tight is not sensible , so making more of what you have makes sense . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always nice to feel like you are making progress . You can get down and disheartened with the industry it is better to be doing something , rather than nothing . " <p> When Mr Hares rejoined the farm in East Horrington , near the city of Wells , finding a way to better manage dairy-bred beef calves was high on the agenda following a period of six years shut down with TB . <p> " At the time we had horrendous TB . Initially we were keeping bull calves to 20 months and selling them at a restricted market . We had a lot of stock , putting pressure on winter housing , grazing and labour , and they were not making much at market they were averaging 650-750 , so they probably were not making us any money . " <p> A pasteuriser was purchased to reduce the risk of their raw milk sales being banned due to TB incidence . <p> Keen to avoid shooting bull calves and find a more profitable route to market , Mr Hares contacted Tarrant Valley Livestock , which produces dairy-bred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company was looking for year round calving dairy herds to supply calves younger than eight months for veal production . <p> The fact calves went straight to slaughter at a young age proved the perfect solution for the Hares as it worked with TB restrictions and reduced stocking densities . The pricing structure available also meant they would receive a strong price for non-castrated , horned dairy-bred calves . <p> " For the last group of five we sent we averaged 3.08/kg , including bonuses , " says Mr Hares , who runs the 200-head Holstein Friesian herd with his mother Judith and brother , Jacob.The base price is calculated as the R4L market price from 2 Sisters , St Merryn , minus 60p/kg . <p> Bonuses are then available , depending on weight banding . For example , Mr Hares receives a 25p/kg premium plus a 5p/kg bonus for animals of 145kg or more and a 20p/kg premium , plus a 5p/kg bonus for animals from 125-145kg. 120kg is the minimum weight . <p> The fact calves are on-farm for a set period of time means the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now selling for about 400-500 a head , with costs at about 320 a head , including labour and transport . <p> " Where before we were potentially making no money , we now make about 100/head . We are pleased with this , " says Mr Hares . <h> Requirements <p> Investment to get the operation up and running has also been minimal . The family spent about 4,000 installing additional pens , troughs and straw racks to fulfil Freedom Food requirements . There are also plans to put up an additional purpose-built calf shed . <p> The fact calves are forward booked onto a slaughter date by Tarrant Valley means everything has to be in place to ensure growth rates are maintained and animals are ready within eight months . Mr Hares believes this focus has helped calf rearing as a whole . <p> " It has made us focus on everything so it has benefited heifers as well , which will help us hit a target age at first calving of 24 months . We are averaging 25 months at the moment , " he explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also enrolled on a youngstock scheme with their vet . As part of this , all calves are weighed up to 100 days old . This shows they are generally achieving target growth rates of 800g/day , which Mr Hares puts down to good colostrum management and feeding a quality concentrate ( see panel ) . <p> The installation of the milk vending machine at the end of the farm drive has been a more recent development in the familys mission to add value . <p> As an Arla member , most of their milk has been sold at a loss in recent months , understandably impacting on morale . Having looked at various options at the start of the year , they decided to look at installing a milk vending machine to make the most of their location on a busy road in East Horrington , close to the city of Wells . <p> In August , Mr Hares bought a second-hand vending machine with bottle dispenser . Then he set about getting the appropriate documentation from the Foods Standards Agency though he admits this was probably the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy part . You need permission from Environmental Health at the local council . It took two months to get the paperwork signed off , " he says . <p> The vending machine cost 6,500 . A shipping container was also bought and converted to handle and pasteurise the milk at a cost of about 4,000 . Another 4,000 was spent on a second-hand 35-litre pasteuriser . <p> Due to the TB issues , they chose to invest in a pasteuriser to reduce the risk of being banned from selling raw milk should they be shut down with the disease . <p> Having opened the milk hut on October 22 , demand quickly outstripped supply , with the family having to invest in a new 110-litre pasteuriser within two weeks . Customers pay 1 for a reusable milk bottle and 1 per litre , serving themselves at the vending machine . All milk is less than 24 hours old . <h> Income <p> Mr Hares says : " I budgeted selling 40 litres a day and 10 bottles , so the gross income would equate to roughly the set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litres in one month and 1,500 bottles , so it is about 100 litres a day . " <p> The farm produces milk for 24ppl . The additional costs of pasteurisation and labour means the total cost is about 45ppl . Bottles cost about 50ppl , taking into account buying , labeling and sanitising . All in all , this leaves a healthy margin , though Mr Hares admits it is difficult to know if they are surfing the crest of a wave . <p> " The milk from the hut will more than pay for a mans wage , so it is making a difference . Assuming we still sell 80-90 litres a day , which may be the norm , it will definitely be worth it , " he says . <h> More Insights <p> Last year 's Royal Welsh Show was a career peak for Iwan Morgan and his family 's Erie herd , taking both the inter-breed champion and reserve in the dairy ring .

Ann Hardy reports . <p> Share This <p> Performance is key focus for South Devon herd <p> It will be no surprise to see Edward Hawkins and some of his South Devon cattle exhibiting in the performance championships at the NBA Beef Expo , Stoneleigh . <p> Performance recording runs through Mr Hawkins veins and his enthusiasm for measuring , recording and improving his cattle is at the heart of all he does on his Somerset farm . <p> Farming in Trull , just outside Taunton , he describes how every week , the plate meter comes out to help plan the herds grazing ; every month , youngstock are weighed to check they are meeting their 200- , 400- and 600-day targets ; and once-a-year , Cutsey Farm has a visit from a Breedplan technician , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intramuscular fat and calculation of retail beef yield form an integral part of the system . <p> " If you do not measure it , what hope is there of improving , " says Mr Hawkins , who believes the beef industry should take its lead from dairy farming , where performance recording has become second nature . <p> However , he regrets that within the beef industry there are not more producers performance recording , and says he would particularly like to see more take part in ultrasound scanning for carcase quality traits . <p> Believing higher participation would improve reliability of genetic indexes and propel the breed forward , he says : " People sometimes feel they do not have the time to weigh cattle , but even if only for worming , it helps to know exact weights to get exactly the right dose . I think it is time well spent . " <p> But the real value , Mr Hawkins says , is in knowing an animals estimated breeding values ( EBVs ) which will form a significant part of the competition , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Casting his eye over a uniform group of bulling heifers with little to choose between them on visual assessment , he says : " We will decide which of these heifers to use to breed replacements when we know their latest EBVs . " <h> Service sire <p> Mr Hawkins says : " EBVs are a great tool and they are 60 per cent of the battle , but appearance is also important . We are looking for locomotion and good feet and we want to see bulls we buy in working condition . In other words , what they will look like when they take off their show clothes . " <p> For EBVs , Mr Hawkins prioritises eye muscle area , a balance of direct and maternal calving ease , good weights at 200 , 400 and 600 days , and plenty of milk . <p> " We are currently looking for a myostatin zero bull , " he says , referring to the most favourable variant of this muscle-regulating gene . <p> He says the performance of the progeny of the two natural service sires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost perfectly predicted by the bulls EBVs . <p> " Ensigns calf weight EBV is -1 , whereas Leos is +5.6 . And if you look at heifer calves born on-farm this year , they average 41kg and 45kg , respectively , which is exactly what the EBVs are telling you . " <p> Equipped with an iPad and a full set of the herds performance data , Mr Hawkins has customised the Breedplan results to make them more meaningful and give an instant visual picture of genetic strengths and weaknesses of each animal on-farm . <p> He says : " It is easy to be number-blind in farming and this traffic light system helps overcome that . If the EBV trait falls in the lowest percentile , it is coloured red , showing there is much room for improvement ; the middle values are amber to green and when they get to the top they are blue , then yellow for the very best performers . " <p> The system developed by Mr Hawkins has made a significant contribution to the herds genetic progress , as too have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inquest and Woodhayes Homer 5 . <p> Among its many accomplishments , the herd has won the Wessex region herd competition in 2014 and was the second most improved herd for EBVs in Eblexs national competition in the same year . <p> " A lot of this was accredited to Kestle King Leo , " says Mr Hawkins , praising Roger Rundle , the stockbulls Cornwall-based breeder . <h> Youngstock <p> This year , bulls have been kept entire and will be finished on-farm at about 16 months and sold in the soon-to-open butchery in nearby Sheppys Farm Shop . However , in previous years , they have been castrated and sold as stores . Heifers are either retained as replacements or sold for breeding . <p> Growth rates are precisely measured and last months average of 1.7kg/day for bulls ranged from 2.4kg/day for the best , down to 1.3kg/day for slower growing animals . <p> The finishing ration on which they achieve this performance is ad-lib grass silage with 5kg/head/day of rolled barley and 0.6kg of a rumen bypass rape-based protein . <p> However , as calves , Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He says : " We used to creep feed , but we found calves would spend a lot of time in the feeder and less on their mothers . The mothers milk would dry up and calves would eat more and more cake , yet growth rates were the same . " <p> Today , Mr Hawkins says spring-born calves remain on grass until weaning in December , by which time they are mostly close to their target of half their mothers weight . With dam weights averaging 750kg , this accomplishment on grass and milk alone is impressive . <p> High quality grass plays a central role in reaching these targets and today the herd is paddock-grazed in 0.96-hectare ( two-acre ) blocks , with a close watch kept on maintaining opening covers at about 3,000kg DM/ha ( 1,214kg DM/acre ) , grazing residuals to 1,500kg DM/ha ( 607kg DM/acre ) and conserving any surplus by monitoring the grass wedge . <p> Mr Hawkins says : " For the future , we want to look more towards kg of meat produced/ha . " <p> Other aspirations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EBV to bring the average into the top 25 per cent and to continue to build on genetic and performance improvements . <p> Remarking he always aims to learn from other farmers in both dairy and beef , as well as from his own results , Mr Hawkins says : " This improvement will not be achieved by doing one thing 100 per cent better , but by doing 100 things 1 per cent better . " <p> At Beef Expo , all Mr Hawkins hopes to achieve is to do the breed proud : " For me , it is all about the South Devon it is such a good breed .

Ewan Pate paid him a visit <p> Alex Brewster and farmworker Lucy Christie <p> Share This <p> Improving grazing strategy benefits Perthshire farm <p> IT is 16 years since Alex Brewster started performance recording and this makes him something of a pioneer . Even now selecting ewe replacements using Estimated Breeding Values ( EBVs ) is a rarity in most traditional breeds . <p> The work continues , but now Mr Brewster has moved to the next stage and is giving far more thought to improving the grazing strategy on the 3,500 hectares ( 8,650 acres ) he farms with his wife Jane and parents Alistair and Morag on the hills north of Dunkeld . The business is based at Rotmell , a tenanted farm on the Atholl Estate , but includes another management agreement on the neighbouring Riemore Estate . <p> He says : " Of the 3,500 hectares , about 90 per cent is hill with a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double our output from grass through greater use and control on the lower ground and above the hill dyke . I have 500 hectares earmarked for hill paddocks and this will be part of the next drive to improve our grazing . <p> " We were the monitor farm for Quality Meat Scotlands Perthshire Grazing Group . The project has just finished and I was sad to see it end . I would struggle to find a negative from the whole experience . Even the few ideas which did not work were positives because we all learned from them . We owe the facilitator , Michael Blanche , a big debt of gratitude . " <h> Improvements <p> The project has set Mr Brewster on a major programme of improvements to his grazing management , all based on paddocks . <p> He says : " The limiting factor is how quickly we can build fences . On the improved pastures I am creating 3ha paddocks and above the hill dyke we will make them 6ha . <p> " The rule of thumb is a four-wire electric fence costs 3 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the dividing fences serving both side on a paddock . " <p> The whole grazing group experience had an unexpected spin-off for Mr Brewster . He soon found there were limitations in the fencing equipment available in the UK and set off on a global search for better solutions . This inevitably led him to contacts he already had in New Zealand . <p> The result is he has now formed Powered Pasture , a new company set up to supply others of like mind , including members of the grazing group , with equipment including a novel diamond gate system to allow for quick movement of stock between paddocks . As part of the service , Mr Brewsters wife Jane , an architect , is able to supply paddock plans . <h> Accident <p> The move to a paddock system began in 2012 , partly by accident , through the farms cattle enterprise rather than its sheep . The summer that year was wet , as it was across the whole UK , making it difficult to conserve enough fodder . <p> Mr Brewster realised he would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to move his cattle about more . His yearlings had been gaining an average of 1.2kg per day when they were set stocking but this went up to 1.5kg/day even though they appeared to have less grass.He says : " What changed ? All we had done was move them from field to field more often . <p> " Afterwards Michael Blanche asked me to host the Perthshire grazing group and I jumped at the chance to give it a go . Using the sheep as an example we have now been able to make more of the improving genetics . We had already improved weaning weight of the Blackface lambs by 3kg but using paddocks we are now there 20 days earlier . <p> " It is a management improvement focused on the feed value of grass and constantly moving stock to fresh paddocks . Understanding the botany of the plant has made the biggest difference . " Cattle used to be the holy grail here but sheep now lead the way round the paddocks . The result us where the output has increased from both species . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves in the first 24 hours . Spring calving cows then push the sheep on to the next paddock as they come into graze the residual grass , setting up the quality for the next round of the rotation . " <p> Spring calving cows and their calves are ideal for this pasture management role so numbers at Rotmell are increasing from 70 to 150 . At the same time the 40 autumn calving cows are to be sold . <p> Despite the step change in flock performance Mr Brewster does not regret the years he spent on genetic improvement with his Blackfaces . The emphasis has always been placed on commercial traits , particularly lamb survival and muscle depth . Enhancing the percentage of lambs reared and increasing the killing out percentage is part of the continuing drive towards more self-reliant and efficient stock . <h> Performance <p> Mr Brewster rarely buys a tup , preferring to breed his own and move them between five performance recorded ewes families , each about 200 strong . He runs 1,950 Blackface ewes in total . <p> A study tour to New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nucleus number of at least 1,000 ewes to create the selection pressure need to find the more robust genetics . <p> He says : " The cows have to pay and our data shows our 600kg Aberdeen-Angus cows are most effective . They grow calves at 1.35kg/day and wean upwards of 45 per cent of their mature weight in 175 days . With the average cow weighing 700kg , we have a bit of work to drive the whole herds efficiency to this level . " <p> For the first time last years spring calf crop has been transported down to coastal grazings at Glenluce , Wigtownshire . They left winter housing at Rotmell in early February and will return in May having hopefully gained about 100kg . The thinking is by getting then out to grass sooner this will reduce the store period , get through the change of environment check sooner and drive a far higher growth rate at grass for longer . The aim is to have them weighing 600kg at 18 months having averaged more than 1.1kg day from birth . <p> Meanwhile their mothers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood chip corral near the farm buildings . They are fed a total mixed ration for the last six weeks including silage in the run-up to calving . <p> The ewes spend early spring being mob grazed in improved pasture before being dispersed at low density over the paddocks for lambing in April.Only a quarter of the Blackface ewes are crossed with terminal sires and the target is for the lambs to reach 30kg at 100 days . <h> Alex Brewster 's Philosophy <p> Summing up his philosophy Mr Brewster said : " Livestock farming is about producing red meat protein . Too many breeders have a fascination for fashion over function . We have direct access to one of the wealthiest economies in the world , but how often do we consider what the consumer wants ? Consistently great red meat is the answer . <p> " We have a payment system which does not directly reward taste and tenderness and most seed stock producers do not consider eatability , so why do we wonder about not getting the economic rewards we deserve ? We have phenomenal unique selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce . <p> " A good grassland system is carbon management in action . It drives carbon back into the soil and this helps stabilise the planet . After all , a root system is an ecosystem in itself . How many other products can market that ? <p> Mr Brewster is currently mid-way through a Nuffield Schloarship sponsored by the MacRobert Trust .

Laura Bowyer visits Monmouthshire to find out more . <p> Daryn Williams has been keeping Christmas poultry nearly all his life . In the beginning he was plucking turkeys in a coal shed with his grandmother before progressing to keep 100 geese about 12 years ago . Today he finishes 8,000 birds all for the Christmas trade . <p> Together with his wife Elaine and children Megan and Daniel , the farm has more than doubled its goose production this Christmas thanks to consumer demand . <p> Madgetts Farm also produces ducks and turkeys , lying on the English-Welsh border at Tidenham Chase , Gloucestershire , a stones through from Offas Dyke . <p> They went from growing 100 geese in their first year to 500 the next and turkey numbers dwindled from 1,000 to 500 as the geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Daryn says : " The market is growing for geese , but people are still nervous about how to cook them but the market has to be increasing for us to keep increasing in size . <p> " There is an opening for excellent quality , dry plucked geese . Yes the food movement seems to have slowed down , but people still want to spend at Christmas . But for some reason the public seem to be able to connect with a gosling and not a turkey chick . " <h> Batches <p> With a resident flock of laying geese , eggs are collected and held in batches of 400-500 and then go in an incubator , followed by a hatcher for 24 days . <p> Eskildsen-hybrid goslings , with German blood although UK-bred , are received in March and April for 5 per life , which make up 40 per cent of the years goose crop . <p> The laying flock produces 60 per cent of the farms goslings , while an amount of goslings are also sold off-farm . <p> Daryn says : " British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken from Eastern Germany and breed many of our goslings . The UK goose will lose you money hand over fist . <p> " You need a goose to weigh 4.5-5kg in order for it to start making you money , so 2.5kg deadweight . A bird at this weight could be anything from seven months to 18 weeks at its youngest and they put on a lot of weight in the first three weeks of life . <p> Cereal maize is fed and the protein increases at finishing and at peak 0.5kg is consumed per day . <p> Goslings are bought until the longest day of the year and the last goslings for Christmas will hatch on August 1 . <h> Groups <p> Once hatched , they are kept in broods in groups of 200 for one week and then into groups of 2,000 , at one month old . They go in clear polytunnels and are allowed out of the pot-holes to roam around grass paddocks , where 600 geese are kept to every hectare ( 2.5 acres ) . <p> Little veterinary medicine is administrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They are fed a starter feed , a grower feed and then a finisher when the geese are put on straw yards to clean themselves off after being out at grass . <p> Daryn says : " Geese are better feed convertors when it is cold , as their bodies revert to their natural instincts . They are quite easily manageable birds once the system is set-up for them . " <p> The flock is made up of both geese and ganders and the couple say they perform to a similar level . <p> The business outlets for their geese include wholesalers and distributors , farmgate sales and farmers markets . <p> Daryns father Derek is responsible for farmers markets , travelling from Cowbridge to Cirencester selling the farms birds , but the main part of the business is wholesale with 80 per cent sold in this way . <p> When it comes to the time of killing , geese are caught either late at night or early in the morning , so light levels are low to keep them docile . They are put into modules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed on-farm . <p> Elaine says : " Males can be protective and will hiss . But although geese have a reputation for being nasty at times , they are like many animals , if approached calmly , they will not become defensive . " <p> Once finished , pluckers are employed to take off the feathers before the birds go through a waxing process to remove the finer ones . The birds are tidied up by hand to ensure all feathers have been removed . <p> Elaine says : " Through dry plucking , where the skin of the bird is not broken in any way , the risk of campylobacter is greatly reduced . Also , as water has not penetrated the skin , it will crisp up well when it is cooked . " <p> The process from catching to boxing takes 24 hours , but over the course of two days . Their slaughtering and processing plant can handle 600-700 geese each day , or 100 birds every hour , killing from 9am-3pm . <p> All of the farms birds are sold whole and stored on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of orders , but they aim for a 4.5kg to 7kg bird . <p> The fat that comes from the birds cavity is rendered and sold the following year , while the feathers are collected , washed and sold to be made into duvets . <h> Refocus <p> Previous to producing geese , Daryn managed a dairy herd in Cheshire but wanting to determine their own destiny , the pair moved back to Gloucestershire in 2003 and purchased 16 hectares ( 40 acres ) from Daryns parents in 2011 . <p> After selling at farmers markets for 10 years , the couple decided to focus on the wholesale market to allow sale volumes to increase . Now the goose business turns over 350,000 , with birds selling at a retail equivalent of 16.90/kg . <p> Daryn says : " Farmers markets take a lot of time and prices are cut throughout the day to clear stock and you end up devaluing your product . <p> " It is the same with wholesale , you should not be tempted to decrease your price as you get closer to Christmas as buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following year . " <p> Elaine takes a sales and administration role in the business , while Daryn sticks to the production side of things . <p> Polish workers come over for the finishing period and 20 are housed on-farm for three weeks . During summer months , it is solely Daryn , Elaine and their children who work at home . <p> Birds do not fly as they are too heavy and neither wings nor claws are trimmed . They behave better in small flocks , of 500-600 birds . <p> Daryn says his aim is to be successful and he says you must be proud of your product . <p> " I have done a lot of things from milking to turkeys and contracting , but I enjoy geese production because you are right at the coal face . <p> " Running a business where every stage of the process happens on your farm means everything is your problem , there is no one else to blame . <p> Every bird going through the line counts .

@@106567245 @1967245/ 119573 @qwx979573 <h> Vineyard enterprise aims to ripen farm 's future <p> Insights11 Nov 2016 <p> While North Norfolk bares little comparison to Bordeaux or Champagne , two sisters believe their proximity to the coast , the local climate and a growing demand will make their families arable farm ideally suited to grape production . Abby Kellett finds out more . <p> Laura Robinson has converted four hectares of family farm to grow grapes . <p> Sisters Laura and Samantha Robinson have bitten the bullet and gone for a small but emerging trend . In response to a growing demand for good quality English wine , the pair decided to plant 17,000 vines last spring on their fathers farm in North Creake , Norfolk . <p> This forms part of their 10-year vision with the ultimate goal of producing a range of own-label wine in a custom-made winery , running alongside a cafe and restaurant . <p> The site , known as Burn Valley Vineyard , covers four hectares ( 10 acres ) which would have otherwise been destined for arable production had the sisters father , John not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " It was actually my dads idea to start the vineyard after his trips to France . I knew there were no big vineyards up here and I started to get really interested and excited about it . " <p> But , as she admits , the challenges came after the idea was formed . <p> " It is all very well growing grapes but you need a market to sell them to . <p> " Our location really swayed it for me . Firstly because of our proximity to the coast , which is only three miles away , we have a popular and wealthy market right on our doorstep ; lots of villages with high footfall and plenty of pubs and restaurants , " she says . <p> With grapes harvested from year four onwards , it will be some time before the sisters can quench their thirst with their first drop of wine . <p> " It will be four years before the first grapes are ready to harvest . We may get a small crop before then but you do not want to push the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years you want the vines to put all their efforts into growing really deep roots and a really strong structure which can hold lots of grapes . <p> " Even when the grapes have been harvested , they need processing and the wine needs aging before it resembles the final product . " <p> Therefore it could be eight years before the sisters get any return on their investment of 150,000 , which has gone into buying specialist equipment to fit 2.2-metre ( 7.2ft ) rows , infrastructure and labour . <p> " We bought a little tractor and we are sharing the neighbours sprayer as she only uses it three times per year , although further down the line we will need to buy vine trimmers and a mower . " <p> The sisters plan to supply a range of wine , from still to sparking , white to red . From a management perspective , this provides multiple benefits . <p> Vineyard consultant Chris Hatto , who has been assisting with the project , says : " The beauty of having several different varieties is they will ripen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvest . <p> " Also , some will get hit with frost and some may pick up disease while others wont . Its a good way spreading risk . " <p> Long-term , the sisters plan to process and bottle the wine on-farm themselves but , in the meantime , grapes will be sent to a winemaker to be processed . <p> Laura says : " At the moment , my job is simply to grow the ripest , healthiest grapes I can with the right levels of acidity . " <p> To process and make the wine , they predict it will cost about 1.80 per bottle . Added to the cost of production and tax , they anticipate the overall cost of producing a bottle of wine will be about 3.50 for still and 6 for sparkling . <p> " I want to create a medium-to-top-end product and we will be looking to sell the still wines for 12.50 , " says Laura . <h> Agronomy <p> Knowing which field to set aside for the venture was an easy decision , largely driven by soil characteristics and geography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing . It is one of the poorest fields on-farm in terms of arable production but it is free draining which is good for vines . <p> " You do not want too rich a soil or you would get too much growth which would need to be controlled . " <p> And with the coast so close , frost damage should be minimal during winter months . <p> But the site is not without its problems . Soil magnesium levels are fairly low and , since vines require more magnesium than the average cereal crop , plants will require regular topping up . <p> Controlling crop growth is another challenge , which Chris foresees . <p> He says : " Nitrogen is a bit of a curse really . You need nitrogen to get the vines growing in the first couple of years but then , as most vines grow vigorously , too much nitrogen sends them crazy . <p> " If the leaves are growing too much the flowers , which are deteriorating , will wilt because they are putting a lot of energy into growing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . <p> " Some vineyards in England are starting to use a growth regulator hormone to stop this . We are going to see if it works . If it does we will get better fruit , a bigger crop and hopefully less work in pruning the vineyard in summer . " <p> In order to keep growth under control , the vines require regular pruning through the year , a job which is extremely labour intensive . <p> Chris says : " Most people think there is nothing to do , but winter pruning is one of our busiest times . You have got tonnes and tonnes of old prunings to take away . <p> " In summer you have got to remove leaves round the grape zone so we can get maximum sun and airflow to keep pests and disease away . " <p> Low rainfall is key in growing a successful vineyard , says Chris , along with warm temperatures and minimal wind . <p> " We are quite dry here . We may be a degree off the south coast in terms of temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Vines hate wind so we put a wind-break along one hedge and another two windbreaks will be going up . " <p> The new business venture comes at a time when the market for English wine is booming . <p> " When we get the first bottle of wine I do not think I will believe it 's ours . But after all the years of hard work which will have gone into making it , I just hope we like it " <p> " There is now a demand for good quality English wine when there was n't before and many are willing to pay a premium for a wine which is produced locally , " says Chris . <p> Consequently , the vineyard area in England doubled between 2007 and 2013 , increasing to almost 2,000ha ( 4,942 acres ) according to Laura , who expects this to grow to 3,000ha ( 7,413 acres ) by 2020 . <p> Chris says : " I 've been working with vineyards for 25 years and seen a lot of changes . Years ago it was much more amateur , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good quality wine . " <p> A better understanding of how to select varieties which will suit the UK climate has contributed to the upsurge in wine production , he says . <p> " We have learned to adapt the grapes we grow to UK conditions . We can not grow Chardonnay like they do in Champagne as we do n't  get the bigger crops . Therefore , we grow smaller crops , getting the ripeness right with better quality grapes . " <p> Variety selection has also been driven by the development of disease resistant varieties , which require fewer fungicide applications . At Burn Valley Vineyard , several of these varieties have been planted . <p> " On this site , we are growing Rondo and Regent which both have disease resistance and do not require heavy spray programmes . <p> " So , instead of doing 10 passes with the sprayer each year , you may only have to do three on some varieties or none in others , depending on the year , " says Chris . <p> One of the most significant changes which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now much more comparable to grape growing regions across the channel . <p> " The climate is better than it used to be , climate change has helped . <p> " The temperatures in England now are similar to what they used to be in Champagne in the 1980s , whereas in Champagne it is getting too warm to grow certain varieties . <p> " As well as being able to grow more varieties , the rise in temperatures effectively lengthened the growing season by about three weeks , so we are still able to harvest as late as November , " says Chris . <p> Looking forward , it is clear the sisters are in it for the long haul , not least because the vines have a lifespan of 25-30 years . <p> " This is a family operation and something for the future . The life of the vines means they will be there for the next generation as well if they are interested . <p> " When we get the first bottle of wine I do not think I will believe its ours . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got into making it , I just hope we like it . <p> " We want to create a really stand-out sparkling wine which showcases the north Norfolk terroir .

IVP accelerates embryo production from donor cows , while pregnancy hold rates for both fresh and frozen embryos are relatively similar for both techniques .

There was also a shortage of fencing , which he started to improve along with quality of grassland , with the help of the farms workman Terry Boulton . <h> Soil indices <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and K , were at rock bottom , and soil structure had been destroyed . <p> " I became involved with the AHDB Beef from Grass Project and , with Charlie Morgan , of Charlie Morgan GrassMaster , and Sarah Pick , ADHB Beef and Lamb , a full nutrient plan was drawn up . " <p> These days , Mr House relies on his soil and grass nutrient levels to produce store cattle without the aid of concentrates , running a rotational grazing system based on leys , consisting of five varieties of ryegrass , three white clovers and Timothy . <p> Operating just into Somerset on the Dorset border , there are many New Zealand-style dairy farms in the area , and calves of the Angus sweeper bulls make up the basis for the farms suckler system . <p> Grassland has been split into 2ha ( five-acre ) paddocks and its growth is measured weekly . <p> Mr House says a lactating cow requires 15-16kg DM per day , while dry cows need 10kg DM per day . All silage is baled as excess grass is cut throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shed space , cattle are out-wintered . <p> Mr House buys-in week-old Angus-sired heifers out of Kiwi-Friesian cross Jersey cows . These grow into small , milky mothers , which are then put to an Angus bull at 14 months , if more than 280kg , to produce suckled calves . <p> When buying-in these dairy heifer calves , he pays 80-100 , and says they will cost another 100 to wean at about 100kg . <h> Milk-bar <p> Calves are trained on teat feeders inside and fed twice-a-day until three weeks old . They are then moved to grass where they are fed milk from a quad-bike drawn milk-bar . Weaned calves are kept in paddocks in batches of 40 . <p> Suckled calves are weaned at the end of November , with steers leaving the farm at nine months old . Heifers are outwintered to be sold the following spring at 12 months old . <p> The practice of fence-line weaning is used with all suckled calves , where calves are put on one side of the electric fence and cows the other , maintaining a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dip in calf growth rates at weaning . <p> Mr House works to get as much from his pastures as possible . <p> " To avoid cattle eating grass regrowth , a paddock is not grazed for any more than three days , otherwise it will limit plants photosynthesising ability . " <p> Cattle are weighed at least once a month , with the aim of increasing output of kg of beef/hectare . Keeping Angus crosses for the sire premium , stores produced from suckled calves are sold to Farmark , which supplies cattle to Dovecote Park and , ultimately , Waitrose . <h> Creep-grazing <p> Mr House says : " Steers are gaining on average 1.3kg/day and heifers 1.22kg/day . Through creep-grazing , where a gate is put in the fence to let calves go on to fresh grass first , it is possible another 100g/calf/day could be gained , as calves nibble the best bits of the grass off first . This method is introduced to suckler calves from three months onwards . " <p> Mr House says cattle were deficient in selenium and copper due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ground and its grass . Now , breeding heifers and cows are given a fertility bolus twice a year . <p> He says : " Cows have to be productive , maintaining calf as well as body condition .

@@106567444 @1967444/ <p> Since the mid 1980s , UK sugar beet yields have nearly doubled from about 40 tonnes per hectare ( 16t/acre ) to 75t/ha ( 30t/acre ) , yet the crops nitrogen demand has remained constant . <p> This is according to Prof Debbie Sparkes , Nottingham University , who told a meeting at Newark the current 90-120kg N/ha recommendation for sugar beet crops is as relevant now as it was decades ago , despite the use of modern varieties with greater yield potential . <p> Prof Sparkes shared results from six years worth of trials , all of which supported her assertion growers need not apply more than 120kg N/ha to sugar beet in a single season . <p> In fact , in 2012 , high soil mineral nitrogen levels meant there was no response to nitrogen application at all , she said . <p> Growers should aim to apply enough nitrogen to enable the canopy to reach a leaf area index ( LAI ) of 3 , but no more . <p> " Sugar yield is directly related to the amount of light intercepted by the canopy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can intercept is about 90 per cent . <p> " In order to do this , our trials have shown the canopy has to have a LAI of about 3 . To achieve the magic LAI , the crop needs 90-120kg N/ha . " <p> She warned by applying too much N , growers risk suffering a yield penalty . <p> " If the crop takes up much more than this in early crop growth , more of the plants energy is targeted towards leaf production at the expense of root growth , so roots are effectively robbed of nutrients and energy . <p> " The last thing we want is to build N in the root . You do not want high amino nitrogen levels and we have seen the detrimental effect of partitioning if there is excessive N. " <p> Even during the latter part of the season , because nitrogen in senescing leaves is recycled there is no need to top up with further N once the optimum canopy size has been reached , she said . <p> In order to push yields forward , growers need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . <p> " We really want to focus on maximising light interception in the early part of the year . Anything you can do to increase light interception , particularly in May and June , is going to promote high yields . " <p> As a means of accelerating canopy expansion , the British Beet Research Organisation ( BBRO ) has begun work looking at whether nitrogen placement has an effect on canopy development , something which has already been investigated by Scandinavias equivalent organisation , Nordic Sugar . <p> Nordic Sugar found the yield increase associated with N placement ranged from 0 to 8 per cent , depending largely on soil moisture . <p> Prof Sparkes said : " In a wet spring , there was often no benefit and in a dry spring there tended to be the greatest benefit as the nutrients were placed in the rooting zone and crops could access nitrogen more easily . " <p> Applying nitrogen alongside phosphorus , potassium and sodium led to the greatest yield response , however the research flagged up logistical issues in placing numerous products close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an important factor . <p> " They had to ensure nutrients were not right on top of the seed , but both below and to the side of seed to avoid inhibiting seedling growth and establishment . " <p> This work has been largely driven by a need to use nitrogen more efficiently as environmental regulations in Scandinavia limit the amount of N growers can apply . <p> Prof Sparkes said : " Their emphasis is on getting more from less . They are limited by the amount of N they can apply because of environmental regulations , but they have found they can get by using less nitrogen when the seed is placed as uptake is much better . " <p> In the first year of UK trials , results suggested there was no yield improvement to be had from placing nitrogen alongside seed at drilling . <p> However , researchers believe high levels of mineralisation caused largely by wet weather in early summer , was likely to have masked the difference between placed nitrogen and non-placed nitrogen and work is set to continue in this area .

A healthy discussion on these complex and extremely important issues is just the beginning , but it is encouraging to see the forward thinking from the Government . " <p> The gas mix used during the slaughter of pigs was highlighted by the Minister as another possible area for reform . <p> He said the latest science raises some concerns about the gas mixture which is currently used and it would be easier to improve standards during slaughter once outside the EU . <p> Trade <p> Putting animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme of the debate , given concerns about the extent to which this would be possible under World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) rules . <p> " There are legal precedents and case law to support the use of ethical bans on certain practices " , Mr Eustice said . <p> " I do not believe anything along the lines we would propose will cause any difficulty whatever with WTO rules .

Differences in the normal sown plots , however , were not significant . <p> He said he introduced sheep to the rotation to extend fertility-building leys from 18 months to 24 months . <p> " I felt sheep would fit in well to graze the extra leys , rather than mowing and incorporating them into the soil pre-cropping . Green manures planted after harvesting some of the crops are also used for over-wintered sheep grazing . <p> " Long term , we hope to see increased soil fertility , less weeds and healthier crops . The leys also provide additional income from sales of finished lambs . " <p> In short term situations , replacing a badly infested crop with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left can be completely sprayed off before a more competitive crop is drilled to smother regrowth . Longer term foraging could also help where seed burdens were particularly high . <h> Environment <p> " Environmentalists and policy makers have long called for a return to mixed farming crops , grassland and livestock , which together support increases in small mammals , pollinators and farmland birds , " Mr Stocker said . <p> Tim White at Sheep Improved Genetics said sheep could potentially help deal with blackgrass and help farmers with their greening and environmental commitments . <p> He said he had been ' quite amazed ' by the reaction at Cereals from arable farmers . <p> " The market has changed , arable farmers are realising there is a need for these things . " <h> Young farmers <p> Mr White added it could help introduce ' young blood ' into the sector . <p> Young sheep farmers could introduce a flock to the land if the arable farmer did not want to deal with the ' hassle ' of keeping livestock and this would be appealing to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Case study : Young Farmer <p> Aberdeenshire sheep farmer Michael Ritch introduced sheep onto his family farm which allowed him to expand the business and work fulltime alongside his father and grandfather . <p> " The sheep manage the land over the winter without poaching it and keep down the docks . Having a grass rotation has definitely improved the land for following crops , and having the sheep has motivated us to improve our management , which has rewarded us with greater yields and performance of grass , " he said . <p> " We now use less fertiliser and less herbicides , so our input costs for the whole farm have been reduced . " <p> While there were uncertainties surrounding Brexit and the UKs sheep sectors trade with the EU , Mr Stocker highlighted opportunities in trade worldwide as well as with specialised markets for wool . <h> Demand <p> Increasing UK demand for locally produced products has helped create a new market for wool and Mr Stocker said this could be a significant market for smaller scale farmers . <p> " We are starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat is almost a by-product , " he said . <p> He added farmers needed to look past the immediate profitability of the sheep enterprise on its own and look at the benefits to the whole farm . <h> FG Insight Blog <h> Related blogs <p> The dry weather is starting to raise a few eyebrows of concern with very little rain falling in March and just 6mm in April , with crops on lighter land visibly suffering . Currently the heavy clays at Toddington are coming to no harm , but it wont be long before the crops start to suffer , with the last reasonable rainfall being 7mm on the March 22.
