But fad diets wo n't help you keep the weight off for the long haul . <p> Article By : Karen Miller-Kovach , MBA , M.S. , R.D. <p> There are a lot of fad diets out there . While they may help you lose weight in the short-term , they wo n't help you keep the weight off for the long haul . The simple fact is , the key to losing weight for the long-term is eating a balanced , healthy diet . <p> Everyone wants a " quick fix " when it comes to weight loss . Some people turn to fad diets as they are generally easy to understand and simple to follow ( at least for a few days ) , and they make great tabloid headlines and even better book titles . Since fad diets do n't last , there 's always room for a new one . <p> The problem with fad diets is that they are ... fads . Following any diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lead to long-term weight loss . And , when it comes to following today 's fad diets , the results run the gamut from disappointing to dangerous . Let 's take a look at some of the latest weight-loss fads . <p> Low-carb diets These diets , described in a host of recent best-selling books , share a common theory : Carbohydrate-rich foods , especially those with sugar , wreak havoc on your physical and mental wellbeing . Eating these foods forces your body to make fat with abandon and leaves you moody , irritable and constantly hungry . <p> The cure depends on whose fad you 're following . Recommendations include avoiding carbohydrate-containing foods altogether by switching to protein-rich foods or fats , eating carbs at restricted times of the day or swearing off the most offending foods for life . The short-term health risks and negative side effects correspond with how extreme the fad diet is , ranging from marginal deficiencies of key vitamins and minerals to light-headedness and nausea . Since no one 's yet studied these diets in a credible , scientific way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic premise behind these popular diets is that eating specific foods - whether it 's cabbage soup , grapefruit juice or a combination of tuna with vanilla ice cream - in specific amounts at specific times of the day will lead to big weight loss . By severely restricting food intake , you lose weight . That 's the good news . <p> The bad news is that the weight loss is mostly water , which returns as soon as you start eating normally again . And virtually everyone who follows a restricted diet will eventually return to eating normally , whether the diet says to or not . Most of the side effects of these nutritionally inadequate diets are short-term , such as gas and other gastrointestinal disturbances , and only last as long as the diet is followed . One long-term effect , especially if the diets are followed one after the other , may be increased risk for developing an eating disorder . <p> Diet pills and supplements Due to changes in the laws that govern the sale of dietary supplements , the number of pills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the United States , recent estimates suggest that almost 3.5 million Americans are buying these products in an effort to control their weight , more than double the number in 1993 . <p> For the most part , the quality of the science behind these products is extremely weak , and the results have been inconsistent . In addition , side effects are largely unknown . What is known , however , is that combining dietary supplements with other pills ( including over-the-counter medications ) can be risky , and that at least one compound ( known as ma huang , ephedrine and ephedra ) has been linked with several deaths . <p> A lifestyle plan for life When it comes to weight loss , what your weight is at the end of a decade means a whole lot more than what it is at the end of a single day . In order to reap the many benefits of weight loss - from improved physical and mental health to having an entire wardrobe in a single size that you 're happy with - you need to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time . <p> There is not a fad diet available that has shown it can make that happen . That 's why the Institute of Medicine 's expert panel has stated : " Because improvements in the quality of the diet and especially the amounts of food consumed are important to weight loss , as is modifying one 's lifestyle to incorporate reasonable physical activity , any weight-loss program must attend to these two components , providing the participant with necessary information and , ideally , skills .

" Once you get there , take the time to congratulate yourself on your efforts . " <p> Reality checkAfter losing 10 percent , you gain a sense of what it will take to lose the rest and reach your final Goal weight . It allows you to ask yourself , ' Am I willing to put in that much more effort to lose even more weight ? ' . If the answer is no , that 's okay . Some people only lose 10 percent and that 's it . Health-wise , a 10-percent weight loss is a greater achievement than no loss at all .

Consequently , this can slow ( but not stop ) the anticipated rate of weight loss . <p> For example , if an individual needs 8,400 kilojoules per day to maintain weight , reducing intake to 6,300 kilojoules , assuming exercise stays the same , should provide a 500g per week weight loss ( Note : 500g of weight is equivalent to about 14,700 kilojoules ) . Furthermore , reducing to 4,200 kilojoules should result in a weight loss of 1kg per week and going down to 2,100 kilojoules a day should result in a weight loss of 1.5kg per week .

This ' lower than expected ' rate of weight loss is a lot different to ' no ' weight loss as the ' starvation mode ' notion proposes . <p> It is unclear as to whether the relationship between reduced kilojoule intake and a lower metabolism follows a straight path or becomes more pronounced the greater the kilojoule reduction . Some studies have found no significant reduction in metabolism until the kilojoule restriction is quite large ( e.g. 3,360 kilojoules or less per day ) .2 Others suggest a linear relationship with small reductions in metabolism accompanying small reductions in kilojoule restriction , with the gap increasing as the kilojoule deficit is enlarged . <p> While there is no biologic evidence to support the ' starvation mode ' myth , there may be behavioural reasons why weight loss stops when kilojoules are severely reduced .

@@43528004 @3528004/ <p> Apple vs. pear shape Total body fat is not the only indicator of weight-related health problems . Fat distribution also plays an important role . For example , body fat that accumulates around the waist known as abdominal fat ( an " apple shape " ) poses a greater health risk than fat carried in the hips and thighs ( a " pear " shape ) . Men are genetically predisposed to gain weight around their waist , although there are exceptions . By contrast , women 's bodies tend to be more " pear shaped .

We reveal how to plate up like a weight-loss expert . <p> Article By : Emma Stirling <p> Read on for five practical tips that will help you gain control of your eating habits . <p> Do you start your day with a nutritious breakfast , pack your bag with healthy snacks and make good food choices at lunch , only to have it all fall apart at dinnertime ? You 're not alone . Many people find serving up a healthy evening meal a challenge . Read on for five practical tips that will help you gain control of your eating habits . <p> 1 . Clean out your crockery cupboard A main cause of overeating at dinnertime comes not from food , but what you 're eating off . Dr Brian Wansink , director of the Cornell University Food and Brand Lab , estimates that an oversized dinner plate causes you to serve ( and eat ) an extra 20 per cent or more of food . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a traditional blue and white Chinese bowl . When placed in a modern stirfry bowl , however , you unconsciously add twice as much to try and fill the space . Using large bowls , like pasta bowls , can cause you to plate up an extra 40 per cent or more . <p> How ? Reduce your dinner plate size from 30cm ( 12in ) to 25cm ( 10in ) and you 'll plate a slightly smaller , but still significant , serve that leaves you satisfied . <p> 2 . Get informed about correct portion sizes With masses of food within our reach ( and our budgets ) , it 's easy to blame our supersized food supply for our supersized waistlines . But when was the last time you stopped and took a good look at your portion sizes ? Learning about correct-sized portions can instantaneously boost your weight-loss effort . Measuring cups , jugs and spoons are a must-have in any kitchen , with digital scales providing an added edge . Try to dish out 20 per cent less than you think you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should dish out 20 per cent more . <p> How ? Use real-life objects as a visual guide to portion sizes . A 30g portion of cheese is about the size of a matchbox , while a portion of lean meat , fish or poultry is the size of your palm . <p> 3 . Choose filling and healthy foods Once you 've mastered control over your portion sizes , the next step is cutting back on foods that are higher in kilojoules per serve ( also known as energy-dense foods ) , such as oil , butter , cheese and wine , as well as refined carbohydrates such as white pasta , rice and bread . Instead , try and fill your dinner plate with foods that are low in energy density and high on the fullness-factor scale . This means learning to love fruits and vegetables , which ( according to the latest US government dietary guidelines ) should be filling half your plate at every meal and snack . <p> How ? Maximise your intake of veggies containing vitamins , minerals and other important nutrients by eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 . Stay ahead of hunger Have you ever arrived home from work after not eating for hours and ended up wolfing down fatty fast food ? When you 're ravenously hungry , you 're more likely to make food choices based on what 's convenient , rather than what works best for weight loss . That 's why it 's so important to stay ahead of hunger and learn how to listen to your body 's signals . Take the time to cook a meal , and munch on sticks of carrot and celery with salsa to decrease the urge to eat high-kilojoule snacks . <p> How ? Halfway through each meal , stop , rest and assess . Stop eating , rest your knife and fork for a few minutes and assess your hunger levels . Aim to leave the table just comfortably satisfied , rather than completely stuffed . <p> 5 . Treat yourself wisely After a long day spent juggling work and family , it 's common to feel you deserve a treat . Another trap is skipping dessert , then overdoing it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two rows ( or even a whole block ) .

Brushing your teeth after dinner is an easy way to signify a meal is over and that it 's time to stop eating .

@@43528111 @3528111/ <h> Is fat your fate ? <p> New research is revealing more and more about the relationship between genes and weight gain . <p> Article By : Weight Watchers Magazine <p> Your hair colour , the size of your nose , the shape of your face " all these are determined by your genes . So a tendency to gain weight is probably genetic too , right ? If only it were so simple ... <p> In the past decade , it 's become obvious that the role of genes in affecting weight , appetite and even our predisposition to exercise is a complex one . " Currently there are about 450 genes identified as having an influence on weight - and there will be more , " says Karen Miller-Kovach , Weight Watchers Chief Scientific Officer . " There are undoubtedly a large number of genes involved in the regulation of body weight , energy expenditure , food preferences , eating , hunger and the way fat operates in the body , " agrees Associate Professor Boyd Strauss of the Nutrition and Dietetics Department at Monash University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for between 25 and 40 per cent of the difference between individuals with respect to body weight . So - are we condemned by our genes or can this information help us fight weight gain head-on ? <p> The ' obesity gene ' Research into the impact of genes on weight accelerated in the early 1990s when a quest began for an obesity gene that could be modified to help control weight . " It was believed - and hoped - that there would be two or three genes in the human genetic pool linked with obesity , " explains Karen Miller-Kovach . " There was a quest for a ' thrifty gene ' - a gene that helped people store fat to help them survive when food was scarce . There were theories that if science could identify and modify that gene , it would solve the world 's obesity problem . Then , in the mid 1990s , the ' leptin gene ' was discovered . People thought ' this must be the gene ' - but it was n't . " <p> In laboratory studies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice by reducing their food intake and increasing their energy expenditure . After two weeks of treatment with leptin , mice lost 30 per cent of their weight . Genes carry the instructions to make leptin , but in obese mice , those genes were defective , so the obese mice ate more and exercised less . Leptin also plays an important fat-burning role in humans - but until recently , nobody knew how . Researchers at Brown Medical School and Harvard Medical School have found leptin triggers production of a chemical called aMSH , which sends a message to the brain to burn kilojoules . " If somehow , through a drug , you could increase activity of aMSH , you 'd force the body to burn more kilojoules and lose weight , " says Eduardo Nillni of Brown Medical School . <p> From foetus to fat ? Another more recent field of research in this area is epigenetics . " Epigenetics is the recognition that environment , particularly when a foetus is in the womb , also affects vulnerability to weight gain , " says Karen Miller-Kovach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German occupation of various European countries in the First World War , when there was famine . Children born during the famine were substantially heavier and more likely to become obese as adults than children born before or after the occupation . Why ? While the foetus had restricted food supply , a biological programming occurred along the lines of ' when food becomes available you 'd better keep hold of it ' . " <p> British researcher David Barker , who conducted this study , suggested chronic health issues such as obesity and heart disease could be an outcome of physiological adaptations or ' programming ' an unborn baby forms when it is undernourished . Barker believes maternal nutrition is a major influence on the programming that affects childhood growth and obesity in later life . However , this is just part of the story . It 's now widely recognised that the influence of genes extends beyond biological factors to weight-related behaviours such as food preferences , dietary patterns and exercise behaviours . <p> Behavioural factors Karen Miller-Kovach believes research into how genes affect our predisposition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two groups of people and put one group on an exercise program , but at the end of the program , the weight change between the two groups is minimal , " she says . " That may be because the group who exercise then unconsciously make up for that physical activity through the week . They spend a little more time on the couch , and they do that without realising it , because that 's the way they are genetically programmed . " <p> " If that sounds like you , a good strategy is to focus on incidental activity , rather than structured activity , " says Karen Miller-Kovach . Park the car further away , use the stairs not the lift and walk more , because you wo n't compensate for that kind of physical activity by relaxing on the couch - but you may take it easier if you go to an aerobics class three times a week . <p> The bottom line While researchers are studying the role of genetics in weight , it 's important to realise that except in very rare cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we eat and the amount of exercise we do has a far greater impact on our weight . " The majority of obesity today is probably environmental rather than genetic , " says Strauss . " It 's to do with your level of physical activity and food intake . " <p> Karen Miller-Kovach stresses that a healthy lifestyle is what makes the difference . " You may have a deck of cards stacked towards weight gain or you may be dealt cards where the genes are protective against weight gain , " she says . " But do n't think of these as genetic edicts , think of them as tendencies . Focus on behaviour to change those tendencies - for example , think carefully when choosing a drink if you have a tendency towards sweet things . " If everyone in your family has had a heart attack , you probably have a fair amount of genetic material that makes you vulnerable to a heart attack , too , " says Karen Miller-Kovach .

Here are the best ways ( from old-fashioned to high-tech ) to keep tabs on your changing figure - and your health . <p> Article By : Lisa Harris <p> The scale has been an intrinsic part of Weight Watchers since Jean Nidetch held the first meeting in her Queens , New York , apartment in 1961 . <p> " It is ingrained in our history " it has always provided a sense of accountability that 's hard to match , " says Maria Walls , RD , manager of program development at Weight Watchers International . In fact , even researchers who have access to high-tech weight and body-fat measuring devices say they still hop on the scale once a week . <p> Why weigh in ? " Scale avoidance can lead to unwanted kilos creeping up on you without your knowledge , putting you at risk for heart disease , diabetes and some cancers , " says Judith Korner , MD , PhD , assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh yourself regularly , you know if you 've gained and can make a plan of attack before more kilos accumulate . " <p> To get the most accurate picture of your progress , stick to a weekly weigh-in since weight can fluctuate on a daily basis due to water retention . <p> Scaling up On a scale of one to 10 , how does your bathroom scale measure up ? If your unit does n't provide the latest high-tech features , such as measuring body fat or revealing how many kilos you 've lost since you last weighed yourself , you could be missing out . <p> Consider treating yourself to a new scale to make tracking your progress easier and more accurate . <p> The numbers game Body Mass Index ( BMI ) is a measurement based on height and weight , which determines whether you are at a healthy weight ( 18 to 24.9 ) , are overweight ( 25 to 29.9 ) or are obese ( 30 and higher ) . " A BMI is a good assessment of where you stand in terms of health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight problem , " says Korner . <p> She recommends that everyone , regardless of their weight , knows what his or her BMI is . <p> Change matters A healthy BMI does n't mean you 're in the clear . " Even if you stay within a normal BMI range , any increase can signal a health risk , " says Korner . " For instance , you can have an increased risk for developing hypertension and diabetes if your BMI goes from 22 to 24 " . <p> Do it yourself To calculate your BMI , use this formula : Divide your weight in kilos by your height in metres squared . Or use our BMI calculator . <p> Roll the tape Remember the tape measure ? If you 're of a certain age , you may recall that this sewing essential doubled as a tool to measure more than fabric " it was once the preferred method for charting a changing figure . Today , experts still rate the tape measure as a top tracking method for assessing your health risks as well as providing tangible proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Along with your BMI , your waist circumference will reveal if you 're at risk for future health problems such as heart disease or diabetes , " says Korner . If your waist is greater than 89cm ( 102cm for men ) , you have a greater risk of developing obesity-related health problems . <p> The tape measure is also an underrated tool when it comes to providing motivation . Avid exercisers often lose centimetres faster than kilos because they 're losing fat while gaining muscle , and since fat takes up more room than muscle , the tape measure is a better barometer of progress . " On the flip side , if you 're dropping weight but not centimetres , it 's a sign that , although your diet is working , you need to raise your fitness ante , " says Korner . <p> Size wise Measure your chest , thighs , arms , hips , buttocks and waist once a month .

Be sure the tape is snug , does not compress your skin , and is parallel to the floor . As you measure , look straight ahead and do n't slouch to look down at your reading . Place one finger on the end of the tape measure , pull it away from your body , then read . <p> What 's the skinny ? If you 've just started lifting weights and you 've also put on a few kilos recently , your muscle-building workout must be to blame , right ? Not so fast . Before you jump to that conclusion , have your body fat measured using a skin-fold caliper ( a device used to measure the thickness of a fold of skin with its underlying layer of fat ) to determine if you have gained muscle or fat . <p> Here 's how it works : A trained technician measures the skin-fold thickness in your upper arms , upper back , stomach , upper thighs and other areas ( there are more than 20 caliper-worthy sites on the body ) . Measurements are typically taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into your percentage of body fat using a mathematical formula . <p> Consistency counts While calipers are one of the top ways to measure body fat ; the accuracy is contingent on the skill of the technician , so use the assessment in addition to the scale and other weight-monitoring tools . To boost accuracy , have an assessment taken once a month with the same technician and the same type of caliper every time . After you 've had your measurements taken a few times , look into learning how to use calipers yourself .

@@43528183 @3528183/ <h> Guide to buying running shoes <p> The right pair of joggers can prevent injuries and improve your workout . <p> Article By : Kathryn C. Kukula <p> As gear goes , running shoes are pretty simple . After all , most of the performance in running is supplied by the engine " your heart , lungs and muscles . Still , it pays to tend to your feet . The proper shoes will make the kilometres you travel more comfortable and could help to reduce your risk of injuries . <p> Here 's how to select the right pair for you . <p> Pronation ( left ) ; overpronation ( right ) <p> Stability control shoe ( top ) ; motion control shoe ( bottom ) <p> Know how your foot hits the ground Running shoes are designed to cushion the blow of your foot slamming onto the pavement or ground . Your foot has a built-in mechanism to do this : It flattens somewhat to absorb the shock . Usually the foot rolls inward on the big-toe side as it flattens , a motion called pronation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Problems occur when the foot totally collapses on the inside arch , called overpronation . Left unchecked , overpronation can create stress from the foot that rises up into the lower leg , knee and , sometimes , the hip . This can lead to injury . <p> To find out if you 're an overpronator or just a pronator , go to a specialised running shoe shop and ask for an analysis . Some shops will have a treadmill that can analyse your gait , while others rely on an experienced staff member . If you can , bring in a pair of old running shoes as the staff member may be able to examine the wear pattern of the midsole to see how you 're landing . <p> See how shoe parts work for you Walk into a shoe shop and you 'll see scores of running shoe styles and models . Each one is basically a high-tech sandwich . The breathable , nylon mesh upper encases your foot ; the midsole is like the meat in the sandwich , it 's the layer of dense foam that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stride ; the outsole is the usually black layer that actually meets the road . <p> Select for your stride If you are an overpronator , the person fitting your shoes should recommend a motion control or stability shoe . These shoes have stiffer material on the inside edge of the midsole to prevent total collapse ; you can often see the stiffer material . <p> If your feet land with normal spring to their step , you can wear neutral or cushioned shoes that provide just enough cushioning and support to protect your feet . More cushioning is not necessarily better ; you really want just enough to be comfortable . <p> Factor in where you 're going to run You 'll need slightly different shoes depending on whether you 'll be on the road or on unsurfaced paths . The outsoles of road shoes have just a few grooves in a mostly flat surface . The bottoms of trail shoes have a deep , gnarly tread good for traction on dirt or mud . And trail shoes ' uppers are often waterproof . <p> Try on a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different price ranges . Five or six shoes is a lot to try on , but you 'll learn which brand fits your foot best and the features you like . Try them on with the socks you 'll wear when running . <p> Walk around the shop The heel should fit snugly without slipping . You need about 1cm of extra space in front of your toes . Many manufactures make shoes in widths ; if your toes are pinched ask for a wider shoe . A good fit is absolutely critical and if the shoes do not fit well in the shop then they wo n't fit better at home ! <p> Compare and contrast Decide on two pairs and ask for an explanation of the differences between the two . Then you can make a final decision based on quality , price or style . <p> Things to consider : <p> Does it fit snugly around the heel , while still roomy in the toe ? <p> Does it support your foot when it lands ? <p> Does it feel natural and flexible on your foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where you want to go ? On the road or trails ? <p> Running shoes usually last about 400-800 kilometres . Outsoles are so durable that they will rarely show wear . Instead , the midsole foam will begin to collapse and crease . You can test this by pressing on the outsole with your thumb - it should compress . Make a note in your calendar when you buy your shoes . If you track your distance , you 'll be able to estimate when your shoes need to be replaced . New aches and pains while running will also tell you that you need new shoes .

Here 's how to fit health into your shift . <p> Article By : Amy Leibrock <p> Shift work and weight loss Security guards , policemen , ER doctors and nurses " all of them risk their health for their jobs . They 're among the 16 percent of Australians who work alternative and rotating shifts , including the night shift , which falls between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m . Those who work this schedule log an average of 42 fewer minutes of shuteye per night than daytime workers , according to a 2005 study at Eastern Virginia Medical School . <p> For years , researchers have been linking long-term insufficient sleep to a host of chronic ills , such as cardiovascular disease , digestive problems , type 2 diabetes , metabolic syndrome and sleep apnea , not to mention the poor concentration , absenteeism , accidents , errors , injuries and fatalities that lack of sleep can cause in the workplace . More recently , studies have associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on a nocturnal schedule , the human body never truly adapts to it , says Greg Belenky , MD , director of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University in the USA . " The body 's circadian rhythm that controls our cycles of sleep is set by exposure to daylight . It 's next to impossible to reset this rhythm , " he explains . <p> This rhythm regulates our temperature , lowering it at night when it 's time to sleep , and raising it during the day to keep us alert . So , even if you are tired from a night on the job and go to bed at 8 am , your body fights to keep you awake . A victim of " shift-lag , " the average night shift worker will wake often up around 1 pm , after only 5 hours of sleep , much less than the 7 to 9 hours of zzzs recommended by experts , says Belenky . <p> A good day 's sleep The first step in making a night-owl schedule a healthy one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to awake before reaching a solid 8 hours of sleep , fit in some naps throughout the day . " It 's the total sleep time in 24 hours that counts more than sleeping for longer stretches , " says Belenky . The body takes a mini temperature dip around 4 pm " the perfect time for a siesta . <p> Try some of these daytime sleeping tips from the National Sleep Foundation : <p> Wear wraparound dark glasses on your way home from work to keep the daylight from triggering your internal " daytime " clock . <p> Go directly to sleep after work . Resist turning on the TV , reading a thriller or anything else that might start your mind racing . <p> To push your body temperature in the sleeping zone , keep the bedroom cool , around 26 degrees . Experiment until you get the optimal temperature for your body . <p> Sleep medication is n't recommended without a consultation with your doctor , and then should only be used as a short-term fix . <p> Midnight feasts Shift workers often eat due to boredom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight-loss plan because there is less access to nutritious meals at night . And , again , nature is working against you : " When you 're sleep deprived , you 're more likely to crave food higher in fat and kilojoules , " says Belenky . He also says that when you are lacking sleep , your body ends up with a surplus of glucose , which contributes to weight gain . <p> Being aware of these factors is the first step in sticking to healthy habits . While there are no specific foods proven to help you relax , the best foods for shift workers are the healthy , balanced choices that are best for anybody . The National Sleep Foundation recommends not going to bed too full or too hungry - either feeling could keep you awake . <p> Many shift workers unwind with a drink after work to help them slide into slumber . While it may seem to help , it actually causes you to sleep less soundly . Instead , try aromatherapy , suggests Alan R. Hirsch , MD , FACP , founder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation in Chicago . His studies have found scents like lavender , vanilla , green apple and cucumber promote relaxation . You can get the soothing effect with essential oils , sliced fruit or even an open shampoo bottle " synthetic scents work just as well as natural ones . <p> Getting active As a coping strategy for night shifts , some researchers suggest that aerobic exercise soon after you awaken will raise your body temperature , improve your mood and make you feel more alert for the rest of the day . Others suggest that aerobic exercise one or two hours before commencing your shift will keep you more alert whilst on duty . <p> Do n't , however , sacrifice sleep to fit in exercise , advises Belenky . Why ? " Sleep is tied to performance and safety , " he says . <p> If your job allows it , try to fit in activity while at work to keep yourself alert , even if it 's only a quick walk . Like sleep , exercise adds up throughout the day . The best thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

But the really great news is that this amazing activity is n't as hard as it may look . Trust us " those runners you see gliding effortlessly along in the park not so long ago they were beginners too . <p> Before you start Of course , there are a few things to think about before you start your running routine . Firstly you 'll need a base level of fitness . We recommend that you build up by walking regularly first .

The shoe that 's best for you depends on several factors " your weight , foot shape and the style in which you run . When buying shoes , try them on late in the day when your feet are their largest , and wear the same thickness of sock as you 'll wear when you run . Do n't assume you know your size as feet widen and lengthen with age . It 's a good idea to ask a salesperson from a reputable shoe retailer such as The Athlete 's Foot for help , as all their staff are trained fit technicians . Even better try to find a specialist running store where the experienced staff can analyse your foot movement whilst you run , which can be different to how you stand .

While you 're running , remember that this is an entirely individual sport , so the speed you choose to run has to feel right for you and you alone . It may be a shuffle for some , or a sprint for others , but as long as you 're comfortable that 's all that counts . The idea here is that you learn to listen to your body and run at a pace that suits you best . That said , to gain maximum benefit from your run , ensure you push yourself a little .

Simply defrost overnight in fridge and reheat in a moderate oven for approximately 30 minutes . Try serving with creamy mashed potato and peas .

@@43528321 @3528321/ <h> Top 12 weight-loss myths <p> Are misconceptions about weight loss sabotaging your own efforts ? We talk to the experts to tackle some of the most common weight loss questions ... <p> Article By : Weight Watchers Magazine <p> Have you ever heard , ' The less you eat , the more you 'll lose ' or ' Do n't eat anything after 7pm ' ? We talk to Weight Watchers magazine experts to uncover the truth behind these common weight-loss myths . <p> 1 . ' If I cut out all the fat , I 'll lose weight ' Fat is the most concentrated supplier of kilojoules , but it 's also an essential nutrient for wellbeing . " It 's common for many people to be confused about fat , " says Emma Stirling , Weight Watchers magazine nutrition editor . " We 've been so fat-focused for many years , that most people check fat content on nutrition labels and buy low-fat products . However , these can still have lots of added sugar and so be moderate to high in kilojoules . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can also reduce your intake of ' bad ' fats by switching to low-fat dairy products , eating less meat and baked goods . <p> 2 . ' To burn tummy fat I should do lots of sit-ups ' " Exercising specific muscle groups does n't burn fat from that area , " says Allan Bolton , Weight Watchers fitness advisor and men 's health expert . But restricting your kilojoule intake and exercising burns fat from all over the body , so sit-ups will have a good long-term effect . " It wo n't melt fat away from your tummy , but it will help make you look more toned . " <p> 3 . ' I ca n't lose weight - I 'm big boned ' It 's true that our shape and bone structure are defined largely by genetics , but environmental factors such as diet play a huge part too . Genes may define the weight range you fall into , but you control where you fall within that range . <p> 4 . ' I need to go on a diet ' A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempting , but is ultimately doomed to failure . " Going on a diet almost invariably means coming off a diet , " says Leah Brennan , a psychologist specialising in weight issues at RMIT University in Melbourne . " Only a small percentage of people can maintain dieting long term or indefinitely . " Going on a ' diet ' often provokes feelings of deprivation , which means you quickly get tired of it and regain any lost weight . Instead , focus your attention on adopting healthy eating and physical exercise habits that you can keep up for good . <p> 5 . ' Lifting weights will make me bulk up ' This old myth still makes some women avoid strength training . " Muscle takes up less space in the body than fat because it 's about 2.5 times denser , " says Allan Bolton . " It also has a higher rate of metabolism than fat , and helps you burn more kilojoules . " So in fact , weight training will result in a sleeker silhouette , not the other way around . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I lose ' The best way to lose weight and keep it off is slowly and steadily . You need a certain amount of kilojoules to function , and not getting them can slow your metabolism . Plus , if you do n't eat enough , you might make up for those missing kilojoules by snacking . " If you skip breakfast , you 're more likely to end up eating extra kilojoules mid-morning , " warns Emma Stirling . Breakfast is particularly important as it refuels your body after sleeping and causes energy to be burned more efficiently during the day . <p> 7 . ' Carbs are the enemy ' Anti-carb crusaders have taken foods such as bread and potatoes off the menu for many slimmers . But Emma Stirling says it 's a myth that carbs on their own lead to weight gain . " There is no evidence to suggest that high carbohydrate intakes are associated with increased levels of being overweight or obese , " she says . " Some people also mistakenly believe that high-carb foods are always high-kilojoule foods . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kilojoules as an apple . " <p> 8 . ' I should n't eat anything after 7pm ' Successful weight loss is n't so much about when you eat , but what and how much . " There 's no research to support that eating after a magic time in the evening leads to greater weight gain , " says Emma Stirling . But snacking in the evening can be a trap for many people , so she recommends that if you ca n't resist an after-dinner treat , save ProPoints values from earlier in the day and enjoy with a free conscience . <p> 9 . ' I ca n't keep to the goals I set ' Sticking to a weight-loss program long term is n't always easy . But many slimmers are guilty of setting unrealistic goals from the start . You ca n't expect to she 'd a large number of kilos in a matter of a few weeks , any more than you can start training for a marathon from scratch one day and expect to run it the next . The best way to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , progressive goals , and reward yourself for achieving each one . Slow and steady is always the healthiest and most effective approach . <p> 10 . ' I can lose weight through exercise alone ' Regardless of how much exercise you do , you still need to follow a healthy eating plan in order to effectively lose body fat and keep it off . Bear in mind that even though you can easily eat 3000 kilojoules in five minutes , it will take the average person around three 20-minute jogging sessions to burn it off .
