@@59299052 @8299052/ <h> Security and Safeguarding <h> Security like no other <p> We understand how important it is for you to protect and safeguard everyone in your community , which is why IRIS Connect ensures outstanding security. - We have thought very carefully about our legal responsibilities and your peace of mind , building a system that 's rooted in data protection , privacy and safety . <h> Why are data protection , privacy and security so important ? <p> Video is a powerful tool for accelerating teaching and learning , but it is vital that the students featured in a lesson recording are appropriately protected at all times . <p> A school leader who purchases a system that does not meet basic data protection requirements exposes the school to a range of significant liabilities , not least the failure of an Ofsted inspection on the grounds of safeguarding . <h> What questions should I ask ? <p> Our platform is designed to be a safe professional learning community , but not all video technology providers prioritise your safety in the same way . Not everyone abides by the relevant legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures . <p> Here are a series of basic questions you can use to help establish whether a video system puts your security first . <p> These considerations will help you check whether a provider is aware of the legal framework that schools have to operate within , provides an agreement that meets it and can look after your data in such a way that it will not be lost or accessed by others . <h> Questions relating to agreements and data protection <p> The DPA outlines how an individual 's personal information is used by businesses , the government and organisations . Information must be used fairly and lawfully and kept safe and secure . <p> The DPA outlines 8 principles that organisations must comply with . IRIS Connect has built its system around these principles and the Information Commissioners Office 's ( ICO ) privacy by design approach that promotes privacy and data protection compliance from the start . We are always putting our user 's rights at the heart of what we do . <p> The ICO outline that the distinction between a data controller and data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there is a data breach , it is essential for both the organisations involved and the ICO to be able to determine where responsibility lies . <p> The DfE outlines that schools , as data controllers , have a responsibility to ensure that the processing carried out by their service provider complies with the DPA . The best way to do this is to have a contract and a data processing agreement in place . <p> IRIS Connect ensures our users are always in control of their data and videos . We will never ask for ownership . Our users are the data controllers and we act as data processors , which is outlined in our Organisation Administrator Agreement . <p> Keeping data within the customer 's geographic region will ensure it complies to the requirements for that customer 's organisation and is covered by the necessary legal protection . <p> As a global company with customers in 6 continents , - IRIS Connect respects geographical regulations for data protection , such as the EU Data Protection Directive . We ensure secure processing and store all client data within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stored within the EU . <h> Questions- relating to privacy <p> From a data protection perspective , this is key to addressing informational privacy best practice . This includes the ability of a person to control , edit , manage and delete information about themselves and to decide how and to what extent such information is communicated to others , as outlined in the ICO Privacy Impact Assessment Code of Practice . <p> By ensuring the user keeps control of their data , the system also keeps its focus as a developmental tool with the user 's interests at its core rather than as an assessment tool . <p> We ensure all the organisations in our community appoint an Organisation Administrator who is responsible for agreeing to and enforcing the IRIS Connect EULA . <p> The IRIS Connect EULA also makes clear that our system is to be used only within a supportive developmental framework . It states that IRIS Connect act solely as the data processor , the school acts as the data controller and the end user the data owner . This agreement also gives individual users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not be recorded or shared with any other IRIS Connect user without their explicit permission . <p> The ICO encourages organisations to ensure that privacy and data protection is a key consideration in the early stages of any project and then throughout its lifecycle . Taking a privacy by design approach is an essential tool for- minimising privacy and data sharing risks and building trust . <p> By adopting a system where only the user makes decisions about what data to- share and to whom , the system is inline with a user driven personal development model not assessment . <p> The IRIS Connect system is based on individual user accounts and permissioning , where each user has their own personal username and password for their account in our platform . The observed user has to agree to a recording taking place before the system allows another user to connect to the camera . The same protections exist once a video has been encrypted and uploaded . This means users are only able to see data that has been explicitly shared with them . Users are limited to sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other organisations can be enabled at the permission of the Organisation Administrator . <p> Users have complete control over who has access to their data by deciding to share reflections either with individual users or into a group library . A fundamental principle of the system is that users will never lose sight or control of their video . They will always be able to see the video and any associated data . Users retain the right to delete a video or remove sharing privileges at any time . <h> Questions for cloud-based solutions <p> The DPA contains special provisions where schools use a data processor : <p> 1 . You must choose a data processor that provides sufficient guarantees about its security measures to protect the processing it will do for you 2 . You must take reasonable steps to check that those security measures are being put into practice <p> IRIS Connects stores all data within a world-class environment trusted by numerous government and public sector organisations to store highly sensitive data .

This environment has qualified for the following assurance programs : <p> The ICO states : Information security is probably the most important area for schools to concentrate on . The loss of or unauthorised access to personal information is likely to cause most harm to pupils , parents or staff and is most likely to result in us taking action . Individuals have a right to take action for compensation if loss of personal data causes them damage . The Information Commissioner now has the power to impose a monetary penalty for serious contraventions of the data protection principles. Not taking security seriously causes a reputational risk and could cost you money . <p> The IRIS Connect system is based on individual user accounts and permissioning , where each user has their own personal username and password for their account in our platform . <p> Each account is linked to an email address , which needs to be verified .

The ICO states : it is good practice to encrypt data whilst it is being transferred from one device to another ( e.g. across the internet or over a wireless connection ) to provide effective protection against interception of the communication by a third party whilst the data is in transfer. <p> IRIS Connect ensures any data in transit is encrypted using the leading industry practice ( TLS 1.2 ) . <p> Inline with principle 5 ( data retention ) and principle 7 ( security ) of the DPA , - it is not only important to monitor data transfer and storage but also the deletion of data , where data is deleted from a live system , it should also be deleted from any back-ups as well. <p> Customer data ( financial ) will be retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( non-financial ) will be disposed of following termination of licence .

At a time of dwindling budgets , school leaders need to act quickly and take practical steps to retain teachers at the start of their career . <h> Looking at the numbers : what 's the situation ? <p> We all know about the current issues with teacher recruitment and retention , with the " teacher recruitment crisis " a buzzword that features in media headlines on a regular basis . <p> The facts are : <p> 1 in 8 teachers are leaving the profession after 1 year <p> 15% of teachers are leaving within 3 years ( the highest rate since records began in 1996 ) <p> 1 in 3 teachers are leaving within the first 5 years <p> ( Stats from YouGov and the National Union of Teachers , 2015 , and Database of Teacher Records and School Workforce Census , 2016 ) <p> Of course , it 's more cost-effective to increase teacher retention than it is to keep recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , year out . Why keep pouring scarce resources into a leaking barrel when it is cheaper and more effective to repair the barrel ? <p> So how exactly can school leaders go about repairing the barrel to increase the retention of NQTs ? <h> Listen : what are NQTs telling us they need ? <p> We could speculate all day about what might or might not help school leaders increase the retention of NQTs . But it makes more sense to have a look at what NQTs themselves have to say on the matter . <p> The number one reason for teachers staying in teaching has been found to be because they feel like they are good at it ( Menzies et al. , 2015 ) . <p> And the need for teachers to feel good at their job does n't go away . In fact , 20% of teachers surveyed said it actually increased in importance for them ( Menzies et al. , 2015 ) . <p> A teacher who feels that they are good at their job has a strong sense of self-efficacy . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lecturer in Mathematics Education at the University of Cambridge , explained that a teacher with a strong sense of self-efficacy is more likely to : <p> Be motivated and successfully meet goals <p> Be resilient and flexible when faced with change <p> Have the confidence and ability to choose appropriate approaches in the classroom to meet the needs of learners <p> Effective training and ongoing professional learning can help develop a strong sense of self-efficacy in teachers , therefore leading to the feeling that they are good at their job and impacting on retention . <p> This could particularly help with the retention of NQTs as the Why Teach ? report found that CPD and career progression are much more important to younger teachers ( Menzies et al. , 2015 ) . <p> So there it is from the horse 's mouth ; providing effective CPD could be one way to increase the retention of NQTs . Using video is a way for school leaders to facilitate the types of CPD activities that have proven to be effective at a time when budgets are particularly tight . <h> 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as try and ease teacher workload , school leaders should do all they can to cut unnecessary activities . The government and Ofsted have stipulated that this includes any marking and paperwork that wo n't directly contribute to outcomes for learners . Read Ofsted 's stance here . <h> 3 . Develop a positive professional learning culture <p> It 's important for schools to cultivate a positive culture , where teachers feel trusted and supported to take informed risks . This will contribute to the wellbeing of teachers and have an impact on retention . <h> A problem shared is a problem halved : the importance of support <p> Make sure to check in with your NQTs . Ensuring that they feel supported and able to talk to you can go a long way . <p> This will also add to the development of a positive culture in your school , meaning that your school is a place where retention levels and teacher wellbeing are high and improvements to teaching and learning can flourish . <h> Are you a NQT ? One simple tip for coping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might feel on top of things , but a week later you could be struggling . If things are feeling difficult , it 's important that you talk to someone . <p> It 's an age-old saying , but a problem shared really can be a problem halved . Do n't underestimate the power of just talking to someone ; this could be those close to you , perhaps a friend or family member . <p> You might prefer to talk to someone who also has experience of teaching , but whilst a moan can be therapeutic , be careful that a conversation with a colleague does n't leave you both feeling more frustrated . <p> If you 're feeling really overwhelmed , why not tell your mentor ? Hopefully they will be able to offer you advice and help you develop a manageable plan for coping .

It gave them access to video clips , resources and discussion questions focused on dialogic teaching , via IRIS Connect . Teachers then came together to reflect , discuss and learn before implementing the new strategies in their own classrooms . <p> We caught up with year 6 teacher Dan Sheffrin to find out about his experience of IRIS Connect film club and the impact it 's had on him , the school and their learners . <p> IRIS Connect : Why is film club effective ? Dan : It works because it ties into what we are already doing , becoming part of the whole picture . For instance , yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the learning from a film club session about dialogic teaching . <p> IRIS Connect : Is that because of the specific content on dialogic teaching , or the flexible format of film club ? - Dan : Its both . The content , which was really useful in itself , and the format of film club . The ready-made modules or episodes really help because half the job is done for you . <p> IRIS Connect : Tell us how you are using film club at the moment ? Dan : We are using groups of three teachers from across year groups to promote mixing and better spread ideas across the school . <p> Find out what the teachers at Whitecote Primary- School think of IRIS Connect film club <p> - - <p> IRIS Connect : So its an intentional network ? Dan : Yes . It means that people feel secure within the triad but can also go beyond it to get new ideas. - Were using whole school priorities as focuses for the triads e.g. at the moment we are looking at reciprocal reading and seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are using film club for change management ? Dan : Yes , film club is a useful template for change management . The next topic were hoping to explore through it , is Blooms Taxonomy . It feels like a very sustainable approach to embedding whole school priorities . <p> IRIS Connect : Has using film club affected the professional learning culture at all ? If so , how ? Dan : Definitely ! The culture is less top down , people are more open and its created an atmosphere of trust between teachers . <p> IRIS Connect : What exactly is it about film club that 's made a difference ? Dan : The clips are high quality and lead to fantastic face-to-face discussion during the film club screening . The online comments function is very helpful for sharing thoughts beyond the triads . This combination of formats works really well. - Like with anything in school , you need someone with capacity to keep this going and it must have support from leadership . <p> IRIS Connect : Any improvements we can make to film club ? Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own school , so wed like more episodes please . <p> IRIS Connect : Thanks Dan , we plan to keep creating new episodes with different teaching and learning focuses from a range of schools around the world .

After initially seeing the IRIS Connect platform at a local cluster school 's learning-group ' training day in 2015 , our deputy-head teacher was keen to investigate further . <p> Soon enough , we invested in the system and put forward two teachers ( myself and the year 6 teacher ) to be in charge of getting used to the equipment , ensuring that it was embedded into our practice and a consistent part of our professional development . <p> We began using IRIS Connect in January 2016 . Rather than just being seen as another bolt-on ' or gimmick ' for the new curriculum by our fellow colleagues , we knew it would be important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . <p> Working with our deputy-headteacher , we planned a 3 half-termly phased ' approach to help us structure the way teachers got used to the equipment ; becoming familiar and competent at recording themselves . <p> We also had a liaison with Richard from Impact Matters , a leadership consultancy that act as regional partner for IRIS Connect , working with schools and colleges in Wales and the South West of England . Richard helped us to think about coaching methodology , and how to encourage peer-to-peer support amongst the teachers to help motivate and encourage this new approach in our school . <h> Building the confidence to share with others <p> Initially , however , we had to get used to the equipment and filming our lessons . They say with IRIS Connect , you need to get 4 recordings done on-the-bounce ' to get over that initial awareness that you 're being filmed throughout your lesson ; and we both found this to be true ! - Equally , after 4 recordings , we found that we became less concerned with our looks ' and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact the lesson had on the children . We began recording lessons just to see if a new idea would work , or how a group would react to a certain task etc . <p> Once you 've recorded a lesson , you have the ability to share it internally from your account to that of a colleague . At first , we both found it slightly nerve-racking to share our lessons ; it 's a lesson observation all over again ! Will he think I went on too long during the input ? Were the children engaged ? Was there enough challenge ? All these questions flooded our minds before we hit the share button . <p> However , to the contrary , the comments ( which can be tagged within minute and second intervals of the video " like a Facebook feed ! ) were very encouraging and up-lifting . As we were both in the same boat ' , we both enjoyed having the opportunity to be the fly-on-the-wall ' in each other 's lessons . More importantly still , we could silence the harshest critics ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is arguably forgotten in the current teaching climate . <h> Setting up coaching triads <p> Once we had set up coaching triads , our colleagues enthusiastically took to video coaching , recording both long and short lessons in order to get over the 4 recording hurdle . ' <p> On a staff-meeting feedback session , we found that the feeling of anxiety before sharing a video was common . However , we knew that we did n't have to share our video and that if the lesson was an absolute car-crash , we could always choose not to and try again the next day . <p> Currently , we are still in the process of recording lessons with set focuses to help us get used to the coaching process , improving our professional development and overall teaching and learning . <h> Looking to the future <p> Although it is still early-days for us , we are hoping that we can build a bank ' of good practice videos that will help not only the staff at Treleigh , but maybe even the schools in our cluster and learning group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PGCE students are benefiting from the impact of seeing themselves teach and saving time arranging demonstrations and observations of other teachers , rather than just logging on to watch best practice of a particular focus they need . <p> We 're in the business of educating , and this life-long education culture needs to be alive and modelled by the teachers to the children they teach . <p> IRIS Connect is certainly an educational journey for us , one we are only beginning , but are excited to be on . <h> What is IRIS Connect ? <p> IRIS Connect is a secure , personalized place for teachers to record , analyze and reflect on their practice . <p> Teachers can take control and arrange their own professional learning experiences and resources .

Here she explains how . <h> Why did you decide to develop a growth mindset in your students ? <p> At Braunstone Frith , we believe failure is n't a permanent state ; if you get something wrong it does n't  matter , you just need to keep working at it until you get it right and actually the more you fail the better it is for you because when you do get it , itll really stick with you . <h> How did you do it ? <p> My students used to be really fussy and claim that they could n't do things . So , I introduced the idea of a growth mindset through grit , the perseverance and passion for long-term goals and used the phrase keep on swimming from the film Finding Nemo to help them understand . <p> They now know that if they find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask themselves , how am I going to do this ? <p> Theyve got three options to choose from : <p> 1 . They can ask the person next to them <p> 2 . They can have a go , get it wrong and then ask the teacher to guide them a little bit more <p> 3 . They can ask the teaching- assistant who 's also in the classroom <h> What impact has it had ? <p> Before working with IRIS Connect to develop grit and a growth mindset , I had two children who werent very confident learners . Over time they have got better and now they 're independent learners . Theyll just get on with the task at hand and quite often move on to the more challenging work . In terms of progress they 're making strides because I 've been able to successfully embed that mindset in them . <h> How did IRIS Connect help you ? <p> Through the regular use of IRIS Connect to film my lessons , I have been able to see which children have n't quite got to grips with the concept of grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then use the videos to work out what the barriers are to them developing it . <p> I also created a showreel demonstrating how well my children have developed a growth mindset to show my professional learning progress . I started off with a lesson right at the start of term where the idea was there but it was n't very clear what I was trying to do . Then in the videos towards the end , you can really see how the children have developed as a result of how I 've developed , in terms of the language and questioning that Ive used . I also interviewed two children who were using grit and could explain it really well . <p> I could n't have done any of this without IRIS Connect , its really helped me a lot . <h> What are your plans moving forward for this ? <p> Obviously there 's a transition between my class going up to the next year , - so I 'd like to use IRIS Connect to show their new teacher what they are capable of and how they are using a growth mindset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them and maybe use that or even show them the videos of them using it at the start of the year to remind them . I 'm also planning on using it again with my class next year but this time jumping straight in with the techniques that have worked and refining them to meet the needs of the new children I 'll be working with .

One was a Good bit of practice that he felt was worthy of celebrating as it had inspired his pupils . <p> 2 . The next was an example of Bad This was more unconventional but essential . He shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he learned the most from . We can learn from excellent practice but the mistakes we make , if reflected upon rightly , can be the richest source of learning and developing . <p> 3 . The final bit of Ugly practice was something that he had identified that he wanted to work on and wanted input from the other teachers in the room . This piece of humility instantly disarmed those present and got teachers to open up and share the things they struggled with . <h> Treasure Hunting <p> In some cases , the first phases of using video professional learning have been pitched to staff as opportunities to Treasure Hunt ' and celebrate areas of strength and development . <p> One leader adopted the use of IRIS Connect in school with the aim of putting staff at ease and recognising the power of self-reflection as a tool for treasure hunting . <p> Ideally , he wanted to use video to show examples of how the teacher he was coaching was demonstrating real progress . He asked the coachee to put together a list of 10 Greatest Hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing real impact . <p> Other leaders have started using Celebration ' or What Went Well ? ' as the first area to be looked at during self-reflection sessions . Understanding how our best practice works can be an excellent and insightful process in realising how we can improve in our classrooms . <p> There are people that naturally gravitate to the weaker and more disruptive elements of what they are seeing . I believe it is much more useful to use video to understand what is working well when addressing what can be improved . <h> Examples of Experimental CPD <p> Sometimes the best thing to do is to film ourselves with no agenda and just see what is happening in our classroom out of sheer curiosity . <p> Here are 4 examples of what has happened when teachers have used IRIS Connect to do just that : <p> 1 . The teacher decided to see how long it took for her to pose a question and wait for a response from her pupils . On average she waited only around 3 seconds for a response . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her students to come up with a coherent response in that time ? She tweaked her questioning strategies to make sure every child had time to think on their own , talk to a partner , share with their table and then allow for whole class discussion . <p> 2 . This teacher decided to measure the time they spent talking versus the pupils . He wanted to know who was working harder in the lesson , him or his pupils . He used the IRIS Connect timer to time teacher versus pupil talk . <p> 3 . Another teacher spent time measuring pupil engagement in the lesson via another analytical tool . After looking through the chart that the tool produced , he got the chance to see what it was that was most effective method for engaging his learners . <p> 4 . This teacher , upon self-reflection of his lessons , decided to map out zones of engagement in his classroom . He divided the zones by colour : Red = off task , Amber = mixed levels of engagement and Green = engaged . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video can be a great way of giving teachers the chance to watch themselves back simply out of curiosity . The promise is that they have the power to shape their own CPD and not just have CPD done too them . <p> " Leaders become great , not because of their power , but because of their ability to empower others . " John C. Maxwell <p> In his book , The 5 Levels of Leadership , Maxwell writes that " great leaders do their utmost to bring the best out of each person within their sphere of influence . As they unleash the unique strengths of the people on their team , the entire organisation rises to new heights .

To really develop their teaching they also need to reflect on and develop their own teaching . <p> Teachers who engage in AFL give continual , explicit feedback to students and assist them in answering the following questions : <p> Where am I going ? <p> Where am I now ? <p> How can I close the gap between the two ? <p> Try flipping this around and asking yourself these three key questions about your own practice .

Through IRIS Connect film club , teachers gained access to video clips , resources and discussion questions focused on dialogic teaching . They came together to collaboratively reflect and discuss the strategies used , before trying them in their own classrooms . <h> Why did you choose to run IRIS Connect film club ? <p> Toni : We chose to run IRIS Connect film club as part of our whole school teaching and learning strategy to encourage people to experiment and take risks . The different episodes of film club provided us with a specific focus for this and encouraged dialogue and corridor talk amongst the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secondary sectors attended the first meeting . This included those who were already using IRIS Connect as well as those that had n't  . <h> What do you like about- it ? <p> Toni : The opportunity to try something new and to discuss it with both our primary and secondary colleagues . It also forces me to dedicate time to my personal development that often gets buried under the day to day role of a classroom teacher . <h> Has it- affected the professional learning culture ? <p> Toni : Yes . It 's encouraged people to use IRIS Connect for the first time and allowed teachers who experimented with the strategies , an opportunity to step out of their comfort zone . Self-reflection is an important part of our Academy Improvement Plan so it gave people a very structured way of approaching this . <h> What exactly was it about IRIS Connect film club that made a difference ? <p> Toni : The neutral video clips , collaborative approach and clear focus are all part of the appeal of film club . For instance , the collaborative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues about how things had gone . Where we found a particular area of the strategy a challenge , it was useful to coach each other towards possible solutions . <p> The content in episode 1 : the Empire Talks Back is great . Especially because the teacher in the clip used strategies that would n't be traditionally encouraged , such as not giving praise . <h> Will you be using film club in the future ? <p> Toni : Yes . We are due to run the second episode early January so hopefully , with more experience , I will have a better understanding of how we can use it going forward , and how many people experimented with the strategy after the meeting . My goal is to use the film club approach and apply our own classroom clips that coincide with our teaching and learning improvement plan . <h> Can you suggest any improvements ? <p> Toni : To aid the development of discussion I would have liked to have watched the pre-screening clip a couple of times within the session with my colleagues .

Here are 10 easy to implement tips to help schools move towards a culture where improvements in teaching and learning can thrive . These tips also support the implementation of the Department for Education 's Standard for teachers ' professional development . <h> 1 . Stop and think about classroom culture <p> As a school , take some time to consider the culture that you want to see in classrooms and how your professional learning culture can reflect this . For example , if schools want to nurture a culture based on growth mindset then arguably teachers need to embrace this concept too . <h> 2 . Work as a collective to create a common , learner-focused , vision <p> Think carefully about the way in which learner needs are identified and consider involving all teachers in evidence gathering . Referring to data and using tools , such as video can support this . Whatever approach , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social capital . <p> Work back from desired goals and plan accordingly . If developing Growth Mindset is the aim for example , then ask : What do we need to know ? How will teaching have to change ? Which professional learning activities will support this ? How will we know if our changes are effective ? How can we refine our work ? <h> 4 . Create small , collaborative learning project groups <p> Schools tend to be incredibly hierarchical but for project teams to be most effective , established hierarchies might need to be left at the door . The most suitable project lead is not necessarily the most senior . Whoever leads , they need to be empowered with the full support of the senior leadership team ( SLT ) and have time capacity . <h> 5 . Establish norms for positive professional dialogue <p> Build trust , openness , and tolerance . Embrace differences of opinion ; focus on the teaching not the teacher , the learning rather than the learners . Video can be a great way of initiating teacher led professional dialogue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all involved , including any teachers and pupils . <h> 6 . Focus on real practice rather than best <p> A culture focused on the dissemination of best practice ' can lead to a directed , top down approach where teachers are told what good practice is . For a truly collaborative , professional learning culture , everyone needs to feel they have something to learn and something to contribute . Teachers should be actively involved in interpreting and constructing knowledge rather than being expected to accept and enact ideas dictated to them by others . <h> 7 . Reduce risk and anxiety <p> It 's important to understand people 's concerns and meet them where they are . Video is a powerful tool for becoming more reflective about teaching and learning . Creating a video club for a small group of teachers using existing classroom footage for collective reflection can encourage reflective practice in a non-threatening , non-judgemental environment . <h> 8 . Underpin professional learning and dialogue with evidence and expertise <p> To be relevant and effective , dialogue must be driven by evidence from the classroom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical perspective , imagining alternative possibilities and becoming acquainted with others ' practices . <h> 9 . Practice what we preach <p> A school 's professional learning culture should be driven by the culture they want to see in their classrooms and vice versa . Take collaboration , creativity , communication and critical thinking . If we want our learners to embrace these skills then we need to model this in our own professional learning . <h> 10 . Share challenges and celebrate success <p> Remember to schedule regular check-ins and updates . Consider ways of involving the wider community too by sharing developments and achievements with those outside of school - parents , governors and other schools . Video can be a powerful collaborative tool and an excellent way of capturing evidence . Utilising social media can also help you to reach a wider audience . <p> Is there anything you 've found works for creating a positive school culture ?

You 're not alone . It 's understandable that you may even think they are the same thing , but they 're not and both warrant consideration in the workplace . <p> So what 's the different between coaching and mentoring and how do they each benefit teachers ? <h> Making use of mentoring <p> Mentoring is about developing a supportive , iterative relationship between a mentor and a less experienced mentee ; a structured , sustained process for supporting professional learners through significant career transitions ' ( CfBT Education Trust , 2010 ) . The idea is that mentoring ends when the mentee is deemed confident or capable enough to continue in their new role , carrying out their duties without oversight . <p> The mentor typically has more experience than their mentee , and their goal is to teach the mentee tips that they have found to work successfully . <h> Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for continuous improvement through peer-to-peer review and discussions , to enable the development of a specific aspect of a professional learner 's practice ( CfBT Education Trust , 2010 ) . <p> At the heart of coaching is the belief that the person being coached already has the ability to improve within themselves . Whitemore ( 2002 , p.8 ) defined it as the process of unlocking a person 's potential to maximise their own potential . <p> A coach helps someone to realise the tools they need to achieve their own potential , rather than explicitly teaching them how to improve , and is about supporting the teacher , at any stage of their career . <p> Coaching creates objective feedback , and your coach can help you to set your own goals and personal targets . Your coach is there to guide you , not to judge or assess you . <p> Unlike in mentoring , a less experienced colleague can coach a more qualified one . One of our case study schools explains : <p> " As a school I think that we 've learnt that coaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your level of experience as a teacher is . I 'm shortly going to be working with a colleague of mine and I know that she 's got some great tricks and ideas that I want to learn . So even though I 'm much more experienced than her as a teacher she can still teach me things . " <h> Which should you use and when ? <p> The main difference between coaching and mentoring is that mentoring is especially useful for a specific period of time , to aid the changeover into undertaking a new position or making a career transition , whilst coaching is continuous and can help you throughout your entire career . Both are about guidance , but coaching is a really useful tool for helping a teacher take ownership of their own professional development . It 's this encouragement that your CPD is your own that distinguishes coaching from mentoring.

This personal account outlined the impact on confidence and motivation that judgements can have on a teacher ( as it would in any profession ! ) . The following except is particularly telling of the challenge that 's faced : <h> " I had received no written feedback from the observation . I could remember bits and pieces of the suggestions for improvement , but what stuck in my head most was that grade . Inadequate , inadequate , inadequate .

The debates taking place online and the Secret Teacher 's comments certainly make a argument for the obsession with lesson observation grades eclipsing the value of feedback . <p> Since I began writing this , David Didau , Ross McGill and Tom Sherrington have published blogs following their meeting with Mike Cladingbowl , OfSTED 's Head of Schools at Ofsted HQ , announcing that " lesson observation grades are over " . In Tom Sherrington 's post he highlights Mike Cladingbowl 's good intentions for Ofsted and his explicit directions on whether individual lessons should be graded .

Without context it has limited value in improving teaching and learning .

In an interview with Sarah Montague for BBC Radio 4 , he dispels some popular myths about what does and does n't matter in your school . <h> Factors affecting student achievement " Hattie 's take : <h> 1 . Class Size <p> Reducing class size does enhance student achievement but only by a marginal amount . Our preoccupation with class size is an enigma ; what 's really important is that the teacher learns to be an expert in their own class , no matter what size it is. <h> 2 . Types of Schools <p> Academies , grammars and state schools do n't actually differ too much inside , what 's more important is good leadership within your school . Look at who has control over how teachers are recruited and how they progress after being selected . <h> 3 . Uniform <p> Conversations about school uniform are distracting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it makes no difference whatsoever to student achievement . Your school should decide whether or not you want to enforce a uniform , but waste no further time debating it . <h> 4 . Homework <p> Homework has been found to have no effect on the progress of primary school children . To get it right without getting rid of it , children at primary level should be given less projects and more activities that reinforce what they learnt in the lesson that day instead . <p> Whilst homework does make more of a difference to secondary school children , too much emphasis is placed on it . 5-10 minutes of practising what was taught that day at school has the same effect as 1-2 hours does . <h> 5 . Extra-Curricular Activities <p> These are powerful in terms of helping children learn . The best predictor of health , wealth and happiness in adult life is not academic achievement at school , but the number of years schooled . Extra-curricular activities can be a fun and inviting way to get children to enjoy school and want to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Does TV have a negative effect on a child 's progress ? Not directly . The problem with a child watching too much television is that it stops them from spending that time learning in more productive ways , such as by reading or developing their communication and relationship skills . <h> 7 . A Child 's Birthday <p> Where a child 's birthday falls in the school year has an effect on their progress initially , as there is a big difference in the ability of a child who is 5 years 1 month and one who is 5 years 11 months . However , no difference is found after 2-3 years of schooling . <p> What has a more dramatic effect on a child 's academic achievements is whether that child makes a friend in their first month at school . <h> 8 . Streaming and Teacher Talk <p> Whether your school is streamed or not , what must be recognised is that children learn better from their peers than from the teacher or a book . If a child is struggling to grasp a new concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students explains it correctly . <p> We teach children to be passive and listen in the classroom , whilst a great teacher does the opposite : letting their students be active both in what they know and what they do n't . Effective learning is about exploring ideas , making mistakes and adapting to them ; not just sitting and listening to explanations from the teacher . <h> 9 . Testing <p> There 's no problem with testing per se , but tests at the end of the year are n't beneficial as by then both the teacher and the student have moved on from that particular topic . <p> If tests are to be used , they should be done to practice and reinforce what has recently been taught . <h> 10 . Student Expectation <p> Telling a child do your best ' is the worst thing a teacher or parent can do . A successful teacher establishes a student 's expectations of their abilities and then dispels those expectations by telling them they can do better . What a student achieved yesterday should never be okay tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When asked what the UK education system needs to learn , Hattie answered that we need to get rid of the mentality that if a student does n't succeed , it 's because they were incapable . Replace it with : if a student does n't achieve , it 's because they did n't put in the effort or were n't properly supported . <p> What Hattie wants to make clear is that a student 's ability to achieve academically primarily comes down toteacher expertise . How teachers think and make daily decisions and judgements is the most important thing within a school . <p> Hattie finishes the interview with a clear message : schools need to stop thinking about things that do n't really matter and instead talk about teacher expertise , passion , diagnosis and practice . This then , might help us to reach his goal for the UK : to make all our teachers more like our top 20-30%.

Express appreciation <p> Teachers can often feel unappreciated and battered by the ever changing education landscape and negative press . Creating a supportive positive environment within school and telling your staff how much they 're valued can really help to build a more confident culture . Make a habit of telling your teachers thank you , it 's quick , easy and can make a real difference ! <h> 2 .

However it 's also worth remembering that strengths still need to be honed and improved , just like weaknesses . One way to build confidence is to allow them to mentor a teacher who struggles in an area they thrive in. <h> 4 . Provide suggestions for improvement <p> Give teachers professional development opportunities that can act as a supportive guide for improvement . Most people are aware of their weaknesses but do n't know how to fix them , which leads to a lack of confidence . Creating a culture that hinges around peer support and collaboration and providing time and tools for teachers to develop is great for building confidence and a stronger culture as a whole .

Here are their 3 tips : <p> Share how other teachers deal with difficult students successfully . Some students will only misbehave with certain teachers or in certain subjects depending on where their strengths and weaknesses lie .

Often students do n't realise that how they behave affects other students and seeing it on video helps them to understand the consequences of their actions . <p> Highlight learning difficulties by asking an inclusion member of staff to watch your lesson either live or recorded , and then feedback about where they feel the problem is . This can then be shared with other teachers to help adjust lessons or teaching methods in order to better cater for the student and hopefully improve their performance . <h> IRIS Connect Top Tip : <p> Once you have identified students that require further support , use IRIS Connect to record each of their lessons over the course of a few weeks .

( See Figure 1 below ) <p> Similarly , Darling-Hammond ( 2000 ) conducted a comprehensive analysis of state-level data from all 50 states and found that well-prepared teachers can have a greater impact on student achievement than poverty , language background , and minority status . Education researchers and practitioners have reached a consensus : teacher quality matters most . <h> Teacher quality is an equity issue <p> Students placed with high-performing teachers progress three times faster than those placed with lower performing teachers . And students placed with low-performing teachers for several years in a row suffer an educational loss that is largely irreversible ( Sanders &amp; Rivers , 1996 ; McKinsey &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubling that our most qualified and best-prepared teachers are not equitably distributed throughout our schools . <p> For example , research shows that teachers at high minority and high poverty schools are more likely to have less content expertise and certifications in core academic areas ( Jerald , 2002 ) . We must provide all of our students with high quality teaching , but particularly our most vulnerable students . If we want our students to have great teaching , we have to provide our teachers with effective professional learning . <h> So , what makes professional learning effective ? <p> Over the past 30 years , researchers have synthesized the studies on the effectiveness of different elements of teacher professional training ( e.g. , Fullan , 1991,1993 ; Joyce &amp; Showers , 1980,1995 ; Joyce &amp; Calhoun , 2010 ) .

However , individually these elements are insufficient to enable most teachers to achieve personal mastery of the content or to actually transfer new skills into their classrooms . <p> Unfortunately , most of the PD that teachers receive does not contain all of these elements and is therefore insufficient . <h> Workshops alone are insufficient <p> For decades , there has been substantial criticism that most professional learning across the United States fails to change teacher practice or impact student achievement ( Guskey , 2003 ) . Educators have lamented the fact that most PD is delivered to teachers in the form of in-service workshops that are disconnected from teachers ' actual classroom environment and practice ( Banilower , Campbell , Malzahn , Smith , Weis , &amp; Weiss , 2013 ) . <p> These are usually one-time events that flood teachers with new information and then send them back to their classrooms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in by the district or state typically leads these events . These experts are often good at what they do but unavailable as a resource during the teachers ' implementation in their own classrooms . <p> They can not provide the follow-up support and coaching that is necessary to ensure that teachers translate new knowledge and skills from the professional learning activity to their own instructional practice . Instead , teachers are left to implement and measure their effectiveness using the skill without help from a mentor or coach . <p> Instructional coaches , principals , and researchers all agree on the experiences that are necessary for effective professional learning . The problem is that creating authentic , context-specific models of teaching and providing coaching and performance feedback is logistically challenging and cost prohibitive . <p> At IRIS Connect , we believe that technology can overcome these logistical challenges and provide educators with the experiences that make PD effective .

Self-reflection can help you recognise the progress you made in a lesson , whilst simultaneously allowing you to consider improvements that you could make . <p> " Follow effective action with quiet reflection , from the quiet reflection will come even more effective action " <p> We learn by experiences and mistakes . But , unless we question ourselves about what our experiences mean and think actively about them , research has shown that we wo n't make any changes .

So , logic dictates that waiting until later to reflect is more beneficial . <h> Let 's consider the four modes of thinking <h> 1 . Technological <p> Technological thinking uses knowledge gained from an external source and relies on practice that has already been proven as effective e.g. a teacher adopting general policies that are part of their school 's culture . <h> 2 . Situational <p> Situational thinking focuses on information that is embedded within a specific context and moment of time e.g. a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quick and responsive ; action is taken immediately . <h> 3 . Deliberate <p> Deliberate thinking occurs when the teacher seeks more information than that which the immediate situation provides e.g. by looking back on the lesson after it has ended , asking students for their opinions , discussing the lesson with colleagues . Teachers who want to better understand why the lesson went the way it did would utilize deliberate thinking . <h> 4 . Dialectic <p> Like deliberate thinking , dialectic thinking aims to gain greater understanding of a situation , but dialectic thinking has the goal of generating solutions and making improvements . <p> Technological and situational thinking are both reactionary , whereas deliberate and dialectic thinking are self-reflective . They can only take place after the lesson has ended , when you are feeling open-minded and ready to consider why the lesson went the way it did and able to think carefully about how to make changes and improvements . <h> How do I self-reflect ? <p> Ask yourself questions that challenge your assumptions ; how effectively am I performing ? What are my strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas ? What improvements have I made in this lesson and what do I need to do now ? How will I know I have made improvements ? <p> Video can be a great way to aid reflection . Since you can only self-reflect effectively once you have left the lesson environment , it could be easy to forget exactly everything that was going on at the time . Video can help provide you with an objective perspective ; helping you to notice things you may not have otherwise remembered . Videos can also become resources that you can re-visit and watch again to gain deeper insight into the lesson . <p> Developing a habit of self-reflecting will lead to a natural process of evaluation ; you will become accustomed to asking yourself these questions and because self-reflection is a cyclical process , once you start to implement changes in your lessons , the reflective and evaluative cycle will begin again . <p> Self-reflection is not about focusing solely on the negative , it also enables you to think about what you do well .

Influential educational thinkers like Fullan and Hargreaves make this point clearly in Building Professional Capital ' . <p> So , given the overwhelming positive reasons for collaborative Continuing Professional Development ( CPD ) why is it not more evident across schools ? <p> From both my position as working Head and having had the privilege of working at a national level as President of the NAHT , I have developed a perspective which raises a number of challenges for the profession and policymakers : <p> With the diminution of Local Authorities , which were the historical locus for collaborative working , schools have been placed in a more competitive environment . Schools are still judged individually and league tables do little to aid the process of collaboration . This is proving a dilemma for many Heads . <p> School to school support can create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world collaboration can cause problems if one of the schools involved takes their eye off the ball ' and face an unexpected Ofsted outcome . The possibility for a Teaching Schools to lose their status over just this can prove a chastening experience for all involved . <p> Budgets remain an issue . Traditional forms of CPD can be expensive and of limited value . There are many inspirational expensive speakers on the circuit and a few questionable ones ! Even with the best , you sometimes remain inspired for a day but impact can be limited . You then return to school and the reality hits you ! By far the greatest impact is when colleagues lever the skills within and share best practice , but the caveat of competition between schools remains . <p> For some , the benefits of collaboration can be overcome by a nervousness around being taken over ' . Despite the best intentions , the suspicion of empire building ' can blight collaborative working in some circumstances . <p> Then there is the issue of time , or lack of it ! With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans can come to naught . Very many Heads remain in the whirlwind ; important tasks get left because urgent ' tasks take over . Long term planning , however important , gets left behind when it is necessary to jump through various hoops for short term survival . <p> I have tried to set out a realistic picture of the pressures faced by a primary Headteacher facing the day to day challenges of running a school . However these are challenges not insurmountable obstacles . Collaboration is proven to be the way forward and it is up to us , as leaders within the profession , to create a culture of trust where we can develop new practices of collaboration for the benefit of all those in our schools . It is up to policy makers to find ways to enable this to happen , recognise the constraints of time and resources and , above all , to understand that unbridled competition and collaboration are not mutual bedfellows . <p> We know the way forward and must have the courage and confidence to make it happen for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and communities .

@@59299257 @8299257/ 176435 @qwx586435 <h> The Green Paper , ' Support and Aspiration ' <h> The Green Paper , Support and Aspiration <p> Well , the wait is over . The analysis of the Green Paper will now begin . <p> Initial reactions will , understandably , focus on funding implications . There will be an almost visceral response to the perception that this is just another means of saving money . Over the coming months , as interest groups and stakeholders build their responses , I think that this and the restructure of technical aspects of SEN will be the focus of much attention . <p> But there is much more to this Green Paper : Support and Aspiration ' is intended to change the landscape of SEN by fundamentally shifting the way we consider pupils with additional needs in schools , equipping teachers to be more effective when working with all children , changing the relationship between mainstream and special schools . It is the impact on special schools and how communities of practice will evolve to share and develop skills that I would like to focus on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter and I would welcome feedback , comment and ideas . <p> Those special schools deemed outstanding will have the opportunity to become Academies and Training Schools . Special schools will play a more prominent part in the local community of school by being a part of the fabric of provision and providing advice and guidance to mainstream colleagues . <p> There is a strong echo in all this ! Removing Barriers to Achievement ' ( 2004 ) provided an inspiring vision of special schools as centres of excellence collaborating with and providing support and guidance to their local community of schools . It described an achievable and rational way of spreading skills , knowledge and experience across all sectors and take special needs out of the secret garden ' . But the worthy aims were never realised . I was involved in two major initiatives as a consultant to support schools and local authorities building on this vision . Despite some detailed and well regarded plans developed by heads and officers , in the end inertia set in and the impact was minimised as the status quo won through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role as consultant but I believe that the deciding factors were ultimately certain groups in the local authority who saw change as a threat , the lack of dynamism and , importantly , leadership from the Local Authority to drive the changes . Some , but by no means all , schools also found a comfort zone in doing what they had always done . For me , the greatest professional disappointment was seeing those who had worked with such enthusiasm to unfreeze values and attitudes ' reverting , as the plans were watered down , to a state of fatalism and cynicism that real change would never happen . <p> The need for centres of excellence to provide advice and guidance is highlighted by the failure of mainstream schools to provide for the whole school population . The explosion of pupils identified with SEN must be linked to a failure of the curriculum to provide a broad range of educational experience suitable for all pupils . This , of course , reflects a centrally generated curriculum which promotes conformity for both the style of teaching and the content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding needs . Schools have increasingly relied upon SEN funding to provide additional resources and much of school based SEN activity has been focussed upon the sterile task of chasing resources . From my own experience I would suggest that much of the resulting resource was wasted . I know that there are some brilliant SENCOs , some wonderful NTAs and schools which made fantastic use of the extra resources but all too often I found that the stereotype of a velcroed teaching assistant was in fact the reality . Some schools have cherished and developed pupils with special needs but all too often the system itself militated against pupils with learning difficulties and they became outsiders within an inflexible process which labelled them . Those great SENCOs often find themselves less of a school resource to enhance the experience of all pupils but more the solution to other people 's problems . There is the old adage that all teachers are teachers of SEN ' but too often this sentiment ( and I am not sure that it has ever been more ) has been submerged by other priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be the call for greater training . If nothing else , removing both the mystery and fear of special needs for newly trained teachers will be welcomed . It does beg the question , though , of how this training will be delivered " where are the skills and the resources to provide truly high quality training ? A worst case scenario would be a few compulsory lectures on SEN provided out of context . There is much evidence to show that traditional CPD activities fail to impact on day to day teaching . This systematic failure is not surprising given the mismatch between the traditional CPD toolset and the specific needs of adult learners . If we want the training to be truly effective we must incorporate the key experience based components such as modelling , observation and professional dialogue . <p> If we believe that the skills to provide training and advice to colleagues will naturally emerge from special schools themselves we may be disappointed . Certainly , a few special schools have provided high quality support for mainstream pupils and colleagues in mainstream schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involve a different skill set . OK , there are exceptions where schools are already fully engaged and collaborating but this has only been achieved through a long process of development led by inspired school leaders . <p> There are some great case studies in Support and Aspiration ' . The example of The Lampton School and London Leadership Strategy bringing together teachers from 40 schools to help share and develop skills and knowledge around SEN illustrates effective collaboration in action . It is interesting and positive that The Lampton School is a high performing mainstream school which has taken a key role in developing a partnership approach to SEN . I can also think of schools involved in the Leeds Inclusive Learning Strategy who have developed exciting ways of working with mainstream colleagues . I know that there are many more examples . <p> But moving from the traditional mould of working will not be easy for some special schools . If they are to be at the heart of the local learning community and provide a broader range of services to mainstream colleagues it will require strong leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . The skill sets involved in supporting pupils in a classroom do not readily equate with those of providing advice and guidance to other teachers . The need to unlock knowledge and have it move freely around the community of schools is critical but it will provide challenges . With reducing budgets in mainstream and lack of central budgets to sustain core teams , special school leaders will need to develop a range of entrepreneurial skills not usually associated with one of the more sheltered ' areas of education . Indeed , if I were the governor of a special school , would I not want my leadership team to focus on school based activities ? . It will take some hard talking between school leaders , parents and governors to establish a clarity of role for each special school . <p> Collaboration does have to be at the core of this new landscape . Working across and between schools is not easy . To fully realise the vision , schools may need to move beyond traditional methods of communication and training delivery .

They can share their videos ; feedback can be successfully taken on board because the videos provide an accurate point of discussion ; observation nerves have been conquered bringing out the best in teachers ' performances ; teachers can watch themselves in the classroom and pick up the small tweaks they need to make in order for their practice to improve . <h> And the pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for learning in their classrooms because teachers have been able to see what was n't working and change it . Those who were disengaged are engaged again because teachers have been able to make sure no one falls off their radar . <p> Lastly , disruptive behaviour has been reduced because the teachers are able to go away , take the time to watch lessons back and really understand the barriers to learning . The culture of the school now is one where teachers are clear of the expectations and that they need to support one another to be successful . Good ideas are shared , praise given and because the teaching is typically outstanding , teachers know they have plenty of places to go for good advice . <h> The Future <p> The staff believe that outstanding is not the end of the journey because you should never stop working at being better . They have plans to collaborate with another school in their cluster who also use IRIS Connect , aiming to grow a library of videos that they can share and use to build a bridge between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> From the moment I took over the headship it was absolutely imperative that we moved the school to outstanding as quickly as possible , because we serve a cohort of children who are some of the most deprived in Havering and the whole of greater London , so we did n't have time to wait . <p> Malcom Drakes , Headteacher <p> I share my role with another teacher , so I teach at the beginning of the week and she does the other half . Before we had IRIS Connect I did n't know how she was teaching something . <p> Now we swap videos of our lessons to make sure that our teaching is consistent and that every child gets the same experiences , whichever one of us is leading the class .

So , how can you make sure your feedback is effective for your students ? <h> Do n't overlook the importance of verbal feedback <p> While there has been much focus on marking ( written feedback ) , reflecting on the verbal feedback you give can also have a big impact . Verbal feedback is one of the most important aspects of effective teaching , as teacher Alex Quigley recognises in this blog . <p> Effective feedback shows pupils what they have achieved , what they need to improve and supports them to make changes . It should be specific ; a generic well done ' is not helpful . Instead , perhaps you could say something like : well done , I like the way you tackled that task , next time you could try ... ' and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback is focused on the student 's learning and given as quickly as possible during or following the learning . It is essential that pupils are given appropriate time to respond to the feedback and use it to improve their work . <h> There are many opportunities for verbal feedback during a lesson , including : <p> A quick prompt during independent work <p> A guided writing session with the whole class to demonstrate expectations <p> A mini plenary to address misconceptions <p> Clarification of task expectations <p> Longer dialogue with a pupil about a piece of work <p> All of these situations help pupils to be able to carry out a task or improve what they have done . But with all of these opportunities to give verbal feedback , how can you know that what you 're giving is effective ? <h> Reflecting on verbal feedback <p> Consider using video to record your lesson and reflect back on how you use verbal feedback throughout . Ask yourself : Were there any other opportunities for me to give feedback in that lesson ? ' <p> Verbal feedback is effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following , the learning or task . It offers more opportunity for dialogue between you and your pupil , ensuring that they understand the feedback , enabling them to respond to it and to action the feedback straight away . <p> To support this , think about how you give feedback : the tone of voice you use , your body language , how you can encourage the pupil to respond and join in with discussions . <p> Revisit the video of your lesson and look at how your pupils respond to your verbal feedback . Does it encourage them to develop their answers or work ? <p> As well as explicit verbal feedback , also think about the implicit feedback you give throughout a lesson . To really improve student achievement , all the messages you give in a lesson should be focused on the learning . Yet sometimes , you may find yourself giving just as many instructions and messages about other aspects such as behaviour , spelling or presentation . This can confuse pupils as to what the expectations of the task really are . <p> Reflect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the input and while pupils are working independently to see whether your feedback is focused on the learning objective or on other aspects . <h> For 10 top strategies for oral formative feedback , visit Alex 's blogand have a read of his suggestions for using technology to support your feedback and dialogue . <p> Do you have any tips of your own for making verbal feedback effective ?

Unfortunately , students can be quick to spot lack of confidence in a teacher , which can have implications for classroom management . <p> Gaining confidence is n't just a concern for new teachers . More experienced teachers may also need a confidence boost when they meet new challenges , the education landscape shifts around them or find they need to make changes to their teaching practice . <h> 5 confidence boosting tips for teachers <h> 1 . Be prepared <p> Planning includes anticipating the challenges of particular classes , ensuring you 're ready for lesson observations , potential situations that could arise and how you might deal with them . If your confidence has been knocked , try to put a little extra preparation time in . But try to allow for some flexibility to avoid panicking if you need to change track part way through ! <h> 2 . Walk tall <p> Body language says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are scared or unsure tend to slouch or cower , so walking tall will give you an air of confidence . <h> 3 . Your classroom , your rules <p> Your lesson begins the moment your students set eyes on you . So if they 're waiting outside your classroom , start the lesson then . Calmly and confidently demand the behaviour you expect from them before come in , greet them at the door and set expectations straight away . <p> If you start to feel panicky or that you 're losing control , take a moment and breathe . Refer to your lesson plan and then once you feel more relaxed , try to gain control of the lesson calmly and authoritatively . <p> Finally , if a class simply wo n't listen , do n't try to shout over them . It will quickly frustrate and anger you and it wo n't encourage your class to listen . Instead try calmly standing still ( despite how you may feel inside ) and wait . Eventually the class will become quiet , it may not happen right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear criticism , use it <p> If you 've been given some feedback that you deem to be negative , then use it as a tool to change . By acting on criticism instead of wallowing in it , you can turn a negative into a positive , helping you to not only build confidence but also really improve your practice . <h> 5 . Realise your strengths <p> Last , but definitely not least , take some time to reflect on your practice and pull out the positives . Try filming your lesson for a really objective lens on your practice . <p> Whilst it might be uncomfortable at first , it really does help to overcome negative self-perceptions and recognise your strengths in the classroom . By reflecting on your teaching strengths and celebrating them you build a sense of self worth and belief , which ultimately leads to confidence . <p> Do you have anything you 'd add ?

There 's a wealth of evidence for this problem " usually described as disengagement ' " across the developed world . Researchers in Canada came to the worrying conclusion that students ' intellectual engagement in school ( that is , their engagement in learning itself ) declines steadily as they get older . And , unsurprisingly , students from poor families tend to be much less engaged than students in rich ones . However , a study by the OECD found that engaged students from poor families tend to outperform disengaged students from wealthy families . <p> None of this will come as a surprise to teachers , who know how difficult it can be to help students become self-motivated learners " and who know that it is often most difficult to reach the students who are receiving the list support outside of school . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of disengaged achievers ' who are adept at jumping through hoops ' by achieving high marks on high-stakes assessments , but do not develop an intrinsic love of learning " and so struggle when they leave the highly-structured confines of school and enter university and the world of work . <p> In 2008 , Innovation Unit and the Paul Hamlyn Foundation launched Learning Futures , a major project dedicated to understanding how schools could be redesigned in order to foster more engagement in learning . Learning Futures has examined the most exciting practice from around the world , and worked with forty schools across England on incubating radical new approaches to learning . This has led to three significant outcomes : <p> A richer understanding of what engagement ' means <p> A vision for what learning that fosters engagement looks like ' <p> A suite of tools for achieving that vision <p> I 'll say a bit about each of these outcomes in turn : <h> So what do you mean by engagement ' ? <p> We use it to mean engagement in learning ' .

Reusable Learning Resource " just one lesson recording can become a resource that you can go back to time and time again to look at different aspects of your teaching from multiple perspectives . <p> 3 . Enhanced Feedback " discussions can take place focused on what actually happened during the lesson , not on recollections or conflicting accounts thus helping you to build trust , dialogue , deeper shared reflections and a richer experience . <p> 4 .

Through an in-ear coaching tool , a mentor in another room , school , or even country , can watch the lesson as its taking place and help the teacher to implement changes immediately or address anything that they may not have noticed .

The key to sustaining the focus on improving teaching for several months is to combine different approaches to CPD . <h> Here are 5 suggestions of great ideas to try : <h> 1 . TeachMeets <p> Pros : Incredibly inspiring to share in the enthusiasm of colleagues from different schools ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and energising and motivating when you need some new input . <p> Cons : There can be so many different ideas that it makes it easy to keep trying new things without ever sticking to one ; you ca n't always be sure of the evidence-base behind ideas ; and ideas are often focused on teacher practice rather than helping deal with specific pupil learning needs . <h> 2 . Twitter <p> This social network is one of the best ways to link up with teachers around the country ( and the world ) and find ideas , research , and current news as well as engage in debate . Try following #ukedchat as a great starting point . <p> Pros : Massive amounts of links , blogs , resources and ideas and a great way to find like-minded people who can support and inspire you . Some topics ( e.g. certain subjects or roles ) have regular chats and events so you can engage with colleagues and experts in one place . <p> Cons : There is a deluge of information and it can be hard to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also take up a lot of time ( if you get addicted ) and throws so many ideas at you that it 's hard to stay focused on one thing . <h> 3 . Lesson Study <p> This is a popular approach with teachers in the Far East where teams of teachers collaboratively plan lessons and watch each other carry them out then come back to reflect and improve . Click here for UK-focused resources . <p> Pros : An inexpensive way to collaborate and improve teaching over time , co-planning and peer-observation are some of the best ways to change practice . <p> Cons : It needs a lot of dedicated time ( unless you use video technology ) and can lead to simply recycling existing mediocre practice and ideas unless an expert is brought in . It can also be quite a culture shock in some schools . <h> 4 . Get reading <p> Try getting some information from further reading . The Teacher Development Trust has some great book ideas to get you started . <p> Pros : Books are an inexpensive source of new ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore ideas deeply and have plenty of examples to help you implement ideas in practice and are usually based on research and evidence . <p> Cons : It 's easy to get carried away with a generic principle when books are written as a sales-pitch for an idea without a critical analysis or evidence . Unless you 're in a reading group then you end up trying ideas alone , and it 's easy to get a bee in your bonnet ' about an exciting idea that is really just a vague solution without a clearly defined problem . <h> 5 . Go on a course <p> Get out of school and find a lecture or course to help with new ideas or solve problems . Try the Good CPD Guide which lists hundreds of courses and explains how to get the most out of them . <p> Pros : Inspiring and motivating , a great way to get out of the classroom to get a fresh perspective . The best courses keep you up to date , challenge you , and provide ideas from well-regarded experts .

Expert input <p> After a few cycles of intervention lessons , where lessons have been planned and observed collaboratively , it is useful to bring in some expert input . The mentor , or some other external partner , can recommend some research or similar to extend and augment the enquiry project for the next few cycles of lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone to put a lot of effort into an idea and to find superficial ways that suggest it works . However , to be as useful as possible , the evaluation processes used in Lesson Study should be as objective and methodologically sound as possible . In addition to qualitative methods , such as interviewing the case pupils , objective measures such as counting the number of times a certain event occurs or a standardised test should be used . Where appropriate , a comparison or control group is an excellent way of measuring impact . <h> 3 . Mentor role <p> It is advisable to support any triads of Lesson Study in your school with a mentor . This person can help guide groups in choosing a learner-focused enquiry question , direct participants towards relevant research , and provide assistance during the evaluation and the dissemination processes . <h> 4 . Time <p> It is important that Lesson Study is integrated into the school 's timetable so that participants have enough time not only to observe each other , but also to reflect together on their observations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time slots are introduced into the timetable to allow for this , although use of video can of course assist this . <h> 5 . Research <p> To ensure that a group 's project is as effective as possible , triads should choose an enquiry project that is underpinned by research . Reviewing research should be part of the process in choosing an enquiry question . <h> 6 . Dissemination <p> It is essential to find ways for others to learn from your Lesson Study . Strategies should be designed for enquiry groups to share their findings amongst colleagues and peers in their own school , and elsewhere . Video is an ideal medium for sharing across a wide audience . <p> Lesson Study has the potential to transform both professional and pupil learning in a collaborative and teacher driven way .

" - Child Bereavement UK <p> I used to specialise in difficult children . I ran schools , remand homes , off-site units , pupil referral units , hospital schools you name it . It may sound contrary but I really enjoyed this work . I relished the craic ' you could get with some of these children/young people and I also enjoyed the intellectual challenge they posed . <p> Yes , I know the second part of that sentence may surprise some people but trying to understand and deal with the causes of unacceptable ' behaviour requires thought and analysis . You can find simple ways to control ' behaviour but actually managing it , let alone changing it , is more difficult . <h> What the research says <p> One thing that I became aware of was the number of these difficult ' children who had a significant bereavement in their background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a random way . It was not scientific but , for me , it started to illustrate a causal link between bereavement and a number of behaviours which are not socially acceptable . <p> This is not to say that bereaved children will have problems nor that bereavement in itself is the cause of behaviour problems . It is much more complex than that . Bereavement is another risk factor that can have an impact . <p> Those who have suffered bereavement at a personal level will have an understanding of the complexity of emotions that it raises . We all deal with it differently . For some , the grief becomes utterly overwhelming whilst others , at a superficial level at least , cope relatively well . We are all different with different histories and access to different support infra-structures . <p> If a child is bereaved of a parent or sibling whilst they are at school does it have an impact ? Well , for some it does . There is research on the impact of bereavement but much is confusing and some contradictory . A longitudinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Childhood Wellbeing Research Centre ( 2011 ) gave the following insights : <p> They are more likely to leave school at the age of 16 <p> They are more likely to leave without qualifications <p> They report higher levels of truancy <p> They are more likely to be suspended <p> They are significantly more likely to show symptoms of depression <p> In this longitudinal study , they are also less likely to have a successful transition to adult life with higher levels of unemployment and less skilled work . <p> Again , this is not inevitable and every person 's response is unique and context bound . There is , however , one view that seems to permeate the literature ; children need an effective network of support . <p> The key people to provide this support are the remaining parent and family but sometimes these are fractured before or after the death . Schools can not act as substitute parents in these situations " it would be neither feasible nor appropriate . Schools and teachers do , however , need to have an understanding of how death impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find additional support . At the most cynical level , it will help with the school 's results . <h> How can schools and teachers help ? <p> I worry that the school timetable is so full that space can not be made for young people to deal with other important issues in their lives . Teaching should be about far more than cramming facts , figures and data . I can state that when , as a young teacher , I was responsible for teaching O ' level English ( the supposed Gold Standard ) I would wander off the curriculum for weeks on end and our results usually exceeded the local grammar schools . <p> The purpose of teaching is , in part , to support the transition to adult life . If we see the outcomes ' in terms of being able to regurgitate a narrowly defined curriculum as the purpose then we are failing a whole generation of children and , I would argue , society as a whole . <p> I had a very close friend who was chronically i 'll when she was young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a different perspective on school . School did not meet her needs and she ran away when she was 15 to trapes across Europe . She returned to education in her mid-20 's and did an access course to university where she gained a 1st . She went on to become one of the best and most effective educators I have known . She did , tragically , die too early but I learnt from her that it is our professional duty to understand the needs of individuals and be flexible in the ways that we meet them . <p> As compassionate people , we need to understand how to support a child through the initial stages of grief and as professionals we need to understand that bereavement is a longer term risk factor . We need to prepare for this and , where necessary , have appropriate plans . Bereavement is an educational issue and we need to deal with it . <p> Teachers can find support from a number of dedicated charities and organisations .

@@59299420 @8299420/ 176435 @qwx586435 <h> Chalkboards to Ipads : Teacher Training and Technology <p> A few years ago I spent some time volunteering in a Tanzanian primary school . Two of the things that struck me during this experience was the complete lack of resources , and the fantastic job that teachers did with sixty eager to learn children , with nothing but a piece of chalk , a chalkboard , and dedication . <p> I was reminded of this when I came across an article discussing the use of iPads in some classrooms in the UK . Something which highlighted to me the gap amongst Britain 's schools , let alone the stark contrast to the bare desks and non-existent bookshelves in Nkwawangya Primary school . The use of technology as a teaching aid in British classrooms is common place and something that I 'm sure almost everyone looks on positively . Information , Communication Technology ( ICT ) is recognised at being vitally important in preparing young people for work in a highly competitive global market . With the rate at which technology is developing , I wonder how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially at a time when their purse strings are being tightened . <p> Unlike the Cedar School of Excellence in Scotland , which claims to be the first school in the world with an iPad for every student , the average British comprehensive school is worlds away . They might have a Kindle or two in the Library , and enough laptops for a science class to use , but budgetary constraints mean that schools in the UK are often unable to provide their students with the latest technologies . If and where they do I wonder what impact would this have on teachers and their ability use the high-tech tools available . <p> A head teacher of a large comprehensive school commented to me that many of the older teachers in his school have been slower to recognise the use of ICT in their classrooms , and are much less comfortable with it than their younger colleagues . We 've reached the point where some teachers are struggling to keep up with the student 's that they are trying to educate . Especially now that many teachers will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to ensure that support , training and development on technological matters is accessible . <p> A friend of mine who has been teaching for about four years now has said that since finishing her PGCE she 's not received much valuable training , and nothing on technology . For her it 's not too bad as she 's grown up with technology , but she commented that many of her colleagues are not at ease using their smart boards or laptops as educational tools , and are not necessarily comfortable with new dynamics that technologies have brought to the classroom . <p> Aside from school owned technology , some pupils will have their own . There is the question of how to deal with this . When I was at school any phone spotted by a teacher would be confiscated for the rest of the day . Now however , students could use their smartphones to carry out quick research when computers are n't available , or video group work or presentations . How teachers harness these possibilities is an issue . Aside from highlighting the haves and have-nots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the class is n't on Facebook adds another challenge . <p> This is the sort of thing that training in the use of technologies could address : training teachers to make the most of the opportunities that new technologies bring , whilst being able to cope with these new classroom dynamics . Unfortunately , as my friend demonstrates , not all teachers are receiving this training . At a time when Bursars are having to make savings , sending teachers on expensive training courses is unlikely . Innovations such as that of IRIS Connect , through which schools can use remote observation technology and develop training and development networks , provide a more cost effective way of training staff to cope with the new dynamics that technology brings to the classroom . <p> Really what 's important here is that teachers are given the professional tools to utilise the resources available to their fullest potential , be it the Tanzanian chalkboard , or Cedar 's iPads , in order to enhance student 's learning .

How can I improve it ? What are my next steps ?

These statistics do not represent the whole picture of FE in England but it does highlight a need to reassess the training and professional development provision in the FE sector . <p> Another point of concern is the provision of FE teacher training . Whilst the government are offering -20,000 bursaries for first class graduates to teach priority subjects in schools , the FE teaching grant of a mere -400 is being discontinued as of March next year and the fees are going up . <p> These issues combined present a concerning picture for teaching provision in FE .

A call for bottom up professional development has been made by the Chief Executive of the Institute for Learning , I think there 's a lot in that . <p> But how does a Teaching &amp; Learning/CPD Co-ordinator manage 400+ staff , identify and support each one individually ? An important challenge for colleges in achieving the more consistent level of teaching that Ofsted demands , is to find a way of disseminating best practice from those outstanding teachers and ensuring that all staff are able to learn and benefit from it . Quite a challenge when colleges have a huge staff body and are split across multiple sites . <p> Large multi sites challenge any CPD provision even for the most eager teacher . The opportunities to discuss practice , observe others can be difficult and costly . It 's ok allowing teachers to go away and immerse themselves in their own CPD , but without the interaction with their colleagues the best trained teacher will find it difficult to sustain their performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole increasingly expects ordinary people to do extraordinary things . Teaching 30 + students between 4-6 hours every day ensuring every single one is motivated engaged , actively involved in their own learning and doing well is no easy feat .

Gloucestershire College being one example , where they share practice and drive innovation through the use IRIS Connect . In order to meet Ofsted 's demands , raising levels of attainment for both staff and pupils , at a time of tightened purse strings , Colleges are starting to think outside the traditional box for CPD provision and staff training .

Bent law officers exist in every era , sabotaging the work of their colleagues and putting the community at risk . James Morton and Susanna Lobez have illustrated , in several Gangland books , that Australia almost certainly has out-ganged other countries . Now their spotlight is turned on corruption within the police services and identifying which state wins the bent cop handicap . The authors examine the problems that started with the First Fleet and spread through to the present day , looking at the trouble caused by greed , power , alcohol , sex , money , and , most recently , drugs . They compare the experience in Australia with corruption in America , England , and Hong Kong , concentrating in particular on organized corruption at the highest levels , including judges , lawyers , and politicians , through to the petty criminals who work the streets . Which state has the shadiest cops ? The answer will surprise you .

In this , the first history written of the New South Wales coast , historian Ian Hoskins traces the relationship between the residents of the coast and this particular stretch of land and sea over the course of millennia , from the earliest Aboriginal inhabitants who feasted on shellfish and perfected the art of building canoes to the modern-day obsession with the beach as a place to live or vacation . Among the topics explored in this captivating study are the European fascination with marine life , the attempts to establish a whaling industry , the fear of a seaborne invasion which led to the creation of the Australian navy , and the rise of modern Australia 's seemingly unstoppable enthusiasm for surfing and fishing . As Hoskins analyzes these and other subjects , he argues that the current enthrallment with the coast began more recently than might be imagined .

Geographically so near , culturally so different , the countries of the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa have influenced both the Oriental vogue of the baroque period and also the popular Oriental genre in the fine arts . At the same time , the mysterious aura of the Orient has repeatedly served as a romantically idealized counterpoint and escape route for European fantasies and longings . From the early turquets to the glory of the 19th century to the Tunisian images of August Macke and Paul Klee , this elaborately appointed volume presents the history of Oriental images in painting and follows the traces of a phenomenon that remains fascinating even today .
