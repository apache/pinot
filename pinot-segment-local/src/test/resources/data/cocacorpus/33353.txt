@@20883950 @883950/ <h> Lone survivor 's death marks the end of Yellowstone 's famous Druid wolves <p> The last surviving wolf of the most celebrated pack in Yellowstone National Park 's history has been killed , legally , by a hunter in Montana . <p> In the parlance of Yellowstone wolf monitoring , he was 778M , though he 'd also earned the nickname " Big Brown " for his handsome stature . He 'd spent most of the past couple of years north of the park boundary , and it was there that he met his end by a bullet a few weeks ago . <p> Wolf 778M 's saga began , meanwhile , back in the spring of 2007 , when he was born into the mighty Druid Peak Pack . The Druids , as they were reverently known by legions of dedicated wolf-watchers , had ruled the heart of northeastern Yellowstone 's Lamar Valley for years . <p> Yellowstone 's Druid wolf pack on the move . Image : In the Valley of the Wolves , - PBS/YouTube <p> The broad glen " - part of the mountain-walled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Range " is often called " America 's Serengeti " given its plentiful and varied megafauna : from bison , elk , pronghorn , mule deer , bighorn sheep and moose to a full roster of native Rocky Mountain carnivores . And the Druids , for much of their 14-year existence , were its haughty top dogs . <p> The pack was among the second cohort of wolves reintroduced to Yellowstone in the mid-1990s " - many decades after the canids were wiped out- through the US government 's predator-control policy , which in the early twentieth- century applied even to national parks . The founding Druids , who hailed from northern British Columbia , were released into the Lamar in April 1996 , and did n't take long to assert themselves . By the early 2000s , their numbers had grown to nearly 40 " - one of the biggest wolf packs ever recorded . <p> With their primary den just a stone 's throw from the Lamar 's Northeast Entrance Road and one of their preferred rendezvous sites " - where growing pups hang out after leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binoculars or spotting scope , the Druids became the best-known and most-watched pack in Yellowstone , and very likely the world . <p> All told , more than 100,000 visitors saw them at their wolfish work in the wild , wide-open arena of the Lamar Valley : dragging down elk , mobbing grizzlies , rumbling with other packs and performing downright Sopranos-worthy internecine dramas . In 2000 , the pack 's domineering alpha female , 40F , was killed in an apparent coup by other Druid she-wolves , including her sister , 42F , who took over the leadership role . <p> The Druids were the flashy face of an exciting new chapter for the oldest national park in the US , as its ecology rapidly readjusted to the return of an apex predator to the stage . <p> Wolf empires are as transient as human ones , though . By 2010 , the Druid Peak Pack was in shambles : ravaged by terrible pack-wide mange , beset by rivals , and dwindled by natural dispersal and deaths . <p> But 778M " - who was the grandson of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolf from the first litter of one of Yellowstone 's original reintroduced groups " - had left his natal pack well before its sorry unravelling . In 2008 , a year after his birth , he and several other wolves dispersed from the Druids and helped establish the Blacktail Deer Plateau Pack to the west . Big Brown became its alpha male by- late 2009 . <p> When Yellowstone 's head wolf biologist Doug Smith radio-collared him in 2011 , 778M weighed a solid 118 pounds . And his easy swagger made him , like his grandfather , a natural-born leader . " He had that classic confidence and quiet self-assurance that pretty much all alpha males have , " said Yellowstone Wolf Project biological technician- Rick McIntyre in a Jackson Hole News &amp; Guide article announcing the one-time Druid 's death . <p> Under 778M and his mate , 693F , the Blacktails comprised an impressive 15 wolves by the early 2010s . Their numbers soon declined , however , and 693F died in late 2013 , likely killed by other wolves . By then , Big Brown- was- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a spell , even gaining a few companions , though the pack never really reformed . Eventually , he drifted north of the park into the Gallatin National Forest and a bit more obscurity . <p> " He went from being one of our main wolves in the park to being a peripheral wolf to being a wolf we did n't keep track of at all , " - Doug Smith told the Jackson Hole News &amp; Guide . <p> Montana held its first modern wolf hunt in 2009 ; there was none in 2010 , but hunts have occurred annually since 2011 , when the federal government removed wolves in the region from its endangered species list . Over- 200 were killed during the 2015 season . Conservationists have been pushing- for buffer zones around Yellowstone- where wolf hunting is prohibited , but the efforts have been unsuccessful thus far. - <p> Though 778M 's death marks the end of the Druid wolves , their bloodline lives on in other Yellowstone packs . In fact , the old Druid kingdom has been home to a confederation partly composed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pack . These wolves have denned in the same grove that saw generations of Druid pups whelped , and in some seasons they 've been visible enough to summon throwback visions of the Druids ' royal heyday . ( The most celebrated Lamar Canyon wolf , the so-called " 06 Female " , was herself killed outside the park in late 2012 " - one of a dozen Yellowstone-ranging wolves shot outside the boundaries during that winter 's hunting season . ) <p> " Certainly there is a sadness in the death of 778 after living a long and difficult life . But now that he 's gone , we still have descendants of the Druid wolves , " McIntyre told Jackson Hole News . <p> In few places on earth are wolf societies and wolf geopolitics so scrutinised as Yellowstone , and thus the death of a long-lived , long-tracked individual like Big Brown- has powerful resonance for scientists and wolf-watchers alike .

A few years ago , scientists discovered the ancient skeleton of one of Europe 's most famous Ice Age carnivores deep within this cavern : Crocuta spelaea , the cave hyena . <p> Remains of these extinct creatures can be found within hundreds of caves all across Europe , but most of these fossils are just bits and pieces " - complete or even partial skeletons are extremely rare .

And the most famous and intimidating scorpion feature ? That- venomous stinger-tipped tail , of course . <p> A new study using high-speed video footage of scorpion strikes has revealed that not all species- wield their rear weaponry the same way . Scorpion tails vary quite a bit in size and shape , and these diverse weapons " not unlike varieties of swords or knives " are swung with differing techniques , speeds and degrees of precision . <p> A moveable stinging backside is pretty unusual in the animal world , and scorpions put it to several uses . When it comes to prey , they 'll often grab with their claws and poke around until they 've found an ideal spot to inject venom . Males even sting females during mating ! But researchers from the CIBIO Research Center in Portugal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward off predators . <p> Scientifically speaking , a scorpion 's " tail " is not a truly separate appendage like most animal tails " - it 's actually the last five segments of the body ( together called the metastoma ) , tipped off by a stinging structure called a telson . The venom packed inside has deadly toxins that attack the bodies of the small bugs scorpions prey upon , but it also contains ingredients that are dangerous or even deadly to larger animals that might be looking for a scorpion snack . <p> " Among the almost 2,500 species of scorpions , there is a lot of- difference in the relative size and girth of their ' tail ' , " says Arie van der Meijden , one of the co-authors of the study . " We wanted to- know what these different tail shapes are for . " <p> Previous research has shown that there is a relationship between the shape of a scorpion 's metastoma and the potency of its venom . But why all this diversity in the derri+re ? " We suspected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that is the most- strenuous behaviour they do with their tail , " van der Meijden notes . <p> To investigate the dynamics of stings , the researchers gathered seven African species into the lab . These included West Africa 's gigantic ( we 're talking up to 20cm ) emperor scorpion , - the famous deathstalker of northern Africa and the Middle East , and the Transvaal thick-tailed scorpion native to southern Africa , which is capable of spraying venom from its stinger . <p> Encouraging a scorpion to strike can be a bit harrowing for everyone involved , but van der Meijden stresses that- safety is a top priority : " We take all- precautions to handle the scorpions in a safe and scorpion-friendly way , - such as using long rubber-tipped tweezers to handle the scorpions .

Others favoured shorter swings that allowed them to quickly return their stingers to starting position for the next jab . <p> So , are these different strategies attuned to the potential predators each scorpion might face in the wild ? It 's a possibility that van der Meijder has considered . " But currently there is- no information available to test this , " he explains .

Since then , further research has shed light on- some amazing details about the life " and death " of these little lions . <p> The two cubs were affectionately named Uyan and Dina , after a river near the discovery site . They were found last summer , several metres underground in Siberian permafrost deposits in the Uyandina River basin of the Yakutia ( Sakha ) Republic . <p> The fossils there , which also include skeletal remains of other Ice Age favourites like woolly mammoths and steppe bison , are understood to be at least 30,000 years old . <p> The map shows the approximate location of the cave lion cubs site in Eastern Siberia . Image : Olga Potapova- <p> Scientific analysis of these incredible fossils , which was presented at this year 's meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job of an international team of researchers led by the Department of Mammoth Fauna Studies at the Yakutian Academy of Science in Yakutsk , Russia . The ice that encapsulates the cubs has preserved incredible details , such as their tan-yellow fur and their short ears and tails . With the use of CT scanning , palaeontologists can even examine the- inside of the cubs ' bodies . <p> " All this together gives us an idea of how old the lions were , " said Olga Potapova , Collections Curator and Manager at the Mammoth Site in Hot Springs , South Dakota . " They 're pretty young , probably between one and two weeks old . " <p> Given their age at the time of death , the cubs ' bodies were still growing rapidly . Their milk teeth " that is , their baby teeth " had n't even fully grown in yet , and were still nestled within the gums . In modern-day African lions , these teeth do n't erupt until an animal reaches about one month of age . And just like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes had n't opened yet . One cub , Uyan , has one eye partially open , but Potapova speculates this was most likely due to the processes that buried the animals . <p> So how did these cubs come to be buried in an icy grave ? It appears the poor babies became fossilised after the collapse of their den . Like living lions , mom may have tucked them away for safety , but some mishap- led to a cave-in . <p> Examination of the cubs ' skeletons revealed fatal crushing of the skull and separation of the neck vertebrae . According to Potapova , those injuries indicate the youngsters were likely killed very quickly in the collapse . <p> Though it spelled obvious disaster for the animals , the cave-in also allowed their bodies to become so well preserved that scientists could even examine some of their internal organs . The skulls were damaged , but the brain of one cave lion was sufficiently intact for researchers to reconstruct its 3D shape , which was found to be quite similar to that of living cats , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestive tract were preserved as well . The researchers found that Uyan 's stomach was empty , but some food residues were left behind in the intestines . The cub had probably gone just a few hours since its last meal from mom . <p> Of course , whenever an Ice Age fossil is found in such good shape , scientists get excited about DNA . " What makes these cubs exciting is the quality of the specimens , " said ancient DNA researcher Leigha Lynch from Oklahoma State University , who was n't involved in this study . " You have multiple tissue types to work with : teeth and bones , hair and muscle . " She explained that different parts of the body may preserve different quality and quantity of DNA , expanding the possibilities of what researchers might find . <p> Indeed , working alongside renowned molecular biologist Beth Shapiro of the Paleogenomics Laboratory in Santa Cruz , California , the cave lion research team was able to uncover DNA from the mitochondria of the cubs ' cells . Not only is this the oldest complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's also only the third such case , including DNA extraction from bones and hair earlier this year . <p> These cubs have a lot in common with living lions , but ongoing research is revealing some notable differences . " We found indications that the cave lions showed a different pattern of development than the African lions , " Potapova told me . <p> As research continues , the team will aim to gather more information about the cave lions ' growth , anatomy and genetics . Clearly , these prehistoric felines hold many more secrets inside their tiny frozen frames . <p> <p> * In addition to the organisations listed above , from Russia , California , and South Dakota , the researchers would also like to acknowledge the work of colleagues at the University of Gr+ningen in the Netherlands , and the other organisations participating in this research .

Collectively , the actions of these snakes can appear terrifying , but once a snake eats , it loses its desire to hunt again . <p> Unlike mammals , snakes do n't chew their food and have no appendages with which to carve up a share of their quarry with their kin .

Such tiny groups can easily wink out of existence due to inbreeding or human encroachment . <p> " The frankincense collectors are n't the major threat , " says Al Hikmani , " but they are a new threat . " For a subspecies so close to extinction , any threat matters . <p> Decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated Arabian leopards from most of their historic range . Camels , goats and other livestock denuded the landscape , depleting populations of leopard prey .

Al Hikmani worries that as leopards in the reserve move into the foothills to avoid collectors , they 'll encounter more camels and other livestock . <p> But there is some good news . " Before the 1970s , there was a lot of demand for camels for their milk , meat and transport , " says Hikmani . " Now , only a small number of people still depend on them . " Motor vehicles have replaced camels for transportation , and some people keep the animals simply as pets .

More good news : now that hunting is illegal , camera traps have documented an increase in prey such as Arabian gazelles and Nubian ibex in the area . <p> But killings in other countries continue . At least three leopards were shot in Yemen in 2015 , and two more this year " - all in retaliation for killing livestock , according to Al Hikmani . <p> " We know this through Twitter , Facebook and Instagram , " he says .

That means protecting sufficient habitat and prey to support viable populations . ( You can read about the reintroduction of Persian leopards into Russia 's Caucasus Mountains here . ) <p> With civil strife raging in Yemen and a growing human population throughout the region , the Arabian leopard might need a modern-day miracle to endure .

The counter-trafficking group Freeland and the cat conservation organisation Panthera conducted the study in cooperation with Thailand 's Department of National Parks , Wildlife and Plant Conservation ( DNP ) . <p> The exciting- results have revealed breeding tigers in eastern Thailand for the first time in more than 15 years , according to a news release , as well as the first-ever photos of cubs in the region .

The confirmation of a breeding population of tigers here is especially validating given how long and tenaciously the DNP and Freeland searched for any tigers in the region . Dedicated rangers ran anti-poaching patrols in the Forest Complex even when evidence for the big cats was lacking . <p> " The existence of tigers here was often doubted , but these recent surveys are proving its importance not only nationally but regionally and internationally as well , " Kraisak Choonhaven , Freeland 's chairman of the board , said . <p> Only about 221 Indochinese tigers are thought to survive in the wild , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and until now the only known breeding one " resides in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary in Thailand 's Western Forest Complex .

Each female has one pup . It 's a pretty small cove , so it is probably only big enough for one or two males . " <p> According to Evans , the elephant seals are not alone- " on average , between 700 and 1,000 harbour seals ( Phoca vitulina ) can be found swimming just off the coast or taking a break on the shore . But the sighting does mark the first time in decades that elephant seals have decided to turn the area into a rookery , with previous appearances confined to a few hundred juvenile males seeking a place to recover after losing- breeding fights .

@@20883993 @883993/ <p> This past Saturday , a 7.5-metre-long ( 25ft ) - Allosaurus named Kan went up for auction in Lyon , France , and the anonymous winning bidder took it for G1.1 million ( $1.2 million ) . This is surely an exciting win for the buyer , but big dinosaur purchases tend to stir up tension in the scientific community . <p> Kan the Allosaurus is certainly not the first big-ticket dinosaur to hit the auction block . Fossils priced at over a million pounds ( or dollars ) regularly make headlines " from this year's- tyrannosaur fossils- to the two-for-one pair of " duelling dinosaurs " from a few years ago , and the famous T. rex " Sue " - of the late 1990s . <p> From a palaeontologist 's perspective , high-priced fossil sales can be a big loss . Oftentimes , a rare or important fossil , which might be- crucial to answering questions about ancient creatures and ecosystems , can end up disappearing into someone 's private collection , out of scientists ' reach . Thankfully , reports say the buyer who purchased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ display " - but things do n't always work out that nicely . <p> This Allosaurus- is on display at the San Diego Museum of Natural History . Hopefully , Kan will be- available for public and scientific viewing as well . Image : Wikimedia Commons <p> Take , for example , the case of an intriguing and controversial fossil named Tetrapodophis . Scientists initially identified it last year as an ancient four-legged snake , but others have hotly disputed this claim . All sides agree that this is an important fossil in the story of snake and lizard evolution , and that future study is still needed . Unfortunately , the specimen is privately owned , and was recently removed from public display . Whatever secrets it- might hold are now locked away . <p> Steven Jasinski , Acting Curator of Palaeontology and Geology at the State Museum of Pennsylvania , has dealt with similar issues while working with a dinosaur named Dracorex. - Some have suggested that this small , two-legged plant-eater is actually the juvenile stage of another dinosaur " - the famous bone-headed Pachycephalosaurus . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all except one are in private collections , so whatever information they have to tell us about dinosaur life history is off-limits to scientists . " Even though it would undoubtedly help determining whether these are juveniles or not , we do n't have the specimens , so we ca n't say anything about them , " he explains . <p> Many palaeontologists have fine working relationships with private fossil owners and commercial collectors who are happy to support the work that scientists do , but contrasting priorities can lead to disputes and controversy . For the scientists , it 's important that fossils be collected and cared for professionally , and that important specimens remain available for study and public education . On the other hand , collectors value their right to own and sell the fossils they 've worked to acquire . <p> The most worrisome consequence of big sales like Kan is that they encourage the growth of an expensive fossil marketplace . This can lead to more and more rare and significant fossils being priced well out of reach of scientific institutions . " Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . " They have money to prepare and care for the fossils , but they do n't have excess money to buy fossils . " <p> Sue , the famous- T. rex , - was bought for over $8 million , the most ever paid for a dinosaur , after a lengthy legal dispute . Image : Connie Ma , Wikimedia Commons <p> At its worst , the fossil market can create some very serious problems . With the promise of a high pay-off , some irresponsible collectors may resort to forgeries that cause confusion and frustration , as in the famous case of the hodgepodge fossil " Archaeoraptor " . Others may violate international laws to obtain the fossils they sell : last year , actor Nicolas Cage agreed to return a dinosaur skull he 'd purchased when it was revealed to have been smuggled illegally out of Mongolia . <p> For these reasons , many palaeontologists condemn the sale of fossils . The Society for Vertebrate Palaeontology even has this sentiment written into its bylaws . But most scientists and commercial fossil hunters are not blind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides would be a compromise that allows scientists to access all the fossils they need to and gives private collectors the recognition and compensation they earn . <p> Palaeontologist Kevin Padian- has addressed some of these issues in an editorial on the topic : " Professional palaeontologists have to work to ensure that fossil specimens are appropriately valued and conserved . They also have to be realistic about the business world ... In turn , commercial collectors have to see more than dollar signs in nature . These resources are finite , and they are irreplaceable . Last , but not least , these facts must be conveyed to the public at every opportunity . " <p> Jasinski , too , stresses the importance of scientists communicating with the public , noting that for a beneficial arrangement to be reached , palaeontologists need to convey just how significant fossils are for investigating and understanding nature . " I would hope that we could convince people of the scientific value of these items , and that the potential acquisition of new knowledge would win out over monetary value . "

@@20884016 @884016/ <h> We finally know the identity of ' Baby Louie ' , the dinosaur embryo from a giant egg <p> Over 20 years ago , a unique fossil was unearthed in the Henan Province of China : a dinosaur embryo surrounded by a nest of eggs . Since then , the little petrified creature has travelled across the world and even earned the affectionate nickname " Baby Louie " . But one big question has remained all this time " who were Louie 's parents ? <p> The eggs in Louie 's nest are huge . At over 40 centimetres ( 16in ) long and weighing five kilograms ( 11lbs ) , they 're some of the largest dinosaur eggs ever discovered . But just like ancient trackways , it can be very difficult to connect prehistoric eggs with the species that produced them . Now , an international team of researchers has cracked a part of the riddle . <p> " For many years , it was a mystery as to what kind of dinosaur laid these enormous eggs and nests , " says- Darla Zelenitsky of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now know that these eggs were laid by a gigantic oviraptorosaur , a dinosaur that would have looked a lot like an overgrown cassowary . " <p> Baby Louie was found outside of an egg , probably forced out shortly before hatching . This illustration also shows how it would have curled up inside as it developed . Image : Zhao Chuang <p> Baby Louie finally has a species name : Beibeilong sinensis , or " baby dragon from China " . The fossil is- only 38 centimetres ( 15in ) from snout to rear ( the tail is missing , along with parts of the legs ) , but based on the size of the eggs , the researchers suspect that the parents would have reached sizes similar to the famous Gigantoraptor : eight- metres ( 26ft ) long and weighing at least a couple of tons ! Beibeilong adults would have been some of the biggest two-legged dinosaurs around in China 90 million years ago . <p> Oviraptorosaurs were bipedal and covered in feathers , with- toothless beaked mouths and often showy crests on their heads " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beibeilong and Gigantoraptor are odd ducks ( so to speak ) , as most known members of this group are around the size of a- Velociraptor . <p> However , - our picture of these dinosaurs ' diversity may be lacking .

" Embryos , juveniles and hatchlings of oviraptorosaur dinosaurs are either not known or poorly known , " says Steve Jasinski of the University of Pennsylvania , who was n't involved in this research . " It is difficult to compare babies of one species with adults of another .

But one question has remained unanswered all this time : what motivated these predators to hunt humans ? <p> " The original story was that these lions were desperate and eating anything they could , even crunching on bones , " said Larisa DeSantis of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee .

There , in waters about 500 kilometres east of Newfoundland , the researchers recorded the telltale sounds of an unexpected animal : the northern bottlenose whale . At the time , the team was unable to spot the whales , so this past summer , they went back . <p> " This summer we sailed directly out there , and there they were , " Hal Whitehead , whale researcher at Dalhousie , told CBC News .

" Some people have described- them- as a dolphin on steroids , " said Laura Feyrer , a student at Dalhousie who is studying these animals . " A cute dolphin face , but they 're large and robust , more like killer whale-size almost . " As part of her research , Feyrer will compare these new whales to the populations closer to Nova Scotia , which will allow her to determine how closely related they are . <p> The discovery is somewhat bittersweet for the researchers .

The prevalence of such noise in the area might mean that these newly found whales are already in trouble . <p> Northern bottlenose whales , like many marine animals , have n't had the easiest time living alongside humans . Estimates suggest that close to 100,000 of these whales cruised the oceans in the early 1800s , but more than a century of intense hunting pressures depleted those numbers by more than half , and the big mammals never fully recovered . - <p> These days , we humans are a bit more considerate of the whales . For example , seismic surveys along Canada 's eastern coast are usually stopped if the animals- are spotted close enough to be physically harmed . But many researchers point out that the noise alone from this kind of activity can have harmful effects . Whales use sound for communication , searching for food and finding their way around their habitat . Loud noises can interrupt that behaviour , and can even result in injury or death , said Whitehead . <p> It may not be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic , but noise pollution is a very real , very serious problem for many ocean species .

@@20884046 @884046/ <h> For one of the oldest venomous bites , look to this ancient mammal relative <p> Say hello to an old relative of yours : Euchambersia mirabilis . An ancient cousin of the mammals , it may not seem too unusual from the outside " about half a metre ( 1.5 feet ) long with a mouth full of sharp teeth . But new research into the adaptations inside its jaws hints at something very special indeed : one of the oldest venomous bites in the fossil record . <p> Mammals ( including you and me ) are the only living members of an ancient group called the synapsids . In the distant past , even before the dinosaurs showed up , non-mammal synapsids like Euchambersia dominated their ecosystems . They were quite similar to living mammals , but with unusual features such as reptile-like jaws and a habit of laying eggs instead of giving birth to live young . <p> Euchambersia lived during the Permian Period in what is now South Africa , around 260 million years ago . It shared its habitat with other early mammal cousins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large reptiles like the armoured plant-eating- pareiasaurs . <p> Venom and the glands that contain it do n't typically preserve in fossils , but ever since Euchambersia was first discovered on a South African farm in the early 1930s , palaeontologists have wondered about odd features on its jaws that may have been part of a special venom-delivery system . <p> " The ' venomous- Euchambersia ' - hypothesis is not a new idea , " says Christian Kammerer of the Museum f++r Naturkunde in Berlin , who was not involved in the new study . " It was first proposed by the nobleman scientist Baron Franz Nopcsa in 1933 and has been generally accepted ever since . " <p> But a few scientists have expressed doubts about the venom hypothesis , and Julien Benoit of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg is one of them .

Some of them have shallow ridges along their edges " they 're not deep grooves like some venomous snakes have in their fangs , but the ridges would have provided enough of a channel to direct venom down along the teeth and into the bite wound of a victim . North America 's Gila monster lizards envenomate their prey in a similar fashion . <p> And- there 's more . In each upper jaw , Euchambersia has a bowl-shaped depression " prime real estate for a fluid-secreting gland . Two holes in this bowl lead to a small tunnel called the maxillary canal .

All it would have taken is for the animal to bite down on something and squeeze those glands . <p> Any one of these features by itself would n't be too convincing , but all of them together make a compelling case .

There , archaeologists have spent decades digging up the remains of buildings , tools , and a variety of local animals , including one very intriguing polar bear skull . <p> Any polar bear skull is a sight to behold , but this one , discovered back in 2014 , caught the eye of researchers . At about 40 cm ( 16 in ) long , it 's larger than most of the ancient bear skulls found in this region , and its slender shape brings to mind a legend passed down through generations of local hunters : the tale of the weasel bear . <p> The ancient residents of Walakpa belonged to the I+upiat Birnirk culture , which appeared around 600CE , constructing- homes across the Arctic . These resourceful people had few plants to depend upon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools , building materials and more " they got from the body parts of local mammals , particularly marine creatures like seals and whales . <p> This ivory artefact from Walakpa is thought to be an early stage in the manufacturing of a thimble holder .

The local name for these creatures- is tiriarnaq , meaning " weasel bear " , in reference to their narrow frame . The accounts are striking enough that some have even wondered if these animals might represent a separate species or subspecies . <p> So , could the newly unearthed bear skull represent a weasel bear ?

According to Jensen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Museum of the North by her colleague Raphaela Stimmelmayr from the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife Management . <p> The team- plans to extract DNA from the Walakpa skull , which is well-preserved enough to retain soft tissues , and compare this to modern polar bears . " If it does look different , the next step would be to get permission to sample the similar skulls in Museum of the North , both for dating and for DNA , " Jensen says . If these " weasel bears " are indeed a different- type of bear , their genetic data should show it . <p> The idea that the skull might represent a species unknown to science is definitely intriguing , but polar bear researcher Andrew Derocher of the University of Alberta suspects this is n't the case .

If you focus on the ends of the spectrum , you could easily come up with the weasel and badger bears . " In his view , the Walakpa skull may simply have belonged to a lanky , but otherwise unexceptional , individual . <p> Time may tell us more about these animals , but time is not on the archaeologists ' side . The new bear skull was found after intense erosion exposed new material at Walakpa , and this kind of landscape change is becoming more and more common all along- Arctic coastlines .

@@20884079 @884079/ <h> In photos : Anatomy of a black mamba <p> Black mambas have a pretty bad rap . Shrouded in myth and misinformation , the species is widely feared across much of southern Africa for its potent venom and alleged aggressiveness . But how much do we really know about this iconic species ? From its coffin-shaped head to its uniquely flexible fangs , we 're zooming in on mamba anatomy to bring you seven facts you might not know about these unique snakes . <p> Click on the images to enlarge . <p> Fangs <p> Like all snakes in the Elapidae family , black mambas have fixed , hollow fangs at the front of their mouths that they use like hypodermic needles to inject venom into their prey . But what sets the mamba apart from many other elapids , like cobras and kraits , is that black mambas have an " articulating maxillary bone " that allows their fangs to rock back and forth . This slight movability in their fangs makes the black mamba a very efficient hunter , able to deliver large amounts of venom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the species ) . <p> Windpipe <p> Snakes can not bite or tear into their prey like many other predators , so instead they must swallow their meals whole . This adaptation makes breathing during eating a tricky task . So to avoid suffocation during supper , black mambas ( like many other snake species ) have an extendible trachea or windpipe that works kind of like a snorkel , allowing them to breathe while ingesting prey . The opening of the trachea , known as the glottis , either sticks out to the side or under the prey while it 's being consumed . <p> Saliva <p> It 's no secret that the venom of the black mamba is extremely potent . Mambas usually deliver about 100-120mg of venom in a single bite " that 's enough to kill 8-14 people ( but do n't worry , despite their fearsome reputation , black mambas are typically shy creatures and will usually not attack unless confronted ) . Venom is produced by a modified salivary gland and digestive enzymes in the saliva help soften the meal while the venom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its meal , the prey 's insides have already started breaking down . <p> Scales <p> Widely considered to be one of the fastest snakes in Africa , black mambas have been clocked travelling at speeds of 11kmph ( 6.8mph ) over short distances , and are able to navigate through thick vegetation thanks to shiny , smooth scales . Scales on the snake 's belly ( ventral scales ) may also help the mamba move over flat surfaces. - Research conducted in 2009 revealed how snake scales act as " friction hooks " , gripping into rough points on the ground and helping propel the animals forward . <p> Mouth <p> Black mambas are n't actually black , despite a common name that suggests otherwise . Instead , the species is named for the deep blueish-black colouration on the inside of the mouth . Their bodies come in a variety of olive-grey shades with a grey-green underbelly . Juveniles are usually lighter in colour . If confronted , mambas will often put on a startling display by flaring their neck-flaps and opening their mouth to expose the black colouration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attackers or distract them for long enough to allow the snake to slither away . <p> Vision <p> Not all snakes were created equal . Some species can only just distinguish between light and dark , while others , particularly arboreal species such as the boomslang , were gifted with keen eyesight . Like most diurnal snakes in South Africa , black mambas are considered to have good vision . They are able to detect motion and may strike if they pick up any sudden movement perceived as a threat . Their keen eyesight also helps them hunt for the small mammals that typically make up their diet . <p> Head shape <p> Not sure if that visitor in your garden is a harmless house snake or a potentially lethal mamba ? Here 's a clue . While most snake species have blunt , round or triangular-shaped heads , both black and green mambas have a distinctive , coffin-shaped head that helps form their streamlined shape .

The fish have- very little- built-in structural support , so it 's all that deep-sea pressure that- actually- holds- everything together. - When- hauled to the surface , however , blobfish encounter a rapid pressure drop , and the anatomy that works so well at great depths suddenly- turns on them , - expanding and falling into a gooey mess . <p> Most of what we 've learned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive in its natural- habitat is always a treat " even for the- seasoned- crew of the Nautilus .

@@20884086 @884086/ <h> What causes massive fish die-offs ? <p> On Monday morning , residents of Hampton Bays in eastern Long Island , New York gathered at the Shinnecock Canal to stare at the tragic sight of thousands and thousands of dead fish . As you might expect , many locals- have voiced concerns about pollution , but experts provide a much more likely explanation for the die-off : the fish suffocated . <p> When fish die in large numbers , it 's officially called a " fish kill " . These events can have a variety of causes , but among the most common is a lack of oxygen . Fish do n't breathe air , but they still take in oxygen dissolved in the water around them , and if those oxygen levels drop too low , it can spell disaster . As the USGS Water website points out : " That 's why it 's important to have an aeration device , a bubbler , in your home aquarium . " <p> When the locks in Shinnecock Canal were closed at 3:00am on Monday , they locked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to the Department of Environmental Conservation , these fish probably fled into the canal to escape predators , and then became trapped . Local government and university experts have pointed out that with so many fish in a small , sealed-off area , oxygen levels would have dropped quickly . By the time the locks were opened at 10:00am , many fish had already died . <p> This event may be dramatic , but it is n't unique . A similar fish kill situation occurred in California in 2011 , where thousands of sardines apparently crammed ( you know , like sardines ) into a harbour to escape rough waters , and became stuck there as oxygen in the water depleted . <p> In fact , fish kills are a lot more common than you may think . The Southwest Regional Office of the Florida Fish &amp; Wildlife Conservation Commission reports that , across just 13 counties in Florida , between 100 and 150 fish kills are recorded each year , most due to low oxygen . This tends to be more common in summer months , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gobler noted that the waters of Shinnecock Bay have been unseasonably warm lately , which may have contributed to this latest mass death . <p> Long Island is no stranger to low-oxygen fish kills . In May and June of 2015 , three major fish kill events occurred in the Peconic River , killing hundreds of thousands of bunker fish . Scientific investigation found that the waters were not toxic , but that the river had experienced extended periods of low oxygen . The same explanation was reached for similar fish kills in the river in 2008 and 2009. - <p> The low-oxygen levels in the Peconic were found to be related to high water temperatures , high concentrations of fish , and perhaps most importantly , large amounts of early-blooming algae , whose growth was boosted by nutrients ( nitrogen and phosphorus ) added to the water from human sewage and other runoff . <p> Algae survive through photosynthesis , which means they release oxygen during the day . But at night , they " breathe " the same way we do : taking in oxygen and releasing carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their decomposition removes yet more oxygen from the water . All in all , big algal blooms can quickly create a fatally low-oxygen environment , particularly when fuelled by human pollutants in warm waters populated by lots of fish . - <p> Algae can also form infamous " red tides " , large toxin-releasing blooms that can accumulate in fish and spread through the food web . These happen nearly every summer in the Gulf of Mexico , and a particularly dramatic case occurred last year on the west coast of North America , stretching from California to Alaska . Aside from forcing many fisheries to close for fear of toxic harvests , that incident was also linked to widespread illness in birds , sea lion strandings and whale- deaths . <p> The list of factors that can cause mass fish mortality is actually pretty extensive .

Honey badgers are messy eaters and often leave a little something behind for the birds and jackals . <p> For the most part , these interactions are amicable .

These mutated plants ca n't produce their own energy and they live only a short time before dying off . It 's a strange existence " one that has puzzled naturalists since these trees were first documented in 1866. - <p> An " albino " plant is n't the same as an albino animal . The latter condition causes the absence of the pigment melanin , but in plants , it comes down to another missing pigment , the one that allows photosynthesis to happen , chlorophyll. - <p> Without chlorophyll , these trees lack- the ability to produce precious sugar , so they must sponge off- the root systems of healthy redwoods- to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , albino redwoods have been called parasites over the years . But something about the interaction did n't add up for University of California , Davis PhD- candidate- Zane- Moore : the healthy trees actually allow it to happen . <p> " Redwood trees can control where they send their sugars , " explains Moore . At any given time , - therefore , - a healthy tree could easily stop feeding its pale freeloaders , killing them off in the process. - " But that 's not what we see in nature , " he says . " Why would a tree want albino foliage to persist ? Why promote a stressful tissue that does not provide for the rest of the plant ? " <p> When a plant or animal willingly gives up its resources to another , there 's almost always a reason . Whale lice keep the wounds of their gigantic hosts clean , so they 're allowed to camp on- their skin ; bees fly from flower to flower gathering nectar , but pollinate in the process ; the bacteria in our guts help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some benefit to keeping these arboreal apparitions around , Moore- reasoned. - <p> To find out what it was , he- teamed up with local arborist Tom Stapleton . The pair focused their work on the rarest albino morph : a split-toned wonder known as a " chimera " . While some mutants " known as " everwhites " " appear completely white or yellow , chimeric trees possess both green and ghostly branches . In fact , some chimeras even have green , white and split-coloured needles on the same branch . This is possible because the rare trees have two sets of DNA . Of the 400-odd known albino redwoods in California , just ten possess the rare trait . <p> " We looked at green and white leaves growing as closely together as possible , " explains Moore . " I expected that the albino tissues would be different from green . " But what he found buried within the trees ' cells was unexpected : the- white shoots were n't just sucking sugar from their normal- neighbours " - they were also absorbing harmful toxins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It gives new meaning to the term ' ghost tree ' , " notes Moore . " They 're alive , but really , they should be dead . " <p> Among the toxins were heavy metals like cadmium , copper and nickel . At high enough concentrations , these elements are lethal to plants " and white needles contained- double ( and in some cases triple ) the amount found in green needles . <p> " The green tissues showed that they were at the threshold of toxicity for all of these metals , basically meaning that they were at the brink of irreversible poisoning , " he adds . From the healthy plant 's perspective , therefore , handing over some precious sugars to the albino ( the risk ) meant getting some relief from toxins in return ( the benefit ) . <p> Albino plants are more efficient at absorbing heavy metals because they move water from root to leaf faster . Once absorbed , those toxins become trapped " no longer able to enter the redwood roots " and seemingly removed from the environment for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random mutation , may well have persisted through the centuries as an ecological lifeline . " Tom and I have noticed that albino redwoods occur with much more frequency close to areas of high human impact ( places where redwoods do not naturally grow ) , " adds Moore . " The foliage grows quickly , accumulates toxins , and dies , and this happens repetitively . " <p> Mine tailings , waste disposal , fertilisers , coal combustion residues , and leaded gasoline and paints are just some of the sources of these toxic metals . If Moore 's hypothesis is correct , strategically grafting albino trees could help mitigate damage to the forest ecosystem . <p> The next step will be to conduct experiments in a controlled environment . The plan is to water trees with a solution containing high levels of nickel to see if redwoods with albino shoots grow better than those without a built-in clean up crew . <p> " If they do , this will really be remarkable , " says Moore .

In its last few minutes of life , - does a fly actually perceive a flyswatter as scary ? That 's the question that California Institute of Technology postdoctoral fellow William T. Gibson wanted to answer. - <p> There 's a long tradition in psychology and neuroscience of avoiding anthropomorphisation : just because an animal behaves- as if- it is afraid does n't mean it actually is. - If you suggest that flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one will argue with you , " said Gibson in a statement. - " But taking the question a step further " whether flies that flee a stimulus are actually afraid of that stimulus " is much more difficult . " <p> It would be simple if we could talk to flies and ask whether they 're afraid , but since we obviously ca n't do that , the next best strategy is to break the complex emotion of fear into its building blocks , which Gibson refers to as " emotional primitives " . <p> One primitive is persistence : an animal remains scared even after the fearful stimulus has gone away . For example , we might become afraid when we see a clown , but thanks to our increased heart rate and amped-up adrenaline , that feeling will continue long after the clown has disappeared . <p> A second primitive is scale : the more clowns pile out of a clown car , the more afraid you become . <p> Yet another primitive is generalisability : once the clowns have made you afraid , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gibson 's experiment was simple : a group of flies was placed in a small arena over which a paddle moved back and forth , casting a dark shadow below . The researchers recorded video of the experiment and carefully analysed the flies ' behaviour. - <p> They reasoned that if the flies ' actions were persistent , scalable and generalisable , then their response to the shadow might be similar , at least in some fundamental way , to our own response to a gaggle of scary clowns , or gunshots , or heights , or sloths doing " Grudge " impersonations- " or anything else that makes us afraid. - <p> And that 's just what the researchers found : it looked as if the flies were afraid ( or , to be most conservative , their behaviour was fear-like ) . The " fearful " behaviour continued long after the shadow had disappeared , and each time it passed over the arena , the flies flew or hopped away faster and faster . When the shadow passed over hungry flies , they stopped eating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer to resume their feeding . In other words , the flies seemed to react to the shadow the same way a human reacts to a succession of scary clowns : they became more and more scared , and took longer and longer to calm down . <p> A well-fed fly might be best suited to running away from a threat since it knows it will easily find a meal once the danger passes . But a fly that does n't know where or when it might find more food has to make an important decision : is it better to hide and risk losing out on an important meal , or is it better to keep eating and risk becoming someone else 's dinner ? That 's why a fearful response in a hungry fly suggests there 's a more complex cognitive process at work , not just a- quick , impulsive reaction . <p> This study is the first time that researchers have subjected flies to a repeated negative stimulus , and in doing so , they seem to have confirmed that the flies ' behaviour is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continued scrutiny , then the humble fruit fly might be poised to reveal more about the biology that governs our emotions than even other primates can . <p> So what 's next ? The researchers plan to find out more about the genetics and neurobiology behind the insects ' fear-like responses .

But on the humpback whale , you ca n't miss ' em. - <p> About the size of your fist , these ' tubercles ' form a kind of ringed fortress , protecting the hair inside . Within each tubercle is a bundle of thick nerve cells connected to the hair , which sticks out a few centimeters from the middle of the mound like a lonely flag . So what do humpbacks and other whales use their highly enervated and sensitive facial whiskers for ? It 's one of the best-kept secrets in the scientific world .

It was even once assumed that the hair served no purposes at all , and was just a leftover evolutionary trait from when the land-based ancestors of whales needed hair to protect themselves from the cold . <p> The reality is that whale hair " and humpback tubercles in particular " has received very little attention by scientists . This is partly because of the difficulty in obtaining samples of whale facial hair " a knock-on effect of the welcome global moratorium on whaling- ( but one that 's also unfortunate for whale-hair anatomists ) . <p> Mercado 's study , one of just a handful from recent years , has helped she 'd some light on the function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number and placement of humpback tubercles ( ranging between 30 and 60 depending on the individual ) , Mercado found that tubercles form patterns around the head of the whale .

The oldest fossil evidence of lions is just under 1.5 million years old , but Barnett's- study indicated that- Panthera spelaea- and- Panthera leo- had an ancestor almost two million years ago ! This means there 's half a million years ' worth of lion evolution we have n't yet found in the fossil record . <p> What was this two million-year-old ancestral lion like ? - What other differences existed between these two ferocious felines ?

Show this meal what you 're made of . <p> With prey in reach , the goblin shark 's jaws jut out , moving at a whopping 3.1 metres per second .

That 's a well-established fact you 'll find in any book describing dolphin biology and anatomy . But one little dolphin in New Zealand clearly has n't done the reading . May we present the first documented case of a mouth-breathing dolphin . <p> Image : - Steve Dawson/University of Otago <p> Stephen Dawson and his team of researchers from the University of Otago first observed the strange behaviour off New Zealand 's Banks Peninsula back in 2014 .

" The published literature states , and the prevailing view among marine mammalogists- was , that this was impossible , " notes Dawson in an- interview with- Hakai- Magazine . <p> Dolphins evolved a breathing hole on the top of their head to make breathing in air while submerged less dangerous . During the course of evolution , the dolphin larynx changed its shape to form a kind of plug that reaches into the nasal cavity . This bizarre plug , sometimes called a goosebeak or epiglottic spout , tunnels right through the oesophagus and lodges snugly in the air passage leading to the blowhole , resulting in " complete separation of the- respiratory and digestive tracts " . <p> Scientists have long known that this laryngeal plug can be moved out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach to retrieve accidentally swallowed objects will often fight against the plug as the dolphin tenses its muscles to keep it in place . Sometimes after a dolphin has been anaesthetised , it will take a couple of breaths through its mouth after the ventilation tube has been removed , before its respiratory muscles come back online to stick the plug back in position . And then there are examples of dolphins that choked to death when they shifted their laryngeal plug aside to swallow large fish . In one case , a pilot whale choked to death when a fish tried to escape through its blowhole . <p> Even though dolphins seem to have some muscular control over their larynx , it was widely believed that they could n't " or at least would n't " attempt to move their laryngeal plug ( and risk drowning ) in order to breathe through their mouths .

" The animal is in great condition and looks absolutely normal , except for this weird breathing behaviour , " - Dawson tells- New Scientist . <p> Whatever the reason behind this respiratory quirk , we can no longer claim that dolphins do n't breathe through their mouths .

Historically , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eurasian steppe region , but poaching for meat and horns , and mass mortalities like the die-off earlier this year , have shrunk their range to just one location in Russia and three areas in Kazakhstan . <p> The bizarre saiga die-off occurred in May this year and it 's a truly grim phenomenon . In less than a month more than half of the entire global species was wiped out . Carcasses littered the calving grounds in- Kazakhstan's- Betpak-Dala- region " home to the world 's largest saiga population . Although initial estimates tallied the death toll at 120,000 , Steffen Zuther of the Frankfurt Zoological Society believes that as many as 211,000 may have perished ; that 's 88% of the Betpak-Dala population ( to put that into context , if humans suffered a similar loss of life , it would be the equivalent of wiping out all life outside of the Americas plus an extra 100,000 or so people ) . <p> Although the die-off is not completely understood , experts have narrowed down the possible culprits : sharp changes in weather and bacteria gone bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in temperature stressed out the saigas , weakening their immune systems and triggering usually harmless- bacteria to explode into violent infections , causing extensive internal bleeding that kills the animals in a matter of hours .

You might remember the 2010 die-off , or maybe the massive one from 1988 ? In fact , records of saigas dying en masse date back as far as 1955 . The worst mortality on record happened in 1988 , with a staggering death count of 434,000 animals .

There may be a small silver lining to this profoundly gloomy cloud . Although the saiga die-offs have been happening for some time , researchers have been previously unable to conclusively narrow down the cause of death . The latest studies are more positive .

Without them , the planet would be pest-ridden to biblical proportions , with much reduced biodiversity . They are a natural asset of a world dominated by humans , providing us with free services that contribute to our economy , society and ecology . <p> This huge and diverse assemblage belongs to the order Hymenoptera and is divided into two groups , the Parasitica and the Aculeata . Almost 80,000 species of wasps belong to the Parasitica group , which lay their eggs in or on their prey or plants using elongated tubular organs called ovipositors . The remaining 33,000 species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones whose ovipositors have been modified through evolution to form a sting . <p> Both parasitic and predatory wasps have a massive impact on the abundance of arthropods , the largest phylum in the animal kingdom , which includes spiders , mites , insects , and centipedes .

This regulation of populations is arguably their most important role , both ecologically and economically . <p> Although the majority of wasps lead solitary lives , it is the 1,000 or so species of social wasps which make the biggest impression on insect populations . Social wasp queens share their nests with thousands of offspring workers , who raise upwards of 10,000 sibling larvae during the colony cycle . This means a single nest provides a whopping bang for buck in terms of ecosystem services , killing vast numbers of spiders , millipedes and crop-devouring insects . <p> Many social wasps are generalist predators too , which means they control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe any single species out . This makes them extremely useful , minimising the need for toxic pesticides , but unlikely to threaten prey biodiversity . It is not yet possible to accurately quantify their huge economic value in this regard , but their diet of agricultural pests such as caterpillars , aphids and whiteflies makes a massive contribution to global food security . <p> Wasps also play a crucial role in ecosystems as specialist pollinators . The relationship between figs and fig wasps is arguably the most interdependent pollination symbiosis known to man . Without one another , neither the fig nor fig wasp can complete their life-cycle " a textbook example of co-evolution which is estimated to have been ongoing for at least 60m years . Figs are keystone species in tropical regions worldwide " their fruit supports the diets of at least 1,274 mammals and birds .

One type even provide their larvae with pollen instead of insect prey . These " pollen-wasps " are considered to perform the same ecological roles as bees , pollinating a diverse array of plants . <p> Unfortunately , while bees are credited with contributing at least G100 billion a year to the global economy through their acts of pollination , the works of wasps in the same sector is often ignored . <p> Even the wasps ' sting could have a positive impact on the human population .

@@20884176 @884176/ <h> Could ' smelly ' snails ward off a major Great Barrier Reef enemy ? <p> The beautiful Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef system in the world , and it 's in trouble . One of its biggest threats is a nasty marine predator called the crown-of-thorns starfish , which can devastate reefs by feeding upon the coral . But scientists at the Australian Institute of Marine Science may have discovered a way to hold off this attacker " because just like any big bully , deep down the starfish is a scaredy-cat . <p> Thanks to its big appetite for coral , the crown-of-thorns starfish is a major enemy of the Great Barrier Reef . Image : John Turnbull , Flickr <p> Okay , it might be unfair to call the starfish a bully . After all , it 's only trying to survive . The problem is that it 's just so good at it . The crown-of-thorns starfish ( COTS ) gets its name from the hundreds of sharp , toxic spines covering its body , which make any ocean-goer think twice before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starfish are super-reproducers . According to Dr Mike Hall , - they can have the highest fertilisation rate of any known marine invertebrate . And for all those hungry COTS , coral is at the top of the menu . <p> Population outbreaks of the starfish are a major problem for coral in the Great Barrier Reef . In fact , they rank #2 on the list of reasons the iconic reef system is in decline , just below tropical cyclones and just above bleaching due to warming ocean waters . But unlike storms and global warming , the starfish have natural enemies , and chief among them is the Pacific triton . This snail may be key to protecting the reef. - <p> The Pacific triton is also called the " giant triton " because it can grow to a whopping two feet long .

The starfish was positively terrified of these snails . <p> So here 's the brilliant plan : by strategically planting tritons across the reef , researchers might be able to spread enough of that scary smell around to keep the starfish away from those areas .

In the end , a bit of snail stink might be a step towards preserving the beauty of the world 's most famous reef system . 
@@20884177 @884177/ <p> The basic divide is whether the existence of a legal trade in ivory encourages further poaching or whether a regulated legal trade would serve to reduce incentives to poach . CITES voted in 1989 to put all Africa 's elephants on the list of most endangered animals , banning all trade in ivory between member countries . <p> The ban has remained at the insistence of East African countries , notably Kenya , with the backing of Western governments and international nongovernmental organisations .

A recent decision by the European Union ( EU ) to back the southern African position for the first time could well tip the balance against the pro-ban lobby . The EU has 28 member countries . <h> Exempt their elephants <p> Namibia and Zimbabwe have already petitioned CITES to exempt their elephants from the ivory trade ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving . Income from legal stocks of ivory would generate income to improve conservation and anti-poaching efforts , they argue . <p> But this bid will be opposed by the 29 African range states that make up the African Elephant Coalition . Members of this coalition want a complete and permanent ban on ivory sales . They have gone further to demand the destruction of ivory stocks . Leading coalition member Kenya burned 105 tonnes of ivory in April this year . <p> But the southern African states do not belong to the coalition , and even Botswana , which banned hunting in 2014 and has not applied to sell ivory , has vehemently opposed ivory burning . Botswanan President Ian Khama was in Kenya for an elephant summit in April but refused to attend the ivory burning ceremony , denouncing it as wrong and wasteful . <p> Botswana and other southern African nations all oppose a permanent ban on trading . They have long held the view that the 1989 ban has been a costly and unsuccessful experiment that has signally failed to stop poaching . Elephant populations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half the estimated 400,000 to 630,000 elephants remaining in Africa . <h> Ban on all ivory trading <p> The push against ivory trade started in the 1980s . It was led by East African-based conservationists and animal welfare groups alarmed by the massive wave of poaching that had started in the 1970s and continued into the 1980s . Between 1979 and 1988 , elephant numbers fell from about 1.3 million across sub-Saharan Africa to less than 700,000 . <p> The drastic fall was almost entirely due to poaching to meet massive demand in Hong Kong and Japan , among others . Ivory prices had increased tenfold between 1970 and 1979 , reaching US$74 per kilogram . Prices in China " now the main market " are currently about $1,200 per kilogram , having dropped recently from $2,100 . <p> The decimation of the African herd has led some conservationists and advocacy groups to demand a ban on all ivory trading . At first not a single African elephant range state agreed . Southern African states had growing elephant populations in contrast with East , Central and West Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quota system to control the trade . But this was poorly operated and failed to overcome the massive corruption that was involved in illegal ivory trading . It also enabled poached tusks to be passed off as legal ones . <p> Eventually , after Kenya and Tanzania were won over to the ivory ban camp , CITES voted in 1989 to put all Africa 's elephants on its Appendix 1 of most endangered animals and ban all trade in ivory between member countries . <p> This was opposed by the southern African states who inserted a caveat that they could apply to have their elephants downlisted in the future to Appendix 2 . This would allow trade in ivory if agreed to by CITES . The 1997 CITES meeting in Harare sanctioned two one-off legal ivory sales in 1999 and 2008 at which Botswana , Namibia and Zimbabwe sold legal stocks to Japan and China .

Nevertheless , legal sales undoubtedly give a signal that the purchase of ivory is acceptable and so undercut attempts at demand reduction . <p> Pro-ban advocates like Kenya argue that the legal sales have encouraged trading and led to a surge in poaching in the early 2000s and the first three years of the current decade . But there are far more convincing arguments that the rising prosperity of China and its emergence as a huge market for ivory prompted the huge resurgence in poaching rather than one-off sales . <p> The major increase in killing for ivory led to the deaths of an estimated 100,000 elephants in 2010 to 2012 . Poaching rates are still thought to be about 20,000 to 30,000 a year . The very heavy poaching occurs in southern Tanzania , northern Mozambique , and Central and West Africa . <p> What makes the September summit even more interesting and controversial is the decision by the EU to oppose a total global ban on ivory sales . The European Commission opposes an all-encompassing ban in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission says countries with growing elephant numbers should be encouraged to manage their populations in a sustainable manner . The sustainability argument has been a main plank of those arguing that the total ban is ineffective and counter-productive . <h> Extinction of the African elephant <p> As the current moratorium on all ivory sales ends in 2017 , CITES will have to make a decision in September . In the past the EU has generally supported the ban and the moratorium on all legal sales . And so the anti-trade camp has responded to the new position with fury and shock . <p> One of the voices raised against the EU is that of Andrew Seguya , the director of Uganda 's Wildlife Authority . He told the Guardian : <p> If the EU prevents an Annex I listing , it will be the beginning of the extinction of the African elephant for sure . <p> What he failed to mention is that elephant poaching on a massive scale in the past five years has not taken place among the downlisted populations in southern Africa .

In case you missed all the hoo-ha , the trailer claims naturalist and wildlife filmmaker Paul Rosolie will ' enter ' the belly of an anaconda in a custom-built , snake-proof suit , covered in boar blood to entice the reptilian to ' eat him alive ' , with a rope attached to allow for his safe retrieval . We could spend this time weighing in on whether the stunt threatens- the animal 's welfare- ( we 'll leave that one to you ) . Instead , in honour of the awesome that is snake biology , what say we take the bait and pose a new question : What would you really have to do to get an anaconda to eat you ? - <p> " I have a hard time believing that someone would or could actually make this happen , " says- Auburn University- wildlife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest native snake , the indigo snake . With Steen to guide us , let 's take a little tour of- snake biology- to discuss some of the obvious obstacles that anyone attempting a stunt like this would face . <p> Finding the right species <p> First of all , you can put that Indy-inspired snake phobia- to rest ... - referring to anacondas as ' man-eaters ' is more than a bit sensational . The term anaconda does n't just refer to one animal , but rather to a group of large constricting snakes . There are four different species of anacondas that we know of , ranging in size from the three metre ( 9ft ) - yellow anaconda- ( Eunectes notaeus ) - pictured above , to the six to nine metre ( 20-30ft ) - green anaconda- ( Eunectes murinus ) , the- supposed star of- Eaten Alive . Though no anaconda species has ever been known to actively seek out hominid snacks ( in fact , - the only two well-documented strikes were on anaconda researchers ) , the reality is that most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to. - <p> Building the right suit <p> In the unlikely event that you 've landed yourself in a snake 's ' loving embrace ' , the animal will be relying on cues from- your body- to tell it whether to move on to the ' nomnomnom ' stage or to give up altogether. - The goal of a snake squeeze is n't to crush prey ... it 's to suffocate it , explains Steen . " When constricting prey , snakes try to restrict air flow until the animal stops breathing . Their grip becomes tighter and tighter over time as air is expelled , " he explains , adding that any suit made of material that is unlikely to bend in response to a snake 's grip should- in theory- help the wearer escape a snake 's constriction unharmed . Research has also shown that constrictors have the remarkable ability to detect their prey 's heartbeat , and start to relax their grip only as the heartbeat slows and eventually ceases. - A wild snake would not attempt to swallow something it did n't perceive to be dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an impressive 84 psi ... but what many people do n't realise is that doing so is energy- expensive ( an anaconda 's metabolism kicks up seven-fold when squeezing ! ) , and as such , a snake is unlikely to attempt to waste energy trying to eat something that wo n't be easily killed or that does not make up part of its natural diet. - <p> Having ' snake meal appeal ' <p> For the purposes of this serpent-spilunking- analysis , we 're going to assume that you 've beaten the odds : your super-suit is hard enough to protect your skeleton ( we would not want to be part of the material testing phase ! ) , blocks your heartbeat from being detected , allows you to breathe incognito and gives the snake the unlikely impression that you 're a food source . You may now pass go and collect $200 . But there is one major obstacle we have n't touched on yet : wild snakes are not scavengers . <p> Though your pet snake might be accustomed to eating pre-killed prey , snakes rarely engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't imagine why adding blood to a suit would make it more appealing to a snake , " explains Steen . This is due in part to the fact that snakes are not well-equipped to scavenge . With the exception of tree-dwelling species , most snakes have relatively underdeveloped eyesight and rely on the abrupt movements , - vibrations- or heat signatures- of passing animals to alert them to a potential meal . If you want to entice your reptilian opponent , your tough snake-proof suit better let some of that body heat through and you 'd better start throwing shapes ( for best results , we suggest ' The Carlton Dance ' ) . <p> Getting inside the snake - <p> While deer , capybara , turtles and caimans make up the majority of a green anaconda 's diet , from a strictly physical standpoint , swallowing an adult human does n't escape the realm of possibility for an extremely large specimen . Snake jaws are not fused to the braincase like they are in other vertebrates , but rather float loosely connected by extremely flexible ligaments- " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( it 's a common misconception that snakes dislocate their jaws to accomplish mind-boggling feats of ' open wide ' ) . " There is actually very little evidence that a person has ever been killed by a green anaconda , let alone eaten . This is not to say , however , that it 's not possible , " clarifies Steen . <p> But we have to remember that your custom-built super-suit keeps you from being crushed , and therein lies the problem . Without being able to manipulate your bones , - it is unlikely that the snake would get past your shoulder girth without reaching its physical limit , or simply becoming disinterested and giving up . Unless you are one seriously svelte human , there is just no continuing down the anaconda 's slimy digestive tract . <p> Finding your way out <p> This is a simple case of what goes down must come up . " If the snake was big enough to swallow the prey , I think it would be relatively straightforward to have it come out again , especially because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Steen explains . - <p> He also notes that snakes will intentionally regurgitate prey when the need arises ... but that does n't mean it 's a pleasant experience . " It 's hard for a snake to escape predators when it has a big meal inside of it , " he says . " If they are threatened or harassed they will regurgitate a recent meal so they can move faster , but a key point here is that the snake needs to be made threatened or stressed out for this to happen . " <p> And there is a big difference between regurgitation and having your food pulled out from inside of you " - this is where things could get a bit hairy for the snake . " It 's not hard to imagine some serious abrasions or even fatal internal injuries occurring as a result , " says Steen ( and this particular concern has caused the biggest outcry from the public ) . But what is being largely- overlooked is that- getting this far in the process is extremely unlikely. - Discovery claims neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filming of the show , so we 're going to wager that things are not quite as they seem . - <p> " In any case ... snakes are fascinating animals that are not well known by most people and that is probably why they 're so feared .

@@20884243 @884243/ <p> The jungles of the central Annamites are renowned for their incredible diversity of small carnivores . The number of sharp-toothed furry critters roaming these forests should send a shiver of fear down the back of anything rabbit-sized or smaller " and a shiver of excitement for any tropical biologists who find themselves in this corner of southeast Asia ! - <p> It 's an impressive list : - yellow-throated marten , Asian palm civet , masked palm civet , - large Indian civet , small and large-toothed ferret badgers , - spotted linsang , small Asian mongoose , crab-eating mongoose ... it 's like a small carnivore celebrity gathering . But as spectacular as these animals are , none can compare , in my opinion , to the star of the show : the- Owston 's civet . <p> The Owston 's civet ( Chrotogale owstoni ) is among Asia 's most mysterious carnivores . <p> This member of the small carnivore gang is unique for several reasons . For a start , it has a very small distribution : found in Vietnam , Laos and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered an Annamite endemic . It 's also one of the most striking mammals to stalk these jungles . Slender and muscled , it has a buff-coloured background coat streaked by midnight-black bands that spill down the body and then dissolve into Pollock-like spots and streaks . <p> And the civet is as mysterious as it is visually stunning . Very little is known of its ecology , distribution or status in the wild , with most assessments consisting of little more than best guesses from biologists working in the region . <p> The species is currently listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN , which , at one step away from Endangered , means that it 's not doing great . In a region where wildlife trade flourishes , the days of this small forest phantom could be numbered . <p> Fortunately , there are still areas in the Annamites that seem to support decent numbers , though these havens are increasingly rare . I picture them as remnant species-pools fast evaporating in a scorching desert landscape . <p> In fact , research published in the journal- Small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests the forests of the remote and unexplored- Xe- Sap- National Protected Area in southern Laos- might be the region 's last- stronghold for the Owston 's civet. - ( For those readers bold enough to step into the somewhat stuffy prose of scientific literature , the full paper can be accessed- here . ) <p> These camera trap photos suggest the remote forests of Laos might be the last stronghold of the Owston 's civet . <p> The gist of the research is this : - Camera-trapping- work from western Xe Sap captured a surprisingly high number of Owston 's civet photos . In fact , during the year-long study , it- was the most commonly photographed small carnivore , surpassing even run-of-the-mill- species like Asian palm civet and crab-eating mongoose . <p> These encounters confirm what biologists have observed in other parts of the civet 's range : this is a terrestrial species that , unlike many other small carnivores , spends most of its- time on the ground . Sadly , this trait probably- makes it more vulnerable to snaring by hunters . <p> But the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps can easily pick up- the ground-roaming- Owston 's civets if these small carnivores are present in an area . If they do n't show up , it 's likely because their numbers are so low that they 're close to being wiped out " or they simply are n't there . <p> And that has profound and worrying implications for the fate of the civets in other parts of their range . In fact , despite more than 15,000 camera-trapping nights in Vietnam's- Hue- and- Quang Nam Saola Nature Reserves , the World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) failed to track down the Owston 's civet , even though these areas were once home to the species . <p> In other words , it seems plausible- that the carnivores are gone " another victim of the relentless snaring that has decimated wildlife populations in Vietnam . And that also means the remote forests of Laos might now be the last and best hope for the survival of this remarkable species in the central Annamites.

@@20884294 @884294/ <h> Researchers crack the code of otter chatter <p> Giant otters , the river- and lake-dwelling Amazonian cousins of the charismatic oceanic critters , are adorable and goofy and smell vaguely of fish . These- endangered- animals are fairly unique from other otters by their high level of sociality : they form family groups of as many as nine individuals , comprised of a breeding pair and their juvenile and sub-adult offspring from different breeding seasons . They 're also quite the chatterboxes , known to be quite noisy . <p> To figure out how otters talk to each other , the researchers went to Peru and recorded the chatter of five otter groups from five different lakes and made detailed observations about what the otters were doing so they could match the behaviours up with each recorded bark , hum and scream . They also recorded the babble among the giant otters in three different German zoos . <p> They were able to work out , for example , that a whistle means something like " I 'm hungry " while a growl means " nuh-uh , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an approaching predator , such as a human or a caiman , while isolation calls might mean " hey , where 'd everybody go ? ! " since they are used only when an otter has lost sight of its group. - <p> The calls all fall within five broad categories . There are the cohesion calls , which keep the group together and coordinated , the alarm calls , which are used either to alert others about a possible threat or to maintain the dominance hierarchy , and the begging calls , which are used to ask ( or demand ) others to share their food . Two other types of calls are emitted only in the contexts of mating or nursing . <p> Why do giant otters have such an impressive array of sounds ? It might seem surprising , since neotropical otters only have four calls , Eurasian otters have around eight and the familiar sea otters have just ten. - <p> In 2012 , psychologist Todd M. Freeberg put forward the social complexity hypothesis for communication . The basic argument goes that animals who negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication . So far the pattern seems to hold up : primate species that live in bigger groups or within more complicated social hierarchies have a wider variety of calls than those with simpler social lives . Humans are perhaps the most social and the most vocal of all primates . The pattern also holds up for canids ( wolves , coyotes , dogs and their relatives ) and even for the herpestids , animals like mongooses and meerkats . <p> So is this true for otters as well ? The authors of the new study argue the otters represent a good suite of species to further test Freeberg 's idea , because among the thirteen species still in existence there is wide variation in both social and vocal complexity . <p> But Mumm and Kn+rnschild note that large group size in an otter species does n't guarantee vocal complexity " sea otters , for example , gather in the thousands , but have only around ten different calls . Rather than the number of individuals in a group , - it 's the strength of social relationships that matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having lots of otters within a social group does not necessarily mean that their relationships are complicated . The massive aggregations of sea otters are made up just of males and only occur when they 're not busy trying to mate with the females .

The giant otters , on the other hand , might live in smaller groups , but their relationships are longer lasting and more nuanced . It makes sense , then , that they 'd need more ways to talk to each other . <p> The researchers hope that an improved understanding of giant-otter chatter could help to facilitate conservation efforts for the endangered species . That could be thanks to a greater interest taken in the animals by scientists who study vocal communication .

This hypothesis , however , has never been confirmed , and until now nobody has worked out what causes the redness in the first place . <p> But recently , a group of researchers led by Pedro Mayor of the Autonomous University of Barcelona set out to solve the long-standing colour mystery . To do so , they collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Amazonian monkeys. * They published their results this week in the journal Royal Society Open Science. - <p> First , the uakaris ' faces look so red because of a huge number of small blood-carrying capillaries just beneath the skin 's surface .

In comparison , the skin samples from every other monkey species the researchers looked at " woolly monkeys , saki monkeys , howler monkeys , capuchins " contained lots and lots of melanin- ( the pigment that gives skin its colour ) . <p> Together , these features allow the uakari monkeys to show off how much blood they have just underneath their faces at any point in time .

Growing to a length of almost ten meters , and weighing over six tonnes , the killer whale is fully capable of picking off any tourists that happen to spill over the side in their diving dry-suits . But anyone adventurous enough to make their way to the remote regions of northern Norway to swim with killer whales can take comfort in the fact that these dolphins ( despite their name , killer whales are actually classified as dolphins ) have never attacked and killed a human swimmer in the wild .

@@20884309 @884309/ <p> There are tiny little wormlike parasites living inside the bodies of more than one billion people all over the world . The beasties are called ' helminths ' and they 're not just found inside human bodies , but inside the bodies of animals as well . The trouble with helminth infections is they do n't make a mess of things on their own ; they also suppress the immune system , which makes an animal or human less able to fight off other types of infections . So if you get rid of the helminths , the immune system rebounds and other diseases are vanquished . At least , that 's the idea . <p> But infections interact in complicated ways . And diseases do n't just affect individuals , they affect populations of individuals : groups , flocks , schools and herds .

Ezenwa and Anna E. Jolles- from the University of Georgia and Oregon State University , respectively , turned to wild African buffalo to find out how treating them for their helminth infections might affect the infection and transmission of bovine tuberculosis ( BTB ) . - <p> Every six months over the course of four years , the research duo captured 216 female buffalo in South Africa 's Kruger National Park . Of those , 108 were given treatment that attacks helminth parasites and helps to prevent future helminth infections , for a while at least . The remaining half were not provided with any treatment at all . At the beginning of the experiment , none of the buffalo had a BTB infection . <p> The researchers first verified that administering treatment ( known as- anthelmintic- treatment ) to the buffalo resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TH1 immunity . The TH1 response is known to be involved in the defence against tuberculosis , so Ezenwa and Jolles expected that the two groups would have different levels of BTB infection . But they were surprised to find that the two groups instead had roughly equivalent levels of infection ! <p> Over the course of the study , 69 buffalo wound up with a BTB infection : 36 from the control group and 33 from the treated group . <p> The researchers found that since the treated buffalo lived longer , they had more opportunities to pass the disease on to others within their herd . <p> Here 's where the story takes a sharp turn to the left . While the treatment did n't seem to help the buffalo avoid BTB , it did help them survive it once they were infected .

" <p> To put it into context , the average BTB-positive , untreated buffalo would have transmitted the infection to two others . But each BTB-positive , treated buffalo went on to infect some fifteen others , on average .

" <p> Humans have always had a bit of a rocky relationship with these apex predators . Historically , wolves have been the most widely distributed mammals in the world , and they 've made a habit of picking off the occasional lamb or calf at the expense of their " friendship " with the agricultural community .

The antlers have grown fantastically till they reach right back to the tail , and sometimes hold the disc of the sun or a human figure with the sun as its head . The flung-out hooves seem to represent more than just a leap : it is as if the artist has caught the reindeer in the act of flying through the sky in an association with a deity of the sun . <p> 10 .

The argument for an all-female pulling team is based on the fact that older male reindeer usually shed their antlers in early December " which would leave them antlerless at Christmas ( and Santa 's reindeer are always depicted with head gear on show ) . In contrast , female reindeer shed their antlers well into the spring , which makes them far better contenders for Santa 's sleigh . But there are other options to consider . The shedding cycle is affected in males that are neutered and younger male reindeer can delay their antler-shedding until April ... so there 's hope for Rudolph after all .

@@20884358 @884358/ <h> A study of island birds reveals that biodiversity is everywhere , if you know where to look <p> The beak shapes and lengths of Gal+pagos finches led Darwin to his theory of natural selection . Image : oliver.dodd <p> Charles Darwin was famously inspired by the differing beak shapes and lengths of Gal+pagos- finches " so inspired he eventually thought up the idea of evolution by natural selection . Now , researchers working on Santa Cruz Island , a small rocky island jutting out from the Pacific Ocean a few miles from the California coast , have once again turned to bird beaks to she 'd new light on evolution . <p> It was once thought that physical barriers like mountains or oceans were required to keep a population of animals separate enough to eventually evolve different physical traits , at least for highly mobile creatures like birds . Each of the islands of the Gal+pagos- has their own variety of finch , for example , and they 're kept separate by the ocean . But more recently , scientists have come to understand that divergence can occur even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , nuanced variations in habitat preferences . <p> On the California mainland and throughout the American West , western scrub-jays ( Aphelocoma californica ) have different types of beaks as well , depending on where they live . Those that live in forests dominated by pine and juniper trees tend to have longer , shallower beaks , which are useful for breaking into pine cones . Those that live in forests dominated by oak trees tend to have shorter , stubbier beaks , which allow them to better hammer apart acorns . <p> As for the Gal+pagos- finches , it 's not all that surprising to find variations in the design of bird beaks even within a single species , across very broad landscapes . What is perhaps more surprising would be to find that sort of variation within a single , small island . <p> The island scrub-jay ( Aphelocoma insularis ) is related to the western scrub-jay , but has been evolving in isolation for at least a million years . The only place on the world they are found anymore is on Santa Cruz Island . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island 's vegetation shifted to favor oaks . Today , there still exist three separate stands of bishop pine trees on the island . <p> Because the pine habitats are small and close enough to oak habitats , biologist Kathryn M. Langin from Colorado State University and The Nature Conservancy , together with her colleagues , realized that the pine habitats are within the potential dispersal distance of island scrub-jays that were born inside oak habitat . Even though birds in general can fly long distances , scrub-jays are non-migratory . They do n't typically move all that far away after they fledge , typically staying within a kilometre or two of their parents ' nests . On the mainland , that would typically keep them within the same habitat in which they were born ; on the island , that could conceivably allow them to be born in one habitat but set up their own territory in a different habitat . <p> After taking measurements from nearly six hundred island scrub-jays , to their surprise , the researchers discovered that those that lived in pine stands indeed had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the ones that flew among the oaks likewise had shorter , stubbier beaks , all the better for smashing open acorns . These are birds that can literally be found on neighbouring trees , and that do sometimes cross from habitat to habitat as they go about their daily lives . The results were accepted for publication in the journal Evolution . <p> Despite the clear lack of physical barriers preventing the birds from intermingling , the pine-loving scrub-jays mate with others in their neighbourhoods , while the oak lovers typically keep to themselves as well . Or , as Langin put it , " longer-billed females were more likely to mate with longer-billed males . " And it was n't because the birds were actively seeking out mates with similar beak types . The birds were simply pairing up with others that lived in the same neighbourhoods , and birds that lived in the same neighbourhoods were likely to have similar beak types . <p> Despite being found in neighbouring trees , island scrub-jays can display different beak types depending on diet . Aaron Maizlish <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing list of findings that suggest that groups of animals within a single species can develop different adaptations even in very , very small landscapes and even when there are no obvious physical barriers to prevent them from moving around . <p> The research has important practical implications as well . It highlights the fact that biodiversity may exist in places where we 're not necessarily looking for it . Owing to their small population size and concerns related to threats like wildfire and West Nile virus , island scrub-jays are classified by the IUCN as vulnerable to extinction . In addition , the birds wo n't be able to simply move their territories to adjust to changes in climate , as mainland birds can and have . Instead , they 'll have to adapt to new conditions within the island , unless aided by humans . <p> Indeed , discussions have been taking place among conservation groups about translocating some of the island scrub-jays to other islands within the Channel Island archipelago . Langin 's study underscores the need to avoid treating the species as a single homogeneous group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relocate , depending on the microhabitats available on the other islands . Or , more ideally , they might consider developing parallel conservation plans for the two types of island scrub-jay , to ensure that the birds are equipped with the most genetic diversity possible to allow them to adapt to future environmental changes . <h> Jason Goldman <p> Dr Jason G.

@@20884368 @884368/ <h> New study : Infusing rhino horns with poison does n't work <p> It was the sort of bold , innovative solution that seemed appropriate at a time when other approaches were doing little to stop brazen , well-armed poachers from decimating South Africa 's rhino populations . A small team of private game reserve owners and veterinarians buoyed hopes all across the conservation world when they began infusing the horns of live rhinos with toxins and dye in an effort to render them useless to poachers and potential consumers alike . The method was unproven and experimental , but there was a chance it could turn out to be the " magic bullet " that would finally turn the tide in the conservationists ' favour . That was until earlier this month , when , perhaps in a lesson that there would be no magic bullets in this war , reports claimed the infusion method had been discredited by new research . <p> Since 2007 , poaching has claimed well over 2,000 rhinos in South Africa , their hacked-off horns destined- mostly- for consumption in Asia as ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first developed back in 2010 , emerged as the country was facing a full-blown poaching- crisis . For one of the method 's originators , Lorinda Hern , the infusion idea grew out of personal adversity , after her own Rhino &amp; Lion Nature Reserve near Johannesburg lost rhinos in a devastating poaching incident . Disillusioned with ' reactive ' solutions , such as microchips and trackers that helped only after a rhino had been attacked , Hern was on the lookout for something preemptive " something that would prevent her rhinos from being targeted in the first place . <p> " So the idea came about what if we could contaminate these horns in some way so that poachers would n't benefit from poaching the animals because they could n't sell the horn on , " Hern recounted during an infusion exercise earlier this year . That initial idea grew into the Rhino Rescue Project , which saw Hern teaming up with veterinary scientist Charles van Niekerk . The team began their ' contamination ' mission by drilling holes directly into horns and infusing them with a cocktail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of indelible dye used to stain banknotes during robberies . The hope was that the toxin-dye combination would work like a powerful two-pronged weapon " devaluing the horns in the eyes of poachers as well as scaring off potential consumers in Asia since the infused toxins would be harmful if ingested . <p> Several private game reserves in South Africa went on to adopt the infusion method , and , last year , two state-owned reserves in the country 's KwaZulu-Natal province- treated 40 of their rhinos- as part of a pilot project , becoming the first state parks in Africa to do so . Despite concerns that the method was expensive and time-consuming , it seemed that many conservationists were optimistic about its potential . Then , earlier this month , reports emerged that a forthcoming paper , authored by a group of prominent South African wildlife experts , had concluded that the infusion method did not work . <p> Titled " Are chemical horn infusions a poaching deterrent- or an unnecessary- deception ? " , the new paper- is based on the examination of a treated white-rhino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained expert opinion " . The paper 's conclusion ? Conservationists should not use the infusion technique when dealing with the rhino poaching threat . <p> The new study found that the dye injected as part of the infusion method does not permeate the horn as claimed . <p> It seems the main reason for its failure is that the formulation can not penetrate the high-density fibre of the rhino horn . " We found that the colouring of horn did not happen as a result of the horn infusion technique . The indelible dye was only found in the drilling holes " nothing in any other part of the horn , " said study co-author Sam Ferreira , a large-mammal ecologist at South Africa 's Kruger National Park . <p> Ferreira added that the method 's effectiveness has been questioned by experts for some time , but there has been tacit agreement among scientists not to voice concern so that parks and reserves could " benefit from the bluff " .

@@20884386 @884386/ <h> Thinking of volunteering at a wildlife sanctuary ? Ask these questions first . <p> If you 're an animal lover , volunteering- your time at a wildlife sanctuary offers the chance to surround yourself with creatures you love while doing some good at the same time . And for those looking for a volunteering destination , the African continent with its iconic wildlife is an obvious pick. - But before you book that flight , there are a few things to consider . Not all wildlife sanctuaries were created equal , and there are important questions you should ask to ensure you 'll be devoting your time to a sanctuary or project with solid credentials , and one that has animal welfare and conservation at its heart . Here 's what you should to consider , courtesy of- Conservation Travel Africa : - <p> 1 . What kind of animals are at the facility ? <p> If the sanctuary has threatened animals ( particularly baby or adult lions and elephants ) , where did they come from ? How did they end up at the sanctuary ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conservation area that is more like their natural environment ? <p> Cuddling lion cubs might sound like a pretty great way to spend your time , but legitimate sanctuaries should actually limit human-wildlife contact . <p> 2 . Can you touch the animals ? <p> Animal interactions are a draw-card for volunteers who want to come to Africa and touch or cuddle cubs , baby monkeys and other adorable animals . The controversy over sanctuaries often comes down to how much the animals are used to draw in paying visitors ( including volunteers ) . Reputable organisations will have a minimal or no-contact approach to their wildlife unless the animal is never going to be released ( and then you should find out the reasons why that animal will live the remainder of its life at the sanctuary ) . The main aim of sanctuaries is to rescue , rehabilitate and release as many animals as possible , so those that maintain a hands-off approach are usually the ones keeping these principles in mind . For example , a lion cub that has been kept in an enclosure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released back into the wild . <p> 3 . Is there evidence of breeding ? <p> Breeding wild animals in captivity can add to the problem of unwanted animals , which sanctuaries were created to solve . The problem with facilities that allow visitors to interact with cubs and other larger animals is that they need to breed or buy a constant supply to keep visitors coming . And what happens to these cute cubs as they grow up and become too large and unpredictable to interact with tourists ? Often , older animals are sold to private hunting conservancies where their habituation to humans makes shooting them much easier . The argument often used in support of captive breeding is that if endangered animals are not bred in captivity , there will be none left . This is flawed and a stance dismissed by most conservationists . What 's more , privately bred cats ( and other animals ) are generally too inbred to be useful in maintaining genetically diverse populations , and to bring new animals to breed with those in captivity is usually prohibitively expensive . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what purpose . <p> 4 . What credentials does it have ? <p> Reputable sanctuaries work hard to differentiate themselves from less ethical facilities and most are supported or affiliated with a conservation organisation . Do some digging into the background of your sanctuary project and see who it supports and who its associated with . Look for any positive or negative reviews or scientific case studies that have been written about the volunteer programme or facility . <p> African animals suffer at the hands of humans , and one of the most essential areas where sanctuaries can have an influence is within the local community . Sanctuaries that take steps to educate communities on animal welfare , as well as the bush meat and exotic pet trades , are usually those that have long-term wildlife conservation at heart . It is only through community education and awareness-raising that attitudes towards the treatment and protection of animals can be changed . <p> 6 . What impact do volunteers have on the welfare of the animals ? <p> For an animal lover , heading to Africa and working in an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the right support , volunteers can make a positive difference . But there are too many programmes where volunteers support money-making enterprises that have nothing to do with conservation . These projects take animals illegally from the wild and separate babies from their mothers to stock their facility with cute animals for volunteers and tourists to interact with . Well-managed sanctuaries will limit contact with animals , and volunteers will work more on data collection , habitat enrichment and enclosure maintenance , all of which have a positive impact on the lives of the animals at the sanctuary . <p> 7 . Is your sanctuary actually a zoo ? <p> Sanctuaries , by definition , take in and care for animals that have been abandoned , abused , injured or neglected . The murkiness comes when considering if , when and how these animals can be released or re-homed . Sanctuaries do not , in general , exhibit their animals to the general public or for the benefit of tourists , unless there is a strong educational purpose that will have a long-term benefit for the animals. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exhibit animals to the public . They collect animals to conduct scientific research , to undertake managed breeding and to show these animals to visitors .

@@20884398 @884398/ <h> Top 8 : Things we learned from the ' Big Bang ' of all bird studies <p> Scientists have finally unequivocally solved that age-old mystery : chickens came first . Well , something like that anyway . Last week , a team of researchers who call themselves the ' Avian Phylogenomics Consortium ' - unleashed a treasure trove of new information on birds . Not only have they been able to reconstruct the bird family tree , helping us to understand which birds are more closely related to which other birds , but they 've also revealed new conclusions about everything from how bird song evolved to why birds do n't have teeth . <p> The more than two hundred researchers from eighty different institutions in twenty countries were led by Erich Jarvis of Duke University , GuojieZhang of the National Genebank at BGI in China and M. Thomas P. Gilbert of the Natural History Museum of Denmark . <p> The study is n't only unprecedented in terms of manpower , but also in terms of scope . Previous efforts to suss out the relationships between birds relied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the current effort involved sequencing , assembling and comparing the entire genomes of forty-eight different bird species . Getting the raw materials to extract the DNA was a breeze " the most difficult involved a trip to a United Arab Emirates zoo to collect blood samples from a bustard and a sandgrouse . <p> The study also meant that computer scientists had to devise new methods for processing all that data , which took three supercomputers three hundred years of CPU time . Some of the supercomputers required a terabyte of memory to get the job done . This is truly the era of Big Data . ( In case you want to know , here are the 48 bird species that were included . ) <p> There 's so much new science that came out of this work ( last week alone the consortium published twenty-nine individual papers , with more to come ) - that it might be overwhelming . So here , in no particular order , are eight of the most interesting things we learned about birds this week that we did n't know last week. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the birds most closely related to the ' dinosaur avian ancestor ' . Image : Nicholas Noyes , Flickr <p> All birds are dinosaurs , but you knew that already . What you perhaps did not know was that some modern birds have evolved faster than others , making them " from a genomic perspective , at least " more different from their dinosaur ancestors than others . But the birds most closely related to the ' dinosaur avian ancestor ' ? Chickens . As the researchers put it , " the chicken lineage appeared to have undergone the fewest changes compared to the dinosaur ancestor " . <p> The root of toothlessness- <p> Birds have a single common ancestor to thank for their toothlessness . Image : Jan Vrsinsky , Flickr <p> Birds have beaks , not teeth . You already knew that too . They use their beaks to snatch food and gizzards to crush it up for digestion . This week we learned that birds ' toothlessness is thanks to a single common ancestor that lived about 116 million years ago . As a result , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to making enamel . <p> Avian SOS <p> The crested ibis , once widespread in Northeast Asia , dwindled to just seven wild individuals from two breeding pairs in 1981 before humans intervened . Image : Danielinblue , Wikimedia Commons <p> Nearly one in four bird species are at risk of extinction and seventy-three are currently the focus of conservation efforts . The crested ibis , once widespread in Northeast Asia , dwindled to just seven wild individuals from two breeding pairs in 1981 before humans intervened to help them . By looking at the genomes of this and other birds whose survival is threatened , researchers were able to identify " genomic signatures for near-extinction events " and how those genomic changes might make at-risk species even more susceptible to climate change , over-hunting and other human-related threats . That information also promises to allow conservation biologists to better create breeding recommendations to identify the best possible pairings among the world 's rarest birds . <p> Singing genes- <p> Songbirds are among the few other animals who possess something similar to human language . Image : Mathesont , Flickr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as songbirds , one of the few other animals who possess something similar to human language . Researchers identified ten genes unique to the songbirds and two of them are most active in the parts of their brains known to be involved in vocal learning ( the ability to- acquire new sounds through imitation ) . <p> Another paper described a study in which the researchers compared the genes active in the vocal regions of songbird brains and in language regions in human brains . We already knew that the brains of songbirds and humans share some similar neural circuitry , but now we know that they also share some underlying genetics " - meaning that the genes behind birdsong and human speech have much in common . <p> It is perhaps not surprising that so much effort was devoted to birdsong , since that 's lead researcher Erich Jarvis 's specialty . When the researchers redrew the family tree of birds , the three clusters of song-singing birds " the parrots , hummingbirds and songbirds- " had a common ancestor that probably did not sing .

Or , as researcher M. Thomas P. Gilbert told Nature News , it was very likely a " mean-ass carnivore " . <p> March of the penguins- <p> The study also shed light on the genes that allow penguins to live their lives in such an extreme environment .

@@20884406 @884406/ <h> Saving a species , one snake at a time <p> Copperhead snakes are the most commonly encountered type of snake in the southern parts of the US state of Alabama ... but it was n't always that way . The eastern indigo snake Drymarchon couperi , the longest native North American snake , once slithered along the forest floors there and helped control the rest of the snake community with its eating habits " dining not just on copperheads , but also on the venomous cottonmouths , rattlesnakes and others . The beautiful creatures , jet black with a hint of blue , are fairly docile and completely harmless to humans . <p> But the last time an indigo was seen in Alabama was in 1954 . They 've simply disappeared . <p> Though the indigo snake hangs on to existence in southern Georgia and some parts of Florida , it has vanished from southern Alabama and Mississippi . In 1978 , the species was classified as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act . At first , conservationists thought they could re-establish the species in Alabama simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into southern Alabama 's Conecuh National Forest . But as is so often the case in wildlife conservation , things are n't quite that simple . <p> That 's in part because the indigo snake is inextricably linked to the ecosystem in which it evolved . Longleaf pine forests once covered nearly 150 million acres and swept through nine US states , from eastern Texas to southern Virginia . This was at one time among the most biologically diverse terrestrial ecosystems outside of the tropics . " Longleaf pine ecosystems may be North America 's least appreciated repositories of biodiversity , " wrote Bruce Means , an ecologist who has been working in the Florida panhandle for more than forty years . <p> But the last century and a half of human development has seen the longleaf pine ecosystem become increasingly degraded and fragmented , with much of the forests ' historic range converted for agriculture and urban development . As the forests disappeared , so did their inhabitants , including one cold-blooded reptile of great importance to the indigo snake. - <p> Gopher tortoises excavate deep burrows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and indigo snakes evolved to take advantage of those burrows , cosying up to the tortoises as temporary roommates during the most frigid parts of the year . But as the forest was altered , gopher tortoises began to decline , which in turn led to a decline in indigo snakes . <p> Both gopher tortoises and indigo snakes were also collateral damage in the targeted killings of eastern diamondback rattlesnakes . The rattlers also rely on gopher tortoise burrows for shelter , which led people to gas the burrows in an effort to smoke them out . The rattlesnakes reliably flee the burrows upon gassing , but the indigo snakes and tortoises do not . They remain inside the burrow , where they suffocate . <p> Reintroducing the- indigo snake- into a severely degraded ecosystem is a fool 's errand , but lots of work in recent years has gone into conserving parts of the longleaf forest that are still intact and to reclaiming areas that have become overrun with other tree species .

Eighteen others were ' soft released ' , a process pioneered with birds and mammals that affords the snakes some measure of protection while they adjust to the new environment . This was the first known attempt at soft-releasing a reptile species . <p> To soft-release the snakes , researchers constructed large pens within the forest , each containing at least one gopher tortoise burrow .

Seeing my first shark , a white tip reef shark , lying motionless on a sandy shelf -- it burst my ( media-fuelled ) preconceptions .

Closer still I could see the small needle-like teeth lining its maw and its almost catlike eyes moving , watching me . Were these the razor-sharp knives ' that would tear me to pieces if I inched closer ?

I snorkeled with whale sharks and guitar sharks just outside of the surf breaks on South Africa 's border with Mozambique . And in all of this time , I also became more and more aware of the ever-increasing signs of the shark fisheries , predominantl , for the fins that are the main ingredient in shark-fin soup . But in time , I also also noticed a soaring demand for gill-rakers , the bony processes used by manta and mobula rays to sieve food from the water ( used as a sought-after ingredient in health tonics ) . <p> Having spent the last few years on the island of Bali in Indonesia , I was driven to investigate the shark fisheries here . The region has some of the richest and most vibrant coral reefs on the planet , from the mucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tropical fish in the northern confines of Raja Ampat in Indonesian Papua . This nation of 17,000 islands should serve as a beacon of hope for the world 's dwindling shark population " and there should be numerous locations for tourists to recreationally dive with a diversity shark species . But sadly , this is not the case . Instead , Indonesia ranks as the world 's leader in shark-fin exports to the consumer hubs of Singapore and Hong Kong . <p> To clarify , shark finning refers to a specific fishing method that involves the deliberate removal of a shark 's fins- whilst the fishing vessel is at sea. - The shark , often still alive , is then dumped back into the ocean to die . I wanted to see for myself if local fishermen were engaged in finning specifically to supply this cruel and wasteful trade or whether the fins were taken from a full carcass that is then fully utilized to feed the local population . <p> To get a better sense of the local fishery I decided to head east from Bali and grabbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was headed to an infamous village on the eastern shores of the island and the site of its largest fish market : Tanjung Luar . <p> Entering the market , the first thing that hits you is the stench .

I passed through a throng of sellers and buyers from the surrounding villages , as they haggled over prices for the astounding diversity of displayed produce . Morey eels , stingrays , eagle rays , trevally jacks , marlin , tuna and a vast supply of octopus and squid , all laid out in the rising temperatures of an Indonesian dawn . <p> A scrawny man , middle-aged and toothless , gesticulated with a bony finger to another larger building : Ikan Hiu besar .

Bamboo poles were then fed through the hoops and the animals were lifted unceremoniously to the processing shed . <p> With the help of hooks and bamboo poles , a bull sharked is hoisted towards the processing shed . <p> For four days I watched , photographed and filmed the time-honed efficiency with which the animals were processed . Hardest to watch where the species I was seeing first time in my life : wobbegong sharks , zebra sharks , bonnethead and guitar sharks all dumpe into piles on the muddied floor , waiting to be processed with a jaw-dropping efficiency . <p> I timed a tiger shark being unloaded from a boat .

Sectioned completely in two , the shark 's meat was then separated from the skin ( which was left in the sun to dry , to be used later as low-quality sandpaper ) . Time to fillet : around six minutes . The meat was then weighed and placed into plastic tubs , which were labeled , loaded onto trucks and shipped out to restaurants in the immediate vicinity . From majesty to mincemeat in some ten minutes . <p> Once sliced from the carcass , the fins are thrown into a collective pile on the market floor . <p> It was a heartbreaking sight . But here 's the catch : this was not shark finning ' . These fishermen were not solely after fins . Instead , the fins were an additional , bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its jaw and eyes , to be used in its entirety . And yet , unless you witness the process yourself , it 's easy to get the wrong idea . Occasional iPhone shots I shared online during my time on the project were invariably met with howls of protest and angry remarks directed at the fishermen . But to catch a shark in Indonesia is not illegal . Neither is the processing on dry land of that same shark , which may include the removal of its fins for export to countries where they are used in the preparation of sharkfin soup . None of this is illegal . What is more , these sustenance fisherman live by this fishery and feed their families by it . To label them shark finners is misguided . <p> That reality could not be clearer to me as I walked along trash-strewn beaches to the north of the fish market , to the shantytowns where the fishermen live .

If they strike out , they 'll need to rely on handouts from friends and other family members . Local governments provide no social welfare here . <p> Saving sharks from the fate that awaits them at Tanjung Luar means giving the fishermen here a viable financial alternative . <p> So what is the solution for those who want to end the shark killings here ?

@@20884421 @884421/ <h> Sloth organs hang on ' coat hangers ' for easy upside-down breathing <p> Sloths are known to spend a significant amount of their time hanging vertically upside down , yet no one has ever discovered how they manage this ( if we were to stand on our heads for several hours a day , we would probably end up with a lot of problems ! ) . In my latest publication , we solve part of the mystery ! <p> Three-fingered sloths have multiple unique fibrinous adhesions that effectively anchor their abdominal organs against the lower ribs . These evolutionary coat hangers ' support the weight of the sloths ' stomachs and bowels whilst the animal is hanging inverted , preventing the lungs from being squashed and facilitating breathing . Offering further support to this hypothesis , we discovered that the kidneys are bound by connective tissue against the pelvic girdle- with absolutely no mobility . This unusual configuration means that they too are exempt from contributing to the abdominal weight . <p> We used Daily Diary ' data loggers on both wild and captive sloths to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the presence of the adhesions could reduce a sloth 's energy expenditure by 7-13% when hanging upside down ! <p> Of course , these adhesions do n't solve all of a sloths ' upside-down problems . Indeed , we are discovering that both two- and three-fingered sloths have a whole array of fascinating anatomical features that allow them to hang inverted for up to 90% of the day . These include circulatory adaptations that prevent the blood rushing to the head and a highly specialised oesophagus that allows them to swallow whilst upside down " we are still working on these publications ! <p> How did you first discover the- adhesions ? <p> Discovering the internal adhesions was actually quite a slow process . The Sloth Sanctuary has been rescuing sloths for over 20 years and during that time , they have had to perform many necropsies on sloths that did n't survive . At first , because sloth anatomy was still poorly understood , the adhesions were assumed to be scar tissue from previous injuries . It was only when we began to document the exact location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sloth anatomy . It was then a case of working backwards and figuring out what the adaptive benefit could be . Interestingly , two-fingered sloths ( Choloepus ) actually have more of these internal adhesions than the three-fingered sloths " probably because they spend a higher proportion of time hanging upside down . <p> Why do you think the complications of hanging upside down have never been considered previously ? <p> I am sure that someone somewhere has briefly pondered this issue in the past , but it has never been followed up or solved . I think this is partly due to the difficulties of studying sloths in the wild and the lack of reliable scientific data documenting their natural behaviours . The typical sloth hanging position ( horizontal ) and sleeping position ( sitting vertically ) do n't result in any gravity-based problems . It takes a good amount of time spent observing them in the wild to see that they do hang vertically upside down , and more importantly , they need to . Sloths need to eat the young , tender leaves that grow on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digest and often have a lower toxin content . In order to reach these new leaves , sloths frequently have to hang inverted . <p> Why are these adhesions so important for sloths ? <p> For many mammals , an energy saving of 7-13% would n't be particularly game changing . In fact , there are several groups of mammals ( howler monkeys , for example ) that do regularly hang inverted , yet do n't have any internal adhesions to support the organs . The difference with sloths however is a very tight energy budget . Because of their extremely slow metabolic rate and unusually low body temperature , it can take a sloth up to 30 days to digest a single leaf . Having a constantly full stomach means that they really ca n't ingest very much on a daily basis and so their caloric intake is very low . Sloths have virtually no flexibility in their energy budget : they generate just about enough energy from their diet to move when and where required , but there is not much left in the tank afterwards . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite a big deal ! <p> In addition , sloths can store up to a third of their body weight in urine and faeces before defecating " this means that the stomach and bowel contents make up an unusually large proportion of their body mass . With their limited energy supply , it would be energetically very expensive , if not completely impossible , for a sloth to lift this extra weight with each breath were it not for the adhesions . <h> Becky Cliffe <p> Becky Cliffe is a British zoologist working at the Sloth Sanctuary of Costa Rica .

Bon apetit ! <p> Despite the fact that they came from the hippo-free reference pool , the fish dined on the dung with gusto . You can tell what kind of plants an animal has eaten by looking at certain chemical markers inside of its dung " and if the markers- from the kinds of grass eaten by hippos show up inside of a fish , then it 's reasonable to assume they got there because that fish ate hippo crap . <p> So after three to six months of captivity , the researchers analysed their fish for those chemical markers and compared them to other fish that were tested immediately upon capture .

@@20884434 @884434/ <h> For great pond snails , sex is a game of sabotage and manipulation <p> In the world of great pond snails , receiving semen can put you in a sticky situation , as Joris Koene and his research team at VU University Amsterdam discovered . <p> These snails are hermaphroditic , meaning that under each nondescript brown shell , every great pond snail ( Lymnaea stagnalis ) carries a complete set of both male and female sex organs " like two toolboxes for different gadgets . The option to swap sexes comes in handy , but it also means that each snail must divide its resources between the two toolboxes " the more energy a snail invests in male functions ( such as producing and transferring sperm ) the less it can allocate to producing eggs as a female . <p> When two snails meet in a pond , one snail " the better-endowed one " will become the male. - But it 's not the size of the shell or even the penis that determines who gets the male role " it 's the size of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semen . When a great pond snail has not mated as a male for some time and has not ejaculated , seminal fluid builds up in its prostate gland , and the gland expands .

Levesque <p> The snail playing the male role will crawl onto its mate and ejaculate into it , allowing the partner to use the sperm within to fertilise its eggs . And so the romance ends , apparently without fuss but a bit of sexual sabotage has already snuck in with the semen . <p> When a male great pond snail ejaculates into its partner , the semen delivers more than just sperm . The semen is a cocktail of seminal fluid proteins , two of which are covert agents that disrupt the recipient 's future sperm transfer and paternity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been inseminated as a female goes on to mate as a male in the future , it will ejaculate with only half of the sperm count ( and thus father one-fifth fewer eggs ) than it would have had it not received sperm from previous mating partners . <p> And the snail story gets even more confusing . <p> Koene and his team also discovered that another seminal fluid protein , ovipostatin ( which is unique to great pond snails ) , reduces the number of eggs laid by the inseminated snail . Limiting the number of eggs its partner produces seems to act completely against the benefit of the sperm donor and this left Koene and his team puzzled . <p> A great pond snail lays its eggs . Koene and his team discovered that the seminal fluid protein ovipostatin reduces the number of eggs laid by the inseminated snail . Image : J.M. Koene &amp; A.W . Pieneman <p> Initially , Koene hypothesized that ovipostatin helped the sperm donor in unidentified ways , and that the limited egg-laying was a mere side effect of the protein. - But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although snails that are inseminated more often ( likely receiving more seminal fluid proteins ) lay fewer eggs , they also invest more resources in each egg . This suggests that ovipostatin directs the partner to sacrifice egg numbers in exchange for producing better-nourished eggs . <p> Mating as a male and exploiting partners with seminal fluid proteins might sound like the better role by far , but there are serious perks to mating as a female as well . These snails mate and change partners frequently , receiving generous amounts of ejaculate " which they can ingest and stockpile for later use . And when no partners are available to provide sperm ? The snails then simply fertilise their eggs with their own sperm , through a process known as ' selfing ' . <p> Who knew there were so many crafty tricks hidden under the guise of those ordinary-looking brown shells ? 50610 @qwx250610 <h> Yao-Hua Law <p> Yao-Hua Law writes about animal behaviour , ecology and agriculture .

@@20884438 @884438/ <h> Agbogbloshie : On the trail of Ghana 's illegal e-waste ( Part 2 ) <p> The dumping of electronic waste in Ghana has been getting a lot of media attention , and it 's clear that urgent action is desperately needed to stop the immense damage it 's causing to the environment and to human health . But despite the glare of the global spotlight , the dumping continues . Why ? Who is involved , who is responsible , and why does it seem like nothing is being done , locally or internationally , to stop it ? <p> For nearly 15 years , industrialised countries have been offloading their unwanted electronic waste at Agbogbloshie . It is now one of the world 's largest e-waste sites . Image : Tash Morgan <p> Environmental experts monitoring Ghana 's largest and most toxic e-waste site at Agbogbloshie , in Accra , are convinced that elements of organised crime are involved . The dumping is consistent , it follows a certain pattern , and it 's clear that there are people behind the movement of this e-waste who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed countries , and evade authorities , in order to dump it in Ghana . In other words , it is deliberate and it is criminal . <p> Direct evidence points to shipments from the UK , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden , Germany , Belgium , USA , Canada and Australia . Except for the USA , all of these countries are signatories to the 1989 Basel Convention , which aims to stop hazardous waste ( of which e-waste is a part ) from crossing borders . Considering their commitment to this agreement , and with compliance being monitoring by intergovernmental organisations , why is it that e-waste shipments continue to be exported ? <p> Part of the answer lies in the safety measures governing the disposal and processing of e-waste within developed countries : because the rules are very strict , recycling e-waste is very expensive . As a low-cost option , many illegal e-waste traders pose as legitimate recycling outfits offering affordable , quick-fix collection services for businesses and households . But rather than recycle or dispose of the items within the country , the fraudsters pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reusable household items ' , ' secondhand functioning equipment ' or ' donated electronic items ' ... and then ship it off to e-waste dumps in the developing world . <p> From broken microwaves to antiquated TV sets , Agbogbloshie is where many of our discarded electronic items go to die . Image : Tash Morgan <p> For many of those who 've paid for the service , it 's simply a matter of ' out of sight , out of mind ' : once your old computer , broken microwave or unfashionable TV has been picked up , why should you care what happens to it , right ? But if you do care , and if you have witnessed the horrifying consequences of e-waste dumping as I have , the question becomes : how does this e-waste get into Ghana ? <p> The responsibility for monitoring shipments that enter the ports lies with Ghana 's Department of Trade and Industry " it should presumably be scrutinising any cargo that comes ashore and instituting far stricter controls to prevent e-waste from entering the country . The department was contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to respond ... but it 's yet to release a statement on the matter . <p> One thing is clear when observing containers of e-waste being transported from Ghana 's Tema Port to Agbogbloshie : syndicates have local contacts that receive and dump the shipments . Are the contacts using bribery to encourage port officials to turn a blind eye ? It 's probable . Of course , the truck drivers and assistants , and many other- workers along this murky supply chain , are probably simply doing their jobs " unaware of the bigger picture . The syndicates ' kingpins , however , are clearly willing to go to any lengths to hide their toxic cargo . <p> Currently , up to 80 tons of e-waste per month , from places like the USA , UK , EU and Australia , is smuggled into Ghana and dumped at Agbogbloshie .

This tainted produce is making its way to smaller fruit and vegetable stands all across Accra . <p> So what is the solution ? - Ghana 's Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) claims it 's made all possible efforts to discourage the dumping and burning of e-waste here . Significantly , it also says it 's fighting a losing battle against a loophole in the Basel Convention . <p> The loophole makes- allowances for the exportation of e-waste on provision of what 's called an offer and acceptance agreement . It goes something like this : if a company in the UK makes a formal offer to donate ' usable secondhand ' computers to an NGO in Ghana and that NGO accepts the offer ( and all supporting export/import documentation backs up the agreement ) then port authorities and the EPA can not intervene . With no complaints from the supposed NGO regarding the state of the items imported , the importation continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cases , this may actually be a legitimate transaction ... which makes it all that much harder to clamp down on the illegal cases without depriving genuine schools and NGOs of- much-needed electronic equipment . To stem the flow of e-waste , the loophole needs to be recognised by the signatories to the Convention as well as the Ghanaian government , and remedied through tighter legislation and prosecution . <p> And what about those of us who sit at the source of the e-waste trail ? We all need to start demanding accountability from our governments and major IT and electronics producers . More importantly , we need to consider the life cycle of our electronic gadgets , and remember that what we throw away today is still around tomorrow . It might not be in your dustbin , but it will be polluting the environment somewhere else in the world. - <h> Tash Morgan <p> Having spent every possible moment outdoors as a child , playing with snakes , spiders , and scorpions , camping under the stars in deserts and mountains , and bathing in rivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from South Africa , she now lives in Ghana , working in corporate communication , and writing in her spare time .

To tackle the problem , South African researchers have been looking at more high-tech solutions . The country 's KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board is working on developing an electrical shark repellent to keep the potentially dangerous predators away from the coastline . Locally , as many as 570 sharks a year currently wind up in nets and not very many of them are released alive . The eco-friendly barriers aim to use electrical pulses to deter sharks without causing them any harm . <p> Massachusetts bans fins <p> Massachusetts was the filming location for much of the ' monster ' hit- Jaws a movie that 's given great whites a pretty bad rep ( much to the regret of the author of the book on which the movie was based ) .

Sure you can try to predict and track an animal 's movements , but an element of luck always plays a role when chasing that ultimate animal encounter . Field guide Mike Sutherland knows this only too well and he would have been holding thumbs for a thrilling sighting or two when he took his guests out on safari in South Africa 's Londolozi Game Reserve recently . <p> Sutherland was hoping to catch up with a resident leopard known as the Marthly Male , who 'd been spotted earlier that day . At the suggestion of his tracker , they headed to a thicket beside a dam where the leopard was last seen . Unsure if the cat would still be there , they parked the safari vehicle beside the watering hole and scanned the surrounding bushes . Nothing . A family of warthogs meandered to the water 's edge unconcerned about any lurking dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . <p> And then this happened - <p> This is the moment when one of the warthogs realises there 's a leopard a mere ten metres away and alerts the rest of the family . <p> The warthog family regroups and starts to panic . At this moment the family has two choices : fight or flight . Considering there are young piglets in the group , sticking around to fight is a risky plan . <p> The Marthly Male had been lying in the same thicket all day , keeping his senses peeled for an opportunity just like this to present itself . The leopard sticks his head out to get a better view at the warthogs and waits for the perfect moment to launch an attack . <p> He decides it 's now or never and heads off in pursuit of the warthogs . <p> The male leopard runs straight towards Mike Sutherland and his guests , passing the safari vehicle at high speed . At this moment , he 's just a couple of metres behind the warthogs . <p> The cat has locked onto his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all four legs are off the ground ( he 's practically flying ! ) . There are warthogs , dust and a sense of panic everywhere . <p> The adult warthogs suddenly make a brave and bold move . Flight is not working for them , so instead of continuing to run , they turn around and charge straight towards the leopard . This breaks the leopard 's focus on the small piglet and sends him running down the bank for cover . <p> The unsuccessful chase in the hot sun has cost him lots of energy , so the leopard ambles off towards a puddle of water to quench his thirst before returning to the thicket to rest ( and wait for his next opportunity )
