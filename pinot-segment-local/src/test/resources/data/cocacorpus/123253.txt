These objectives guide the enterprises to choose an optimal data backup ( rather restore ) plan . <p> RPO : Recovery Point Objective <p> Recovery Point Objective ( RPO ) describes the interval of time that might pass during a disruption before the quantity of data lost during that period exceeds the Business Continuity Plans maximum allowable threshold or " tolerance . " <p> Example : If the last available good copy of data upon an outage is from 18 hours ago , and the RPO for this business is 20 hours then we are still within the parameters of the Business Continuity Plans RPO .

There is a growing awareness of the need to manage not only security but also data privacy to deal with changing infrastructure , regulations , and tremendous data growth , while still delivering cost effective operations . This study examines the state of data privacy protection among IT leaders , how it 's the same or different than approaches to security , and the readiness of IT in the face of cloud adoption . <p> The following report , sponsored by Druva , is based on a survey of 214 IT professionals with responsibility for corporate data .

Almost all businesses , 99% , have sensitive data that they must manage . <p> Participants were asked what types of business data is the most sensitive for their organization , and were allowed to pick up to three answers . The most common types of data identified as most sensitive included regulated customer data including credit cards and health records ( 52% ) , password or other authentication credentials ( 46% ) , and personal employee information such as social security numbers ( 41% ) . <h> Businesses must protect data privacy to meet regulations <p> Certain types of businesses are known to have strict data privacy regulations ; for example HIPAA protects the privacy of patient data in healthcare environments , and PCI for retail and other companies that deal with credit card data . However , these regulations for data privacy are not the exception ; they are the norm . The majority of companies , 81% , do deal with some form of data privacy requirement to meet compliance and governance regulations . <h> Data privacy is increasing in importance in 2015 <p> Focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the privacy of sensitive data were changing for 2015 , the majority of participants ( 84% ) indicated that these efforts were increasing . A further 15% said that efforts would stay the same , with only a very small number ( 1% ) indicating that their efforts at protecting data privacy would actually decrease in the coming year . <h> Employees do not follow data privacy policies <p> Employee education and awareness is key to any data privacy initiative , but it is clear that depending on employees is not an effective approach . Only a small number of companies ( 18% ) report that all employees follow data privacy policies . The majority of companies ( 82% ) have employees that do n't follow established policies for data privacy . <p> Within the same company , certain departments are more likely to follow data privacy policies than others . Participants were asked which types of employees were most likely to ignore data privacy policies , and allowed to pick up to three departments . Sales was the worst offender ( 48% ) , ahead of marketing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , even employees in the legal department made the list ( 6% ) , although this is stereotypically the group that knows the regulations best and is most interested in following rules . <p> Employees also follow data privacy policies at different rates . Individual contributors and front-line professionals are the interested types of employee most likely to ignore data policies ( 39% ) , but this was followed very closely by executives ( 33% ) . <p> Several participants did take the time to report that they faced other challenges including multinational regulations , keeping up with changing regulations , and the impact of BYOD . <h> Companies try to cope , but data privacy controls are incomplete <p> The vast majority of companies , 91% , do have data privacy controls in place . <p> However , when you look into the details of those controls , you find that controls are not extensive . Many companies do educate employees by asking them to sign a data privacy agreement ( 61% ) , offering regular training ( 54% ) , or offering ad hoc education programs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , depending on all employees to follow these policies is not an effective approach to data privacy . Technology solutions can be more consistent , if implemented properly . Two-thirds of companies ( 63% ) do use some kind of technology approach . However , the technology in use today to ensure data privacy is incomplete at most companies . The most common technologies are basic access control ( 58% ) and logging data access ( 41% ) . But only 21% encrypt data on mobile devices and only 36% encrypt data on laptops . <h> International operations make data privacy even more challenging <p> For companies who have international operations , data privacy is even more complicated . The need to understand a wide variety of regional requirements can make data privacy challenges exponentially greater . Participants in our survey agreed , with 77% of participants who operate in more than one country reporting that they have difficulties . This includes 67% who say they have challenges , and 10% who have given up and do n't even try to keep up with data privacy differences in countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced by global companies range from difficulties tracking emerging rules ( 41% ) to ambiguity of requirements ( 29% ) . Technology vendors are blamed for some of the problems as they are perceived as not offering solutions or guidance to address regulations ( 29% ) . It is interesting to note that IT is confident that if they have the information they can deal with it . Only a few ( 17% ) described the problem as a lack of ability in the IT team to understand the requirements . <h> Most companies lump data privacy into security efforts <p> There can be overlap in data security and data privacy . This survey wanted to investigate the relationship . Specific definitions were provided to participants to set a common baseline for answering questions . Data privacy was defined as ensuring that sensitive data is n't misused , misappropriated , or publicly exposed by those who have authorized access ; and data security was defined as ensuring data is protected from unauthorized access or interception . <p> Most companies do combine their security and privacy initiatives to some degree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for more than half ( 51% ) data privacy is part of the security initiative , although there are a few distinct aspects . Only 20% of companies focus on data privacy to the point where it is a completely separate initiative from data security . <h> Most effort is spent protecting from external threats <p> This focus on data security over data privacy is seen in the effort put into both of these areas . When asked to indicate how efforts are divided between protecting against internal threats such as careless employees that impact data privacy , only 28% indicated this was the larger focus area . Most companies , 72% , indicated that they put most of their effort into protecting from external threats like hackers that impact data security . <p> We see the same focus on security when it comes to audits . While almost half do conduct regular privacy audits to ensure compliance with data privacy standards ( 47% ) , many more conduct regular security audits ( 68% ) . <h> Cloud data will increase in 2015 <p> The adoption of cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has raised many questions around data privacy . The companies who have cloud data were asked about their attitudes and experiences with data privacy in the cloud . <p> Unsurprisingly , the majority ( 88% ) expect their cloud data volumes to grow in 2015 with only 5% predicting a decrease in cloud data volumes . For most companies ( 95% ) the data in the cloud includes sensitive data . <h> IT concerned about the privacy of sensitive cloud data <p> IT is not confident about the privacy of their sensitive cloud data . The majority ( 87% ) are concerned about the privacy of cloud data , including 32% who describe themselves as " very concerned " . <p> Although the reputation of SaaS and public infrastructure cloud has improved dramatically in the past years , most IT professionals ( 65% ) still believe that their on-premises environments have better privacy controls than cloud . <h> Survey Methodology and Participant Demographics <p> In March 2015 , individuals with responsibility for corporate data were invited to participate in an online survey on the topic of data privacy .

How is it implemented ? <h> Introduction <p> This article discusses the backup retention policy and its different scenarios . <h> About Retention Policy <p> A Backup Retention Policy determines the retention time of data , archival rules , data formats and the permissible means of storage , access and encryption , while weighing legal and privacy concerns against economics and ' need to know ' concerns . <p> Administrator can store/save n number of daily , weekly or monthly restore points for each user . <p> Druva inSync uses the GFS ( GrandfatherFatherSon ) retention method for maintaining hierarchical restore points . GFS method describes a rotation scheme whereby a daily backup ( the son ) , a weekly backup ( the father ) and a monthly backup ( the grandfather ) are created to maintain a hierarchical backup strategy . <p> Each week , one full daily backup ( latest from that week ) is promoted from a son to a father and is deemed the weekly backup . Each month , a father ( latest from that month ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup .

The SLA typically does not cover data lost due to situations like accidental deletion , migration errors , data corruption or malicious insider attacks .

@@77780722 @6480722/ <h> Climbing Everest : The Number Crunch <h> Share <p> What does it actually cost to mount an expedition to climb Everest ? Sauraj Jhingan , who has been on leave from Druva to follow his dream , shares the gritty details . <p> One of my favorite moments is the reaction from people when they find out the cost of my expedition . The cost of climbing Mt . Everest for a single climber in my expedition is US$45,000 ( or in India Rupees INR27,000,000 ) . The gasps of astonishment I receive : Priceless . <h> The Cost Factor <p> The first major expense " before you can even set foot on the mountain " is the Everest climbing permit , priced at $11,000 , charged by the Ministry of Nepal . This climbing permit is collected by the Government of Nepal , acting as a rite of passage ( in the literal sense ) for anyone , experienced or amateur , brave enough to attempt to climb Everest . This is a nonnegotiable , nonrefundable , onetime payment completely independent of success or failure . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are fees every climber and expedition must pay , directly or indirectly : a climbing permit , liaison officer , visa , park fee , yaks , porters , icefall ladders and fixed ropes , waste deposit , travel , insurance , tents , food , and fuel . At a minimum , these total $22,000 for one person going alone . <p> To add to this heady mix of expenses ( if you were not feeling light-headed enough ) , you are embarking on an expedition into extremely rarified atmosphere , thus necessitating oxygen . Each climber must plan for at least eight oxygen cylinders for him and his Sherpa to ensure a realistic chance of hitting the summit as well as returning safely . At $700 a cylinder , that cost comes to $5,400 . <p> Extreme temperatures , incredibly low wind-chill factors , and the harsh terrain compels us to invest in specialized equipment . Everest-grade expedition climbing boots , down suits and other apparel , and thermal layers add up to another $5,000 . Finally , this does not include tips for the team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months while on the glacier , which can be a couple of thousand dollars in total . <h> The Chase <p> Most climbers on big mountain expeditions become extremely creative when it comes to raising capital for their climbs , and so were we . Among the options we considered but did not exercise were taking bank loans , refinancing our home loans , and trying to chase down the proverbial rich uncle . <p> Our major source of revenue has been through personal funding : that is , setting aside money every month and making it a priority in our monthly savings . It also goes without saying that my family ( my wife , dad and mom , my sister and brothers , not to forget my cousins ) have been incredibly supportive , both physically and financially taking on a huge chunk of the cost . <p> One incredible experience , which I am guilty of initially dismissing , is raising money through the medium of crowd funding. - Crowd funding is an appeal to the masses to help support a cause , requesting small amounts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Established websites such as Ketto.org , Milaap.com , and Kickstarter.com help add structure to the project and ( more importantly ) allow you to receive payments through a payment gateway . <p> However , I decided to go about it in a more personal way . I drafted an appeal and circulated it among my 500-odd friends on Facebook . I then requested them to circulate it among their friends , and so on . Immediately , the responses started trickling in ; and then it became a flood of not just contributions , but messages and goodwill , words of encouragement and support . Friends from school to whom I had n't spoken for 10-15 years reached out to me , and my biology teacher from the 9th grade contributed INR10,000 though she last saw me in a scruffy school uniform and unpolished shoes . One particular friend , an old college buddy , transferred an amazing US$1,600 to my account . <p> This entire experience of crowd funding has just been incredible . In a period of 45 days , we raised a fantastic sum of $US12,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priceless . <p> Often , the first resort is to try obtaining a sponsor , for example by one of the large outdoor gear companies . It is extremely difficult to get on a sponsored team . Other companies are often hesitant to endorse big mountain expeditions for numerous reasons , the high risk factor being the largest . There are ways to obtain a sponsor , but it takes years of work , a solid plan , and proven experience . Often it comes down to whom you know and a lot of luck . <p> In our case , we acquired a few sponsors , but had to deal with the heartache of them pulling out . That happened as recently as last week , just a month short of the expedition . Fortunately for me , Druva Software , my extended family , has been incredibly supportive and encouraging . The core management team , Jaspreet and Milind , have been incredibly consistent in their support , encouragement , and words of wisdom . They give me incredible confidence in my endeavor to reach new heights " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have learnt that an expedition to the Top of the World is not just about determination , physical grit , and mental toughness . It requires an uncanny amount of resourcefulness in terms of leveraging such large finances . In trying to raise finances for this expedition , I have , without a doubt , developed more business acumen in the last year than in all my years of pursuing my MBA or in my career in the corporate world . Though I am still short by about 20% of the amount needed , I am still adamant on setting out on this epic odyssey to reach the Top of the World , with the eternal hope that it will all come together in the end . <h> Sauraj Jhingan <p> Sauraj is Human Resources Manager at Druva .

@@77780736 @6480736/ <h> How much bandwidth do I need to back up user data ? <p> The bandwidth requirements depend on how large your inSync setup is . Generally , inSync clients require a minimum bandwidth of 16 Kbps and 64 Kbps to ensure backups over WAN and LAN respectively . If your bandwidth falls to a value lower than 16 Kbps or 64 Kbps , backups will fail . <p> As a good practice , you must ensure that the throughput be a value that is equivalent to the aggregate of write speeds for all backups . We recommend the latency to be a multiple of 10 , but not exceeding 100 ms . <h> How can I throttle bandwidth for restores ? <p> We do not support throttling of bandwidth for restores out-of-the-box .

@@77780759 @6480759/ <h> Overview <p> After the successful installation and authentication on clients , users are created on the inSync server without manual intervention of the Administrator . <p> The mass deployment process relies on the creation of an " ini " file on the target , which contains information needed to create and assign the account to the correct inSync Server , Storage and Profile and also the target users credentials . <p> An enterprise can create its own scripting methods to create and save this information or use the Automatic Deployment package provided by Druva to assist in this process . The Druva package can integrate with Active Directory ( AD ) or a CSV file to create the required ini files . <h> inSync Automatic Deployment Package <p> The inSync Automatic Deployment package provides some batch files and configuration files that you can use along with an Active Directory Group Policy Object ( GPO ) to silently install the inSync msi on clients and authenticate them on the server . The GPO is used to automatically distribute and deploy the inSync Client installable ( msi ) across domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At user logon , a batch process ( MASSDS.bat ) creates an ' . ini ' file per AD logon name and stores it on the client machine . Another batch process ( SI.bat ) silently installs the inSync client and authenticates the users using details present in the . ini file ( like username , users email i 'd ) , and a Mass Deployment Token . The ini file can also be created from user details present in a . csv file . <h> Auto deployment process <p> To automate the entire client deployment process : 1 . Download the Auto-Depv2.0.zip package and place the contents on a GPO share . 2 . Edit the batch and configuration files as per your environment . 3 . Generate a Mass Deployment Token . 4 . Execute two steps using GPO : <p> You can download the Auto-Deployment-2.0.zip package from here : Auto-Deployment-2.0.zip This package has some libraries and binaries which help in creating the inSync INI file and installing and authenticating the client . <h> Binaries location <p> The zipped files for automatic deployment need to be hosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all users for execution . The path for share needs to be updated in MASSDS.bat . <h> Customizing the package <p> This is a batch script which is responsible for invoking the inSync INI creator exe . Hence it is executed using User logon scripts via GPO . It uses the parameters in the server.conf file . It creates a set of . ini files , one per user . <p> SI.bat <p> This is a batch script which is executed as a machine startup script and it executes using parameters like TOKEN ( mass deployment token ) and INIFILE ( file holding users details ) . It installs the client and authenticates it with the inSync server , using the . ini file created by MASSDS.bat . <h> Group/Profile Mapping <p> The server.conf also has another section known as PROFILEMAPPINGS . This allows IT administrators to map their exiting AD group with an inSync server user profile . For example , we can use an AD group as administrators and map it to an inSync user profile as IT . <p> The parameters are shown here : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INI creator will use the logged user accounts member group to execute the mappings . If the user does not belong to mapped groups then the default profile will be used . <h> Editing MASSDS.bat <p> Once you have the file share and server.conf configured , you can edit the MASSDS.bat to reflect their paths . A sample MASSDS.bat file is shown below : <p> The result of running this batch file is the creation of ini files , a sample of which is in the next section . <h> inSyncConfig.ini File Composition <p> The INI file contains some information for the inSync MSI installer to read after installation . This information allows the user 's account to be configured on the inSync server and for it to be authenticated .

@@77780764 @6480764/ <h> Troubleshooting slow shutdown of Windows 7 client machines <h> Problem description <p> The slow shutdown of Windows 7 client machines had surfaced when security definitions were pushed by Microsoft on their AV applications " ForeFront , SCEP , Security Essentials , Intune " . Due to this there was an impact on some third-party applications , which also includes inSync . On the tickets that were opened with Microsoft by a few of inSync customers , Microsoft has already acknowledged the issue and confirmed this has nothing to do with inSync . However , they do not have any fix at this point . <h> Cause <p> The issue occurs because Microsoft Antivirus does not honor the set process-level exclusions . The issue is observed not only with inSync but with other applications as well . One such application is Malwarebytes , where Windows 7 systems having this application also observe slow shutdown . The patch in question is KB3197868 but in some cases you will not find it as it might be a security definition pushed on the Antivirus servers . <p> Due to this , traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shutdown is initiated , there is a delay of more than 5 minutes after which the machine shuts down . <h> Analysis <p> Stopping of inSync services or disabling monitoring at a global level , uninstalling inSync or Antivirus resolves the issue . However , this is not an ideal way to solve the problem . <p> The problem was identified with the configuration option of " Monitor file and programs activity on your computer " . The problem is seen when the option is set to " Monitor all files " or " Monitor only incoming files . " When it is disabled or set to " Monitor only outgoing files , " then the shutdown works fine . <h> Workaround <p> For such scenarios , Microsoft suggests to kill the application processes monitored by their antivirus before shutdown . <p> You can perform this workaround by pushing a script through the Group Policy using the steps specified below : <p> Create the following bat file and link it to the shutdown script under the required Group Policy .

Only one unique instance of the data is retained on the storage . Redundant data is replaced with a pointer or reference to the unique data copy . <h> De-duplication in inSync <p> inSync uses application-aware data de-duplication and advanced file-fingerprinting technology to save only a single copy of content ( **28;192;TOOLONG ) duplicated across users . inSync uses source based de-duplication which saves over 90% backup time , bandwidth and storage . <h> Example of App-aware De-duplication in inSync <p> A typical e-mail system might contain 100 instances of the same 1 megabyte ( MB ) file attachment . If the e-mail platform is backed up or archived , all 100 instances are saved , requiring 100 MB storage space .

@@77780777 @6480777/ <h> Share <p> Most people have heard of phishing and have an intuitive grasp of what it means . Images come to mind of bright shiny lures tempting hapless fish into taking a bite of something that will cause their demise . Indeed , this concept holds true whether you 're a rainbow trout or run-of-the-mill worker idly surfing the web at your desk . But unlike fishing in the traditional sense , with its watchful serenity or to some " unrelenting tedium , what does phishing entail in the virtual world of hackers , malware and data loss ? <p> Phishing Today <p> Phishing scams usually involve fraudulent emails from cybercriminals pretending to be someone else in order to steal money , information , or a person 's identity . These emails are especially harmful to businesses , where a single employee can accidently open the wrong email and bring a whole company to its knees . <p> Phishing scams have been around for a while , but people still fall for them all the time . A recent study found that , on average , people open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting that such scams resulted in a loss of $3.1 billion dollars worldwide . With the recent rise of malicious software ( aka malware ) such as ransomware , phishing e-mails have become more harmful than ever before . <p> Hackers Get Creative <p> There 's an impressive array of phishing scams out there , angling to snag unwary users . Here are some common types to watch for : <p> Hackers will use social media posts to see where victims have been , where they 're going , and what they recently bought . For example , if hackers see a tweet that you recently purchased a new iPhone on Amazon , they might send you an email like this , urging you to click on a link . Once you click , you 're directed to a legitimate-looking webpage that requests updated credit card information " which goes straight to hackers . <p> Soft Targeting refers to emails that target large groups of people who all share an attribute , like the same job title . By using vague language , the scammers can successfully target different people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scam involves sending HR departments fake resumes infected with ransomware . As shown on the image below , attachments are often sent as a . zip file , which can hide all sorts of malicious files inside . When employees open the resume , the ransomware infects the computer instantly , putting valuable information and entire businesses at risk . <p> Whaling refers to scams that target senior executives who likely have access to large amounts of money . Before attacking , hackers may comb through social media posts to learn the names of key executives , payment schedules , and anything else that will help their emails look convincing . <p> Last year , a Mattel finance executive was the target of a whaling scam when she received an email from the new CEO , requesting a large amount of money . The executive sent off $3 Million dollars , only to realize her mistake a few days later . Mattel eventually got its money back , but only because of a banking holiday . <p> An Ounce of Prevention <p> Although there 's no way to eliminate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent a phishing attack or mitigate one after it happens . <p> Educate Users : - Educating users about safe browsing practices , the consequence of malware infection , and the latest threats is an important first step . It can also help to involve different departments in addition to IT . To supplement user education , many companies run mock phishing exercises , where IT sends out emails that simulate popular phishing scams , and gather information on employee behavior and compliance . Such testing helps companies understand if employees are disregarding guidelines and putting the company at risk . <p> Create Unique Passwords : An estimated 63% of data breaches involve overly simplistic passwords or those reused by people for their different accounts . While it may be difficult for users to remember several complex passwords , creating distinct passwords for every account makes things more difficult for hackers as well . <p> Flag Outside Emails : Scammers often use emails that look similar to a company 's email address in order to trick employees into thinking the email sender is a coworker . For this reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from outside the company so employees can think twice before clicking links or sending money . <p> Limit User Privileges : Because workers with administrative privileges often have access to important data , their a favorite target of hackers . Limiting the number of people with such privileges makes it more difficult for hackers to succeed . <p> Disable Java and Macros : - Malware is routinely delivered through exploited Microsoft Office documents and Java scripts , both of which can circumvent anti-virus programs . To address this , IT should replace Java and Macro Scripts with much safer programs . <p> Back Up Data : - Because prevention does n't always work , a solid backup plan is essential . In particular , it 's a good idea to keep several copies of backup files in different locations and formats since the more backups you have , the easier it will be to recover your data . And since hackers are learning how to infect backup data , it 's important to have as many different backups as possible . That way , if your system becomes infected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean and reconnect to your backups . Backing up data and systems to the cloud- or using a dedicated collocated backup server provides access to built-in firewalls and other useful security measures . Malware systems cant keep up with ransomwares frantic permutations designed to sidestep detection . Additionally , paying ransomware does n't  mean you 'll absolutely get your data back , key corruption and other issues can arise that permanently lock you out of your data and could force the business , depending on its size into failure . It takes a two-phase approach , leveraging detection technologies and backup to be better protected . The cloud benefit is that the cloud is n't on-premise and depending on how the vendor has designed their architecture can be impervious to being infected by such a virus . This is an advantage of being cloud-native vs. being retrofitted to the cloud . <p> When someone falls victim to a phishing scam , they should immediately disconnect any infected computers from the Internet to avoid any further infection or data loss . It 's also important to contact your local FBI field office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may not be able to undo a phishing scam . However , if you 've backed up everything across your enterprise , you can survive the ordeal with your assets intact and nothing more than a few scrapes and bruises to show for it . <p> To learn more about how to minimize the impact of malware with backup , download- our Insiders Guide .

@@77780792 @6480792/ <h> Evolution of Data Backup from Servers to Cloud Apps <h> Share <p> IT admins have been backing up critical data since the earliest days of business computing . The definition of backing up data , though , has evolved as business data has extended- from mainframes to servers , and more recently to endpoints and cloud apps . <p> Back in the era of The Beatles and moon landings , enterprise computing looked a lot like the IBM mainframe . In those days , backing up data involved expensive magnetic tape and was limited to large Fortune 1000 companies managing financial or scientific data . <p> But , like death and taxes , the only certainty in IT is change . Massive server farms soon sprang up within large corporate environments , storing petabytes of business-critical data on physical servers hosting enterprise applications such as Microsoft Exchange and Oracle SQL . These applications- managed- enormous sets of vital business and end user data , and- SAN and NAS environments sprang up to create a whole ecosystem of vendors , certifications and staff . - IT 's job was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but backup solutions were- notoriously expensive , unreliable and unable to capture data in realtime . <p> One particular challenge that arose for IT admins was how to restore a single file " say , a CEO 's lost email " without having to restore a full database or take users back to a past instance . To address this need , vendors such as Veritas and Symantec introduced Granular Recovery Technology ( GRT ) solutions , enabling the restoration of a single email and/or contact without affecting the productivity of other end users . With GRT , IT admins could now look back in time as needed , and locate the critical data of only a few users . <p> The next stage in the evolution of backup was the adoption of virtual server environments " such as VMware 's ESX farms and HyperV by Microsoft " to allow IT teams to more centrally manage dispersed servers and better manage costs . But as backups expanded to these virtual environments , similar- challenges arose : How do you backup a virtual server as well as the applications hosted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single email from a full backup of a virtual machine ? To address this , Symantec and EMC worked with VMware to create code-aware APIs to backup data stored in Exchange and Oracle SQL applications , protecting the critical data on these servers . <p> From the data center to the endpoint and cloud apps <p> While a typical IT admin 's focus was still on backing up server data , a sea change was brewing in terms of where business data lived . Mobile devices such as laptops and smartphones drove critical business information outside the- traditional data center and server environments and onto a variety of endpoints " outside of the view and protection of IT teams . This lack of- visibility into distributed- data brought increased risk to organizations and hampered ITs efforts to enact- comprehensive data governance . <p> Fortunately , Druva came to the rescue , leading the evolution of backup on endpoints with its enterprise-grade backup solution . With Druva 's endpoint backup , IT could protect and restore data " including data in Office 365 applications " to regain visibility of data across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep the workforce productive . <p> With the rising popularity of Microsoft 's OneDrive and Office 365 , end user data soon extended to cloud apps . What started with a trickle of consumer apps and Dropbox became a flood of enterprise apps moving to the cloud . Microsoft Exchange was being replaced by Exchange Online ; Office 365 was being replaced by Office 365 Online . With this shift , IT now faced the daunting challenge of making sure that critical data was protected , as well as understanding what data was being created and stored across these apps . <p> Again , Druva was ready to meet the challenge , bringing backup to the next level with a new converged approach to backup across servers , endpoints , and cloud apps . This converged approach backs up and stores data in a single platform , making the- data available for other business insights . <p> As end user data migrates- to cloud apps , we tend to take its integrity for granted ; e.g. , OneDrive guarantees redundancy , so losing a file is less common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for data loss , and more about converging distributed data into one platform for IT to address a wider range of devices and services . Now IT teams have greater- visibility into what data the- company stores , and can better analyze it , assess risks , improve compliance , and meet other business needs . <p> In other words , backup has evolved to be more than backup <p> The only constant in IT is change . Critical data has moved beyond servers and endpoints to cloud apps . In the future , what will worry IT the most ? Not losing the data itself , but losing out on any critical business insights offered by the data that they 've backed up . In this way , - the cloud and big data- are- changing how data is protected and analyzed " - fast- replacing monolithic storage pools and excel spreadsheets of the past . <p> IT leaders today have an opportunity to change how they manage the critical data that they store , and bring new- insights and efficiencies- to their business . <p> To see Gartner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the 2015 Gartner Critical Capabilities Report . <h> Sameer Agashe <p> Sameer Agashe is an Implementation Manager at Druva .

As a company , Druva recognizes the critical value of the clients that trust our products every day with their most sensitive data . In keeping with that , we make it our priority to bring our customers into our development process as trusted advisors in order for us to move the forward in the right direction . We were both excited and honored to host our 2016 Customer Advisory Board ( CAB ) event , which was held for the third consecutive year last week . <p> This year , we brought together a great mix of IT , legal and infosec thought leaders from a wide-range of industries " including manufacturing , pharmaceuticals , healthcare , construction , consulting , technology and more " to share their knowledge and ideas with other Druva customers . <p> ( ANDRITZ shares their experience using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Product Management , shares the vision and roadmap for Phoenix ! ) <p> While the discussions varied in their specifics , several common themes and trends surfaced throughout the event .

AWS and Microsoft Azure ( both strategic partners of Druva ) play a significant role in this transformation by helping customers move and scale workloads on demand thereby reducing the cost and overhead associated with managing on-premises infrastructure . <p> The growing adoption and operational reliance on services such as Office 365 , Box and Salesforce is increasing the need to protect and manage data within these cloud applications . While the cloud or SaaS provider 's infrastructure provides high availability and disaster recovery options , the responsibility of protecting the data and recovering it from accidental errors , corruption or malicious attacks like ransomware still falls on our customers . <p> Legal activity and expenses have substantially increased in the last few years driving customers to look for more efficient ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data privacy and compliance regulations becoming more stringent , legal teams are seeing a stronger need to collect and preserve dispersed data " from mobile devices to file servers , to cloud applications " as well as avoid the over-collection of data to help reduce costs and risks . <p> With rising concerns around data breaches , insider attacks and other threats , our customers are seeking to gain deeper visibility into their data and derive actionable insights that would help them identify and mitigate risks proactively while responding quickly to security incidents . <p> The lively discussions around the trends of today naturally transitioned into the impact they could have on organizations down the road . To address the demands of today and tomorrow , our product team engaged in exciting conversations around product capabilities and roadmap on topics such as eDiscovery , cloud workload management , ransomware recovery , anomaly detection , etc .

@@77780815 @6480815/ <h> Why Global Dedupe Is The Killer Feature ' of Cloud Backup <h> Share <p> Thanks to recent advances in mobile technology , device storage capacity continues to closely follow Moore 's Law " that is , doubling approximately every two years . Magnetic disks in laptop devices first reached terabyte ( TB ) capacities a few years ago , and now flash-based disks have broken the TB barrier . With the rise of the mobile workforce , much of todays work is increasingly being performed on mobile devices , and protecting this data is just as critical as if it were stored in the data center . <p> For the past few years , Gartnerhas been tracking advances in end user data protection in its periodic report onCritical Capabilities for Enterprise Endpoint Backup . During that time , content created on mobile devices has become increasingly media-rich and hence , documents , presentations , and even emails have grown in size . The increase in data on devices , coupled with unpredictable network connections , means the ability to protect data effectively is a function in how timely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to data protection of mobile devices , this means the scale of data that needs to be backed up every cycle rises exponentially . <p> By virtue of their inherent mobility , mobile devices are more likely than attached storage devices to backup their data over a network ; and todays devices have multiple options : office Wi-Fi , a hotspot at the local coffee store , even a telco data plan . Although backup software can be configured to use a specific method , waiting for your chosen network to become available exposes you to significant risk . Imagine if your VP were to lose his or her laptop in an airport terminal , moments after putting the final touches to your latest sales presentation ! It should be obvious that when devising a backup strategy , you need to weigh the cost of Wi-Fi access or data plan overages against the very real possibility of losing your critical data forever . <p> One of the keys to ensure the data is protected is to use an efficient algorithm that not only compresses but also removes data redundancies so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of data protection . To accomplish this , vendors utilize deduplication , but not all deduplication is the same . Understanding their differences can aid in ensuring your organization meets its data protection objectives . <p> So , what are the various types of deduplication ? <p> Deduplication at Target : Inefficient for Network but Efficient on Storage Savings <p> With deduplication at target , you copy your data to a storage device , the storage processor identifies the duplicate data , and maintains only a single copy " all other copies are discarded . Now , whenever you need to access the relevant data you get it from this single copy . <p> Deduplication at target can be performed in either inline or offline mode . In the case of inline deduplication , as new data is being received by the storage processor , a fingerprint ' of the data is compared with existing fingerprints in real time . If the same data already exists on the target , it is skipped and only a reference to the existing data is maintained . In offline mode , data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then removes duplicated data and maintains a single copy . All references to the data then point to this single copy . <p> Consider a situation where you have multiple copies of a file , each slightly different from one another ( e.g. , a work that is in progress ) . Using deduplication at target , each device will copy its version of the file over a network layer to the backup store . Whether in online or offline mode , the storage processor in the backup store will then scan these files , find the unique content in each and delete all but one of these unique parts , maintaining a single copy of all the data . However , this creates significant overhead as each device 's version of the file must initially be sent over the network . It is highly inefficient in terms of bandwidth but conducive to overall storage savings , as only a single copy per target is maintained . <p> What if you could identify whether the data has already been stored at the target before copying , and skip sending it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is called deduplication at source . <p> Local Deduplication at Source : Saving Network Bandwidth at the Cost of Endpoint Resources <p> In the case of local deduplication at source , data is scanned locally first , followed by the identification of any unique data , which is then backed up once . Subsequent backups need only include a reference to the original data , thus conserving bandwidth . While there is the advantage to only sending unique data across the network once , scanning for and comparing this information locally can be resource-intensive and weigh down heavily on the CPU and memory of a mobile device.For very large datasets , this can be highly inefficient for an endpoint device . <p> Further , this only ensures that deduplication happens across just a single device at a time . <p> Now , this is alright for your personal laptop , but for business organizations with multiple copies of data spread across multiple devices , duplicate data across these devices gets transferred multiple times . <p> Global Deduplication at Source : The Best of Both Worlds <p> The answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method , the data fingerprint ' is calculated at the source ; this fingerprint is then sent across to the target where it is compared to existing data . If a match exists , regardless of its source , only a reference to the data will be copied . By global , we mean across all users and their devices . The two earlier methods are either user or device only and therefore never get the network-effect that global delvers , which significantly lowers the overhead of data being transferred . <p> Take this scenario for example : a file is sent as an email attachment to a group of coworkers . With the deduplication at target method , each mobile device will copy the file over a network layer to the target , where all but one of these files is deleted and a single copy maintained . Using the local deduplication at source method , once a file is sent to the backup store , no other copies will be sent by that device and only the metadata of the file with a unique identifier will be transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it 's unque within that device . In the case of Global deduplication at source , a file is sent across network only once , be it for 10 devices or 100s . <p> As the number of users deployed increases , the duplicate data begins to accumulate . For successive users , only a fraction of their entire backup set data will need to be uploaded . This reduces bandwidth usage and improves the speed of deployment as it is rolled out across the organization . <p> In the real-world example below , a very large deployment in a global consulting company was implemented within a single business quarter thanks to global deduplication at source . While the users had nearly 300 TB of total backup data , less than 150 TB of data was ultimately transferred to the backup cloud . This was made possible by deduplicating not only on a per-user basis , but globally across the entire organization . This 50% data transfer savings applies to the initial deployment , and it increases to 80% over time as you only backup unique data . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total backup data , less than 150 TB was ultimately transferred due to global data deduplication . <p> The global deduplication at source method , however , scales beyond a single user to the organizational level . The result is that you may not even need to copy that file over a network to the backup store , as someone else may have already sent it there as a part of their backup cycle . This can save a significant amount of network traffic at the cost of finding a unique identifier for that file . <p> The decision often boils down to what is cheaper : CPU cycles or network bandwidth . However , across an entire organization we have seen this method save an incredible amount of bandwidth over time " in one real-world case , nearly 15TB over the course of one year ! Without the benefit of global deduplication at source , nearly twice the amount of data would need to be transferred to backup enterprise data . Not only does this significantly increase bandwidth consumption , it also increases the duration of backups cycles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The above example from a technology company illustrates that for a fully deployed customer the deduplication advantage persists even when data transferred is growing slower than data backed up growth . <p> In the case of locally deduplicated backups , you will see an incremental increase in bandwidth , as each device will have a fixed amount of duplicate content . With global deduplication , however , the bandwidth savings accelerate as more devices are included . Initial backups also become quicker , as each subsequent user enjoys the deduplication benefits of previous device backups . <p> Comparison of Deduplication Methods for Endpoint Backup <p> - <p> At Target Deduplication <p> At Source Local Deduplication <p> At Source Global Deduplication <p> Endpoint Device resources <p> Low resource use required <p> High resources used . All of the dedup computation is done locally . Involves fingerprint calculation of data and comparison . <p> Moderate resources used for fingerprint calculation for the data . <p> Bandwidth Savings <p> No B/W savings at all . All the data is transferred to backup store <p> Moderate bandwidth savings . For data globally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent multiple times over network <p> High bandwidth savings as only single copy of data is sent over network . <p> low resource use required as deduplication happens on endpoint device . <p> Moderate resource use required for inline deduplication processing . <p> Finally , by observing a few simple best practices , global deduplication at source can offer even greater advantages to an organization . For example : <p> Geographically-dispersed organizations can speed up backup of their remote users by first deploying their head office users who have access to better bandwidth , and then later deploying the remote users who may benefit from deduplication with existing data . <p> Mobile or tethered devices can be deployed later in the implementation cycle , potentially saving bandwidth on those devices , which typically backup either on Wi-Fi or other wireless networks . <p> To learn more about data deduplication , check out our previous blog postshere andhere . <p> Geta free trialof Druva 's single dashboard for backup , availability , and governance , or check out a particular purpose . <h> Ashish Karnik <p> I started Druva 's Performance Engineering team about 2 years ago .

@@77780822 @6480822/ <h> Configuring the backup retention policy <h> About retention policy <p> Data backed up from user devices is retained in the storages so that they can be retrieved when required . The retention policy defines the duration for which backed up data is retained in inSync storages . As an administrator , you are responsible for configuring your organization 's retention policy in inSync . <p> Note : Every time data is backed up successfully from a device , a snapshot of the device is created in inSync . A snapshot is a reference to the state of the backup folders in the device when the backup was taken . Through the Admin Console , you can view the snapshots stored for a device in inSync . They indicate the number of backups that have been taken from the device and retained in inSync . <p> Backups taken from a device is classified into three types : <p> ( Regular ) backup : It stands for successful completion of a backup process and leads to the creation of a snapshot in inSync . If the backup interval for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile should ideally end up creating three snapshots for each device every day . However , the actual number of backups may vary depending on the duration for which a device was connected to inSync and the backups manually triggered by the users . <p> Weekly backup : Sunday through Saturday is considered as a week by inSync . The last successful ( regular ) backup of the week from a device is tagged as a weekly backup in inSync . <p> Monthly backup : The last weekly backup of a calendar month from a device is tagged as a monthly backup in inSync . <p> inSync follows the Grandfather-father-son rotation policy for its hierarchical backup strategy . The ( regular ) backups are the son . The last successful backup of the week graduates to father status ( weekly backup ) . The last weekly backup of the month graduates to grandfather status ( monthly backup ) . The When defining the retention policy , you have to define the duration for which all ( regular ) backups , weekly backups , and monthly backups will be retained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profiles and not at an individual user level .

@@77780826 @6480826/ <h> Overview <p> A retention policy defines the rules for retaining your backed-up snapshots within storage . Use retention policies to define the duration for which you want to retain your historic snapshots . <p> The main objective of using a retention policy is to keep important data for future access , depending on how critical it is , and how often it will be required . A retention policy also ensures that snapshots that are no longer required are cleaned from your storage periodically , resulting in less storage utilization and costs . <p> A retention policy should consider the value of your data , as well as the legal requirements that you might need to adhere to . This means that different types of data will be retained for different durations . For example , a bank 's retention period for customers ' financial records and facilities inventory records will be different . <p> Main factors to consider while defining a retention policy are , <p> Legal requirements <p> Storage costs <p> Type of data <h> What should you know about retention policies ? <p> Retention policies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenix Cloud . <p> The default retention policy retains snapshots as follows : <p> All snapshots : 60 days <p> Weekly revisions : 24 weeks <p> Monthly revisions : 12 months <p> Yearly revisions : 3 years <p> Phoenix runs a retention policy expiration algorithm to delete the snapshots that have crossed the expiration period . This algorithm does not delete thawed snapshots . For more information , see Snapshots . <p> Phoenix follows the Gregorian calendar for tracking days . <p> For daily snapshots , Phoenix considers midnight as the end of a day . <p> For weekly snapshots , Phoenix considers midnight of Sunday as the end of the week . <p> For monthly snapshots , Phoenix considers midnight of the last day of a month as the end of the month . <p> For yearly snapshots , Phoenix considers the midnight of the last day of the year as the end of the year . <p> Snapshot name displayed on the Phoenix Management Console is snapshot creation time as per the server time zone , on which the backup occurred . Phoenix considers the time zone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you apply a new retention policy to a server group , Phoenix retains all the snapshots created with the old retention policy . Phoenix does not apply new retention policy parameters to the old snapshots . Phoenix retains the old snapshots for the duration defined in the old retention policy . <h> How Phoenix uses retention policies ? <p> Daily snapshots - Phoenix retains all the snapshots that are created for the number of days specified in Daily snapshots . <p> Weekly snapshots ( Son ) - Number of weekly snapshots that Phoenix should retain . Phoenix treats the latest snapshot in the week as the weekly snapshot . <p> Monthly snapshots ( Father ) - Number of monthly snapshots that Phoenix should retain . Phoenix treats the latest snapshot in the month as the monthly snapshot . <p> Yearly snapshots ( Grandfather ) - Number of yearly snapshots that Phoenix should retain . Phoenix treats the latest snapshot in the year as the yearly snapshot . <p> Example <p> Below is the calendar for September , 2016 . <p> Mon <p> Tue <p> We 'd <p> Thu @ <p> 29 <p> 30 <p> Let us assume , if you have specified below configuration in your retention policy : <p> Keep all snapshots for - 7 days <p> Keep weekly revisions for - 4 weeks <p> Keep monthly revisions for - 12 months <p> Keep yearly revisions for - 5 years <p> Assume , Phoenix performs a daily backup at 22:00 hrs in your environment and todays date is September 15th , 14:00 hrs . <p> Based on the retention policy , Phoenix retains snapshots as follows , <p> 7 Daily snapshots - Server A has been successfully backed up for last 7 days .

However , based on your organizations requirements , you can add a new retention policy and associate it with the server groups . <h> Prerequisites <p> You must be a Phoenix cloud administrator . <h> Procedure <p> On the Phoenix Management Console menu bar , click All Organizations , and then select the required organization from the drop-down list . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain all the daily snapshots . <p> Keep weekly revisions for <p> Specify the number of weeks for which you want to retain the latest weekly snapshot . <p> Keep monthly revisions for <p> Specify the number of months for which you want to retain the latest monthly snapshot . <p> Keep yearly revisions for <p> Specify the number of years , for which you want to retain the latest yearly snapshot. 7464 @qwx627464 <p> New retention policy is added to Phoenix . You can now assign this newly created retention policy to server groups . Retention policy is applied to all the servers that are part of the server group . Phoenix retains snapshots of the backed up data for the servers as per defined retention policy . <h> Update a retention policy <p> As a Phoenix cloud or group administrator , you can update existing retention policy details as per your organizations policies . When you update a retention policy , Phoenix revisits all the snapshots created/retained for the server groups as per the original retention policy , and retains only the snapshots as specified in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management Console menu bar , click All Organizations , and then select the required organization from the drop-down list . <p> Click the VMware retention policy for which you want to view the list of associated server groups . Retention policy details appear . <p> In the Server Groups area , you can see the list of associated server groups . <p> Click on the server group name to view its details . <h> Delete a retention policy <p> As a Phoenix cloud administrator , you can delete a retention policy that is not required as per policies of your organization . When you delete a retention policy , the retention rules no longer apply to the server groups that it was assigned to . Phoenix stops retaining snapshots following the rules defined by the retention policy that you delete . <p> A retention policy should not be associated to any server group at the time of deletion .

@@77780841 @6480841/ <h> User 's quota usage <p> User quota is the maximum amount of data that a user can back up or share from the user 's devices . The user quota is also the maximum data that the backup folders and inSync Share folder can contain across a user 's devices . <p> For example , consider a user who has a quota of 2 GB . The user backs up data from Desktop and Documents folders and also shares data . At any time , the total data in the Desktop , Documents , and inSync Share folders can not exceed 2 GB . If the data in these folders exceeds 2 GB , backups and share operations fail . <p> When you assign a profile to a user , the user automatically acquires the quota that is assigned to the profile . Updates to quota settings of a profile are applied to all users that belong to that profile . You can also assign quota at a user level . <p> Note : User-level quota overrides profile-level quota . This means that if you assign the quota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual quota is applicable for the user. ? <p> For example , if the user quota is defined as 50 GB in the profile to which an user is associated , and if you have also defined the user-level quota at 70 GB for the user , the user is assigned 70 GB of quota . <p> Following are some scenarios to consider for user 's quota usage : <p> When the user installs the inSync client on multiple devices , the inSync Master considers the contents of the user 's inSync Share folder only once when it calculates the inSync Share folder quota usage . <p> When the user creates and shares a folder , and adds files to the folder , the contents of the folder is considered as part of the user 's quota usage . <p> When the user 's collaborators add files to your shared folder , this is considered in the user 's quota usage . If the user adds files to folders that other people have shared , this does not affect the user 's quota usage . <p> When the user shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sync this folder to the device , this folder does not appear inside the user 's inSync Share folder , but it is considered as part of the user 's quota usage . <p> When the user reaches 90% of his user quota , then the user receives the Low User Storage Available alert message . For more information , see Alert Messages . <p> When the user 's quota for data backup is reached , then the user receives the Storage quota reached error message . The user can then request the inSync administrator to increase the user quota . <h> Organization 's quota usage <p> The organization 's quota defines the maximum amount of data that users from that organization can back up or share on their devices . Following are some scenarios to consider for the quota usage of an organization : <p> When the inSync administrator creates a workspace , the contents of the workspace is considered as a part of the organization 's quota usage and not as a part of individual user 's quota usage . <p> When the inSync administrator configures the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps data is considered as a part of the organization 's quota usage . <p> When the organization 's quota for data backup is reached , then the users receive the Storage quotareached error message when performing any backup or share operations . In this case , the inSync administrator must contact Druva Sales to increase the organization 's quota .

To provide the necessary insight into the current data-protection trends landscape , ESG surveyed 387 IT professionals who are responsible for data protection decisions in their organizations . In order to provide a comprehensive overview , ESG selected individuals from both midsize companies of 250-999 employees as well as enterprise environments comprising over 1000 people . <p> What Are the Challenges ? According to survey respondents , data protection and recoverability are major concerns for their organizations . As part of its survey , ESG asked respondents how confident they felt in their current protection strategy for various types of data . <p> For example , only slightly more than one-third of respondents ( 36 percent ) indicated they are very confident that on-premises servers are well protected , while the remaining 64 percent of respondents were less confident to varying degrees with their current data protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are very confident in the level of data protection on servers , databases , email , and on-premises virtual machines . <p> A second tier of challenges hovered around 25 percent very confident including SaaS applications , company-owned endpoint devices , and cloud-based virtual machines . <p> Respondents felt least confident with the security of employee-owned BYOD devices , with only 18 percent very confident responses . <p> When ESG asked respondents to identify their biggest data protection challenges with current technology , the cost of backup was at the top of the list , with 35 percent of respondents citing it as their number one concern as many organizations are looking to the cloud to address this issue . Other critical challenges identified by the survey included the need to protect virtual environments , improve recovery reliability , and reduce overall backup times . <p> Mandates from LeadershipWhen asked about top priorities from IT leadership , respondents ranked recovery speed , recovery reliability , backup speed or frequency , and reducing hardware costs as primary concerns . A quarter of the 387 respondents told ESG that recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 percent indicated that they use a single software backup solution . <p> For the respondents who said they use multiple software backup solutions , the primary reason given for doing so was that different backup solutions are better suited to specific applications or workloads . The need for additional features such a cloud backup and supporting legacy software were also cited as key reasons for using more than one software backup solution . <p> When it comes to length of deployment for backup , three-quarters of respondents have been working with their current solution for between one and seven years . The respondents were evenly split between users with three or fewer years invested in their current platform , and those with four to seven years of using their current backup . Given the pace of advancement in the backup space , it is also worth noting that 18 percent of respondents have been using their current backup solution for eight or more years .

To provide the necessary insight into the current data-protection trends landscape , ESG surveyed 387 IT professionals who are responsible for data protection decisions in their organizations . In order to provide a comprehensive overview , ESG selected individuals from both midsize companies of 250-999 employees as well as enterprise environments comprising over 1000 people . <p> What Are the Challenges ? According to survey respondents , data protection and recoverability are major concerns for their organizations . As part of its survey , ESG asked respondents how confident they felt in their current protection strategy for various types of data . <p> For example , only slightly more than one-third of respondents ( 36 percent ) indicated they are very confident that on-premises servers are well protected , while the remaining 64 percent of respondents were less confident to varying degrees with their current data protection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are very confident in the level of data protection on servers , databases , email , and on-premises virtual machines . <p> A second tier of challenges hovered around 25 percent very confident including SaaS applications , company-owned endpoint devices , and cloud-based virtual machines . <p> Respondents felt least confident with the security of employee-owned BYOD devices , with only 18 percent very confident responses . <p> When ESG asked respondents to identify their biggest data protection challenges with current technology , the cost of backup was at the top of the list , with 35 percent of respondents citing it as their number one concern as many organizations are looking to the cloud to address this issue . Other critical challenges identified by the survey included the need to protect virtual environments , improve recovery reliability , and reduce overall backup times . <p> Mandates from LeadershipWhen asked about top priorities from IT leadership , respondents ranked recovery speed , recovery reliability , backup speed or frequency , and reducing hardware costs as primary concerns . A quarter of the 387 respondents told ESG that recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 percent indicated that they use a single software backup solution . <p> For the respondents who said they use multiple software backup solutions , the primary reason given for doing so was that different backup solutions are better suited to specific applications or workloads . The need for additional features such a cloud backup and supporting legacy software were also cited as key reasons for using more than one software backup solution . <p> When it comes to length of deployment for backup , three-quarters of respondents have been working with their current solution for between one and seven years . The respondents were evenly split between users with three or fewer years invested in their current platform , and those with four to seven years of using their current backup . Given the pace of advancement in the backup space , it is also worth noting that 18 percent of respondents have been using their current backup solution for eight or more years . Even with the fairly long usage of their current solutions , 47 percent of respondents indicated that they are working with the most current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also asked about data redundancy , specifically the number of copies that are being created for data protection and management . <p> One-third of respondents had between 5 and 10 copies of their data in total . <p> 19 percent indicated they had between 11-15 copies and 16-20 copies of data . <p> 13 percent of respondents indicated having fewer than five copies of data . <p> With so many copies of data stored , its no surprise that the most compelling concerns regarding the current data management capabilities cited by survey respondents were reduced storage footprint ( 25 percent ) and consolidation of various data protection tools into a single solution ( 19 percent ) of respondents . <h> Ryan McCurdy <p> Ryan McCurdy is a Senior Marketing Campaigns Manager at Druva , where he is responsible for the development and management of globally integrated marketing programs and campaigns .

@@77780866 @6480866/ <h> Overview <p> This topic explains what storages are and describes the procedure for creating them in inSync . <h> About storages <p> Storage is a location to which data backed up from user devices is stored . You can create multiple storages for inSync Enterprise . However , the combined size of all storages can not exceed 64 TB . <p> Each inSync storage contains the following folders : <p> One or more data volumes - Each data volume is a discrete unit of storage on a physical disk that can store data . <p> Database folder - It contains the inSync database containing the metadata of the backed up data . The information stored in the database is essential for inSync to identify the data for each user . <p> Database log folder - It contains the log files for all transactions to the inSync database . <p> When you create a storage , you create the first data volume of the storage . Later you can add up to 10 data volumes to the storage . Data volumes bring scalability to a storage . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the need for additional space . Instead , you can simply attach a new volume to an existing storage , thus expanding the capacity of that storage . However , you can not control how data is saved to data volumes . Typically , once a data volume is filled to its capacity , the subsequent data is saved to the next data volume of that storage . <h> Creating a storage 7463 @qwx627463 <p> Before creating a storage : <p> Make sure you have admin or root privileges on the computer where inSync server is installed . <p> Plan for the necessary space required to create the storage . Use the following guidelines : <p> A storage can contain maximum 64 TB of data . If you plan to create multiple storages , the combined size of all storages can not exceed 64 TB . <p> A storage can have maximum 10 data volume . <p> The database folder must be 5% of the data that will be stored in the storage . When calculating the size of the database folder , consider the size of the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the first data volume you are creating . <h> Step 1 : Create the folders required for the storage <p> To create the folders <p> Log on to the server to which you attached your storage media . <p> Create the folders that will be used as data folder for the data volume , database folder , and database log folder respectively . <p> Make sure that you excluded these folders from an antivirus scan . <p> Follow these guidelines while creating the folders : <p> If the storage will contain more than 1 TB data , create separate folders for the data folder for the data volume , database folder , and database log folder . <p> The database and database log folders must be on a local drive . Do no create these folders on a networked or shared drive . <p> The data folder can be either on a local drive , a Storage Area Network ( SAN ) , or a Network-attached Storage ( NAS ) . <p> The database folder must be on a separate disk . If you expect many users to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder on a Solid-State Drive ( SSD ) . <p> It is recommended that you create the data folder and the database log folder on separate disks . <p> If inSync server is installed on a Linux computer , the user ' insyncserver ' must have group and owner permissions on the data folder of the data volume , the database folder , and the database log folder . <p> To assign appropriate permissions <p> Log on to the inSync server . <p> Run the following command on all storage folders : <p> $ sudo insync-config -s &lt;storage path&gt; <h> Step 3 : Create the storage <p> While creating a storage , you can add only the first data volume . Later on you can add more volumes to the storage . <h> Fields in the storage creation wizard <h> General Storage Information <p> The following table describes the fields on the General Storage Information page of the wizard . <p> Field 7465 @qwx627465 <p> Storage name <p> Enter the name for the storage . <p> Data folder <p> Enter the path of the data folder of the first data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter the size of data that can be saved to the data volume . <p> Storage consumption alert threshold <p> Enter the threshold value which when crossed , triggers a low disk space alert . For example , if the Max. disk space is 10 TB and Storage consumption alert threshold is 80% , an alert is triggered when 8 TB of storage is consumed . <h> Performance <p> The following table describes the fields on the Performance page of the wizard . <p> Field 7465 @qwx627465 <p> Use SSD <p> Select if you are creating the database folder on a Solid State Drive . <p> Database folder / SSD path Database folder <p> Enter the path to the database folder . <p> Database log folder <p> Enter the path to the database log folder . <p> Max. parallel connections <p> Enter the number of parallel connections to the storage . It indicates the upper limit for parallel backup or restore operations that can be performed by the particular storage . <p> Note : By default , this value is set to 20 . You can set this field to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set the value to 10% of the total number of users backing up their data to the storage . <h> Storage Compaction Schedule <p> Compaction is a process of deleting expired data to make room for new data . With each backup , the previous backup data becomes obsolete . This obsolete data is retained for a period that your retention policy dictates . For example , if your organization 's policy mandates a retention of 90 days , the " obsolete data " is retained for 90 days . At the end of 90 days , this data is deleted from the storage , thus freeing up storage space . <p> The compaction process is resource-intensive and time-consuming , and thus , should run during off-peak hours . Druva recommends that along with the daily compaction , you run a weekly compaction for a longer duration . <p> The following table describes the fields on the Storage Compaction Schedule page of the wizard . <p> Field 7465 @qwx627465 <p> Compact daily at <p> Enter the start time and duration for the daily storage compaction . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continue for 6 hours . The compaction will stop at 6:00 AM even if it does not complete . 
@@77780867 @6480867/ <h> Step 1 of 2 : Obtain WebDAV access details <p> To access legal hold data by using WebDAV , you must obtain the WebDAV access details . The WebDAV access details include your credentials and URLs to the storage where user data resides . If the users data is backed up on multiple storage , multiple WebDAV URLs are created . <h> Access WebDAV by using HTTP connectors within eDiscovery tools <p> inSync Client collects the EDRM-recommended metadata attributes of data that is backed up from devices of users who are on legal hold . inSync then provides WebDAV access to the preserved data and associated metadata. eDiscovery HTTP connector can be used to collect the preserved data and metadata attributes , parse through the data , and help data custodians to analyze and act on them . <h> Access WebDAV by using a mapped network drive <h> Windows OS 7463 @qwx627463 <p> If you are using a self-signed certificate , before you access WebDAV , you must first install the self-signed certificate as a Trusted Root Certificate . However , we recommend that you install and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Using a self-signed certificate might involve potential security risks . <p> On the Enter Network Password window , provide the username and password of the cloud administrator or legal administrator , and then click OK . <h> Mac OS 7463 @qwx627463 <p> If you are using a self-signed certificate , before you access WebDAV , you must first install the self-signed certificate by using the Keychain Access utility in Mac . By using the same utility , you can then update the Trust setting for this certificate and mark it as a certificate that is always trusted for all users . However , we recommend that you install and use a certificate signed by a Trusted Certificate Authority ( CA ) . Using a self-signed certificate might involve potential security risks . <h> Procedure <p> To access WebDAV by using a mapped network drive <p> Open Finder . <p> On the menu bar , click Go &gt;Connect to Server . The Connect to Server window appears . <p> On the Enter Network Password window , provide the username and password of the cloud administrator or legal administrator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a web browser <p> You can use a web browser to access the legal hold data via WebDAV , and then download the legal hold data to your computer . If the download fails or is interrupted , then you can resume the download by using download manager add-ons that are available for your web browser . The download manager resumes the download from right where it was interrupted . <p> To access WebDAV by using a web browser <p> Open a web browser . <p> In the address bar , type the WebDAV URL and press Enter . <p> Note : If you are using a self-signed certificate , an untrusted certificate alert appears . Depending on the browser that you are using , you can click Proceed anyway , I Understand the Risks , or Continue to proceed . However , we recommend that you install and use a root certificate signed by a Trusted Certificate Authority ( CA ) because using a self-signed certificate might involve potential security risks . <p> Type the username and password . <p> Click Ok . <h> How legal hold data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy folders appear . The hierarchy of the legal hold policy folders is as follows : <p> A legal hold policy folder contains folders for users that are on legal hold . <p> Each user folder contains device folders . <p> Each device folder contains backed up folders . <p> Each backup folder contains files and folders included in the backup . <p> Before a user is put on legal hold , inSync has backed up data multiple times . Over a period of time , the user can modify or rename folders and files at multiple occasions . Therefore , inSync appends a version number to the backed up folders and file names . <p> inSync checks for the last period ( . ) in the file or folder name and appends the version number before the period . This preserves the file extensions when versions are appended during backups . <p> Example : Version v1 getting appended to Jellyfish.png will appear as : <p> Jellyfish , v1.png <p> If you have periods ( . ) in the folder names , version is appended before the last period in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting appended in the middle of the folder name with periods . <p> Example : Folders Field.Reports and **25;357;TOOLONG when appended with version v2 will appear as : <p> Field , v2.Reports <p> Transaction.Summary , v2.Stats <p> The version number indicates the snapshot number in which the folder or file is modified or renamed . A snapshot is a " point in time image " of the backup folders and indicates the state of the backup folders , which at a particular point in time . <p> If you view all backup data , then different versions of the same folders and files appear . For example : <p> My Documents , v1/Jellyfish , v2.png <p> My Documents , v1/Jellyfish , v3.png <p> Where , v2 and v3 are the second and the third version of the same file . This means that the user has modified Jellyfish.png twice . <p> If you view the last backup data of users , only the latest versions of the folders and files appear . This means that you will see only one version of the folders and files . For example : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; data for ease of accessibility . ? <p> The subject of email can be up to 30 characters . <p> If an email has multiple attachments , inSync creates an . eml file for the email and separate.eml files for every attachment after backing up the Gmail data . You can then view and access the . eml files through WebDAV . <p> Contacts are available in . vcf file format , in the following directory structure : <p> **26;384;TOOLONG Folder&gt;/&lt;Contact ID&gt;.vcf <p> Calendar events are available in . ics file format , in the following directory structure : <p> Calendars/&lt;Calendar Name&gt;/&lt;Calendar Name&gt;/&lt;Event ID&gt;.ics <p> Google Drive data <p> If a user with Google Apps device is put on legal hold , then the Google Drive data is arranged as follows : <p> Google **29;412;TOOLONG <h> How the MAPI-based backup of emails data is arranged ? <p> inSync displays the emails of end users who are on legal hold and whose data is backed up by using MAPI or Exchange Online through WebDAV in the following structure : <p> inSync exposes only the emails , contacts , and calendar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the following file formats : <p> &lt;fsetname&gt; : The name of the MAPI fset , which can be Outlook Advanced or Outlook All PSTs based on the configuration . For example , Outlook Advanced , v2 in the following illustration . <p> &lt;pst name&gt; : The name of the PST as seen in the Outlook settings . <p> &lt;actual folder hierarchy&gt; : The folder such as Inbox , Outbox , Sent Items , and so on as well as the version information .

The dashboard 's modular design makes it easy to navigate and view information about backup and restore status , data utilization and storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgrading , the information displayed under Activities and Sync &amp; Share area will display graphs for information collected from the day of upgrade . Past information will not available . <h> Ability to access MAPI-based backup of emails via WebDAV <p> inSync 5.8 now supports MAPI to export email data via WebDAV , providing IT and legal teams with flexible options to collect data for legal hold . Every email is backed up using MAPI and is made available through WebDAV in the Email ( EML ) file format for legal teams to quickly and securely access information through any eDiscovery platform directly from the inSync repository for further review and processing . This enhancement is available only with Elite editions of inSync Private Cloud . <h> Security enhancement for inSync Android mobile app <p> inSync mobile app for Android devices now restricts inSync users from logging on to the app if an invalid SSL certificate is available in their ADFS or SAML setup . <h> Easy Migration of data across devices <p> With the easy migration of data across devices , IT managers can use inSync to easily migrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is common in organizations , that when users change their device , they also change the location where the user data resides . For example , the location %userprofile% can change from C : /User to D : /Users . In such a case , inSync will dynamically resolve the right path of the logged-in user , who is restoring the data to a new device . inSync will restore the data at the right location . <h> Office 2016 support <p> inSync 5.8 now supports Office 2016 for organizations to backup emails . To ensure that email files of Outlook 2016 are safely backed up , end-users can easily configure email clients to kick off the email backups at any time . The following image is an example of configuring email clients on Windows ; Outlook -2016/13/10/07 Optimized for Performance or Outlook -2016/13/10/07 Optimized for Efficiency : <p> In case of Mac , IT Managers can easily configure Outlook 2011/16 as shown in the following image : <h> Introducing Encryption File System ( EFS ) Alerts <p> Organizations can use inSync to encrypt data on Windows laptops. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encryption failures due to invalid EFS configuration such as expiry of Data Recovery Agent ( DRA ) certificate . EFS alerts are set at an organization level , and by default IT admins will be notified in case of any encryption failures . Other admins can also opt to subscribe to these alerts . <h> Easy synchronization of backup schedules based on users time zones <p> IT admins extensively use the " Never backup between " and " Backup between " features to decide the backup schedule of end points . In global organizations , where users are spread across multiple time zones , it is challenging for IT admins to control the backup schedule . inSync 5.8 enables IT admins to set the backup time based on the time zone . IT admins can continue to select " Use admin timezone " to synchronize the same time across all clients while selecting the " Backup between time " or the " Never backup between " time option as shown in the following image : <h> Windows 10 and El-Capitan Support <p> inSync 5.8 now supports Windows 10 and OS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OS Migrations , Device Refreshes or Break-Fix device migrations to the new OS platforms seamlessly by utilizing the " System , App Setting " feature ( also known as Persona Backup ) as shown in the following image : <h> Improved Status and Error Reporting <h> Exclusion of External HDDs from Backup <p> IT administrators now have the flexibility of restricting end-users from backing up data on external hard drives ( HDDs ) . By not allowing end-users to backup data from external hard drives , IT administrators can minimize their storage requirements and also ensure end-users do n't exceed their maximum storage quota easily . IT administrators now have the flexibility of restricting end-users from backing up data on external HDDs . <h> Mobile Forensics <p> Mobile Forensics let 's you automatically and transparently collect data from the Android devices of users in your organization . With this capability the enterprise IT , information security , and legal teams can facilitate eDiscovery requests , check for compliance breaches , and ensure legal admissibility while removing the risk of data spoilation . <p> inSync administrators can retrieve the following data by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Text messages <p> Call logs <p> Device information <p> Browser history <p> Third-party app logs <p> inSync administrators can then access the data via WebDAV or download the data as a CSV file through inSync Web . <h> Ability to generate legal hold report <p> You can now generate a chain of custody report , which provides information about the origin , custody of data and device of a legal hold . This let 's you ensure that the data is legally admissible in cases of litigations and internal investigations . <h> IPv6 Support <p> With the advent of IPv6 , an internet protocol , many organizations have started planning for IPv6 support and are increasingly looking for applications to support IPv6. inSync 5.8 now supports IPv6 and it enables customers to use inSync over Microsoft DirectAccess . <h> Client User Interface Enhancements <p> Simplified workflow for adding new folders instead of the pop-up window , and display of contextual information ( path ) for existing folders . <p> Client 5.8 is redefined to provide contextual information upfront , such as the following : <p> Information about backup operations such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interface for viewing Last Backup Details . <p> Information about share operations such as time and date when the sync operation was last completed , and the list of recently-synced files . <p> To reduce clutter while configuring folders for backup , the hidden files are not displayed unless specified to do so . <p> New Sync &amp; Share menu that provides the following capabilities : <p> Information about the time and date when the sync operation was last completed , and the list of recently-synced files . <p> Ability to access the Share Web or the shared folder on your computer . <p> Ability to change the location of the inSync Share folder . <p> Seamless integration with Systems Finder plugin for Mac , that offers highly-functional context menu .

@@77780889 @6480889/ <p> Server backup from remote offices and back offices ( ROBO ) is time consuming , cumbersome , and expensive . With the increase in the amount of data being backed up and retained for litigation and for regulation reasons , large organizations see a lot of corporate data at risk . Scalability and data growth challenges result in very high costs for backup and archival storage , in some cases 6 to 10 times higher than just a few years ago . <p> Protecting that amount of remote data requires a seismic shift in protection technologies . However , few backup offerings are up to snuff . Most depend on replicating to disaster recovery sites , installing twin backup appliances at both the ROBO and the data center , or using backup software to backup over the wide area network ( WAN ) . These are problems , given huge data growth ; slow , un-optimized WANs affect backup and recovery speeds , and it 's hard to assign effective responsibility for multiple sites . <p> This is a problem that traditional backup and storage vendors created . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; given their existing investments , it 's not a problem they are likely to fix . <p> There 's another item influencing the manner in which organizations ensure data integrity in the users they serve outside company headquarters : The remote office is changing in ways that make it possible to introduce new backup technologies . <p> First , Internet bandwidth is getting better .

So , how can you gain a deeper understanding of this wealth of information and use it to your organization 's advantage ? Dave Packer from Druvas product team offers a secure and efficient solution through our Full Text Search Indexing capabilities , a fundamental feature built into our elastic cloud architecture . <p> Hi , I 'm Dave Packer with Druvas product team . And I 'm here today to talk about our Full Text Search Indexing capabilities , which are a fundamental part of our elastic cloud architecture . The Full Text Search Indexing provides a way for organizations to get a deeper understanding of their data , for both analytics and governance capabilities . <p> Most organizations- have- collected a large volume of information and being able to gain insight into that data , understand it better , is a fundamental need for businesses rather than just letting that data sit by the side . Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that data , how you might be able to leverage it for other purposes , especially we start talking about compliance requirements , legal reasons or just overall data analytics and finding information ? <p> One of the big challenges with indexing data has been that most companies do this in an on-premise environment . Were trying to predict how much compute required or how much drive space is required to actually build out the index when were looking across hundreds of repositories and sources of information . It can be very hard for organizations to predict and scale out accordingly their own infrastructure to actually address the challenge at hand . <p> As- organizations scale back the data set or they use the indexer in a way that it winds up taking weeks or months to actually index through all the data . The way that we 've accomplished this is very unique , one is to provide a very elastic search technology , but one that 's also very secured in a way that enables businesses to protect their data to the utmost requirement of their own internal security policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it effective is the way that we separate the data and metadata layer from the actual data itself , what we do is we split those two pieces out and the metadata layer of our system actually keeps track of where those files are , what are they , where they 're located , what is all the information about a file . And then we store the data separately , it just creates a much more efficient way to manage data , but also creates what we call a time index file system which allows us to actually store and retrieve data in a real time manner . <p> And the advantage there is if you 're doing Full Text Search Indexing what we can do is were collecting the information throughout the organization , we can actually index it as we collect it . So files that change , new files that come in , they can be indexed at the ready or on demand . And that 's one of the benefits of utilizing the cloud , we can basically distribute compute and scale as necessary to take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have and can achieve the goals of understanding what data is stored within that . <p> Now when we look at it from the standpoint of the security model , what we 've done is something fairly unique . One of the big questions we get when we engage with customers obviously is that 's great that you do Full Text Search Indexing , but how do you secure the data ? We have a very unique approach in the way that we manage encrypted data to begin with , which is through our two-factor encryption model , and I encourage you to listen to our other video that talks a bit about a way that we manage encryption . But through this model what we do is we 're protecting client 's data so that the client itself only has access to that information , Druva ca n't get to the key , we ca n't be compelled to produce your data . Its stored in a way that 's highly secure . But the benefit is , is that that 's that same mechanism that we use to connect to the virtual private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indexer what it allows for them is a secure communication between the storage area and the indexer . <p> And so you ca n't actually access the indexer from outside the environment . There 's no direct access point , the storage system and the indexer work in tandem . Its a secure link , the key has to be through the two factor encryption model , has to be borne into the session , produced in the session and then it has to be acknowledged by the indexer before the indexer will do anything or can access any of its data . <p> The advantage of that is the stored index itself is actually stored and encrypted using that same key mechanism , and so the benefit here at the end of the day is not only do we as a company Druva have no access to your data that 's stored inside your index , but we have no access to this virtual private cloud instance that is built and specifically segmented for each customer . That 's an important aspect of how we 've secured the data in the cloud as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the security . You know that that index is yours . And that is protected in a way that makes it so that its impenetrable by anybody on the outside . <p> Now another key element of what we do and something that comes up with our global customers is a question about regional requirements . So , you might be a company that has multiple geographies covering maybe the UK , Germany , you might have some site maybe in Singapore , or other places in the world . And each one of those regions has its own kind of data privacy requirements and some of those might place restrictions on what you can index , or what type of information you can look at . <p> So , what we 've done is we 've actually per region built out this indexing capability . The admin then depending on how they 're configured through our delegated admin capabilities gets a segmented view of that data . If I 'm an admin , has the ability to have view of everything , you get that federated view through all those storage nodes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate storage areas that are around the world . <p> As a company , its advantageous because I can go in and I can find information quickly , locate it , no matter where it is in the world and figure out what is it , what do I need to know more about , how does it pertain to any particular type of maybe compliance or legal issue that I 'm researching . So that I can figure out what I need to do next or what are the next steps . Now , the real advantage of this environment of course is the elasticity itself . And as I mentioned earlier , one of the big challenges with on-premise traditional systems is that to grow the index which can at times be thirty to forty percent of the original data set , its a very complex proposition , especially if you 're dealing with petabytes of data . You might have three petabytes of data and a petabyte-and-a-half of index . Well , that 's not only a lot of compute , it 's a lot of storage space . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its a lot of memory and being able to manage an infrastructure to support that is very difficult . <p> With the cloud , we basically have taken that off the plate for you . So , you do n't  even have to think about it . You can set it . You can start indexing . You can start looking through your data , searching it , using compliance tools . For example , using our Proactive Compliance technology , you can identify data , automate it in an automated fashion . And then be told there 's files out there that contain PHI , PII , or PCI type data . So , very advantageous , provides a lot of flexibility to you . <p> As an organization , what this does is it opens up the ability to index to the masses , right . So , to large volumes of data , the things that we want to know more about or understand more in depth . So , that 's a basic overview of our full text search indexing technology . How we secure it and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any more questions , feel free to learn more by going to druva.com or reach out to us via e-mail , I 'm more than happy to respond and give you any more information you might need to understand what were doing here deeper so that it might benefit your organization .

@@77780918 @6480918/ <h> Understanding Data Deduplication <h> Share <p> " Data deduplication is inarguably one of the most new important technologies in storage for the past decade " says Gartner . So let 's take a detailed look at what it actually means . <p> Data deduplication or single instancing essentially refers to the elimination of redundant data . In the deduplication process , duplicate data is deleted , leaving only one copy ( single instance ) of the data to be stored . However , indexing of all data is still retained should that data ever be required . <p> In the same way that the phrase " single instancing " turns the noun " single-instance storage " into a verb , the word " dedupe " becomes- the verb for " deduplication . " For example : - " After we deduped our critical business data with Druvas inSync Backup , 90% of the storage space and bandwidth it was using opened upgiving us the breathing room we need to innovate ! " <p> Example : A typical email system might contain 100 instances of the same 1 MB file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archived , all 100 instances are saved , requiring 100 MB storage space . With data deduplication , only one instance of the attachment is actually stored ; each subsequent instance is just referenced back to the one saved copy reducing storage and bandwidth demand to only 1 MB . <h> Technological Classification <p> The practical benefits of this technology depend upon various factors , including <p> Point of Application : - Source vs . Target <p> Time of Application : - Inline vs . Post-Process <p> Granularity : - File vs . Sub-File level <p> Algorithm : - - Fixed-size blocks vs. variable length data segments <p> A simple relation between these factors can be explained using the diagram below : <h> Target- vs . Source-based Deduplication <p> Target-based deduplication acts on the target data storage media . In this case , the client is unmodified and is not aware of any deduplication . The deduplication engine can be embedded in the hardware array , which can be used as NAS/SAN device with deduplication capabilities . Alternatively , the engine can be offered as an independent software or hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrays . In both cases , it improves only the storage utilization . <p> Source-based deduplication , in contrast , acts on the data at the source before it 's moved . A deduplication-aware backup agent is installed on the client which backs up only unique data . The result is improved bandwidth and storage utilization . However , this imposes additional computational load on the backup client . <h> Inline vs . Post-process Deduplication <p> In target-based deduplication , the deduplication engine can either process data for duplicates in real time ( i.e. as and when data is sent to the target ) or after its been stored in the target storage . <p> The former is called inline deduplication . The obvious advantages are : <p> Increase in overall efficiency as data is only passed and processed once <p> The processed data is instantaneously available for post storage processes , such as recovery and replication , reducing the RPO and RTO window . <p> The disadvantages are : <p> Decrease in write throughput <p> Extent of deduplication is less ; only fixed-length block deduplication approach can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and does not have any knowledge of the files or file-structure . This forces it to use the fixed-length block approach ( discussed in detail later ) . <p> The post-process deduplication asynchronously acts on the stored data . And it has an exact opposite effect on advantages and disadvantages of the inline deduplication listed above . <h> File vs . Sub-file Level Deduplication <p> The duplicate removal algorithm can be applied on full file or sub-file levels . Full file level duplicates easily can be - eliminated by calculating single checksum of the complete file data and comparing it against existing checksums of the already-backed-up files . It 's simple and fast , but the extent of deduplication is less , as this process- does not address the problem of duplicate content found inside different files or data-sets ( e.g. specific email messages ) . <p> The sub-file level deduplication technique breaks the file into smaller fixed or variable size blocks , and then uses a standard hash-based algorithm to find similar blocks . <h> Fixed-Length Blocks vs . Variable-Length Data Segments <p> A fixed-length block approach , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks and uses a simple checksum-based approach ( MD5/SHA etc. ) to find duplicates . Although its possible to look for repeated blocks , the approach provides very limited effectiveness . The reason is that the primary opportunity for data reduction is in finding duplicate blocks in two transmitted datasets that are made up mostly but not completely of the same data segments . <p> For example , similar data blocks may be present at different offsets in two different datasets . In other words , the block boundary of similar data may be different . This is very common when some bytes are inserted in a file , and when the changed file processes again and divides into fixed-length blocks , all blocks appear to have changed . <p> Therefore , two datasets with a small amount of difference are likely to have very few identical fixed length blocks . <p> Variable-Length Data Segment technology divides the data stream into variable-length data segments using a methodology that can find the same block boundaries in different locations and contexts . This allows the boundaries to " float " within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dataset have little or no impact on the boundaries in other locations of the dataset . <h> ROI Benefits <p> Each organization has a capacity to generate data . The extent of savings depends upon " but not directly proportional to " the number of applications or end users generating data . Overall the deduplication savings depend upon following parameters : <p> The number of applications or end users generating data <p> Total data <p> Daily change in data <p> Type of data ( email messages , documents , media , etc . ) <p> Backup policy ( weekly-full , daily-incremental , or daily-full ) <p> Retention period ( 90 days , 1 year , etc . ) <p> Deduplication technology in place <p> The actual benefits of deduplication are realized once the same dataset is processed multiple times over a span of time for weekly/daily backups . This is especially true for variable length data segment technology which has a much better capability for dealing with arbitrary byte insertions . <h> Numbers <p> The deduplication ratio increases everytime to pass the same complete data-set through the deduplication engine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is not widely used today , the ratios are close to 1:300 . Most vendors use this as a marketing jargon to attract customers , even though none of their customers could be doing daily full-backup . If compared against modern day incremental backups , our customer statistics show that , the results are between 1:4 to 1:50 for source based deduplication . <h> Jaspreet Singh <p> Jaspreet bootstrapped the company while defining the product , sales and marketing strategies that have resulted in Druva 's early and impressive success . Prior to founding Druva , Jaspreet was a member of the storage foundation group at Veritas . <p> Good post , Jaspreet . It is clear and neutral , but I 'm missing what is the technology used by inSync in each of the cases : Source or Target ? Inline or Post-Process ? File or Sub-File level ? Fixed size blocks or Variable length data segments ? <p> This helps it find those duplicate emails between large PST files . And the result is up to 90% bandwidth , storage savings . <p> Its one of the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post-process appoaches are only valid in case of target dedup . <p> Jaspreet <p> Laxman8 years ago <p> How is the block size determined when using variable block length ? Can you she 'd more light on the so called " Variable-Length Data Segment technology " ? Specifically , how is the block size determined ? Do you have any references ? Thanks . <p> The inline vs post-process discussion is not accurate . Most inline solutions ( both source and target ) use variable length segmentation . Inline solutions can also be content aware . <p> The numbers section is also inaccurate . Very high dedupe ratios ( e.g. , 500:1 ) are common but it really depends on what exactly you are measuring . For a good discussion , see the SNIA white paper titled " Understanding Data Deduplication Ratios " here : . <p> IMO , Inline always applied to target based dedup . But , point me to right sources if I am wrong . <p> Any deduped NAS/SAN device can-not control what data is flushed to it . The mounted file-system or storage driver flushes information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In such cases the variable data-segment algorithm ca n't be applied . <p> Yup , most vendors .. present twisted information . They compare ratios against daily full-backups which are rare in enterprises today . <p> Any deduped NAS/SAN device can-not control what data is flushed to it . The mounted file-system or storage driver flushes information which it may not make any sense to the device . In such cases the variable data-segment algorithm ca n't be applied . <p> We can not control when data is flushed to our device , but this does not mean that we can not inspect the structure of the file as it is being written an make intelligent choices about where to set boundaries . Data being written sequentially is generally flushed sequentially , and in the case of out-of-order writes from the block cache we are able to do reassembly in memory or make guesses about file structure based on previously seen landmarks in the file . In our experience , we nearly always get deduplication as good as post-processing the file after it has been written entirely , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to falling far behind in the data stream . <p> This is technically more complicated to implement than post-process , but it can and has been done . There is more information about our deduplication technologies , which we call Scalable Data Reduction , on our website at http : **35;559;TOOLONG . <p> I agree with Jered . All document are written in entirety and the filesystem cache also flushes out in a sequential fashion . In case of random overwrites , you may need to read-back and merge to reconstruct the block . For database files , fixed block sizes would perform better . In essence , inline variable sized chunking is possible .

It will also log an error message stating that the " Server is Busy , try again later . " <p> The inSync client attempts to synchronize every 10 minutes and it will have to wait to synchronize till a connection becomes available . <h> Effect on storage performance <p> Storage throughput is shared by concurrent connections . An excessive number of connections will lead to stress on the storage and impact performance , resulting in slow syncs . <h> What is backup retention policy ? How is it implemented ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , archival rules , data formats and the permissible means of storage , access and encryption , while weighing legal and privacy concerns against economics and ' need to know ' concerns . <h> inSync Retention Policy <p> An administrator can set a policy on the inSync server to store N number of daily , weekly or monthly restore points or snapshots for each user . <p> inSync uses the GFS ( GrandfatherFatherSon ) retention method for maintaining hierarchical restore points . The GFS method describes a rotation scheme whereby a daily backup ( the son ) , a weekly backup ( the father ) and a monthly backup ( the grandfather ) are created to maintain a hierarchical backup strategy . <p> Each week , one full daily backup ( latest from that week ) is promoted from a son to a father and is deemed the weekly backup . Each month , a father ( latest from that month ) is promoted to a grandfather and is deemed the monthly backup . For the GFS policy to work you will need a successful sync every day . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following retention policy : <p> Keep all backups for - 8 days <p> Keep weekly backups for - 5 weeks <p> Keep monthly backups for - 2 months <p> In the above scenario , say a user 's device has been backed up successfully for 8 consecutive days . Here the total number of restore points created will be 8 . On the 9th day , the restore point created on the first day will get deleted . This is irrespective of whether syncs are completed within the span of those 8 days . This means that even if the users device is not synced for a day or two , these days would be taken into consideration when deleting a restore point . <p> However , the next segments ( weeks and months ) take care of such Missed Sync cases . <p> Moving to weeks , the last successful sync which took place in a weeks duration ( latest restore point of that week ) will be made available for restore . For 5 weeks ( as defined in the policy above ) , one restore point per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 5 restore points will be available ) . <p> The above also holds true for months , where the last successful sync in a month will get stored . Here a total of 2 restore points will be generated ( for 2 months ) . <p> Also , for any configuration of the restore points , the last successful restore point is always available and it can not be deleted . Older restore points will be removed as per retention policy defined ; however , for each user the most recent restore point will be retained , and will not be removed no matter what retention policy is set . This will make sure that at least one restore point is available for a user . <h> Encryption and access to restored data <p> All backed up/stored data is encrypted using 256-bit AES encryption and can be accessed only using inSync restore methods ( available on server and authenticated clients ) . <p> Data can not be browsed or decrypted using any method other than inSync restore options . <h> How to adjust or control a client 's CPU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority and usage for the backup process on each client . If it is set between 5 to 10 , the inSync client backup will be prioritized compared to other active applications . If the CPU priority is set below 5 , the inSync backup will be slowed down to reduce CPU consumption . <p> If the Allow users to modify resource settings is checked , the user will be able to adjust the CPU usage from the client side , by clicking to inSync GUI icon from the system tray and then clicking Preferences --&gt; Backup Resources and moving the slider bar as needed . The setting on the client will take precedence over that on the Server . <p> It is recommended to set priority at least at 4 for incremental backups . <h> Server Anti-Virus Configuration <p> It is very important to exclude all the inSync directories from live anti-virus scan/on access scan . Most of the anti-virus software lock the frequently accessed files to scan them , which may cause database corruption . <p> When data is uploaded to data folder , inSync stores references for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks these database files , the inSync server may not be able to update database files and it can lose some of the references .

With NBD transport , large virtual disks can take a long time to transmit as the data is transferred over the network to the backup proxy . <h> NBDSSL <p> NBDSSL is similar to NBD transport mode , but uses SSL to encrypt all data passed over the TCP connection . <h> HotAdd <p> This mode takes advantage of the SCSI Hot-Add capability of the ESX/ESXi server to mount the VMDKs of a Virtual Machine , which are being backed up to the backup proxy . The data is read directly from the mounted disks directly for the backup . Backups using the HotAdd mode are faster compared to NBD or NBDSSL as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the storage to the backup proxy . <h> Pre-requisites <p> For this transport mode to work correctly following are the pre-requisites : <p> The datastore on which the backup proxy is created must be formatted with the right block size to be able to mount the largest virtual disk of the hot added virtual machines . The block size limitations vary across VMFS , VMFS-2 , VMFS-3 and VMFS-5 for a given virtual disk size .

It matters to customers , who rely on your compliance certifications , assessments , and audits to make their purchasing decisions . It matters to regulators , who set the requirement for doing business and ultimately perform the audits . And it matters to you , to verify that all of your ducks are in a row and you 're protected against costly regulatory fines and dangerous breaches that will result in a damaged reputation for your organization . <p> As the best software tools shift to the cloud , many businesses are afraid to take full advantage of them . Maintaining security and compliance standards on systems that reside outside their control can be daunting . Or , worse , managers may assume that because the services and data live off of their premises , what they do n't know ca n't hurt them . TechBeacon recently published a great overview of critical challenges in cloud-first security compliance that I put together , and as a Chief Trust Officer , I 've seen these scenarios play out across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are great benefits to adopting cloud-first services , and a cloud-first security approach is critical to maintaining the security and compliance needed to be able to enjoy those benefits . <p> What are the security risks of cloud apps ? Cloud applications can be accessed anytime , anywhere . Designed for collaboration , they 're flexible and adaptable to your teams ' needs . They have low infrastructure and maintenance costs , and are often quick and inexpensive to adopt and operate . In many cases , they 're simply the best solutions of their kind , offering better solutions and more frequent updates than their locally installed competitors . <p> But that does n't mean they 're without risks . These cloud-based apps carry many of the same risks as locally-installed applications , with some unique risks of their own . <p> Security is difficult to assess and manage across platforms . Security controls for cloud applications are spread across people , processes , technology , and even multiple companies : you , your vendor , and any vendors they use to deliver their applications . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controls . <p> Reputation is always at stake . A security breach or negative compliance finding can be disastrous to your reputation . Lack of consumer confidence brings losses in sales and a hit to your stock price . Negative media attention calls future products and services into question , and social media accelerates the damage . Consumers wo n't care whether the breach originated within your business or with a third-party cloud service <p> You may not be fully covered in court . A negative compliance finding can result in punitive , financial , or even criminal sanctions in some industries . True legal compliance also includes the ability to respond to government inquiries such as subpoenas or discovery requests in lawsuits " no matter where the data originated " or face court penalties or lost lawsuits . <p> Threats are relentless and ever-evolving . Growing threats include data theft , malware , corruption , and ransomware . Edge systems on networks outside of your control are particularly vulnerable . Ransomware could take down your entire business for hours or days . Without a data protection solution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your data is restored . <p> Old data protection models are outdatedData does n't just live in a datacenter anymore . It 's dispersed on laptops and mobile devices , across local and cloud-based applications . Seeing a single , centralized view of your data can seem impossible . On top of that , piecemeal operational processes " processes that vary depending on the department , app , or device " slow your organization down and make it difficult to enforce security and respond to audit requests . <p> On the other hand , it 's not safe to leave responsibility for your data security to the cloud service provider . If your vendor does offer advanced security features , it 's up to you to implement those features and maintain the on-premises security policies that regulations require . <p> Fourth-Party Risk AssessmentNot only is responsibility shared between you and your SaaS vendor , fourth parties have to be taken into account as well . Think of the service providers that your providers use for service delivery , like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure . Fortunately , compliance audits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to data security requires looking at security frameworks , audits , and attestations for the entire service chain , not just your on-premises solutions or your direct vendors . <p> Clearly , there 's a lot at risk when you adopt cloud services . To take advantage of the great benefits those apps have to offer , you need a new approach to data protection . The traditional models just are n't up to the task . <p> The modern approach to data protectionA great data security solution will protect your data no matter where it resides . These are some critical questions to ask when evaluating options to ensure that the solution truly covers every aspect of your data security needs : <p> Does it offer continuous monitoring ? You need full visibility into the attack surface of your organization . The monitoring approach should be data-centric , rather than application-centric so that you 're covered no matter where the data lives . Monitoring should anticipate risks before they become problems , whether they originate on an endpoint or in the cloud . <p> How secure is the data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at-rest . Does the provider offer unique encryption keys for your organization ? Do they have access to your data ( making it vulnerable if their organization is ever attacked ) ? <p> How is data preserved and maintained ? You need tools to respond to audits and legal inquiries .

@@77780965 @6480965/ <h> Unusual data activity <p> The suspicious data modification on a device is called unusual data activity . A user or a malicious software can modify data in a suspicious manner on a device . For example , if a device in your organization is under attack , typically , the malicious software on the device starts changing data on the device . When a potential threat changes data on a device , it is suspicious in nature and is unlike how the device owner works with data on the device . inSync provides reports that can help you identify devices exhibiting unusual data activity such as : <p> Large number of files deleted <p> Large number of files added <p> Unwarranted modification of files <p> Suspicious encryption of files ( inSync checks if a minimum of 100 files are encrypted ) <p> Since anomalies of this type often indicate issues that require attention , inSync flags such devices in the Unusual Data Activity Report . Being notified about devices showing unusual data activity can help you identify a potential threat in your environment such as a ransomware attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details page ( top menu &gt; Data Sources &gt; Devices &gt; click on the device under the Devices List ) , you can see data activity trends for the device . The Data Activity Trend tab in the device details displays a chart about the updates in each snapshot . <p> If a snapshot exhibits anomalous behavior , it is flagged in the chart and you can click it to launch the Restore Data window . You can click on any snapshot . <p> Note : The Data Activity Trend tab is not available for CloudApps , however , inSync provides Unusual Data Activity Reports for CloudApps such as Box , GDrive , and OneDrive. inSync does not support Unusual Data Activity identification from : <p> Exchange Online , GMail , and MAPI <p> System app settings <p> Data backed up from mobile devices <p> In addition to the report , inSync also generates an Unusual Data Activity alert and admins receive an email that indicates unusual data activity . inSync monitors data trend for a given device , and after a sufficient sample size ( defaults to 33 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 33 backup jobs , around 40 files reside in the configured folder on a particular device , and close to 5 files are modified , added , or deleted . Suddenly , for the 34th , 35th , and 36th jobs , 20 files are deleted from the device . In such a case , inSync flags it as anomalous behavior and lists the device in the Unusual Data Activity Report . Administrators can take action based on the security policies of the organization to identify and isolate a possible threat , and prevent additional losses . <p> Note : This example is for understanding purpose only . In the background , inSync executes complex algorithms that use multiple parameters to detect unusual data activity . <p> Remember : <p> inSync detects anomaly only after the backup job is complete and a snapshot is created . For incomplete backup jobs , or interrupted backup jobs , inSync can not detect an anomaly . <p> You can see information getting added in the trend after the feature is enabled for your account . As soon as a snapshot is created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the trend . For example , if fifteen snapshots are created after the feature is enabled for your account , the trend shows information for the fifteen snapshots . <p> The Data Activity Trend can show information for the last hundred snapshots . For example , hundred snapshots are created for a device after the feature is enabled . Information for each snapshot from the first through hundredth snapshot is added one-by-one in the trend . When the hundred and first ( 101st ) snapshot is created , the chart shows information from second snapshot through the hundred and first ( 101st ) snapshot . You can not see information from the first snapshot in the chart . <p> There are possible scenarios when inSync does not detect anomalous behavior . For example , if an attack is slow , such as five files removed per day , inSync may not flag it as unusual data activity . <p> If you change inclusion-exclusion filters from profile , inSync clears data activity trend for the devices in the profile . inSync builds fresh data activity trend for the next 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@77780974 @6480974/ <h> 6 Steps You Should Be Taking to Prevent Ransomware <h> Share <p> With ransomware attacks on the rise , many organizations today are feeling helpless and unsure of how to reduce their vulnerability . The solution , though , is surprisingly clear . A successful defense against ransomware and other incidents of malware is as simple as implementing an effective backup- plan . <p> Ransomware is having a good year . CNN recently reported that ransomware events have collected $209 million in Q1 2016 , and are on pace to collect $1 Billion in 2016 . This leaves companies of all sizes asking how to successfully defend against a ransomware attack . At Druva , we offer our own advice which will go a long way towards improving the security posture of your company and make you much more resilient when faced with today 's inevitability of attack . <p> While it may seem basic , experts agree that a solid backup plan is still the best prescription for addressing the threat of ransomware . <p> But what exactly does implementing a backup planreally mean , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the front lines of our data protection experts , are the six proactive steps we recommend for keeping your data safe : <p> Protect Distributed Data <p> An enterprise-grade automated backup solution acts as insurance policy in case of an intrusion such as a ransomware strike . Regular backups across devices and desktops in your organization provide a secondary store of data " stored off-site , no less " as a fallback mechanism in the event of a malicious attack . <p> If you do n't already have a backup solution in place , this step alone offers not only backup and peace of mind , but further business benefit in terms of information governance . Make sure , though , to select a cloud-based backup solution as it provides off-site storage for additional peace of mind when your on-premise data is at risk . Offsite storage that leverages any of the AWS or Azure storage locations not only provides off-site capabilities , but also complies with local data residency laws by storing it in the same region . <p> Are teams distributed across regions ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by your backup policy ? Does your current backup plan ensure that 100% of your user base is covered " however you define that base " to reduce exposure of employee data ? Review and validate the deployment scope of your current backup plan to ensure that your chosen backup solution is deployed automatically to all end users who need to be protected . At a minimum , you should ensure that key users ( Executive Management , Faculty , etc. ) are covered by your data protection policy . <p> Tip : Reduce your exposure to potential data loss in the event of a ransomware attack or other catastrophic event by reviewing and validating who in your organization is covered by backup . <p> Review the scope of your data backup <p> What are you backing up ? You 're probably protecting desktops and email , but what about other locations where users can store data ? <p> We highly recommend that you review , validate , and , if needed , modify backup content ( as defined in your backup policy ) to ensure that all important data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require you to expand your scope to add custom folders where users can store data . <p> You may also allow users to self-select the data that is backed up by enabling inSync 's Allow users to add folders feature . This can be extremely useful in ensuring that all important data is protected . By implementing the " allow users to add folders " feature , users can easily add folders through its intuitive design within seconds to ensure all their data is successfully backed up . <p> Tip : Review the types of backup happening today and consider creating custom folders in users ' profiles , to back up other types of content and reduce the potential impact of data loss . This gives users the flexibility to add more folders so that more data is captured for a comprehensive plan . <p> Check backup frequency across distributed teams <p> How often are you backing up ? Every 2 days ? 8 hours ? 4 hours ? Do you need an even more aggressive schedule for executives ? Review , validate and , if needed , modify backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure automated , periodic backup for all protected users . As a general rule , we recommend you backup at minimum once every 4 hours , and every 2 hours for key users . <p> Tip : For " mission critical data " or highly sensitive information , apply a different backup frequency based on specific user's/groups requirements . <p> Validate- your retention policy <p> How long are you keeping your backups ? 14 days ? 7 weeks ? 6 months ? Review , validate and , if needed , modify the retention policy ( as defined in your backup policy ) to ensure a sufficientRecovery Point Objective ( RPO ) . This may vary depending on your particular industry and regulations , and internal IT policies " IT , Legal , and Compliance teams " will make the call on data retention needs . Rest assured that no matter what length you choose , Druva offers unlimited retention for organizations in need of this option . <p> Tip : Consider applying a longer retention policy to meet internal objectives , especially for key people and departments . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company , we can retain all of it and protect it . <p> Re-Assess policies periodically <p> While the preceding measures might provide sufficient protection for the foreseeable future , we highly recommend that you revisit your backup policies on a periodic basis ( approximately once every six months ) to ensure that they are aligned with your organizations requirements . IT often has the primary responsibility for this routine , and in some cases acts in coordination with the Legal team . <p> Following these steps will ensure that you have a rock-solid backup routine in place . In the case that a network or end user is compromised , your team will be less vulnerable and less likely to be forced to meet an attacker 's onerous demands " as happens all too often today . Instead , you can take a defensive posture and quickly restore data from time-indexed copies . Without these steps , even with a plan in place , you may still have gaps in your backup execution , leading to significant and costly data loss and business downtime . <p> Ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data protection solution ?

@@77780975 @6480975/ <h> Overview <p> This topic explains how to define the frequency of scheduled backups and time period between when the scheduled backups will be triggered from the user devices . <h> Configuring backup schedules for computers <h> Defining the backup interval <p> Note : This feature can only be controlled through profiles . Any change to an existing profile is applicable for all users of that profile . <h> About backup interval <p> You can define the time interval between two consecutive backups triggered automatically from user devices . For example , if you define backup interval to be 4 hours , backup will be triggered from a user device 4 hours after the completion of the previous backup . The device must be switched on and connected to inSync server ( through LAN or WAN ) for the backup to happen . In case the device is not connected to inSync server , backups will be triggered at the first possible opportunity after the interval is over . <h> Defining backup interval <p> To define the backup interval <p> On the menu bar , click Manage &gt; Profiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Click the Laptop Backup Schedule tab . <p> Under Laptop Backup Schedule , click Edit .

Any change to an existing profile is applicable for all users of that profile . <h> About backup schedule <p> Backup schedule defines the time period between which backups can happen , or not happen , from user devices . There are two types of backup schedule : <p> Trigger backup schedule - The trigger backup schedule defines the time period between which backups can be automatically triggered from user devices .

If backup from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will wait till 8:00 AM next day . Any backup triggered during the trigger backup schedule period will be completed even if it means continuing past the end time . For example , any backup triggered before 6:00 PM do not stop just because 6:00 PM is the end time for trigger backup schedule . <p> Never backup schedule - The never backup schedule defines the time period between which backups can never happen from user devices .

@@77780978 @6480978/ <h> What Does CIA Have to Do with the CISO ? <h> Share <p> In the good old days , CISOs maintained a broad view of their security posture . If they paid special attention to any one area , it was to the processes and tools protecting the confidentiality of their data : preventative and detective security processes , and tools such as firewalls , anti-virus , anti-malware , intrusion detection/prevention , and monitoring solutions . These helped to ensure that sensitive data such as personally-identifiable information , health information , card payment data , and proprietary information stayed within the four walls of the organization . <p> Malicious users also had a different focus in those days . Their goal was breaching the environment through conventional approaches in order to exfiltrate data for glory , competitive advantage , or profit . Traditional security measures , though , along with a comprehensive set of policies and best practices , were typically enough to avoid most of the security-related events of the day and keep the bad guys at bay . <p> Sadly , times have changed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to simply protecting the confidentiality of data . With the proliferation of cyber-attacks aimed at circumventing and compromising the integrity and availability of data , todays CISO must evaluate and implement ways to protect all three areas of the CIA triad : Confidentiality , Integrity , and Availability . The problem ? The bad guys know this , and are adjusting their approach to match " at an alarming rate . <p> In addition to implementing security controls to manage risk associated with the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information , immediate consideration should be given to how the integrity and availability of information can be maintained ; not only for data within the organization , but also backups , mobile workforce data , and data stored in the cloud . CISOs must consider an integrated approach that incorporates confidentiality , integrity , and availability , and is seamless and integral to how the organization operates . This approach should be constructed so that security controls are layered and complementary while not leaving any gaps . <p> Even the U.S. government recognizes this as a major concern , as witnessed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ransomware . However , attacks like ransomware do n't play by traditional hacker rules . The new breed of cyber-criminal is looking for a quick payoff , and holding an organizations data hostage has proven to be an effective way of making that a reality . In order to mitigate this risk , organizations must not only implement traditional security controls such as user awareness and training , but also employ contingency planning to ensure that compromised data or systems can be restored quickly . Remember , ransomware attackers ' only leverage is that they have the key to encrypted data that an organization needs in order to operate . Thus , having a secured , tested , and reliable source of backup data is the key to NOT being held hostage by ransomware . <p> This security control , though , like many others in the information security world , is only effective if it is implemented in a timely manner , i.e. , before an incident occurs . This underscores the urgency of re-evaluating how security controls are working together within the organization and doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reevaluate security controls . <p> So how can an organization integrate all three aspects of the CIA triad into a model that offers a trusted , reliable , and secure retention and recovery solution built for todays threats ? <p> The extensive backup and governance capabilities of Druva inSync provide the ideal approach for today 's concerned CISO. inSync is the industry 's first complete data protection package , offering a converged platform for ensuring the confidentiality , integrity , and availability of your sensitive business data . inSync enables organizations to reclaim control over their critical business data wherever it resides , and to : <h> Sese Bennett <p> Sese Bennett is a Senior Manager with LBMC Information Security , LLC .

@@77780987 @6480987/ <p> To register your virtual machines , you have to deploy the Phoenix backup proxy in your infrastructure that registers your server and detects all virtual machines on the server . The Phoenix backup proxy is described below . <h> What is a Phoenix backup proxy ? <p> Backup proxy is a client-side component which is installed on each VMware ESXi Hypervisor or ESXi Host , managed through vCenter Server that manages your virtual machines . <p> Backup proxy contains Phoenix agent , the component that performs backup and restore of virtual machines . Phoenix Cloud , server component installed in the Phoenix cloud , assigns backup proxy to storage within the Phoenix Cloud . Backup proxy performs backup of virtual machines by creating snapshots of these virtual machines , and sends the backed up data to the assigned storage within Phoenix Cloud . Because backups are performed at an image level on the ESXi host , the need to deploy an instance of backup proxy for each virtual machine is eliminated . <p> After installing backup proxy , you must register it with Phoenix for backing up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can deploy multiple number of backup proxies depending on the number of virtual machines that you want to backup .

For more information on how to calculate the required number of backup proxies in your environment , see Sizing for backup proxy . <h> How does backup proxy work ? <p> This diagram illustrates how backup proxy backs up your VMware setup . <p> To get started , deploy backup proxy for your VMware setup . If you deploy backup proxy in a vCenter controlled environment and register it with vCenter credentials , the backup proxy will perform the backup of all virtual machines across hypervisors that are associated with the vCenter Server .

Backup proxy performs a backup of virtual machines by creating snapshots of these virtual machines . and sending these snapshots to the assigned storage within Phoenix Cloud . Because backups are performed at an image level , the need to deploy an instance of backup proxy for each virtual machine is eliminated . <p> Backup proxy uses the vStorage APIs for Data Protection ( VADP ) to perform backups .

A single deployment of a backup proxy can be mapped to a single instance of ESXi hypervisor or a vCenter Server , but not both . <p> After you deploy backup proxy for an ESXi hypervisor or vCenter server , you must configure it to reflect the credentials of this hypervisor or vCenter Server . <h> About backup proxy deployment <p> Vastness of your virtual infrastructure If your organization is geographically distributed and you have deployed virtual machines with multiple backup servers installed across different locations , then you must consider the ease of administration and plan deployment of backup proxy appropriately . <p> Ease of administration <p> If you choose to deploy backup proxy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on each vCenter Server in your infrastructure .

( Refer to Understanding RPO and RTO for a discussion on RPO . ) <p> Backup slots : Traditional backup processes are resource heavy . Also , the server appplication needs to be quisced to get a consistent backup image . This implies that the regular server activity can not continue during backup .

The increase in the number of business hours also puts additional pressure on the backup slots . <p> User interface : Traditional backup interface is complex due to the concepts of full/incremental backups and schedules . Due to the user interface complexity , it becomes harder to let the end user control the backup process . Typically , the administrator configures the backup for end users desktops and laptops . The configuration remains static and can not easily adapt to dynamic data layout . Instead , the end user is asked to arrange his or her data to suit the backup configuration . <p> Backup media : Traditional backup is performed on media like magnetic tapes or optical disks . Complete automation ( using robotic media libraries ) of the backup process is too costly . In absence of an automated process , an administrative attention is required to manage the backup media . Maintaining the backup media also requires administrative effort . The restore operation also requires administrative attention because the right backup media needs to be loaded . <p> Special hardware : Tradional backup is performed using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives . Special hardware means additional procurement and maintenance cost . <p> Restore operation : With traditional backup , an- end user can not restore her files by herself .

@@77781006 @6481006/ <h> Why Druva Moved Away From Cassandra <h> Share <p> A few months back , we migrated from Cassandra to AWS DynamoDB as the noSQL database powering our inSync Cloud service . The move was a hard decision due to the risk and effort involved , but we had some compelling reasons to do so . <p> Disclaimer : Our experiences are with Cassandra 0.8. x . Cassandra improved on quite a few areas in 1.0 and some of the following issues may have been addressed in 1.0 . <h> Data model misfit <p> First and foremost , Cassandra did not fit our data model well . A majority of inSyncs index entries falls in two buckets : <p> File offset to data block mapping ( type A records ) <p> Block checksum to data block mapping ( type B records ) <p> Each Type A record represents a file with potentially millions of columns . On the other hand , there are billions of Type B records with a small number of columns . <p> In our case , we found that Cassandra could efficiently handle millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , Cassandra did not perform well with millions of columns in a row ( Type A records ) and neither did it perform well with billions of small sized rows ( Type B records ) . To use Cassandra efficiently , we were therefore forced to break huge rows and also combine smaller rows . <h> Read performance <p> inSync shows a sequential access pattern for Type A records . For Type B records , only a fraction is hot and the rest is very infrequently accessed . Due to these access characteristics , we expect to operate with cache sizes much smaller than the database size . <p> We found that Cassandra tends to sacrifice read performance in order to improve write performance . Because of the log structured design of Cassandra , a single row is spread across multiple sstables . Reading one row requires reading pieces from multiple sstables . As a result , Type A access does not remain a pure sequential access . <p> Cassandra also relies on OS page cache for caching the index entries , primarily because JVM can not handle large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caching a bunch of cold Type B records along with one hot Type B record that happened to sit on the same OS page . In other words , the cache was filled with cold records resulting in a poor cache hit ratio and lot of read load on the disks . <h> Maintenance overheads <p> A lot has been written on this topic and we also witnessed that it takes a dedicated team to maintain a Cassandra cluster . <p> The regular maintenance tasks , particularly repair , is not automated . We had to fire a regular repair operation and then monitor it because if the operations failed for some reason , it would not restart on its own and never resume from the last point . And this process had to be done for each node in the cluster .

Yet these messages are also one of the more difficult types of data to backup . Let 's look at the challenges in backing up this type of data and then discuss how inSync does it . <p> - Microsoft Outlook is one of the most widely used email clients . Outlook stores email messages in files known as PST files . Most of us have PST files that are a few GB in size , and it is n't uncommon for them to be in the tens of GB . Traditional backup software , which simply identifies and stores these files , has the following limitations : <p> Slow , resource-intensive backups : Before an incremental backup , any changes in our email since the last backup have to be identified . Because Outlook stores our messages in big PST files , it takes a lot of resources to identify any changes . <p> Poor deduplication accuracy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message , lead to multiple changes in a PST file . This creates more data that must be backed up , leading to bigger backups . <p> Locked file issues : Outlook prevents other applications from accessing PST files while it runs , which is problematic since most of us usually leave Outlook running . <p> inSync differs from traditional enterprise backup software because it deals with individual email messages , rather than PST files . It relies on Messaging Application Programming Interface ( MAPI ) and queries specific attributes of messages in mailbox . These attributes are compared with a local reference and any new or changed messages are identified . New messages are backed up , as well as any attachments . <p> Using global deduplication means inSync backs up only a single copy of a message that may appear in the mailboxes of multiple users . <p> Deduplicating email attachments as well as messages means that if an attachment is the same as a file in a folder outside of email , only a single copy is saved . <p> Restoring email data is easier for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need instead of an entire PST file . <p> Accessing email messages directly avoids the issue of being unable to access locked PST files and creates more consistent backups . <p> Beyond improving the backup process for email messages , this type of approach could make other email-related improvements possible . These could include the ability to restore individual messages , as well as e-Discovery capabilities for insight into message content . By making email data more manageable , MAPI offers possibilities for how that data can be used . <h> Anand Apte <p> Anand has over 12 years of experience in product development .

@@77781018 @6481018/ <h> The Cloud As A Path To Infrastructure Resiliency <h> Share <p> Cyber security and IT risks are attracting more attention from business leaders " PwC 's CEO survey released in- January 2016- found that 74 per cent of CEOs rated security as one of the top three challenges that could affect the success of their businesses over the next year. - However , this risk is often not reflected in how businesses assign and manage their data protection plans over time . <p> Using public cloud services for disaster recovery ( DR ) and data protection can provide an agile way to solve some of these challenges . As many global companies have new European legislation compliance issues to consider alongside increased risk to IT , making data protection easier is a management requirement . At the same time , use of cloud solutions can help to save significant costs too through smarter management of data over time . <h> Getting DR ready for a converged approach <p> In the world of business continuity and DR , it can be difficult to know where to start the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those approaches and technologies used to prevent IT issues from taking down a service , while DR involves similar processes and IT solutions used to return systems to normal as quickly as possible . Alongside both continuity and DR projects , companies will also have to implement archiving for their data and records in order to meet compliance and DR needs as well . <p> All these different strands have to be applied to the existing IT resources that support business applications . What results from this is a Spaghetti Junction of tools , processes and platforms used to protect data ; at best , there is a lot of overlap where data sets are protected using multiple tools , additional infrastructure and adding further expense to the storage bill . At worst , this drives up cost while also leaving islands of data underprotected against the risk of failure . <p> Consolidating DR strategies is therefore a good approach , not just to help IT leadership in their endeavours in managing data resiliency , but also to reduce costs associated with data protection too . By removing unnecessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management overheads while also looking to reduce potential risk . <p> Public cloud now offers a worthy option for DR planning . From the initial suspicion that greeted cloud deployments when they launched around five years ago , today public cloud services are perceived as more secure and more trusted than internal IT , according to research by Gartner . The fact that companies like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure depend on their security and availability to stay in business is not lost on IT professionals , while the ability to improve recovery and reduce costs can be attractive too when budgets are tight . <p> However , the biggest attraction here is the potential to automate DR and data protection processes so that information can be copied and made secure more efficiently . Rather than running multiple tools to cover data backup , disaster recovery and archival , these services can be consolidated by using a single secondary copy of the data . This not only reduces costs and improves efficiencies , but potentially improves the ability to recover data faster . <h> Managing hot , warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how data is managed across its lifecycle , as well as how it is managed from initial creation through to long-term storage and archival . Data can be divided into three overall categories : <p> Hot data- " this describes data that has been newly created across the business . Hot data includes everything from the most recent files that individuals have been working on through to central application data . This hot data covers the last thirty days of activities , and can be cached locally . In the event of a failure , this information will be what the business needs recovered fastest . <p> Warm data- " this covers data that is still fairly recent , but is less essential than hot data . Typically , warm data covers files and application data created more than thirty days ago but is less than ninety days old . In traditional DR planning terms , data in this category will be necessary for recovery after a disaster but would have an acceptable recovery time objective that is longer than the hot data . <p> Cold data- " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While this information is still necessary for the business to store , it is not referenced regularly . In the event of a file or record being required , restore time can be slow . <p> In the course of normal operations , data should flow smoothly from hot to warm , and from warm to cold states . Automating this process can help reduce the costs involved in data management for recovery purposes . <p> Alongside this , it is worth thinking about how recovery operations can be run in the public cloud . For example , AWS offers a service called Virtual Private Cloud ( VPC ) that is specifically associated with a customer 's account . Using their own VPC , companies can use AWS resources as an extension of their own internal IT network . Using this platform , companies can shift their DR workloads over to AWS and run operations in the cloud as required allowing them to maintain complete security of their data . <p> This approach can help when companies are considering the value of traditional DR implementations , which typically rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public cloud , companies can cut their facilities spend and use already established services as they are required . <p> For companies that have compliance requirements around their data to consider , public cloud services have developed to provide management control over locations where data may be stored . This expansion of services " coupled with dedicated locations in areas with stricter local data privacy rules such as Germany " means that companies can centrally administer global operations while adhering to local regulations through the public cloud 's geographically dispersed data regions . <p> As companies seek to streamline their data protection requirements , taking a converged approach can help to improve service back to the business . Simplifying DR and data protection does not mean ignoring the specific needs of data archiving " or worse still , thinking that implementing data backup is good enough to cover all use cases " instead , it is about bringing together multiple uses of that data for recovery into one overall process . <p> By using the public cloud to automate and manage operations for data protection , company IT teams can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Jaspreet Singh <p> Jaspreet bootstrapped the company while defining the product , sales and marketing strategies that have resulted in Druva 's early and impressive success .

This can ensure that the eDiscovery process happens faster , with better collaboration . Would n't that be nice ? <p> To many organizations , eDiscovery is a new endeavor . But that does n't mean it 's new to every enterprise , and quite a few issues around bound to come up in any interaction between IT and the Legal department . Endpoints become even more critical during eDiscovery given that 28% of corporate data resides exclusively on endpoints . <p> In such a scenario , the standard questions that Legal has for IT teams during discovery of data include : <p> Where is the backed-up data stored ? What are our retention and archival policies ? <p> How is the company currently backing up the data stored on laptops , desktops , and mobile devices ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , iOS , Android , Linux , etc. " are in use ? <p> If you have the answers ready for your colleagues in the Legal department , it can save time for everyone concerned .

Legal teams have early insight into the custodians involved in a litigation but lack understanding of the business ' data assets . Knowing that key information assets are being backed up is of immense help to Legal in the initial phases of eDiscovery . Since Identification and Collection are the first critical steps in ensuring a cost-efficient eDiscovery , this information can help Legal get a better handle on the relevant data that needs to be included in the legal hold . IT can get Legal 's inputs on the data that should be mandatorily backed-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the software IT uses to manage data . This helps both teams plan how to cope during litigations and investigations . There are multiple data sources , commonly referred to as Electronically Stored Information ( ESI ) , such as endpoints , network shares , file servers , cloud-based data sources ( such as Google apps and social media websites ) that could be of relevance in an eDiscovery . The IT department is the only team with complete knowledge of the software in place to manage these data sources , as well as the applications ' capabilities to enable eDiscovery . If you know what you have , and how it can aid in the effort , by all means tell Legal what 's available and what is n't . <p> Look for opportunities for IT to identify and collect data that can facilitate repeatable collections and reduce spoilage risk . Data protection software with an automated collection workflow can significantly reduce cost and decrease the burden on both IT and Legal teams . Traditionally , data collection is among the most time-consuming and labor-intensive eDiscovery tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complexity of the data itself , IT may often be tempted to conduct manual collections without awareness of the risks associated with such an approach . <p> Involve Legal early in the process while evaluating data-protection software that enables- eDiscovery .

Why not make sure the software serves everyone 's needs ? Having IT and Legal as the decision makers to agree on eDiscovery software goes a long way in arming the respective teams with the right tools to handle discovery requests faster . <p> Choose software that helps Legal do its own data retrieval . The timelines associated with eDiscovery requests from Legal are often stringent ; IT teams can often find themselves struggling with time to address such requests .

Which types of applications run better , what breaks , and what do you need to completely redesign to take advantage of the storage technology ? <p> Ultimately every IT admin wants to know if object storage is a good fit for certain workloads . In this article , we define object storage , compare it to alternatives , and give an overview of where it can make a performance difference for enterprise computing . <h> What is object storage ? <p> Object storage ( also referred to as object-based storage ) is a general term that refers to the way in which we organize and work with units of storage , called objects .

This way , it 's possible to find the data without having to know the physical location of the data ( which could exist within different parts of a data center or different parts of the world ) . <h> How block storage and object storage differ <p> With block storage , files are split into evenly sized blocks of data , each with its own address but with no additional information ( metadata ) to provide more context for what that block of data is .

Metadata can include anything from the security classification of the file within the object to the importance of the application associated with the information . Anyone who 's stored a picture on Facebook or a song on Spotify has used object storage even if they do n't know it . In the enterprise data center , object storage is used for these same types of storage needs , where the data needs to be highly available and highly durable . <p> However , object storage generally does n't provide you with the ability to incrementally edit one part of a file ( as block storage does ) . Objects have to be manipulated as a whole unit , requiring the entire object to be accessed , updated , then re-written in their entirety . That can have performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be directly accessed by the operating system as a mounted drive volume , while object storage can not do so without significant degradation to performance . The tradeoff here is that , with object storage , the storage management overhead of block storage ( such as remapping volumes ) is relatively nonexistent . <h> What problems does object storage solve ? <p> Object storage is ideal for solving the increasing problems of data growth . As more and more data is generated , storage systems have to grow at the same pace . What happens when you try to expand a block-based storage system beyond a hundred terabytes or beyond multiple petabytes ? You may run into durability issues , hard limitations with the storage infrastructure that you currently have , or your management overhead may go through the roof . <p> Solving the provisioning management issues presented by the expansion of storage at this scale is where object storage shines . Items such as static Web content , data backup , and archives are fantastic use cases . Object-based storage architectures can be scaled out and managed simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the data , in combination with its expandable metadata functionality , facilitate this ease of use . <p> Another advantage to object storage its responsiveness to the need for resiliency while mitigating costs . Objects remain protected by storing multiple copies of data over a distributed system ; if one or more nodes fail , the data can still be made available , in most cases , without the application or the end user ever being impacted . ( Downtime ? What downtime ? ) In most cases , at least three copies of every file are stored . This addresses common issues including drive failures , bit-rot , server and failures , and power outages . This distributed storage design for high availability allows less-expensive commodity hardware to be used because the data protection is built into the object architecture . <h> What about the tradeoffs ? <p> Object storage has the potential to provide IT departments a great deal of value . It can save money in infrastructure costs by allowing the organization to use less-expensive hardware , it can reduce management time through ease of scalability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of storage needs . <p> But , as exciting as it sounds , object storage is not the answer to all your storage problems . Sometimes , block storage is a far better fit . There are use cases where object storage performs beautifully , scales out seamlessly , and solves all sorts of management headaches , but in other situations it outright fails to meet the needs of your application . <p> You have to decide which type of architectural approach is appropriate for your needs , as you balance the requirements for a scalable storage solution that provides resilience and performance . The primary issues are eventual consistency or strong consistency . Object storage systems are eventually consistent while block storage systems are strongly consistent . <p> Eventual consistency can provide virtually unlimited scalability . It ensures high availability for data that needs to be durably stored but is relatively static and will not change much , if at all . This is why storing photos , video , and other unstructured data is an ideal use case for object storage systems ; it does not need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is no guarantee that a read request returns the most recent version of the data . <p> Strong consistency is needed for real-time systems such as transactional databases that are constantly being written to , but provide limited scalability and reduced availability as a result of hardware failures . Scalability becomes even more difficult within a geographically distributed system . Strong consistency is a requirement , however , whenever a read request must return the most updated version of the data . <h> Workloads for object versus block storage <p> Object storage works very well for unstructured data sets where data is generally read but not written-to . Static Web content , data backups and archival images , and multimedia ( videos , pictures , or music ) files are best stored as objects . Databases in an object storage environment ideally have data sets that are unstructured , where the use cases suggests the data will not require a large number of writes or incremental updates . <p> Geographically distributed back-end storage is another great use case for object storage . The object storages applications present as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel access to objects . That makes it ideal for moving your back-end storage clusters across multiple data centers . <p> We do n't recommend you use object storage for transactional data , especially because of the eventual consistency model outlined previously . In addition , it 's very important to recognize that object storage was not created as a replacement for NAS file access and sharing ; it does not support the locking and sharing mechanisms needed to maintain a single accurately updated version of a file . <p> Because block level storage devices are accessible as volumes and accessed directly by the operating system , they can perform well for a variety of use cases . Good examples for block storage use cases are structured database storage , random read/write loads , and virtual machine file system ( VMFS ) volumes . However , since block storage has essentially no additional storage-side metadata that can be associated with a given block other than the address of that block , performance degrades in geographically distributed systems . The further the block storage gets from the application , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage in practice <p> Despite what some people suggest , object storage is not an emerging technology . Data stored as objects have already approached the exabyte scale ( 1000 petabytes ) representing trillions of objects . Companies like Amazon ( with S3 ) provide object storage via its public cloud platform at massive scale , while object storage can be implemented in the company data center using technology like OpenStack 's Swift or EMC 's Atmos . <p> When you begin to think about what types of items you should move into object storage , start with the low-hanging fruit . Take a look , for example , at low I/O workloads such as network share , which may be on a NAS device . In this instance , you are limited to the size of the unit . Without an easily expandable option , you are forced to overprovision in order to leave room for future expansion for the users , resulting in underutilization . By moving this workload to an object store , you 're not limited to the amount of space each unit holds . Nodes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing full use of the disks you purchased . <p> Regardless of the path you choose , it is important to familiarize yourself with the advantages and limitations of the architecture in order to get the most value for your company .

Please explain ? <p> Yadin Porter de Leon1 year ago <p> Thanks Roopal for reading the post , <p> Object storage leverages sequential read/writes , which allows it to scale out extremely well , but one downside is that your files can not be manipulated in small parts . The entire file ( as an object ) must be edited and then re-uploaded as a new object . <p> Block storage allows users to frequently access data and edit files as needed because it manipulates small parts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nice and informative article . <p> One clarification , like we say block storage is accessed by operating system . Can we say application accesses object storage . Can you name business applications that uses object storage . Or can we look at object storage for storing backup data . <p> Mohan1 year ago <p> Good description . Thank you . <p> Mukul1 year ago <p> it is not clear to me how does block storage allow frequent access to data ? Even in case of block storage any modification will end up changing all blocks from the point of change .. i.e. let 's say you inserted just few bytes of additional data in a given block that will result in spilling data to next block and then to next block and so on thus resulting in re-writing of all blocks after the modified block . Right ? <p> Block-based storage is more suited for use cases in which a file is edited frequently . For object storage , a change within the file causes the whole file to be saved again . A file , such as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which will cause the entire file to be saved a second time . Block-based storage would only save the changed blocks associated with that title page . In the scenario you presented , in which enough changes were made to the document to adjust all the pages in the document then , yes , all the blocks would be changed and the entire document would still be saved within a block-based storage system . <p> In the case of a geographically distributed block-level storage systems it is extremely difficult to impossible to do deliver the high performance necessary over long distance , simply because the laws of physics do not allow it , because it takes too much time to sync a block-level storage system that is spread over multiple continents . <p> Angel8 months ago <p> Fantastic explanation .

Conversely , object storage is usually accessed through a REST API over HTTP .

The object storage " service " is accessed via API at the application level , rather than via OS at filesystem-level . Object Storage is not directly accessed by the operating system . Block Storage and File Storage are designed to be consumed by your operating system , Object Storage is designed to be consumed by your application . <p> A lot of applications leverage the unique capabilities of object storage , including backup .

@@77781033 @6481033/ <h> Share <p> IT is grappling with how to protect sensitive data , making the state of data privacy worrisome no matter how big or small the organization is . Smaller companies care about data privacy just as much as big ones do , but they 're ill-equipped to do much about it . Large enterprises take more measures to deal with the issue , but they are n't that successful , either . <p> When we talk about topics like IT governance , data privacy , and information security , there 's a tendency to imagine that these issues apply primarily to large companies with household names . As if smaller organizations do n't well , not exactly do n't care , but they have so much to juggle , and fewer IT staff available to do the juggling , that such matters get little attention . <p> As it turns out , that 's not precisely so . Small and mid size businesses care about data privacy .

( You can download the report to see the results yourself , or get a broad overview from this infographic . ) <p> However , differences emerge when we drive a little deeper into the data to learn how company size affects organizational behavior regarding privacy safeguards . Nominally the data is less trustworthy " the sample size for each category gets somewhat small " but the trends are clear enough that you and I can draw some useful ( if not precisely scientific ) conclusions . <p> Larger organizations put more energy into protecting the privacy of sensitive data ; after all , they have to contend with greater risks . A single stumble can result in major corporate embarrassment , such as millions of customer records being stolen . So we see 77% of businesses with more than 5,000 employees investing more effort into this initiative in 2015 , as are 100% of companies with 1,000-5,000 employees . <p> But data privacy urgency affects smaller businesses , too , because you do n't need to be a big organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . In even the tiniest companies , those with under 100 employees , 83% are investing more in data privacy protection this year ; so are 72% of those with 100-1,000 employees . <p> What 's different is not the perceived urgency of data privacy and other privacy/security matters . It 's what companies are prepared ( and funded ) to do about it . <p> Large companies have more resources , such as the opportunity to offer and enforce employee training . And indeed , when it comes to training employees on data privacy , 82% of the largest organizations do tell the people who work for them the right way to handle personally identifiable data and other sensitive information . Similarly , 71% of the businesses with 1,000-5,000 employees offer such training . <p> However , even though smaller companies are equally concerned about the subject , that concern does not trickle down to the employees quite so effectively . Half of the midsize businesses offer no such training ; just 39% of organizations with under 100 employees regularly train employees on data privacy . <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's become commonplace , if not exactly routine , for organizations to conduct regular security audits to ensure compliance with data security standards .

Just 54% of companies overall do data privacy audits regularly ( compared to two thirds who do security audits ) , most commonly in the largest organizations ( among the large enterprises , four in five regularly do data privacy audits which means about 20% are n't policing their practices ) .

A 2013 IDG Enterprise Mobility Study stated that over 34% of IT leaders said the biggest challenge to enterprise mobile IT implementation and support was ensuring data compliance and producing audit trails with an increasingly mobile workforce . <p> The increasing demand for anytime , anywhere access to corporate data by the mobile workforce is challenging status quo approaches to data governance by requiring IT leaders to address three primary risks : <p> 1 . Gaps In Data Visibility <p> In today 's business world , worker productivity and collaboration trump compliance . It is not unusual for employees to primarily work from laptops and mobile devices , as well as self-provision cloud-based apps like DropBox and YouSendIt . As a result , large amounts of data " up to 28-35% of all corporate data on endpoint devices " exists outside the organization and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blind spot for data visibility that undermines a company 's ability to manage risks associated with knowing where content resides , how they control access to content and what to do when devices holding critical data is lost or stolen , or when employees depart . <p> As workers become more mobile , data loss is just a lost , damaged or stolen laptop away . Not only is lost productivity a risk , but so is the loss of crucial , irreplaceable documents such as important research , financial documents and business plans in development . All of these have big implications for your business . <p> To mitigate risk , companies need a second , up-to-date copy of data residing on endpoints to enable immediate recovery with minimal downtime and no loss of productivity . Any loss or damage to a device will not block access to content from another device for continuous data availability . This is especially valuable to companies with thousands of workers and devices in the field . <p> 3 . Controlling Data Leaks <p> When a worker leaves a laptop at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productivity that is impacted in terms of data recovery , it is also the organization 's trust with its customers and its responsibilities for compliance .

Proactive measures to protect corporate data at across every location places organizations in a stronger position with both data compliance requirements and with vital customer relationships . <p> Close the gaps with a holistic approach to data governance <p> With the unstoppable trends towards business in the cloud and on mobile devices , a status quo approach to data governance will only increase the risk exposure for organizations .

Some would say , and count me in , that this is remarkable storage space savings and certainly a vast improvement in network bandwidth reduction . <p> Druva calls the dedupe function " global deduplication " and it produces smaller , faster backups by eliminating data redundancy across all users . Additionally , the application-aware deduplication understands application formats and can accurately determine block boundaries for deduplication " in other words , an intelligent and intuitive deduplication . <p> eDiscovery Given that inSync creates a pool of centralized data that users can access from anywhere , it naturally follows that Druva provides integrated tools to enable compliance and eDiscovery . An advantage to having a centralized pool of data is that endpoint user devices are not impacted during the eDiscovery period or when compliance polices are executed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preserve and collect pertinent data .

Its interesting to see how databases have come a long way and have clearly out-shadowed file-systems for storing structured or unstructured information . <p> Technically , both of them support the basic features necessary for data access . For example , both of them : <p> Ensure data is managed to ensure its integrity and quality <p> Allow shared access by a community of users <p> Use well-defined schema for data-access <p> Support a query language <p> But file systems seriously lack some of the critical features necessary for managing data . Let 's take a look at some of these features . <p> Transaction support Atomic transactions guarantee complete failure or success of an operation . This is especially needed when there is concurrent access to the same data set . This is one of the basic features provided by all databases . <p> But most file-systems do n't  have this feature . Only the lesser known file systems , such as Transactional NTFS(TxF) , Sun ZFS , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular open source file systems ( including ext3 , xfs , reiserfs ) are not even POSIX compliant . <p> Fast Indexing Databases allow indexing based on any attribute or data property ( i.e. SQL columns ) . This helps fast retrieval of data , based on the indexed attribute . This functionality is not offered by most file systems , i.e. you cant quickly access " all files created after 2 PM today . " <p> The desktop search tools like Google desktop or MAC spotlight offer this functionality . But for this , they have to scan and index the complete file system and store the information in an internal relational database . <p> Snapshots Snapshot is a point-in-time copy/view of the data . Snapshots are needed for backup applications , which need consistent point-in-time copies of data . <p> The transactional and journaling capabilities enable most of the databases to offer snapshots without shopping access to the data . Most file systems however , do n't  provide this feature ( ZFS and VxFS being only exceptions ) .

File-systems still have to evolve to handle it . <p> Relational View of Data File systems store files and other objects only as a stream of bytes , and have little or no information about the data stored in the files .

@@77781080 @6481080/ <h> Why inSync directories should be excluded from anti-virus scans ? <p> Ideally , any of the inSync server related paths should not be scanned . Most of the anti-virus locks the frequently accessed files to scan them which may cause database corruption . When data is uploaded to the data folder , references for actual data are stored under database files . If an anti-virus locks database files , inSync server may not be able to update the database due to which it loses some of the references . In some scenarios , anti-virus tends to delete/quarantine database/data/database log files as they are frequently accessed and modified , considering those as malware activities . This in turn leads to storage corruption . <p> To address this situation , inSync has an inbuilt mechanism to ensure anti-virus scans are reported via an alert , which has to be configured .

@@77781094 @6481094/ <h> Why IT is Setting Their Sights on Direct-to-Cloud Backup <h> Share <p> IT is eyeing the cloud as a target for server backup across large enterprises . Cost efficiencies and the massive scale of the public cloud are primary drivers , aided by growing confidence in the foolproof nature of a direct-to-cloud approach . <p> Remember the days when everything was backed up locally , sent to tape , and shipped off-site for storage ? This traditional approach has n't  changed much since its early days , - and- there are downsides ; namely , cost , consistency and global scale . <p> As a business grows , IT teams need to invest in hardware across regions , as well as in people to manage these backups at each site . The costs- of- maintaining appliances and software licenses across all global sites quickly add up . In addition , separate IT resources are required at each site to conduct the tape backup and deliver those tapes to offsite remote locations such as Iron Mountain . While dedupe appliances can be purchased to enable faster throughput and restores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites . <p> Another reality is- that backing up to tape across a variety of server clusters means that data is handled manually " and inconsistently " by location . And , the backup process itself is prone to failure " tapes can go bad or go missing , tape drives can fail , and human error is not uncommon . This all quickly becomes a big ( and expensive ) endeavor , leaving IT leaders muttering , like Cisco from The Flash ' : <p> While IT teams have been backing up target devices to disc , then to appliances , and then to tape for years , the cloud was never a serious consideration given concerns about security , stability and cost . As- recently as five or six years ago , cloud backup for secondary storage would have been unimaginable . But with the growing security and global availability of cloud infrastructures such as Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) , momentum towards direct-to-cloud backup for IT infrastructure is building fast. - <p> Direct-to-cloud backup offers a number of advantages over the legacy approaches , beginning with- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across global sites. - And , data is no longer silo 'd with redundant copies of data being backed up , and now available centrally for multiple uses . And , its a more efficient way to backup and store data . Why ? Using global data deduplication , it is possible to detect redundant data collected across globally distributed sites , and only backup unique data , eliminating storage redundancy and optimizing- bandwidth utilization during backups . Better yet , IT teams can gain visibility into centrally stored data to learn valuable business insights , all the while- lowering infrastructure and operational- costs . <p> Direct-to-Cloud Backup : A Real-World Story <p> By the time it went looking for an alternative to tape backup , TechFlow , a California-based IT services provider , already had business processes like email , knowledge base , SharePoint , and financial time card systems in the cloud . By replacing tape backup with direct-to-cloud server backup for its remote offices , the company experienced faster recovery times and removed manual processes from the backup and said goodbye to the days of hanging out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teams also discovered that the uptime and availability of a cloud vendor offered data durability far surpassing what they were using previously . <p> Accelerating Towards A Pure Cloud Solution <p> As the adoption of server backup to the cloud advances inexorably , data transfer time is still a barrier to be overcome in order to achieve specified RTO and RPO when backing up/restoring data from the cloud . Thankfully , Druva 's global data deduplication addresses this need by efficiently removing duplicate data , as only dissimilar data is backed up , saving bandwidth and making it possible to achieve aggressive RTO/RPO specifications. - <p> Given the momentum towards cloud , it is likely that- target appliances will transition out of the data center and be replaced by cloud backup . Businesses will then have a single store of critical data in a trusted cloud environment that can be used as backup and restores , as well as for other workflow needs " all without the additional hardware and software costs associated with server backup. - Towards this goal , Druva recently announced disaster recovery ( DR ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance of immediately-accessible data for use cases such as disaster recovery , as well as for other use cases . <p> Druva is leading the way toward a future where the cloud is the backup target for large enterprise server environments , allowing users to access data from the data center with a minimum of downtime , and making once disparate , complex and cumbersome workflows like backup and recovery , archiving and disaster recovery ( DR ) come together on a single data set , something not easily attainable with an on premises approach . <h> Sameer Agashe <p> Sameer Agashe is an Implementation Manager at Druva .

Additionally , new endpoint backup functionality must increase user productivity via fewer interruptions at the endpoint and more efficient data handling techniques . <p> Innovation and the proven success in improving efficiency of endpoint backup have driven resurgence in its embrace by enterprise and cloud computing environments.With this success and a growing market come new challenges such as increased competition and new user requirements such as file sync and sharing . <p> Security is Key As companies continue to leverage the fast paced innovation of mobile devices and their functionalities , which enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security and data leakage . The mobile workforce spectrum of endpoint technologies includes desktops , laptops , and a growing array of hand held devices and tablets . <p> In some cases companies will provide employees a company-owned endpoint device while a growing number of companies are encouraging , and in some cases requiring , employees to participate in the BYOD concept . In both cases the threats to data security are a real and present danger . Data security threats include devices that remain with ex-employees that take company data with when they leave , endpoint devices that are lost or stolen , and illegal network hacking by digital information thieves . <p> Given numerous real-time data security threats , those responsible for data security on endpoint devices need to implement a comprehensive and integrated solution that provides not only backup but also additional capabilities such as device encryption , the ability to remotely wipe sensitive company data , the ability to locate an endpoint device anywhere on the globe , and the ability to create an impenetrable virtual box " or container " BYOD environment so that data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IT security personnel need to assure that their comprehensive solution supports configurable polices that can control which apps access local and remote data . <p> Performance and Productivity With regards to backup and restore , many companies today use various brands and models of endpoint devices coupled with a multitude of server platforms that run applications which leverage the flexibility of the endpoint devices . Without implementing a comprehensive data management solution , admins are left with a massive amount of complexity that also translates into increased costs due to the sheer number of disparate data management solutions required . Managing backups and restores in a disparate and complex environment quickly becomes a tricky balancing act and can easily spiral out of control , leaving data virtually unprotected and endpoint users frustrated over losing the use of their device while IT juggles a backup . <p> Clearly , its important for those responsible for backup and restore of endpoint devices to seek out , identify and deploy a comprehensive backup and restore solution .

@@77781112 @6481112/ <h> General guidelines for NFS share based deployment for inSync Storage <h> Summary <p> NFS or Network File System , is a server-client protocol for sharing files between computers on a common network , generally used for Linux systems . NFS enables you to mount a file system on a remote computer as if it were local to the system . You can then directly access any of the files on that remote file system . The server and client do not have to use the same operating system . The client system just needs to be running an NFS client compatible with the NFS server . <p> Below are a few key points to be noted while configuring inSync storage on an NFS share : <p> Only the Data component of inSync storage can be configured on a NFS share . <p> The Database and Database logs will have to be configured on local or internal disks . <p> To avoid any read/write delays , place the NFS server and inSync server in a single hop , dedicated network . <p> NFS share , if used on Linux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding an entry in/etc/fstab . <p> The ownership &amp; read/write permissions of the NFS share directory should be set to user insyncserver and group insyncserver ( insyncserver is the user created on the inSync server ) . <p> Ensure that the Storage directories are not shared/accessed by any other user/system. 
@@77781113 @6481113/ <h> Keeping Security Manageable <h> Share <p> Druvas inSync is based on a simple idea : Build a robust , reliable endpoint protection solution that can be installed without a bulky process , reading tons of knowledge base articles , or making half a zillion support calls . Usability for IT administrators and end users has always been critical to us , and several years later , we 're still proud that customers can install inSync by themselves in 20 minutes . So when we wanted to make sure that inSync adhered to the strictest security standards in the industry , we were n't willing to compromise on user experience . <p> Anyone with even cursory experience in security administration will agree that ease-of-management and security do n't always go together . As best practices , tools , and technology have evolved over time , it 's become simpler to get a relatively useable degree of security with some effort . Yet implementing enterprise-grade security without sacrificing usability takes a lot of innovation . We 've worked hard at this , and I want to share a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On-Premise <p> The overall security of an on-premise deployment depends on two things : the application itself and the environment in which it runs . Because the environment can vary , we 've put measures in place to ensure out-of-the-box security regardless of the particular infrastructure . <p> For example , SSL is an industry standard to protect data in transport . We wanted inSync to use SSL , regardless if a customer has a default , unsigned certificate or a self-installed valid , trusted one . It might have been easier to ask customers to jump through hoops to set up the configuration , but we did n't want to offload this overhead at the cost of making more work for the IT administrator . Instead we use SSL in an innovative way to solve this problem for everyone , even when a customer does n't have a signed SSL certificate . <p> Another way we enhance inSync 's usability is that it integrates with an organization 's existing security framework . This means that it works with existing authentication mechanisms such as Active Directory ( AD ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing firewall rules and any other security policies . Administrators can extend their existing policies to include inSync without needing to put separate configurations in place . <p> Public Cloud <p> With our public cloud deployment , we had to look at security a bit differently . We know that customers sometimes have anxiety over cloud storage , since it requires that they send their critical data to third-party servers . We knew that to bring the management benefits that can come with the cloud , we needed to provide the confidence that comes with the industry 's best security . We chose the hosting provider that offered the most stringent security available and then focused on building a secure cloud application infrastructure . Our customers are now able to offload entire sets of compliance , governance , and infrastructure management hassles to us that would otherwise take a large team of trained IT administrators to manage . IT staff can focus their efforts on other concerns than the day-to-day management of their backup storage infrastructure . <p> It 's always going to be a challenge to ensure the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so , and look forward to sharing what we learn . <h> Srivatsan Srinivasan <p> Srivatsan Srinivasan is Senior Product Marketing Manager at Druva .

@@77781114 @6481114/ <h> What is " Outlook 2003 , 2007 and 2010 Advanced " option and how is it used ? <p> inSync has a very unique way of backing up data . It uses app-aware data de-duplication technology to save only a single copy of duplicate emails/attachments and docs across users . <p> The inSync Outlook Advanced setting uses messaging API . The MAPI allows inSync client to become application-aware , which helps in better understanding the on-disk format of applications . inSync uses MAPI interface supported by Outlook , which identifies all the message folders available with Outlook . It reads messages from these folders and messages are synced to the server . With MAPI it can very quickly figure out newly added/ changed/ deleted messages and selectively backup those . The backup mechanism is entirely different from how a file is backed up . With ' app-aware dedupe ' , inSync backs-up e-mails as proper e-mail messages and not as blocks in a file . This makes it ' content aware ' as far as e-mails are concerned . It is much easier for inSync to identify that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one copy in it 's store . The end result is better de-duplication , efficiency and savings on actual storage required . <p> Example <p> 100 users get the same 100 KB email in their PST files . Any modern day incremental backup software will pick 100 KB ( or more ) from each of these PST files . The total backup for all users combined is 10 MB ( or more ) . With inSync , after the first user backs up that email ( 100K ) , it is skipped from the backup of the other users , and the server maintains only a reference to it for the other users . The total backup for all users is 100 KB . This reduction in backup size saves over 99% bandwidth , storage , and time . <h> Can inSync automatically locate the PST files stored in my system ? <h> Will a user be able to see all the emails under restored PST file ? Can a user restore only Inbox ? <p> Each inSync restore is a full restore . During restore all the users see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users ; they just see a fast backup . As an administrator , you would see much less bandwidth and storage being used . <p> You can confirm this by checking the actual storage space consumed against the total number of files transferred . To do so , launch the inSync Client from system tray icon . Click More Details . <p> Users will be able to restore particular folders like Inbox , Sent Items , etc. from PST files if the Outlook Advanced option is configured .

@@77781161 @6481161/ <h> What 's So Special About Digital Envelope Encryption ? <h> Share <p> There are many ways cloud service providers protect your data : key and data model , escrow model , key server model , etc . With inSync , we take a slightly different approach to encryption using a method called digital envelope encryption , also referred to as two-factor encryption model . Watch the video below or read on to see how- digital envelope encryption- is different from its- alternatives . <p> We look at three aspects of each model : security , data privacy , and manageability . <h> Key and Data Model <p> The good thing is that the key-and-data- model is very manageable . The key is stored alongside your data , making it easy to retrieve . However , if someone breaches the system , they can gain access to all the keys . This model typically works fine for personal use , or for a less secure type of use , but it is not really great for enterprise use where protecting data is paramount . With the way the key and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal subpoena , the information could be easily handed over by the cloud provider . The service provider might even scan the data before- or- after it is encrypted/decrypted . <p> Secure ? No . Private ? Not really . Manageable ? Yes . <h> Escrow Model <p> In this model , the key is stored with a third-party provider and can only be accessed when requested . Doing so- adds an extra layer of security in the case of breach , and it limits direct provider access to your data . Here , too , the keys are easily managed . But the escrow model does n't  really protect your data from the standpoint of an investigation or subpoena , which is at the heart of many regional data privacy concerns affecting global enterprises . <p> Secure ? Yes . Private ? Not really . Manageable ? Yup . <h> Key Server Model <p> The keys to your data are stored on an on-premise server . On the positive side , - it is very private and the cloud provider can not access it . That means good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tasked with managing the server &amp;emdash ; so if it should ever fail internally , you have to fix it . In the worst case , when there 's irreversible damage ( sadly , it does happen ) , it leaves you with no access or recoverability of your data . Also , would n't having something on-premise to store and protect your keys undermine the purpose of implementing a cloud system ? <h> Digital Envelope Encryption Model <p> Are you ready for this ? With the Digital Envelope Encryption model your data is protected two-fold . First , a unique key is generated , encrypted , and turned into a token , which is then stored . This token can only be accessed by the administrator or end user providing his- credentials as the complementary part to decrypt the stored token ; and second , the data is also encrypted . In order to access the encrypted data , both parts of the equation need to work together to recreate the key , which only exists in that unique session . Since only the administrator or end user has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to go to him- to get the first piece of the puzzle . Effectively , no one can access the data without your knowledge . <p> As with so many other things , the choice of an encryption model is based on the application and domain need . ( Since were in the business of protecting your corporate data no-matter-what , we 'd choose the most secure option even if it werent quite as manageable . ) What criteria do you use for deciding which encryption model is appropriate for your own needs ? <p> Video Transcript <p> Hi Im Dave Packer with Druva and today we are going to talk about Druvas unique approach to encryption utilizing our two factor encryption model . What I 'm going to do is contrast this with some of the more common encryption models utilized by cloud service providers in doing so we are going to use three criteria , one is security , really how well is your data protected from unauthorized access ? <p> The second one is the privacy which is really about if you think about things like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a cloud provider , how easily accessible your data is and how it can be produced or handed over to a third party without your knowledge and thirdly is around manageability , How easy is it to manage this mechanism , manage the keys and so that you are not thinking about it on a constant basis and thinking about things like key rotation and expiration and things like that and so the first model that we see most commonly used is where your key is stored alongside your data and in doing so what happens is that key stored in the database when an end user authenticates they get the key now they can encrypt and decrypt data as it moves in and out of the cloud . <p> From a security stand point , the main challenge with this is one question we get from a lot of folks about kind of where are the keys stored is that if somebody breaches the system they might get access to all the keys and therefore all access to all the underlying data within the system . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for personal use of the way maybe less secure model of storing data but really not that great for an enterprise , and so we usually would n't consider this one of the best security mechanisms to use for protecting enterprise data . <p> The second is around data privacy , and I think its pretty obvious with the way the key is stored and the way data is stored that if there was an investigation or the government wanted to access your data , or there was a legal subpoena for your data that that data could be divulged , and so we that this is n't a very private mechanism and what weve also found in these implementations a lot of the times the service providers are actually scanning the data before it gets encrypted or when its un-encrypted or decrypted , and having visibility into it . <p> So what we say is from the manageability standpoint is actually works pretty well . The second evolution is really what we call key Escrow and this is where the key is stored in some type of a third party provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the third party provider , its pulled over and now its utilized for encrypting and decrypting your data . <p> One of the advantages is that from overall security standpoint it adds in an extra layer of security so a data breach for example might not provide that access to that key , people wont be able to then decrypt your information and get hold of it , so from a security standpoint , its fairly secure from a data privacy standpoint though it suffers from the same issue here . <p> Escrow does n't  protect your data from the standpoint of an investigation or some type of litigation or request for your data . So its not really what we consider a very private solution , but from a manageability standpoint it is a good solution because the key is easily managed , you do n't  have to think about it , and some of the other challenges around managing keys that some organizations deal with . <p> The third model that we see utilized a lot is utilizing a key server , and in this model what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on premise , inside your organization . It manages the keys and it offers a very high level of security because a breach of the cloud servers providers system they cant get to the keys , its very private because beyond the cloud service provider , it does n't  have the access to those keys and so there 's no way for them to access the data , so you got good security and definitely good privacy . <p> The challenges is at manageability standpoint when you have an on premise key server what that means is that now I have to manage it , I have to make sure that its backed up that its redundant that there are some type of failure . One of the challenges with key server model is that if that Key sever goes down , none of my employees now have access to their data any more . <p> So it creates a little bit of a fail point however , an organization though it does provide the security , and so a lot of organization will go , oh you know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does kind of undermine the whole purpose of having a cloud system which is to have all that information stored in the cloud as much as possible . <p> So Druvas approach is what we call digital envelope encryption , or two factor encryption , its a little bit of a different model and the idea is how do we take the best of all these different models and mix them together in a way that allows you to have the most security , the best privacy and also the manageability that you really want out of these simpler models . <p> the way that we do this is pretty unique , what we do is when you create an account inside Druva is we generate a unique key for your data but we never store that key , actually , what we do is we encrypt that key using the admin or end user credentials and what that does is result in a token and that token is actually where it gets stored alongside the encrypted data cloud so that means your tokens encrypted , your datas encrypted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely delivers the security you want because there 's no way to access that data , all authorization is managed by the administrator and the end users access to that information . From a privacy standpoint we as Druva do n't  have any access to that information we cant take that key we unencrypt your data , we cant hand it off to anybody , anybody who wants that data has to go directly through you , and so that 's a big advantage because that will make sure that you 're always in the loop about who has access and visibility to your data , so definitely from a visibility and privacy standpoint very strong . now from a manageability standpoint because of the way that were handling it and because were not using a key server model , you get the advantage of having that information and those keys managed the way that you want to and so it delivers that very simple model of key manageability , but also the security and privacy that you really want . <p> So the goal of digital envelope encryption is to really keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we engage with a lot of large enterprises that traditionally have looked at kind of private cloud or stored data on premise they 've gone towards this model because it gives them those advantages , it also allows them to have the efficiencies of Cloud storage but also the security and privacy they 're looking for . <p> So that gives you the general idea of the various key models and why we use our digital envelope encryption model for protecting data in the cloud .

That 's the case even though 78% of survey respondents feel that employees who do n't  follow security policies are a threat to mobile security . <p> Although IT security risks are growing most rapidly on mobile devices such as smartphones , few organizations have governance and control processes to stop attacks on these devices . And when such policies exist , reports the study , " 2015 State of Endpoint Report : User-Centric Risk , " 70% of IT professionals have endpoint security policies that are difficult to enforce . Other enterprise endpoint security threats high on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BYOD , and employees who work remotely . <p> So , why are employees the biggest source of risk ? For most people , endpoint security is n't top of mind ; they " we ! " want to get work done . Most of us , when faced with a security policy , just sign it or click " Agree . " Unless you 're an IT or security professional , chances are you do n't  take the time to read all that fine print . But maybe you should , because getting fired for failing to comply with security policies is a real possibility . <p> " People say the solution to security and data privacy concerns is putting policies and procedures in place , but that means putting the responsibility in the hands of individuals and expecting them to strictly follow those guidelines , " says Dave Packer , Druvas director of product marketing . " Unfortunately , you ca n't trust people to always follow regulations . Technology needs to help companies enforce its regulations by filling in those holes wherever it can . " <p> It would make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance and control processes . According to the survey results , 72% believe that attacks on an organizations devices can be stopped by implementing a combination of technologies , processes , and in-house expertise . <h> Heidi Willbanks <p> Heidi is the Sr. Content Marketing Manager at Druva , where she creates in-depth content to help drive business initiatives and meet goals .

The textbook example are the places which set onerous password policies requiring high-complexity long passwords and frequent changes , ban the use of password managers , and then complain when they find that all of their users are doing something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ password because its hard for humans to memorize new high-entropy strings every month . A productivity-focused security group would do things like deploying single-signon to reduce the number of times someone has to re-enter a password , two-factor authentication so you get better security than password rotation offers with a much better user experience , and keep the IT side up to date with measures like anomalous login monitoring and defense in depth so the security of the enterprise is n't so critically dependent on passwords. 
@@77781166 @6481166/ <h> It 's Not Security that Should Worry You . Its Data Privacy . <h> Share <p> Security and privacy are not interchangeable , and we must have both in order to protect our data and to live up to our obligations as data stewards . So what 's the difference between the two ? It 's an important one . <p> Anthem , Sony Pictures , Target It seems like we ca n't turn around today without bumping into another data breach . Security consumes IT mindshare . We endlessly debate things like firewalls , encryption , and malware detection , and we focus relentlessly on keeping the bad guys out . <p> So I found it interesting that , when Gartner surveyed nearly 3,000 CIOs for its 2015 CIO Agenda report , security was one of the initiatives that actually dropped as a priority . Yet , two areas that CIOs marked as increasing in priority are arguably two big drivers behind security concerns : cloud computing and mobile . <p> How is this possible ? Is it really that CIOs are n't concerned about the safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . CIOs are not less concerned about data security than they were a year ago . The difference is that , as a whole , the computer industry has solved the issues around security . Sure , we 'll always need to develop stronger defenses , and hackers will always look for routes into our legacy systems . However , the computer industry has developed technologies and , more importantly , business processes for that ongoing problem . <p> That 's not to say the industry is hopelessly behind . The cloud gave us a clean slate , security-wise , and we 've learned what it takes to secure it . Obfuscating the storage of both data and metadata , using encryption wisely , and employing authentication controls are just a few of the things we do to ensure that even if someone somehow got into the organization 's cloud , the data would be scrambled or otherwise meaningless to the bad guys . <p> If we 've figured out cloud security , then why are we all still talking about it ? <p> Let 's take this out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep most of your important possessions ? Usually it is wherever we live , since we keep close to us what matters most : our pets , electronics , rare books , copies of old tax returns , medical documents , etc . We all have many things in our lives . Some would be inconvenient to replace but the loss of others would be devastating . <p> So how do we mitigate the risks so this is n't an issue ? One part of the process is identifying the distinction between protecting our privacy and ensuring our data is secure . <p> Security is the process by which we keep the bad guys out . My house is secured in multiple ways : The yard is fenced ; the doors are locked ; and if someone tries to go in through a window , three dogs are waiting inside ( probably asleep , but let 's not delve too deeply ) . The whole point of security is to make sure that people I do n't want in my house are unable to get inside , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen are almost unending . <p> On the other hand , there are people who have a right to get into my house , such as my family , my landlord , and the police . These are people to whom I 'm obligated to provide home access in specific situations . This does n't mean that access is a free-for-all . Privacy allows me to give access based on the person 's role , and it helps me make sure that they only see what they should . For instance , my family has a key to the house , meaning they can come and go as required ( perhaps to feed those slavering dogs ) . Nearly everything in the house is open to my family members , minus a trunk where gifts are often stashed . <p> On the other hand , the police do not have a key to my house . They may have a legal reason to come inside ( e.g. , a search warrant ) but the police need to come to me to gain access , and they are only allowed information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not prevent their access , but I do have the ability to authorize their presence . <p> In other words , I want to be the one to let the police in ; I do n't want them breaking down the door or my landlord giving them a spare key . I want to control when and how the police gain entry to my house , supervise their access , and then escort them back out again . I also want to be the one to open the door again , if for some reason they need to come back . <p> It 's the same with our data . Data privacy means keeping our data safe from misuse by authorized users . This means that if the NSA requests my data , I want them to come to me . I do n't want my vendor just handing it over . <p> This has a lot of implications for us as consumers and as businesspeople . Dropbox recently released its 2014 transparency report , revealing that they were required to hand over data in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . Imagine if , 23% of the time , someone wanted to come into your house , your landlord or neighbor met them at the door with a spare key and did n't tell you about the visit . What is n't reasonable to us in the physical world should n't be acceptable in the virtual . <p> Ultimately , security and privacy must go hand-in-hand , in both the physical and virtual worlds . We should have the same expectation that our data is secure in both places . Talk to your cloud vendor and understand exactly what they are doing to protect your privacy and make sure they are n't waiting on the porch with the key if someone wants to get into your digital house . <h> Sarah Beaudoin <p> Sarah Beaudoin is a Product Marketing Manager at Druva .

In- the US , more than 105 million employees will be classed as mobile workers by 2020 , according to research by IDC . - In the UK today , around 48 percent of employees can be classed as mobile workers ' that travel for more than 20 percent of their working week , according to Strategy Analytics . This trend will only increase . <p> Alongside this shift in how employees are working , companies are changing how services are delivered . Cloud-based applications are becoming common within enterprises of all sizes .

Well , the need for disaster recovery and backup of data has not decreased , but it is different . These changes mean that traditional data protection methods might not capture all of the data that people create as part of their working lives . Relying on protection of central applications is therefore not going to be enough . <h> The impact on compliance : the- need for collaboration <p> Many traditional approaches to protecting data rely on all that new information being created and stored centrally .

The proliferation of data onto more devices , accessible from more places through applications or services that are not directly owned and managed by IT is all too easy to imagine . <p> While this growth of data can put compliance efforts at risk , this can also be an effective spur to action as well . For example , the European Union has put together a new draft regulation in place around the safety and security of personal data .

Either way , DR planning involves having up to date versions of critical data , processes and operations in place that staff can then use . <p> This is a big contrast with compliance activities . In the event of an audit , the typical approach that IT teams will have to undertake is to search through available email records and files around a specific topic .

Is the data stored on a cloud service rather than on a central IT system ? <p> To prevent this from becoming an issue , it 's possible to take a more proactive approach to data protection .

@@77781175 @6481175/ <h> 3 Ways to Dedupe your Duplicated Duplicates <h> Share <p> The biggest culprit in the growing costs of data storage and backup is duplicated files . In fact , in some companies , duplicated files account for up to 30% of data that is ( re ) created . Downloading multiple copies of a document and emailing files to yourself are just a few of the ways this duplication occurs . <p> It 's hard to predict storage costs if you ca n't determine just how much data is going to be created and this is a top concern for IT .

Server-side:When you have deduplication taken care of on the client-side , you will experience storage savings because less data is being shipped over to the servers . <h> Logic : At what level is deduplication accomplished ? <p> You could do it at a file level , fixed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deduplication is the most effective dedupe methodology , because you could identify file duplicates in attachments , emails , or even down to the folder from which they originate . <h> Scale : Dedupe one device or dedupe coverage for all devices ? <p> It 's important to have deduplication at the global level because that 's when you get the full network effect . Rather than individual silos , a single user could seed other users . <h> Video Transcript <p> Hello , my name is Chandar , from Druva . Today I 'm going to be talking about Deduplication which is essentially looking at redundant data and eliminating them . Now different vendors make different claims about their own dedupe approach . I 'm going to be talking about all the various approaches there are to dedupe . <p> The first attribute of deduplication is location . Where exactly is dedupe performed ? You could do it on the server side for example on a data domain dedupe storage system or on the clients side , but when done at the clients side in addition to getting the same storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship less data over the network , and that 's a great thing . <p> The second most important attribute of dedupe is logic . Let 's start with granularity . At what level is dedupe accomplished ? Vendors could do it at a file level , you could look at two different files , identify if they 're the same , and de-duplicate them , or get sub-file level , typically at the block level . <p> You could adopt a fixed block approach , or a variable block approach . The variable block is usually more effective in finding duplicate blocks , regardless of where they 're stored . How many times you inserted a small paragraph in a big word document , or a small slide in a big power point ? The variable block is going to be performing much better , but what 's more interesting is what 's called app aware dedupe . Imagine looking at inside a file just like the application that generated the file looks at it . <p> What if you could use technology like mappy , to look inside all your messages so you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you did that you could identify duplicate attachments across messages and even dedup the attachments from where they were actually backed up inside the folder , and that 's very , very effective . <p> The last and most important attribute of dedupe , is scale . Now most vendors have a scale of one which is the dedup per device or per user , but imagine thousands , and thousands of devices where a single message from your CEO for example went to all of your different devices , or because of your sharing patterns , the same big document is shared across so many devices . <p> A poor use of Dedupe definitely has limitations . What 's most important is performing Dedupe at a global level and that 's when you get the true network effect . Imagine a global Dedupe , where every single user seeds every other user . You start to get exponential savings in both storage and bandwidth and that 's the true power of Dedupe . <p> And ultimate in scale is of course cloud , where the cloud is a design for infinite scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the regions globally and the cloud is great for global footprint and a global reach . Now Druva intelligently combines all the different attributes of Dedupe to come up with something very very unique : client side Dedupe , app aware Dedupe , global Dedupe , and we put it on the cloud .

@@77781180 @6481180/ <h> Data De-duplication <h> Share <p> The Gartner Report ( here ) says storage data de-duplication and virtualization are two main technologies driving innovation in storage management software this year . This makes sense , considering the fact that corporate data is increasing at a whooping 60% annual rate . ( Microsoft Report says here ) . <p> Server Backup <p> Data is very rarely common between production servers of different types . Its not difficult to imagine that Exchange email server may not have same content as Oracle database server . But data is largely duplicate within file-servers , exchange server and say a bunch of ERP servers ( development and test ) . This duplication creates potential bottlenecks for bandwidth and storage used for backup . <p> Existing players have offered two solutions to this problem <p> Traditional single-instancing at backup server to filter out common content e.g Microsoft Single Instance Service ( in Data center edition ) . This saves the just storage cost , depending upon at what level to filter commonalities file / block / byte . A big player in this space is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they just save storage space . <p> New innovative solutions like Avamar ( now with EMC ) and PureDisk ( now with Veritas ) which try filter content at backup server level before the data goes to the ( remote ) store . This makes these solutions much better suited for remote-office backups . They save bandwidth and storage . <p> But , there are two unsolved problems with both these approaches as well ( Which also , explains a poor response for these products in the market ) - <p> most of the times simple block checksum matching fails to figure out common data , as it may not fall on block boundaries . Eg. if you insert a simple byte in a file , the whole file changes and all the blocks shift . And the block checksum approach fails . <p> Checksum calculation is very costly and makes backups CPU exhaustive . <p> These approaches are targeting storage cost , not time/bandwidth which is more critical . <p> PC Backups <p> The problem is much more complex at PC level , as duplicated data is distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . Emails / documents and similar file formats create large pool of duplicate data between users . <p> Also , since 50% of PC backup is mainly large email files , this is problem is particularly difficult to solve using simple file based de-duplication techniches used by servers . <p> Druvaa inSync v2.0 uses a on-wire ( distributed ) de-duplication technique which senses duplicate data before the backup starts and hences skips it from the backup . This is transparent to the user , all he notices is a 10 times boost in backup speed with over 90% reduction in bandwidth and storage usage . <p> How it works <p> This technology creates and maintains a Global " Single Instance " File System at backup server . Each time a user wants to backup a file , the insync clients prepares a file-fingerprint ( using linear polynomial based hash ) and compares it with the server . After the server sends a response , the backup happens only for the " unique " data within the file . <p> The ( patent pending ) advance file-fingerprinting makes it computationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different documents , a same CCed email , media rich corporate presentations etc . This cuts down time for backup by 10 times and reduces bandwidth and storage utilization by 90% . <p> Other Interesting Features <p> Another good use of the Gobal Single Instance File System is Continuous Data protection . The user after starting the restore can see how his files changes over time . Which gives him an option to restore point-in-time data from any point in the past . The marketing name for the feature is " Eternity . Never lose a file . Ever . " A long name , but serves its meaning : ) <p> Business Opportunities <p> The same technology/product can be stripped down to backup PDAs and scaled up to backup servers . A good use case would be to reduce time for backup of bunch of related remote servers . <h> Jaspreet Singh <p> Jaspreet bootstrapped the company while defining the product , sales and marketing strategies that have resulted in Druva 's early and impressive success . Prior to founding Druva , Jaspreet was a member of the storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago <p> Jaspreet , <p> Your claims about Avamar technology are not correct . Their technique is neither block-based , nor is their checksum computation " expensive " . They use a technique they call " sticky byte factoring " , which uses simple rolling checksums to generate variable sized chunks of data and to find differences . See their patent application for details : http : //is.gd/C01 You can see that their technique is highly suited for remote office kind of situations . PureDisk used to do fixed-size chunking , but I had heard that they have also started moving towards an algorithm very much like Avamars . <p> Also , when you say " linear polynomial based hash " , I guess you mean Rabin fingerprinting . Rsync also uses similar fingerprinting to reduce latencies . <p> Thanks for the information on Avamar . Yup , I also came to know about that some time back . <p> The approach followed by rsync , avamar and pure disk is to narrow down the delta change from the previous backup of the same data . <p> We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " data from any source . The important step is to <p> 1 . choose block boundaries which can be checked for hash against data from other sources . 2. compute this and check it against server in real time . <p> This makes sense for Laptop backups where duplicates are between machines . The pitch is for time not storage space . <p> Davish Bhardwaj8 years ago <p> Your blog is very intresting . I began my research on data deduplication after reading your blog . But after Im done with my research on Dedupe , I want to know where to showcase my research . Actually I have developed an Algorithm for Variable size block Deduplication which I think is best in the storage domain industry in terms of Deduplication ration with an additional blend of fast processing . Can Anybody there help me out .

@@77781183 @6481183/ <h> Share <p> " The cloud " is a misnomer of course . Digital data sits in servers and storage and flows through physical conduits ; even wireless transport requires equipment . Your cloud data is hosted on the ground by data centers with high energy needs , vast server farms and massive storage capacity . <p> And these data centers are subject to the same power loss , disaster and security threats that confront all data centers . Their threat may be even greater , since clouds are shared by thousands to hundreds of thousands of users . <p> Cloud providers will have some data security and protection in place that is adequate for both consumer and SMB . As long as they maintain 99.9% uptime ( which most of them do ) and never lose your data ( which most of them wo n't ) then the providers are serving these accounts . <p> But when larger businesses trusts its backup to cloud providers , " good enough " is emphatically not good enough . Big business generates large volumes of data that must remain highly recoverable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses should have Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) in place for signing . <p> This applies to cloud providers who operate their own data centers and also to the ones who are co-located in someone elses . Whoever provides your cloud backup services is responsible for data redundancy . You may be promised the best uptime in the world , but what if a physical data center does not replicate remotely and is flooded , hit by a tornado , or disrupted by an earthquake ? Without enterprise-level SLAs to protect you it is entirely possible that you have lost your corporate data forever . <p> What to Look for in Your SLAs What can you do to protect yourself ? Negotiate the SLAs that you need . <p> Data protection and redundancy . Go with a cloud backup provider who backs up and replicates the data under their control to a remote data center , which is in turn protected from disaster and energy loss . Best bets for data protection sites are geographical regions without major natural disasters , and that are on a generous energy grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of energy for data center builds . ) <p> Data integrity and recoverability . The provider should validate data integrity and recoverability . Natural disaster is not the only threat to your data : corruption and internal loss is too . Put it in the SLAs that your provider regularly validates data integrity . You also need to know what to expect when you need to recover your data . The SLAs should allow you to prioritize your recovery time by the importance of the data . <p> Written service level agreements . Get your SLAs in writing . Do not accept an oral agreement or a simple 99.9% uptime report . You will probably need to negotiate the service levels since the cloud provider needs to make an adequate profit . You may pay more for this level of service but you can justify your increased investment with the reliability of your cloud-based backup service . <p> Even the most reliable service providers experience unforeseeable situations that result in service interruptions . But top service providers like Amazons uptime and security have proven excellent over the long haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture that enables it to offer excellent durability and availability for customers all over the world . <h> Chandar Venkataraman <p> With a strong track record of new business creation for consumers , small businesses , and enterprises , Chandar brings strong product leadership to Druva .

@@77781184 @6481184/ <h> Share <p> Any department or team lead who 's ever evaluated or proposed a complex IT initiative at a large organization knows that winning support across multiple stakeholders can make or break a project . Even solutions that promise big wins for the bottom line have a hard time gaining momentum . So , why is it so hard to find other sponsors for a cost-saving project inside a larger enterprise ? If integrating a new cost-saving initiative will save the company money , why is n't everyone on board ? The answer boils down to the metrics that drive departmental budgets . Knowing how to deftly navigate these roadblocks " either as an internal project champion or as a C-level executive can help drive critical IT projects forward to reap company-wide benefits . <p> #1 . Department heads are hesitant to take on risk <p> Finding a single sponsor in an individual department who will be the first to champion your project is a challenge because the cost savings can not be boiled down to a single line item . So , this person is taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their department first , since they 'll bear most of the responsibility for anything that goes wrong . <p> Solution : Mitigate risk by identifying multiple stakeholders early in the process across senior leadership , development teams and operations departments . Bring them in early to your overall vision to build shared ownership of the project and allow the most passionate advocates to emerge from the group . <p> #2 . The benefits for one department alone are n't enough <p> The agility , efficiencies , and cost benefits are realized across the entire enterprise , which is what makes larger projects so great . The downside though , is that it also makes these projects harder to sell . Those benefits do n't just affect a single department or group 's budget but provide savings across numerous groups . Each group on its own , however , does n't save enough to justify running the project . <p> Solution : Help your stakeholders quantify the benefits across the organization and arm them to the data to bring to the C-suite . You will be helping them gain greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can assist with the heavy lifting needed to put these numbers together , so reach out to them for help . <p> #3 . No one has the budget <p> The upfront costs can be daunting for a single department that is in the process of evaluating a new project that will be used across the enterprise . In many cases , the funds that are under their control simply are n't enough to cover the initial CAPEX needed to get the project moving . In many companies , this means that the project is guaranteed to be DOA when submitted by a single department for consideration . <p> Solution : Propose ways to manage up-front costs so that it does not stall a valuable project . Get to C-level sooner with specific business gains to obtain budget allocations across multiple departments to pool resources . <p> #4 . Ongoing OPEX costs are hard to share <p> Most large enterprises have outsourced their local help desk and site service personnel , so there is a charge every time they need to troubleshoot a machine with a failed drive or provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unquantifiable OPEX budget items . These can range from lost data on machines that are n't sent out for recovery , to user downtime and the potential loss of personal data that might have been on a stolen machine . These drags on productivity do n't come out of a simple line item in the budget where management can point to a direct cost savings . <p> Solution : Outline the intangible benefits as well , like efficiency and agility , which are great value adds for the discussion . While the cost savings or opportunities created by these benefits are not as clear cut , presenting them will demonstrate that you 're providing a more comprehensive view . Providing specific scenarios will also help illustrate the value , especially if the solution will save time or increase efficiency for a large portion of the organization . <p> Overcome IT project roadblocks by addressing the reality of a matrixed organization <p> The key to achieving real success with your project starts with small wins . The worst approach for an unproven concept would be to get a large cohort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them all convinced and on board at the same time . Conflicting interests along with the uncertainty and ambiguity of the outcome would make it easy for everyone to collectively shoot the idea down . <p> Start with one person , someone you can sway with relative ease , and convince them first . Ideally this person would be a senior-level individual in order to provide the greatest degree of leverage when convincing additional stakeholders . Using quantifiable costs savings will provide the greatest impact in this effort . Give specific examples within individual budgets and then show the larger aggregate savings in order to illustrate the collective value of the solution you are proposing . <p> As additional colleagues are convinced , it becomes easier to demonstrate a clearer vision to others , showing the ways in which the company will benefit as a whole . Small wins grow to large ones , as each new project sponsor becomes armed with a firm grasp of the overall savings , efficiencies , and advantages that your project will help each team achieve . Once a critical mass is reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project concept becomes real . Timing is also an essential factor to keep in mind . Managing the process of taking your idea from the whiteboard to POC , to production , requires relentless persistence as well as a great deal of patience . <p> In many cases it 's not just the people who need to be convinced , as windows of opportunity may only open during specific times of the year . Fiscal calendars may only allow budgets to be augmented during a predetermined period , or your project may need to be put on hold to wait for a new hardware or service refresh cycle . <p> Just because you are patient does not mean you are complacent , and being smart about when you begin your efforts is just as important as who is on your side when the project needs to be approved .
