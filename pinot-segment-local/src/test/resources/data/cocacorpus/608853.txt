He spent a fair amount of time helping explaining what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his car and why . He then made sure the extra touches we agreed to were done by an expert in that field . I appreciated the fact that they oversaw the whole process like it was their own personal car . Randy was my eyes photographing every step of this process as well . This whole experience was great and I would recommend them to anyone looking to purchase the car of their dream ! <p> Best Regards , CS <h> From J.M. in AZ <p> Randy , received the Lamborghini Diablo 6.0 and it looks as Nice as the day it rolled off the showroom floor . Once again , you have met our expectations in the exotic world . Thanks for adding the Wing for me . <p> JM <h> From P.B. in FL <p> Just to let you know that six months after getting my Lambo from Randy McCall , I 'm happier than ever with the quality of the car and service you provided . It was a great experience all around , and I 'll return in the future for my next exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good Day Mr. Seale , Not long ago , I purchased a Dodge 2500 truck from your dealership . If you are not aware , it was an ordeal trying to get it in to Canada , because of some perceived problems . After over a month of delays sleepless nights , I finally was able to bring the truck home . I just wanted to let you know how helpful your staff were during the whole process . I can truly say that you are lucky to have such a diligent and courteous team of employees . Thank you for your time and best regards . <p> LL <h> From P. &amp; S. B. in FL <p> Randy , We had our first " date " in the Lamborghini Murcielago last night - got a babysitter - got in the car - and went West on I-10 towards Pensacola - about an hour all total in the car . I saw a Porsche and said , " Paul - get in the left lane - we have to pass them . " He told me not to start being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3 cars in front of us immediately got over into the right line - we came up behind the Porsche , and they very quickly got over too ; ) - we went 120 - fastest I 've ever been in a car - Randy , it felt like we were going 60 ! Also we were going the normal speed and passing a car - Paul said , " Do n't look now but that driver is taking your picture " and of course I looked over and he was taking a picture of us - well of the car of course ! It is really something . Yesterday morning Paul drove it to gas up and then grab coffee and a fireman in the lot asked if he could take a picture of his child in the car ! So of course he did ! Paul is like a kid in a candy store - perfect birthday present ! Now I just need to drive it ! ! ! <p> P&amp;SB <h> From B.H. in NV <p> Randy , As usual , you 're right on again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only once before . The instruction guide you 've provided will be a good refresher course for me and thanks to you , I 'll be able to read up to be prepared on Friday . This is just one more reason I feel good having bought a car from you and your dealership . Everyone there has been over the top with genuine thoughtfulness , utter kindness , and total consideration for me as a new buyer . In closing I would like to say again , " Thank You " for everything and a big extra thanks for your tireless effort in finding a transport to get the car to me before I leave for China on Saturday . Thank you to all those that supported this sale and delivery to make it happen . Thanks a Million ! <p> Regards , BH <h> From T.R. in IL <p> Randy , I would like to thank you for another very smooth transaction . The F430 is an absolutely awesome car and as you promised performs totally different than my 360 . Thanks again for making the entire sale , trade-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to anyone looking for a great car backed by a great team . <p> Thanks again , TR <h> From C.M. in NY <p> I ca n't speak highly enough of the service received specifically from Randy McCall . Randy made himself readily available at all times , and provided quick responses to my questions and concerns throughout the buying process . In summation the experience was great and the car is fantastic . Thanks for all your help . <p> CM <h> From S.W. in Clear Lake Shores , TX <p> Hi Randy , Maiden voyage home went exceptionally well ! I think I took my first breath somewhere around the 610 Loop ! ! ! I wish to express my appreciation for the honesty , frankness , and professional manner in which not only you demonstrated but also everyone I encountered at your dealership . All-too-often automobile sales persons are merely interested in their commission and how many individuals they can exert high-pressure tactics to force folks to buy their vehicles . I especially appreciate your low-keyed approach coupled with genuine enthusiasm about each of the unique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " thanks " to Tommy for ensuring all the minute details were addressed . Tell Gary you deserve a raise for putting up with my incessant questions , as well ! I am delighted with my Ferrari 328 and rest assured I will tell everyone about the incredibly positive experience I enjoyed with you . <p> Best regards , SW <h> From A.G. in Houston , TX <p> Dear Randy , I take the greatest pleasure in writing these few words of appreciation for your most excellent , professional , and personable service during my recent purchase of a Porsche Boxster for my wife . It was clear from the beginning that you were proud to represent an exceptional company from the detailed and complete manner in which you described the car and I felt completely confident that the vehicle would be as you described in every detail . I explained my own motivation and interest in the car and you were happy to help in preparing it as a gift , sending on a key and Porsche crested keychain . Of course , I wish we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of work prevented this you were exceptionally swift in organizing covered road transport and I received the car in fine condition . I particularly appreciated receiving the build docket for the car , all paperwork in the presentation folder and the care you took to ensure that all the car 's systems were fully operational through the local Porsche facility . Throughout the process you behaved as if the car were your own and that is a rare mark of courtesy and consideration which we appreciate deeply . Please be assured not only of our sincere thanks but that we look forward to working with you again and will not hesitate to highly recommend you and your company to our friends . <p> Regards , AG <h> From G.G. in CA <p> I was in VEGAS with my family when I decided that I wanted to drive home in a new 2008 Ferrari F430 F1 Spider . Unfortunately I was told that the wait list is 4 years out ! So I decided to research and found you . Randy , my sales person , was and is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met to date ! The purchase was easy and they made all the arrangements for a PERFECT delivery of my New Black on Black 2008 Ferrari F430 Spider . We have become friends over the course of the process and I am looking forward to buying my next toy from them soon ! They are the best of the best . Look no further , if you want the true VIP treatment call Randy NOW ! <p> GG <h> From D.M. in Beirut , Lebanon <p> Dear Randy , A few days ago , I received in Beirut , Lebanon the 2004 Yellow Ferrari Challenge Stradale that I bought from you earlier . Although this is the first time that I buy a car without any kind of prior inspection ( relying solely on your photos and data ) but after receiving the car and checking its condition , it is actually better than I expected ! I was very pleased in doing this transaction with you and will definitely recommend you to friends and potential clients . It was nice doing business with you and thank you for giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My best regards , DM <h> From A.S . in Columbia , MO <p> Randy , it was a great experience buying from you . The transaction was professional and the car was exactly as advertised - perfect ! The Ferrari F430 is fantastic and the ride home from your store will long be remembered . <p> Thanks again , AS <h> From J.W. in UT <p> I am a very large private collector of Porsche and Ferrari automobiles . As a private collector I am also considered one of the most finicky buyers in the used exotic car market so to say I am hard to please is a major understatement . Finding trustworthy dealers is getting more and more difficult to find and it is even harder to locate cars that are not only as advertised but are actually original and unmarked . A lot of dealers simply do not have the expertise to buy the right cars and more importantly to carefully select the right automobiles that will meet the scrutinizing eyes of a finicky private collector . Bottom line is that it is near impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low miles and in flawless condition and even harder to find a trustworthy dealer to purchase them from . I purchased my first car from Randy McCall in May of 2007 which was a National concourse winning Ferrari 512 TR , before that car could even be delivered Randy my sales rep was able to locate me a car I had been looking for intently for several years , a 3k miles Ferrari 355 GTS . Since that time I have purchased a perfect 1996 Porsche Turbo and I just purchased a brand new very rare one of a kind Porsche GT3RS with delivery miles . Every car I have purchased was as advertised and more importantly each car came to me and exceeded my expectations in every way . Randy McCall is a consummate professional and always goes above and beyond to meet my needs every time but more importantly he is constantly looking for the best cars for my private collection . They are a one of a kind dealer with the highest integrity in the business , have the best cars , and can accomplish things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients . I recommend Randy McCall to anyone whether you are looking for your first special purchase or are a Private Collector as he will exceed your expectations every time and is the best in the business . I am about to buy another car from him and will continue to do so as he has proven to be an irreplaceable asset and partner to me as I continue to build a very impressive private collection . Thank you Randy for making such a positive impact on my life . <p> JW <h> From J.S. in CT <p> I would like to let all prospective buyers know how great it was dealing with Randy McCall . As a first time Ferrari buyer , I knew very little about the cars . Randy was extremely friendly , helpful , knowledgeable . He guided me through every step from start , to delivery at my home in Connecticut . A few problems occured after taking delivery of my 1997 Ferrari F355 Spider . Even though I bought the car with no warranty , he stepped to the plate &amp; took care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the way he promised . His goal was to have a happy customer , and he sure has one in me ! ! ! I bought this car sight unseen , just going on the recommendation of a previous customer in CT , and I now know I made the right decision . <p> Thank you Randy , JS <h> From L.L. in FL <p> Hello , Randy , I just wanted to let you know that I am enjoying my Ferrari more than I could have imagined . I went to a local exotic event and there was a constant crowd around the car . It was getting more looks than a two week old 2008 Ferrari F430 . I 'm probably not the best customer , as I doubt I will ever trade out of it . <p> LL <h> From E.W. in TX <p> Dear Mr. Seale , Thank you much for the amazing package you sent . Our boys LOVE cars and were VERY excited when they saw what was sent . We are using some items in the classroom and the rest as reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> From R.O. in CA <p> I recently completed the purchase of an exotic vehicle ( ' 99 Lamborghini Diablo SV ) with Randy McCall . The plan was of course to fly-in to inspect the vehicle before completion of the transaction , however , I became so trusting of Randy that the personal inspection seemed unnecessary . The information and details he was providing was better than what I would have accomplished in person . And of course upon delivery the vehicle was at least as good as promised , and the maintenance performed by the dealership was top quality . Should I ever wish to sell this vehicle or purchase another my search will certainly start with Randy as I believe our relationship will now continue for life ! <p> RO <h> From R.B. in FL , <p> Hello Randy McCall , I want to thank you for making the sale of our Ferrari 512 BBi so painless . I have been a member of the Ferrari Club of America for 18 years and I have told fellow members how professional and polite you conducted the process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was business-like yet very personable . We will definitely do business with you either as a buyer or seller again . <p> RB <h> From S. A. in Amman , Jordan <p> Dear Randy McCall , I am enjoying the 2006 McLaren SLR ( Black ) . It is as advertised . It was a pleasure doing business with you and your esteemed company ... <p> Thanks Again , SA <h> From D. &amp; K.S. in Temecula , CA <p> It can be a little stressful purchasing an exotic car that you have not seen in person but the Ferrari 360 was everything Randy promised . The shipping was quick and the company did such a fabulous job . I am so pleased ! We will definitely be doing business again with Randy McCall <p> D &amp; KS <h> From B. &amp; T. in TX , <p> Randy , A Big Texas Thank you . We really appreciate your diligence in finding the perfect car . I realize our list of requirements was long and seemed to be unobtainable . But you 're persistence paid off , with patience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to this picture it looks like we will be doing business with you again in a few short years . <p> B&amp;T <h> Customer Writes , <p> A couple of weeks ago I did what some people might consider to be a crazy thing ! I bought a Ferrari from you virtually sight-unseen ( relying only upon a short video tape and your good word ) . <h> From R.P. in GA <p> Randy , thank you for making my purchase of the Ford GT a great experience . You provided me VIP Treatment from the time you picked me up from the airport to the time I drove out of your parking lot . The Ford GT was just as you represented it . Your sales team and service department is top notch and I would purchase from you again without doubt . The Ford GT is a great sports car and it 's American . The best way to describe the performance of the car is WHOA ! I look forward to working with you again . <p> RP <h> From D. &amp; K.S. in Temecula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience I have ever had . Randy McCall was very personable , professional and the transaction was quick and smooth . <p> D. &amp; K.S. <h> From G.P. in FL <p> Dear Randy , I 'm finally home for a while and will be able to enjoy driving my " new " car . I want to thank you for all your help . You were right , the car was everything you said it was . The detailing was the best I 've ever seen . But the best part for me is the fact that this Ferrari drives as good as it looks . I really appreciate all your help in proving to me that you can buy a car without being there and that it will be everything and more . Thanks to Mark , the " Randy 's " and the organization behind you . I wanted a " good driver " and got a " great driver " . I wanted a good original unrestored car but I received a great original car that looks restored . As soon as I am ready for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , detailing it and delivering it for me ! <p> GP . <h> From E. &amp; K.A . in Houston , TX <p> Randy was extremely helpful throughout the purchase of my Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder and even kept the dealership open late a few times to continue answering questions . I had some specific option requests for a car and he managed to find one that exceeded my expectations . Throughout the delivery process he kept me updated by sending pictures of the car , and even stayed late on a Friday night to finish the detailing process himself so I could pick it up on Saturday morning . It is refreshing to find someone with such a passion for cars and customer service . <p> E. &amp; K.A . <h> From D.R. in WA <p> Randy , Just a quick note that we had a great 2,500 mile drive back to Seattle via Austin , Amarillo , Taos , NM , Green River , UT , Boise , Walla Walla and home ! It 's a fabulous car . Goes like a scalded dog . No incidents . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a smooth transaction . Cheers <p> DR <h> From B.M. in KS <p> Thanks for the way you carried out the sale of the Porsche to me . I 've never experienced a better automobile transaction . The car was exactly what you said it would be , you got the things done you said you would and they were done when you said they would be . Also , you 've been a very pleasant person to work with . You guys seem to have the right combination of being able to come up with the hard to find cars and making the buying transaction a pleasant experience . <p> BM . <h> From U.Z. in NY <p> Hi Randy , I love the Ferrari 550 Maranello . I mean really really love it . I mean wake up at 4am and go drive it on the west side highway before traffic starts ! ! ! <p> UZ . <h> From R.D. in FL <p> Dear Randy , Well , the 1998 Diablo SV was delivered to my home today and I want to thank you and your team for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> RD . <h> From J.T. in NM <p> I have bought 2 Lamborghinis and 1 Ferrari sight unseen from Randy over the last 3 years and each time it was an exceptional experience . He worked as hard as anyone I have ever dealt with on my high-end car purchases not only to get me a great deal but also take the time and make sure that when I received the cars they were exactly as represented. <p> JT <h> From F.G . in AZ <p> Earlier this year I had the pleasure to work with Randy McCall while purchasing my first Lamborghini . Initially I was quite nervous about this purchase as I really had never even driven a Lamborghini . Compounding my anxiety was that I was buying the car out of state before visiting the showroom . Randy soon eased my concerns by making sure the car was delivered in excellent condition . <p> FG <h> From P.D . in AZ <p> Dear Randy , I just wanted to say thank you . You and your organization are first class . I know I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfection and you guys delivered . That goes for Rick too ( transport driver ) , really nice guy and I could tell he is great at what he does . I am planning to keep this car for the next 100 years and if I decide to sell it because I am too old and I ca n't get in it , I will call you . <p> Thanks again , PD <h> From M.P . in AZ <p> I just took delivery of a 1988 Ferrari 328 GTS and when the car rolled off the trailer I could n't believe my eyes . Instead of a 19 year old car it looked like it just came off the assembly line . I was a little hesitant about buying the car sight unseen but my salesman , Randy McCall was great and he kept me informed every step of the way . I would n't hesitate recommending him to anyone and I will be contacting him for my next Ferrari in a few years . <p> MP <h> From J.S. in GA <p> Randy was great . I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal by Mondayand received the car on Thursday . As a continual buyer of exotic cars , I can honestly say these guys are the best ! <p> JS . <h> From S.T. in MO <p> Randy McCall is the man for dealing with Ferraris . I love going to the showroom and spending time with him and the team . They love the cars -especially Ferrari- and Randy is a true Tifossi . He knows F1 and he just loves to talk about the sport . He has arranged for special dinners when we go to F1 events and has always taken care of our cars with the utmost care . I was amazed that so many people buy high end cars from an internet based company , but the outfit that Randy is a member of does nothing but the best . <p> ST <h> From D.A . in AR <p> Randy , I just wanted to drop you a note and thank you for taking the time to give us the full tour of your facilities yesterday . Cody did n't stop talking about it all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was showing his mom the pictures we took . He was just in awe of all that he had seen . In this day when people are so busy , it was great to find someone like you who took the time to make a difference in a little boys life . I truly appreciate you for doing that for us . As I told you we had been wanting to stop in here for a long time and the experience was certainly better that we even hoped it would be . We will both never forget that ! Good luck and maybe one day we 'll be able to buy one ! <p> DA <h> From T.A . in IN <p> Randy , Thank you for making this happen as you did . The car was absolutely perfect in every way . Please send my thanks to the team . All the best ! <p> TA <h> From A.G. in CA <p> Randy - I must say that I have never purchased a car sight unseen , but your company was fantastic . I could not be happier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is summer time and attached are a few pics at the beach in the car 's new home in Corona Del Mar , Ca . I thought you would also like to see the Ferrari F430 at the now famous Cars &amp; Coffee in Irvine . That is my old 360 next to the new F430 . <p> AG <h> From S.T. in OH <p> I recently bought a 1984 Ferrari 308 GTSi from Randy McCall . Randy described the car in detail . I inspected the car via the web site and when the car was delivered it was just as described . The car looked and still does like new . Although not the most expensive car they have sold by far , I still experienced a level of professionalism , honesty , and integrity , that all business people should take note of . Of the four Ferraris I have owned , this is my favorite . Great job to Randy McCall . <p> ST <h> From J.F. in GA <p> Randy , I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found both the transportation and vehicle purchase price on an average 10% below your so-called competitors .

Randy and Gary did a top notch job on making sure my Ferrari 328 GTS was in the greatest shape possible and spent lots of time going over the car with me when I picked it up in person with my 10 year old for a great road trip home . I was really amazed at the extra efforts that they went through without any prodding from me . They have my profound thanks . I will be calling them again to add another Ferrari and Lambo in the future .

He shared every detail about the Ferrari 328 GTS , both good and bad , and there were absolutely no surprises when it arrived . Randy kept me informed of the detailing and transporting process every step of the way , and even called a couple of weeks after delivery to make sure everything with the car was ok . The entire experience was first class . <p> KC <h> From J.H. in VA <p> Randy , I am writing to express my most sincere thanks to you and your organization for what has to be the most professional and pleasant automotive buying process I 've experienced .
