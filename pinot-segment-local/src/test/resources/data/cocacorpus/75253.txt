@@1622261 @qwx70987 <p> Along with the development of human civilization , the number of waste paper has a gradually increase trend every year . It is seen everywhere . Many ways have been researched to recycle the waste paper , while the waste paper has been polluted and there are many toxic substances contained , so it is not good for people to have a direct contact with it again . Thus , it is a good choice to have a try to make biomass pellets from the waste paper . <p> Another form of paper is the cardboard . The amount of paper and cardboard in the country is enormous , and the paper and cardboard waste that go the landfill sometimes are exported to other countries . Recycling paper and cardboard is quite the obvious option , but why not be creative and use them heating your house . It is best to try and use it locally instead as the great materials for pellet mill . The waste paper can be turned into pellets to power boilers . Apart from being used in large scale boilers , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home pellet stoves or boilers . <p> When waste paper is made into biomass pellets , it can be used as one green and renewable energy resource with a wide application . The waste paper pellet is a high efficient fuel that plays an important role in family heating , cooking , generating electricity , or as industrial fuel . They can discharge as high calorific value as possible , little smoke and ash left . That is to say , the utilization of waste paper pellets can not only create great economic benefit , but also save a lot of labor . <p> The Benefits of Paper Pellet <p> 1 . Quality : Paper pellets are made to meet the quality demands of the energy system.They are very dense , and the Btu content is similar to coal . The dryprocessing gives them extremely low moisture content . <p> 2 . Cost : The price of paper pellets is one direct benefit and a main lure for customers . Transportation is the highest cost component , therefore , the distance of your industry from the pellet manufacturer may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Environment : Paper pellets have less sulfur andproduce less carbon monoxide than coal , which makes them a little more attractive . Compared to wood , paper has lessformaldehyde . Besides , using recycled paper for pellets is effective in reducing landfill waste . <p> 4 . Lubrication : Paper pellet dust can lubricate the burning system . It is found that paper pellets absorb some of the moisture on coal , allowing the coal to flow more easily on its way to burning . <p> Paper pellets are typically mixed withcoal or wood before being conveyed into the boiler . Co-burning paper pellets takes a little more effort than burning a single kind of fuel.Yet , for the company that wants to save money , develop the regions economy , andimprove some of its fuel handling , it may be the right choice for the fuel needs . To process the waste paper , the pellet mill is necessary . There are some essential matters to be paid attention to . <p> Tips &amp; Warnings <p> 1 . No not use the office paper shredder , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pellet mill . In addition , office paper shredder is not built to handle the capacity required to make paper pellets . <p> 2 . Using a hammer mill to shred the old documents is a good way to prevent identity theft . They will be unreadable after shredding . <p> 3 . If the pellets are too wet to burn well , try letting the shredded paper dry out before feeding it into the pellet mill . According to World Forest Industries , the moisture content should be between 10 and 20 percent for optimum results . <p> 4 . Shredding paper to the required size will create a lot of dust . Wear a mask to protect your lungs . Use the shredder and pellet mill in a well-ventilated area to avoid combustion of the dust . <p> As a burgeoning industry , waste paper pelletizing will keep this trend in the future . Paper pellets will be advocated for a long period due to its renewability and friendliness to the environment .

Use DampProtectT , WallProtectT , and DryRotT sensors to find elevated moisture and dry rot areas hidden inside ceilings , walls , and floors because the presence of elevated internal moisture and dry rot inside building materials makes it likely that there are also elevated levels of hidden mold growth therein . <p> 4 . Use a hidden moisture meter to scan the entire surfaces of all walls , ceilings , and floors for elevated levels of moisture , which would thus facilitate internal mold growth . <p> 5 . In drywall ceilings and walls , cut out and remove numerous , widespread one inch by one inch drywall squares . Examine each ceiling or wall sample square for mold growth inside the drywall material and on the backside ( internal ceiling or wall area ) .

Whether you are considering a small rooftop unit or a large residential turbine you need to know how much wind power is in your area . Wind resource maps , published by the US Department of Energy show airflow speeds at 50 meters ( 150 feet ) above the ground and are a great resource in deciding if you are in a viable location . That 's great if you are installing a larger 10 kilowatt turbine which is typically installed on a 100 foot tower and has a rotor diameter of 24 feet . Below that you really need to evaluate the potential air power of your site on a micro level . <p> Measuring potential for a small rooftop turbine is simple . <p> You need to collect air flow data using an anemometer .

@@1622288 <h> A case study on a sustainable alternative to the landfill disposal of spent foundry sand <p> Many small to medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in the UK are being forced to change the way they manage and dispose of waste . In part , this change has been due to the introduction of landfill taxes by the government , implemented to encourage companies to look at suitable and sustainable alternatives . This case study examines the application of key performance indicators ( KPI ) to monitor SMEs spent foundry sand ( SFS ) disposal over a one year period . Monitoring the KPI initiated a company investigation to reduce SFS disposal to landfill and promote its beneficial reuse . Several alternative methods for SFS reuse were examined and a successful partnership was established with an asphalt producer after it was established that SFS could be substituted for virgin sand in asphalt manufacture .

@@1622295 <p> In order to ensure the highest possible output and productivity when machining aluminium , for the last two-and-a-half years Trumpf 's laser components production unit has been operating as a fully-automated machining centre . It can operate unmanned for up to 60 hours , but to do this it needs both robots and a sophisticated system for dealing with swarf . This latter problem has been handled from the outset by a tailored RUF RAP 4/2600/80x40 Integration Press which processes waste aluminium into practical briquettes and - along the way - increases the value of this raw material . <p> The high-tech company Trumpf Machine Tools is internationally renowned for its high-quality and reliable products and services . This is based on highly-efficient processes which have been fully taken on board by all the company 's staff and management through the firm 's own ' Synchro ' production system . In this way , it is just as important for internal supply departments to deliver ' just in time ' as it is for external competitors . <p> Alexander Wassmer , section leader of around 30 staff in Trumpf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ' We manufacture various aluminium components for core assemblies which are used in the beam generators of CO2 lasers . We are competing directly with external manufacturing plants and so always have to be able to supply at low prices and within a strict time frame . ' <p> The laser components production unit often has to deal with small lot sizes , even as low as a single piece , as the Trumpf beam generator assembly area does not hold any stock . As a result , just-in-time delivery is critical , which requires high levels of flexibility and productivity in machining operations . To achieve this , a decision was taken at Trumpf two-and-a-half years ago to invest in a robot-controlled , fully-automated five-axis milling centre : ' Our main aim was to be able to run the plant unmanned for a whole weekend if necessary ' , explains Alexander Wassmer , adding : ' We realised that the huge amounts of aluminium swarf produced would be a challenge , as they could not be disposed of if weekend shifts were running unmanned . So we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Various ideas were gathered and discussed , and in the end it came down to using a macerator or a briquetting machine . The decision was pretty easy to make , because briquetting offers significantly better volume reduction while at the same time increasing the value of the swarf . The decision-making was also helped by finding a medium-sized company like Ruf which could fulfil all of Trumpf 's technical and commercial expectations and requirements with its compact Ruf Integration Press RAP 4/2600/80x40 <p> The Ruf briquetting press soon paid for itself <p> After two-and-a-half years of using the machine , Alexander Wassmer is still firmly convinced they made the right decision : ' The machine works just perfectly . We have even operated it unmanned for up to 60 hours in our complex milling centre operation without any problems at all . This alone means that it paid for itself in no time at all . ' There are also many other advantages . The compacted aluminium swarf can be sold at a much higher price , while taking up much less space and simplifying downstream processes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metal swarf per year . Around 80 percent of this consists of the expensive aluminium alloys : AlMg45Mn and AlMgSi1 ( also as Si0.7 and Si0.5 ) . The remaining 20 percent is made up of swarf from steel , stainless steel and copper . The swarf produced can also vary greatly : some types are short and several millimetres thick , others are only one-tenth of a millimetre thick and very long . But this is not an issue for Alexander Wassmer , because ' the RAP handles all kinds of swarf without any problems , turning wet , high-volume waste into small , compacted briquettes which on average only take up one-twelfth of the original space requirement . ' <p> Save on valuable working time <p> All swarf is processed in the same way in the state-of-the-art production centre thanks to the integration press which has been customized to meet its exact requirements .

@@1622314 <p> As environmental scrutiny of global industries continues to grow , governments are seeking to impose energy efficiency targets on companies in order to comply with new directives . One solution is to encourage energy suppliers to become energy service companies , who work with customers to identify potential savings and share the benefits this delivers . <p> For the global food processing industry , this provides a welcome opportunity to measure and accurately assess the energy utilization of the manufacturing process and the impact of energy improvements at each step . Food processors have always held a keen interest in identifying ways to improve efficiencies , while demonstrating to customers and stakeholders that they are doing their best to minimize their carbon footprints . <p> Since the introduction of ISO 14067 - an international standard which lays out the principles , requirements and guidelines for the quantification and communication of the carbon footprint of a product - processors are now able to benchmark the impact of their activities on the environment against competitors . <p> As this important issue continues to receive global attention , the ability to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very big challenge for food processors , but advances are constantly being developed to help conserve energy and streamline processes . <p> Illumination and ejection <p> TOMRA Sorting Food is one of the few companies that uses the energy efficiency benefits of technology to achieve industry leading performance in its sorting and peeling solutions . In the area of food sorting , there are two major areas where savings can be found - illumination and ejection . <p> Lighting and illumination are vital to accurately analyze the products . In older sorters , lighting can use 8,000 watts of power per hour when inspecting on a one-meter-wide system . However , with the adoption of pulsed LED technology , this energy use can be reduced to only 150 watts of power per hour . Other benefits of LED illumination are longer lifetime , increased durability and no toxic materials , which is better for the environment . The benefits of pulsed LED technology can be measured in energy efficiency and also in increased lifetime . <p> Another key component of the process is ejection , which can be achieved through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be one of the most expensive uses of energy inside a processing facility . Approximately eight horsepower of electricity is used to generate one horsepower of compressed air . By employing tailored rejection systems for large piece and small piece ejectors , customers can reduce the compressed air usage in parts of the process where large piece rejection is required . <p> In certain sorting and ejection systems for large piece sorting applications ( e.g. whole vegetables and whole fruit ) , the choice to use a sorter that is fitted with finger ejection ( such as the TOMRA 5A ) , as opposed to air ejection , significantly reduces the use of compressed air , which improves the overall energy efficiency of a food processing line . Air consumption is 80 percent lower in finger ejection systems , which provides a significant cost and time saving . <p> Steam peeling <p> The most effective way to remove the skin from vegetables and fruit is steam-peeling , but the use of steam can result in significant amounts of energy being used . Energy usage of steam peelers has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . Using the latest technology in pressure vessel design and shape , the time taken to peel hundreds of pieces of vegetables can be five to ten seconds . The reduction cuts the steam usage in half and results in significant savings . <p> An average French fry production line will employ a single steam peeling machine that can peel approximately 30 tons of potatoes every hour . The steam requirement for this level of food production is approximately 1,800 kg of steam per hour , which has a significant impact upon the energy use and energy efficiency of a production line . In recent years , technologies have enhanced and improved the steam peeling process , meaning that the steam used in the process can be reduced by approximately 25 percent . <p> The introduction of modern , efficient steam technologies , such as TOMRAs Eco steam peeler , has reduced the steam vessel size and steam time , without impacting production capacity . In total , this change in process delivers a reduction of 20 to 25 percent in energy consumption , which in turn reduces energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to process 2,500 potatoes in 3.5 to 5 seconds . <p> The innovative steam peelers have reduced the void space and improved the heat transfer from the steam to the surface of the product that is to be peeled . This in turn reduces the free steam around the product and inside the pressure vessel , and the overall steam time is reduced . <p> Beyond the inherent efficiencies found in modern machines , the collection and interpretation of data is a key factor in reducing energy usage . Today , automated sorting systems used in potato processing lines inspect the percentage of skin that has been removed by the steam peeler . The inspection system collects data and uses this information with an automated peel control module to reduce the steam usage of the steam peeler , by providing real-time feedback and control depending on the percentage of skin that is removed and the quality of the peeling process . <p> The continuous flow of data from automated sorting and peeling technologies is shared with the factory automation system . Each processing machine is able to communicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . This provides real-time information regarding the efficiency of the processing line and enables processors to identify changes in efficiency . This automated communication represents a huge advancement when compared to the capability of machines that were installed five to ten years ago , and contain technology that is more than 20 years old . <p> The benefit of improved accuracy in sorting and steam peeling has universal benefits for food processors but its application in potato peeling is significant . Improving energy efficiencies in food processing has many benefits . By reducing steam , power and time , processors can improve their profitability while also being able to measure themselves against ISO 14067 , and the brand and corporate responsibility benefits it delivers . <p> Beyond that , the improvements will also have a positive impact on the industrys consumption of resources and allow for greater access to food , providing a solution to a challenge that is only going to grow as the worlds population increases . @qwx70989 <p> The threat of deadly aflatoxin is being reduced by food manufacturers across the world , through the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second leading cause of death in the world , behind only heart disease , and rising mortality rates make it a significant public health threat .

@@1622329 <p> MSDS Management is a real pain in the neck , to put it one way . If you secretly know you 're not 100% in compliance , you 're not alone . OSHA studies show that only around 70% of a company 's hazardous chemical inventory has accurate MSDS 's available . But what can you do ? <p> Electronic MSDS management is being adopted with increasing frequency . After all , anything has to be better than trying to keep binders of ratty MSDS pages up to date and in some reasonable order . Cumbersome , internally managed paper-based systems , demanding huge administrative resources , are being replaced by the efficiencies of technology and the Internet . <p> OSHA has clarified guidelines recognizing electronic storage and distribution of MSDS 's as a viable option to replace hard-copy binders and file cabinets , opening the doors for both in-house databases and online MSDS 's . This is good news for plant managers and safety officers . Technology can bring creative solutions to your business issues , but when your organization 's compliance , employees ' safety and company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exercise caution and ask some tough questions . Working in the environmental systems industry for over 25 years , I have learned from many organizations some of the issues it is important to consider when choosing an electronic MSDS management system , and offer them here as a guide for getting started . <p> A number of available solutions do not meet Right-to-Know laws . For example , ' fill-in-the-blank ' database formats , where MSDS information is typed into data fields , do not comply . Also , depending on your needs , Fax-on-Demand may not be an option ( see OSHA Hazard Communication Standard , 29 CFR 1910.1200 ) . If an MSDS can not be instantly accessed in the employee 's work area , you will not be in compliance.Compiled databases with generic or specific suppliers ' MSDS 's are not acceptable if they do not have your vendor 's particular and most current MSDS 's . Manufacturer/importer- and product-specific documentation is required , and approximations , generic MSDS 's , outdated MSDS 's and ' MSDS data , ' even if it contains exactly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for OSHA compliance . <p> 2 . Is the system/service provider 100% reliable ? <p> You should be certain that the provider you select will implement a solution that can meet claims of 24/7 availability , zero down-time , adequate backup , speedy response and accurate documents . For example , OSHA has interpreted the term readily accessible to mean immediate , so a one or two hour delivery of an MSDS would fall short of this requirement , especially in the event of an employee injury or other emergency.It is critical to consider who has control of your organization 's MSDS database . This is important because you will always have ultimate responsibility to ensure it is accurate - you can not transfer this responsibility to an MSDS service provider . Look for a vendor with a number of years of industry experience , as well as software and Internet knowledge , and ask for references from other organizations in your industry . Find out what guarantees are provided . <p> It is a good idea to work with your IT department or resident Systems Manager to ensure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware upgrades or software customization . Instead of getting tangled up in a web of techno-talk , however , it may be beneficial to consult with an industry expert for an evaluation of the most effective solution to your needs . The power of the Internet can offer cost-effective alternatives to in-house systems acquisition , maintenance and support . <p> Sharing information with other facilities and groups within your organization , industry or community may be very valuable . Proprietary or confidential information , on the other hand , needs to be safeguarded . Security , accessibility and reliability are all very important . <p> Some technical issues to consider include : Technical specifications of software and architecture of the program ; application/database/web server platforms and operating systems required ; Internet access ; scalability of the systems to grow with your company ; ability to convert or export any existing MSDS data into the new system ; ability of the new MSDS system to interface with enterprise systems and customization required to do so ; and applicability of the program as an enterprise-wide solution . <p> 4 . Does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much work will it take you or save you ? <p> Consider which of your employees need to have access to MSDS 's . Is language an issue ? When and where do they need access and what computer systems are available ? What information do they have or need when searching for and accessing MSDS 's ? For example , a manufacturing line worker may not have immediate PC or Internet access in the work area , or may not know the exact name of the product used in a particular process . Will this employee be able to access the MSDS they need nevertheless ? At Eaton Corporation , Chemical Safety set up PC 's in plant cafeterias and other open-access areas where simple , handy MSDS access encourages employees to understand product hazards and safety . At Boeing , Nike and Xerox facilities , MSDS 's are accessed by hundreds of employees on their desktop or shared PCs with network and Intranet ( internal company Internet ) applications . For some facilities , MSDS access screens and MSDS documents are available in multiple languages . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which OSHA 's HazCom programs are aimed . <p> Will the EH&amp;S or Safety Officer be able to create documentation required for regulatory reporting or for an inspection ? What other needs might be required by your particular industry , facility , regulatory climate or corporate policy ? Be sure the MSDS system you choose is flexible and will meet these needs . <p> When making a decision to buy an MSDS system or subscribe to a service you should understand how easy or difficult it will be to build your initial database and ensure it stays complete and up-to-date . You should know how much of this work you will have to do , and how much you want to turn over to your service provider . If you are doing the work in house , are tools provided to make it fast and easy ? Can updates be automated ? There will likely be compromise to balance simplicity , service , responsibility and cost . Determine your priorities and choose your service provider accordingly . <p> 5 . Is the system cost effective ? <p> Cost may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy an MSDS system at all , and in which of available offerings to purchase . It is important to consider cost from two angles . <p> First , how much is your current MSDS Management system actually costing you in administration , risk and liability , and how much of that can be reduced with an electronic system ? Be sure to consider all true costs in this analysis . These may include administration , time of employees when retrieving MSDS 's , employee safety liability , risk of punitive fines for non-compliance and other hard and soft costs . Contact Chemical Safety for a free worksheet that can help you determine actual MSDS management costs . <p> Second , what is the tradeoff between the benefits offered by a system and the cost of that system ? You may choose a comprehensive system that ' does it all ' , or look for a simpler system with a lower price . Some providers will work with you at different levels of cost/service , offering optional program expansion in the future . You will need to consider the pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online application provider , and between self-maintenance and full-service. @qwx70989 <p> On Thursday , April 13 , 2017 , the Bellagio Resort in Las Vegas had a fire .

@@1622332 <h> Peracetic Acid " is it an Environmentally Friendly Alternative to Chlorine ? <p> Concerns with chlorine disinfection have led to investigation of alternative disinfectants for use in the environmental arena . Are there environmentally safe alternatives to chlorine ? Is peracetic acid one among these ? Peracetic acid is one among several chemicals that have been touted as a replacement in recent years . Peracetic acid is very effective in killing bacteria , viruses , fungi , and spores over a wide pH and temperature range . Organic matter or storage time does not reduce the effectiveness of peracetic acid . The breakdown products of peracetic acid , hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid are reported to be environmentally friendly . This factor , along with recent improvements in stabilization techniques allowing longer storage periods and decreased costs have peaked the interest in peracetic acid as an alternative chemical for disinfection in the water and wastewater fields . Recent studies have discussed peracetic acid as an alternative chemical to chlorine for drinking water ; wastewater treatment plant effluent and combined sewer overflow ( CSO ) disinfection . Advantages of peracetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , and its ability to be effective in the presence of organic matter . Another advantage is the absence of disinfection byproducts , which has led water and wastewater treatment professionals to believe that a quenching facility ( i.e. , similar to dechlorination ) is not required . Our experience and research has shown that it is a very potent chemical that can have negative impacts . Due to its high potency , it is very important to use utmost caution when applying this in CSO or treatment plant effluent disinfection applications . One of the biggest advantages of peracetic acid , i.e. , its stability , is its greatest disadvantage in such applications . The breakdown products may be environmentally friendly , but it takes a very long time for peracetic acid to decompose . Stabilizers used in the preparation of peracetic acid enable dilute solutions to maintain activity for a number of days . Consequently , excess chemical used in effluent and/or CSO disinfection remains active for a long time and can negatively affect receiving waters , continuing to kill microorganisms unless the excess chemical is quenched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impacts of peracetic acid on microorganisms in the receiving water body and to evaluate the need for quenching .

Through their energy use , consumer behavior , and support for or opposition to climate policies , the public will play an important role in each nation 's effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions . <p> The American public 's climate change risk perceptions , policy preferences , and behavior are particularly important as the United States alone produces approximately 20% of global carbon emissions . With only 5% of the global population , the United States emits 19.10 tons of carbon dioxide per person per year , compared to 4.85 tons in China and 1.18 tons in India . <p> Generally , a majority of Americans have been somewhat concerned about the issue for many years . As a policy priority , however , global warming has always been lower than other economic and social issues . <p> For example , in 2009 the Pew Research Center found that only 30% of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new president , compared to 85% who said strengthening the economy should be a top priority . Similarly , only 35% of Americans considered global warming to be a very serious problem compared to 44% in 2008 . <p> However , research by the Yale Project on Climate Communication found that many more Americans now associate global warming with naysayer imagery , ranging from skepticism that global warming is real or a serious threat to outright conspiracy theories . In 2002 , only 7% of Americans provided naysayer associations ; by 2010 , however , this rose to over 20% . <p> Several factors may have contributed to these trends . Climate change seems distant and abstract to most Americans , while carbon dioxide , other greenhouse gases , and the impacts that have already been observed around the world are largely invisible and outside of most people 's direct experience . <p> The recent scandal , dubbed ' Climategate , ' over the unauthorized release of e-mails from several climate scientists in the United States and United Kingdom probably also had an important influence on public associations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ images are individual mental representations and feelings , they can not be separated from larger-scale political , economic , and cultural dynamics . <p> Risk-related affective images and connotative meanings diffuse through complex social networks where they are subject to reinterpretation , amplification , or attenuation by different actors within the social system . Some of these images are used by advocates in an attempt to increase public risk perceptions to motivate individual and collective action to mitigate risk , whereas other images are promulgated by opponents who seek to raise public doubts , dampen public concerns , and delay action . <p> Affective imagery analysis thus provides a powerful tool to measure , track , and explain shifting public perceptions of risk over time . @qwx70988 @qwx70989 <p> AGIs Multi-Electrode Switch Box is an accessory to the SuperSting Wi-Fi .

Hazardous wastes come in many physical shapes and forms , from PCBs to battery acid , paints and solvents . <p> Hazardous wastes ca n't be recycled , reused or safely disposed of in industrial or municipal landfills . They may be wastes left over from a complex manufacturing process such as making plastic or chemicals .

We 're an industry leader in handling and disposing of toxic , flammable , corrosive , oxidizing and other environmentally hazardous wastes . <p> Once widely used , PCBs are a very stable , non-corrosive and relatively nonflammable chemical substance . They are insoluble in water and act as excellent dielectric insulators and heat conductors . <p> These properties made PCBs a valuable industrial chemical used in a variety of products you could find all around you . PCBs were used most often in electrical transformers , capacitors and lamp ballasts . They were also used in caulking , carbonless paper , hydraulic fluids , printing inks , rubber , paint , sealants , adhesive and asphalt . <p> Yet few hazardous wastes cause greater concern than PCBs , or polychlorinated biphenyls . First manufactured in 1929 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered in remote and otherwise unpolluted areas . Brief exposure to PCBs poses a minimal health risk to humans and long-term effects are unknown , although it is known that PCBs accumulate in body tissues and are passed up the food chain . <p> So what exactly makes PCBs so bad ? <p> When burned between 250- Celsius and 750- Celsius , PCBs convert to PCDFs ( polychlorinated dibenzofurans , or furans ) , or PCDDs ( polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins , or dioxins ) , both of which pose serious risks to human and environmental health . In 1977 , PCBs were voluntarily banned by North America manufactures and importers , although PCBs are still found in electrical equipment still in use . <p> Because the natural breakdown of PCBs occurs very slowly over decades or even centuries , and its chemical stability makes it resistant to chemical or biological breakdown , disposing of PCBs has been a challenge to both governments and industries . For several decades , PCBs were stored in special storage facilities . <p> PCBs are treated in the Swan Hills Treatment Centre 's Incineration Facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for organic waste . The PCB waste is treated at the FBD Kiln , with a capacity of 35,000 tonnes per year . This high-temperature incineration system operates at temperatures up to 1,200- Celsius with secondary combustion chambers equipped with dual-fire burners . ( Reaching this temperature is essential in the destruction of PCBs , as burning at temperatures between 250- Celsius and 750- Celsius creates dioxins and furans . ) <p> Since its inception in 1987 the Swan Hills Treatment Centre has safely processed more than 295,000 metric tonnes of hazardous waste and over 2,000 different waste profiles . As a fully integrated world-class waste treatment facility it is capable of achieving complete treatment of all wastes with the exceptions of pathological , explosive and radioactive . A key feature of the Treatment Centres operation is that all wastes which are accepted by the facility are treated at one location with no need to ship residuals elsewhere . <p> The Plant Site was chosen in 1983 with construction and environmental monitoring beginning in 1985 . The Plant Site consists of a half section ( 320 acres ) of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste being shipped to the Treatment Centre , its chemical properties must be determined and a plan developed for its treatment . Documentation of the movement , treatment , and ultimate disposal of special waste is essential . Therefore , monitoring and cross-checking of a special waste from the initial enquiry from the generator through collection , transportation , treatment and disposal binds the various parts of the System together and ensures a successful waste management program . This ' cradle to grave ' care concept is achieved by the use of various management systems including waste profile sheets , transportation manifests and waste ' fingerprinting ' . <p> Waste is delivered to the facility by bulk truck or in containers with drums . Incoming loads are weighed and sent to off-loading areas which are equipped for waste sampling , drum processing , and tankage . The waste is sampled and a ' fingerprint ' analysis is performed to verify that the waste is representative of that specified by the generator . The Treatment Centre can refuse to accept waste which does not match that initially specified by the generator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially designed transport containers or in storage buildings while awaiting processing . On site drum storage has the capacity of approximately 17,500 drums . <p> The Facility has the capacity to destroy a total of 45,000 tonnes per year , through one of the three process facilities . The selection of the technology to be used is dependent upon the contaminant in the waste . An array of processes are in place to support these three technologies either by preparing the waste for treatment or by disposing of the treated residue . <p> Incineration organic waste ( in solid , liquid or sludge forms ) is destroyed in the incinerator at temperatures up to 1200 C ; acid gases and particulate matter is scrubbed from the resulting flue gases in a multi-stage process ; bottom ash and flyash are stabilized and placed in secure on-site landfill cells . <p> Physical/Chemical inorganic liquids are chemically neutralized and filtered to remove solids .

@@1622346 <p> Reverse osmosis ( RO ) and nanofiltration ( NF ) are membrane filtration technologies that are designed to remove solute ions and molecules from a pretreated liquid stream . Well-designed RO/NF units are compact and demand relatively little maintenance , making them an attractive alternative to conventional treatment trains . <p> Even despite the merits of todays efficient RO/NF technologies , it pays to understand common pitfalls associated with them . If your facility currently uses RO/NF or is considering purchasing an RO or NF system , the following article will help you to understand the most common problems impacting reverse osmosis and nanofiltration , and some possible solutions . <p> RO/NF membrane fouling <p> Fouling occurs when contaminants collect on the surface of a filtration membrane and restrict the flow of water through the membranes pores . With the smallest pore sizes of any membrane filtration technology , RO/NF are particularly prone to premature membrane fouling . Without adequate pretreatment and process monitoring steps in place , RO/NF membrane fouling can reduce unit service life , compromise permeate quality , and increase operational costs . <p> Preventative steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contaminants present in the process or waste stream . Common types of fouling include : <p> Particulate and colloidal fouling <p> Particulate fouling occurs when solid materials build up on a filtration membrane surface , forming a cake layer that blocks water from flowing through the membranes pores . In many cases increased pressure differential measurements provide early indication of particulate fouling in RO/NF membranes . Common particulate contaminants include bacteria , viruses , sediment , macromolecules , iron oxides , salts , and colloidal silica . In many cases , particulate fouling of RO/NF units can be prevented by applying appropriate upstream filtration , which can include media filtration , microfiltration ( MF ) , and/or ultrafiltration ( UF ) , depending on the sizes and geometric shapes of particles present . <p> For streams with colloidal particles , it is sometimes necessary to apply an inorganic coagulant to separate out suspended solids . Commonly-used coagulants include aluminum sulfate , aluminum chloride , sodium aluminate , and ferric chloride , and the use of each will vary depending upon the contaminants present in the feed stream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as coagulants can also lead to RO/NF membrane fouling if allowed to proceed downstream , where they can react with antiscalants or other substances and collect on the membrane . <p> Biofouling <p> Biofouling is a process where microorganisms , plants , algae or other biological contaminants grow on RO/NF membrane elements , forming a layer known as biofilm . As biofilm accumulates on the membrane surface , greater pressure is needed to force water through , resulting in higher energy costs , and eventual damage to the RO/NF membrane element . Key symptoms of biofouling include increased differential pressure from feed to concentrate , and decreased membrane flux . <p> Fouling-resistant membranes that prevent microbials from clinging to the RO/NF element . <p> Scaling or precipitation fouling <p> Scaling or precipitation fouling occurs when membrane pores are blocked by crystallized salts , oxides , or hydroxides that have precipitated from solution . Scaling is among the most common forms of fouling in RO/NF elements , especially by divalent calcium ( Ca2+ ) and Magnesium ( Mg2+ ) ions . Like other forms of fouling , scaling and precipitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , over time , can irreversibly damage membrane elements . <p> Many of the common problems impacting RO/NF can be avoided through careful design that takes process conditions into account . While we 've already discussed how pretreatment is essential for minimizing operational and maintenance issues , care must also be given to other system design elements , including : <p> Flux : Flux is the volume of water to pass through a membrane in a given amount of time , often expressed as the number of gallons of water per square foot of membrane per day ( Gfd ) . Flux is used to determine the number of membrane elements needed for an application , and is affected by feed water quality , temperature , and salt concentration . <p> Flow rate : Generally measured in gallons per minute ( GPM ) , feed and permeate flow rates are critical measures for efficient RO/NF operation . Good RO/NF system design takes water source into account , for example , when processing surface waters with high colloids , an optimal flow rate may be 10 14 GPM/ft2 of membrane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure vessels in an RO/NF system . An array can entail multiple stages , with multiple pressure vessels in each stage . Generally speaking , the higher a recovery rate demanded by a facility , the greater the number of stages in its array . <p> A trusted engineer can help you to weigh these and other factors to achieve optimal RO/NF performance , maintenance , and energy costs , both immediately and in the long term . @qwx70989 <p> Industry , hotels , commercial buildings even private homes in " Hard " water areas are at a disadvantage due to " Scale " formation on devices , particularly those attached to " Hot " water circuits .

Corn pellet is a renewable and abundant resource that can be burned to produce significant heat . <p> 2 . Availability <p> The availability of both corn pellets and wood pellets depends on the location . Wood pellets are made of sawdust , wood chips , bark , agricultural crop waste , waste paper and other organic materials . These wood pellets are most readily available in the northeast and northwest of United States . <p> Corn pellets , obviously , are most readily available in areas where corn is grown , primarily in Midwest . Therefore , corn pellets are inexpensive and easy to obtain in Midwest . But in areas where corn would have to be brought in , such as New England states , the cost may be much higher . And of course , price depends mainly on the crop that year and will be likely vary from year to year . When choosing between corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country should be considered . <p> 3 . Function <p> Wood pellets are burned in pellet stoves . The wood pellets are placed in the hopper of the wood stove . An auger , or corkscrew shaped device , controls the amount of wood pellets that being placed into the burning chamber . This determines the amount of heat produced . <p> Corn pellets can be burned in a corn stove or a multi-fuel stove . A corn stove works in the same way except that corn pellets are used to produce the heat . Multi-fuel stoves have the ability to burn corn pellets as well as wood pellets . <p> 4 . Storage <p> Wood pellets must be transported and stored in dry condition . They are usually sold in plastic bags . It is not wise to leave the bags exposed outdoor , or even in an indoor damp environment . Water and dampness will affect the performance of wood pellets , so dry garage , shed , basement or storage room is preferred . <p> The storage of corn pellets , as opposed to wood pellets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a hassle unless you have a spare garage , a silo or another large area . The corn pellets may attract insects , rats and other rodents if they are stored in an open area for a long period of time . So they should be stored in an airtight plastic or metal container to prevent these problems . <p> The Benefits of Wood Pellets and Corn Pellets <p> The top benefit of burning corn or wood pellets is that they are renewable sources . Their economic benefits make each a popular heating source . Burning either source in a pellet stove requires no chimney . <p> Low cost is one of the biggest benefits of using corn pellets , depending on where you live . Corn pellets are clean burning , making them eco-friendly . One additional plus is that corn pellets will give off a sweet , delectable aroma from the smoke billowing outside home . Wood pellets have their own positive traits . Wood is much more widely available as raw material . And wood pellets are even better than corn pellets as a fuel source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small amount of ash . <p> Tips <p> Although we get the same amount of heat from corn pellets as from wood pellets and the cost may be less , corn pellets do have some drawbacks . There is more ash left after burning . Besides , the stove for corn pellets requires more maintenance because of clinkers , which are formed when the sugars in corn are burned and cooled , producing a substance that is very hard and will not burn up . Some special stoves are designed to automatically clear the clinkers , while others must be cleared regularly by hands . <p> Wood pellets and corn Pellets are natural and renewable energy sources that provide an efficient , reliable and affordable way to heat your home .

The AGC was introduced in 1966 with approximately 64KB of memory , and it operated at 0.043MHz and weighed in at a mere 70 pounds ( think of a toaster with start/stop/defrost buttons that would require ' Team Lift ' stickers on the box ) yet was able to guide astronauts from the Earth to the Moon and back . <p> Computer technology is constantly improving , making programs more responsive ( requiring more RAM ) , graphics more intense ( requiring better graphics cards ) , and documents larger and more complex than before ( requiring more storage capabilities ) .

We wanted to share an example of how investing in new technology can make a big difference for your company : <p> An ' Oldie ' but a ' Goodie ' <p> Recently , we were contacted by a customer looking for some spare parts . The company loves the dependability of their thermal oxidizer ( which was originally comissioned 20 years ago ) and the relatively low maintenance it requires ( they have handled their own maintenance for the better part of those 20 years , with only a few service calls needed from CPI when they required some additional expertise ) . While going through an inventory audit , the customer relaized they did not have some of the critical spare parts on hand .

The current operator interface had been discontinued by the manufacturer over ten years ago . This presented the customer with a dilemma . As with many components , it would be possible to find a " used " or " refurbished " interface on Ebay , but did they want to depend on a used component to keep their facility operating ? They might have been able to get lucky and source a " new in box " original PLC processor ; however , even if they were able to find a new part , did it make sense to purchase technology that has been phased out , with little chance of finding a replacement if it fails in the near future ? <p> Ultimately , it made more sense to replace the PLC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured today . By upgrading to the latest technology , the customer was able to utilize more capabilities and features than he did 20 years ago . Data was available at a push of a button , including the ability to view the oxidizer status remotely and trend amp usage , gas usage , and temperature profiles with a single click . <p> With this new interface in place , the system was no longer under the threat of shutting the plant down in the case of a failure . With replacement parts readily available , the customer was able to have the peace of mind that their operations would be able to continue running . <p> You may want to consider an Engineering Assessment or refresher training in operations and maintenance .

@@1622362 <p> ABSTRACTThe earthquake that generated the great Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004 is estimated to have released the energy of 23,000 Hiroshima-type atomic bombs , according to the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) . The earthquake occurred on December 26 , 2004 was an undersea earthquake originated in the Indian Ocean off the western coast Indonesia and generated tsunamis that were among the worst disasters in modern history . At a magnitude of 9.0 , it was the largest earthquake since the 9.2 magnitude earthquake off Alaska in 1964 . The earthquake was the result of the sliding of the portion of the Earth 's crust known as the India plate under the section called the Burma plate . Tsunamis have been relatively rare in the Indian Ocean . They are most prevalent in the Pacific . The Indian Ocean tsunami caused waves as high as 50 feet ( 15 meters ) in some places , according to news reports . The resulting tsunamis devastated the shores of Indonesia , Sri Lanka , India , Thailand and other countries even reaching the east coast of Africa some 2800 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh water supplies and the soil by salt water infiltration and deposition of a salt layer over arable land . It has been reported that in the Maldives , 16 to 17 coral reef atolls that were overcome by sea waves are totally without fresh water and could be rendered inhabitable for decades . Uncountable wells that served communities were invaded by sea , sand and earth ; and aquifers were invaded through porous rock . Salted-over soil becomes sterile , and it is difficult and costly to restore for agriculture . It also causes the death of plants and important soil micro-organisms . <p> The flood waters of the Tsunami contaminated water supply systems and in many cases destroyed . Millions of people lack safe water and are at risk of potentially deadly water borne diseases like cholera , diarrhea , malaria and typhoid . With over 150,000 people dead from the Tsunami , waterborne epidemics or out breaks is a major concern ( WHO , 2004 ) . After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , contaminated water supplies and infrastructure destruction threatened the lives of many survivors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ septic tanks and causing their contents to contaminate ground and surface water . Seawater also penetrated into groundwater tables , making the water unfit for human consumption . The tsunami also destroyed rural water supply systems across the region . The impact of the Asian Tsunami related to water environment can be described in three time frames : immediate , medium-term and long-term . Immediate impacts include physical destruction of water and wastewater treatment plants , supply pipes and sewers . Some plants not physically destroyed can be severely affected by power failures and worker unavailability . Immediate impacts include cross contamination of water supplies , salt and silt in supply sources makes water unusable for consumption and possible contaminations from biological ( human and animal corpses , dead vegetation etc ) sources . Aquifer contamination by salt water is one of the severe long term impacts and also the most difficult to treat . Other long term impacts may include pollution from chemical and oil spills . The United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) estimated that the recent Indian Ocean tsunami extensively damaged Indonesia 's coastal environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ecosystem functions . <p> INTRODUCTIONDrinking water is cited as a health priority in most emergencies . Much of the drinking water response to the Indian Ocean tsunami focused on providing a sufficient quantity of water , with perhaps less focus on quality . Following a disaster , there is enormous pressure on political leaders and public health officials to take disease control interventions mainly spread through contaminated water . The tsunami raised unique challenges for those involved in these efforts . <p> In most respects the profile of a tsunami resembles that of a flood caused by a hurricane or cyclone . Therefore , disaster response guides consider Tsunamis as floods although the hydrological and engineering issues associated with saline water infiltration are vastly different . Innovative solutions were often necessary to deal with the special circumstancespresented by the aftermath of the Tsunami disaster . <p> After a Tsunami , subsurface pressure wave precedes the surface wave and causes an upward movement of the freshwater lens . Water levels in wells rise . Previously fresh parts of the aquifer turn brackish . When the area is completely flooded and saline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permeable soils . Salt water fills wells and enters the aquifer . Other pollutants present on the surface are spread with the water and will also contaminate the groundwater . When the floodwater recedes and saline water remains in pools and puddles , increasing the duration of the infiltration .

@@1622368 <h> Nitrogen Refrigerated Trucks a New Trend ? An Alternative to Diesel Powered Refrigeration <p> Nitrogen Refrigerated Trucks a New Trend ? An Alternative to Diesel Powered Refrigeration <p> Thanks to technological innovations , the food distribution industry has a greener way to protect refrigerated food during transit : Nitrogen refrigeration . The existing system relies on diesel-powdered mechanical refrigeration units . Although these units are effective , they release significant levels of noise and air pollution . While the new innovations decrease emissions to safeguard the environment , there is a hidden health risk transportation companies must take into account . <p> How Liquid Nitrogen Refrigeration Works <p> The new system uses a liquid nitrogen system to cryogenically chill food . A storage tank mounted underneath the truck can be easily refilled when empty . Since the tank is stored outside the truck , the liquid nitrogen never comes into direct contact with the food . <p> To cool the refrigerated container , liquid nitrogen first passes through a heat exchanger . As the nitrogen moves through the heat exchanger , it evaporates . High-powered fans inside the container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all food safely chilled below the temperature danger zone . <p> The traditional mechanical refrigeration system emits significant noise while in operation . Even when the truck itself is off , the refrigeration unit can cause as much as 80 dB of noise , which is roughly as much noise as a busy urban environment . This noise level exceeds the typical noise pollution levels in cities , thus limiting the hours when truckers can make deliveries . Additional downsides to the mechanical refrigeration system include reliance on harmful refrigeration chemicals and expensive maintenance and repair costs . <p> In contrast , the liquid nitrogen system falls beneath the noise pollution thresholds , so deliveries can be made at any time . This benefits both truckers and restaurants , grocery stores , and other businesses who may want to accept deliveries outside of business hours . <p> The liquid nitrogen system , or N2 system , also reduces carbon dioxide emissions significantly and does not use harmful refrigerants to keep food cool . Transportation companies who want to green their image or offer their clients increased flexibility will enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cryogenic system reduces costs and pollution associated with mechanical refrigeration , the N2 system is not perfect . Liquid nitrogen does pose a safety risk if it comes into contact with the food or the environment . If a truck rollover accident caused a nitrogen spill , for example , individual health and environmental dangers abound . <p> If the nitrogen gas seeps into the load chamber in the accident , it could turn the truck chamber into an oxygen deficient environment . Staff who opened the truck chamber to check on their load could become dizzy , pass out , and die within minutes of entering the oxygen deficient space . <p> The liquid nitrogen itself has cryogenic properties , which is why it 's been used to freeze off cancerous cells and warts . A worker cleaning up the spill must take precautions to avoid getting liquid nitrogen on their skin . In a worst-case scenario , an employee could lose a finger if it was immersed in liquid nitrogen . <p> How to Safeguard Truckers Against Liquid Nitrogen Dangers <p> An O2 deficiency monitor , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangers posed by liquid nitrogen . These monitors continually measure the amount of oxygen in the load chamber . When the cryogenic system is working properly , oxygen will naturally remain at safe levels and the alarm will stay silent yet vigilant . In the event that nitrogen gas leaks into the load chamber -- due to a system malfunction or an accident - oxygen levels will start dropping . Once the environmental oxygen levels falls below OSHA thresholds , the oxygen monitor will flash and sound an alarm . This notifies staff that safety hazards exist , so they will not open the load chamber and enter an oxygen deficient environment . <p> Since staff can succumb to asphyxiation within minutes , the O2 deficiency monitor is necessary to monitor system performance and keep employees safe if anything goes wrong . Since nitrogen is invisible and odorless , employees have no other way to know whether the system 's operating as it should or whether there is an N2 leak . <p> Oxygen monitors from PureAire use zirconium oxide sensors , which provide reliable service for 10+ years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx70989 <p> The SituationA major pipeline company has large storage tank farms throughout the Western States .

@@1622384 <p> NextEra Energy CEO and chairman Jim Robo made an unusual visit with Texas regulators last week , stopping by the Texas Public Utilities Commission ( PUC ) in an emergency session to help shore up support for NextEras $18.7 billion purchase of Oncor Electric Delivery Company , the states largest utility . <p> Robo said he had made the visit after learning the PUC had concerns about NextEras out-of-state credentials . He highlighted his Texas ties , noting his wife is from Dallas and that he has in-laws in Waco , and that he had only Texas best interests at heart . <p> " Theres been a lot of talk and discussion about how Oncor is a gem , and I could n't agree more , " Robo said . " Ive been very clear I love the Oncor management team . I 've asked every one of them to stay .

PUC staff , industrial customers , cities , and consumers are pushing for stronger protections , which NextEra is resisting . <p> " NextEra Energy proposes transactions funded with high levels of debt that would significantly increase NextEra Energys debt as a percentage of total capitalization , while removing the protective ring fencing currently protecting Oncor , " PUC staff wrote . <p> Robo repeatedly used the term " deal-killers " to refer to protections PUC staff and other stakeholders have called for . The term was also used by PUC chairwoman Donna Nelson . <p> " The question still remains whether your deal-killers and our deal-killers match , " said Donna Nelson , PUC chairwoman .

@@1622386 <p> There is much confusion about how to define PM10 particulate , but if articles indicate the definitions they used then the information can be compared with information from other studies .

This takes density , shape and statistical averaging into account . <p> Particulate Matter with a d50 aerodynamic diameter of less than 7 micron ( Mining in South Africa ) .

It is important to remember though that the ratio of RSPM to SPM will be specific to an area and the measurement of the one should be able to infer the other if the ratio has been experimentally determined , ( excluding air pollution modelling ) . <p> At some stage the definition should be standardised so that apples can be compared to apples . <p> DustWatch particulate matter equipment measures SPM ( suspended particulate matter ) , and is designed to have a cut-off at 100 micron , so that the maximum particle size collected is as close to 100 micron as possible .

@@1622397 <p> Gas detector tubes are easy to use , are low cost , and the method is intrinsically safe , allowing it to be deployed in all industries . Because detector tubes do n't  require calibration , users see the benefits of this technology over electronic gas detectors due to their ease of use . <p> Gas detector tubes are most effective as a reference device for conducting spot checks , which gives an idea of present gas at that moment in time . <p> Gas detector tubes are perfect for any newcomers to gas detection or for those who are looking for a cost effective solution to gas detection where they do n't know what hazardous substances are present . <p> What is the purpose of gas detector tubes ? <p> The gas detector tube system is a complete sampling and analysis system for determining hazardous gas and vapour concentrations quickly and easily . The majority of activities that the detector tube system is used for is to carry out spot sampling e.g. to check the level of hazardous gas within a container that has been unloaded from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-site . <p> It is not advised to use detector tubes for personal safety as they do n't  provide an alarm or warning system . <p> What are gas detector tubes ? <p> Gas detection or gas detector tubes as they 're known are glass tubes that are filled with chemical reagent that absorbs and reacts with the target gas or vapour being measured as part of a gas detection programme . A colorimetric stain ( a colour change ) is created . For most detector tubes , the concentration is read directly from the measurement scale on each tube . The detector tube system is comprised of a handheld air sampling pump and detector tubes . <p> How do detector tube system technologies vary ? <p> Gastec and Drager tubes use the same colorimetric technology where the chemical reagent in the gas tube reacts to the gas sample as it is drawn through the tube . <p> The main difference between Gastec and Drager is the gas sampling pump technique . <p> Gastec utilises an effective piston style pump that requires minimal effort which pulls air through the detector tube @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gastec pump . At the other end of the Gastec pump there is a small handle that comfortably fits between your middle and index finger . This is pulled up to draw the sample and clicks once the sample is complete . <p> Drager utilises a bellow style pump ( shaped similar to a stapler ) . When the bellows are released , the air is drawn and the gas sample to be measured is sucked through the detector tube in use . <p> How is gas detected using the gas detector tube system ? <p> The detector tubes are generally supplied in packs of ten , and are sealed at both ends . In operation , the tips are broken off using a tube tip breaker , a neat function often within the hand pump or otherwise sold as a separate item . Gas detector tubes are used with a handheld air sampling pump . Depending on the manufacturer , the pump utilises either a bellows or piston design . The pump connects to one end of the detector tube and the user draws a sample of 50ml @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample works its way up the tube towards the pump , it reacts with the chemical reagent within the tube such that the change produced is proportional in length to the concentration . By using a calibration scale printed on the tube , the concentration may be read immediately , without the need for laboratory analysis . The point where this reaction stops is easily read off against markings on the gas detector tube . <p> What range do the detector tubes measure at ? <p> For many gases and vapours , there are several concentration ranges available ( ppm , % , Mg/m3 , mg/l ) giving you the flexibility to measure both low and high concentrations without sacrificing precision . <p> Which gases do detector tubes detect ? <p> Gas detector tubes are available to measure more than 500 different kinds of gases and vapours including the following : <p> Acetaldehyde <p> Acetic Acid <p> Acetone <p> Ammonia <p> Benzene <p> Bromine <p> Carbon Dioxide <p> Fluorine <p> Formaldehyde <p> Hydrogen <p> Hydrogen Chloride <p> Hydrogen Cyanide <p> Hydrogen Sulphide <p> MEK-Methyl Ethyl Ketone <p> Mercaptans <p> Nitrogen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Toluene <p> Xylene <p> What do the most popular detector tubes test for ? <p> Hydrogen Sulphide and Carbon Monoxide are our most popular detector tube types .

All standard detector tubes are priced at the same price no matter the detection range . There are 8 different Carbon Monoxide detector tube range types . <p> Do detector tubes offer STEL and TWA readings ? <p> Short Term Exposure Limit ( STEL ) <p> STEL detector tubes accurately measure gas concentration for occupational hygiene and compliance with laws and guideline standards . The short term tubes account for the lion share of available tubes ( standard tubes ) . <p> Time-Weighted Average ( TWA ) <p> TWA tubes provide gas samples for up to eight hours .

@@1622399 <p> Harr Technologies , owned and founded by Bob Harr , has developed a revolutionary method for cleaning and restoring clogged and damaged culverts . It all started a few years ago when Bob Harr noticed county workers open cutting a road to remove a clogged culvert . After further observation around his hometown in Colorado , Bob Harr noticed road washouts and failures due to clogged and damaged culverts. @qwx70988 <p> After seeing a need for an efficient and effective way to clean these clogged culverts , Harr spent much time researching and developing culvert cleaning attachments for his horizontal directional drill(HDD) . After much testing and tool modification , Harr had developed a set of tools and a revolutionary methodology to effectively clean clogged culverts . <p> During the past few years , Harr and licensed contractors have marketed and demonstrated this process to railroads , DOTs , counties , municipalities and other entities and have developed a new industry for culvert cleaning using HDD technology . To expand this industry , Harr has licensed contractors throughout the United States to use his patented tooling and methodologies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withing their assigned districts . <p> Box configuration is specifically designed for box culverts made of single or multiple cells . The box pull bucket comes with two extensions to accommodate for different culvert sizes . Featuring a simple , yet reliable locking mechanism , extensions can be easily connected and disconnected within minutes . The operator drills a pilot hole through a clogged culvert , connects a pull bucket to the drill pipe on the other end , and pulls back unwanted debris . <p> The round pull bucket is designed for round culverts . It comes in several sizes to accommodate for different diameter culvers . It works in a similar manner as the box pull bucket . An operator drills a pilot hole through a clogged culvert , connects a pull bucket to the drill pipe on the other end , and pulls back unwanted debris . <p> Push bucker specifically designed to push material out the far end of the culvert .

It can also function as a scoop removing material bucket full at a time . <p> Barrel reamer is designed to loosen and remove heavy material located in the culvert . By utilizing rotational force and push force of horizontal directional drill , a barrel reamer is pushed trough a culvert while rotating . This allows to loosen compressed debris and forces it out of a culvert . It comes in several sizes to accommodate for different diameter culvers . <p> Brush tool is designed to fine clean a culvert . Designed and constructed with heavy-duty materials , this brush can withstand extensive abrasions . Featuring a large industrial metal brush that is very effective at cleaning clay , sand , gravel , as well as removing debris . It comes in several sizes to accommodate for different diameter culvers . <p> With the awareness of environmental hazards detailed by federal and local regulations , it is important that drainage structures are properly maintained . In the past these structures have not been given the attention they deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has resulted in damages to the structures themselves , roads , ditches , personal property and even people . One of the main reasons organizations have not maintained their structures is due to the lack of efficient and effective culvert cleaning methods . Open cutting a road , jetter trucks , backhoes and cables are all methods that have been used to clean culverts in the past . Each of these methods have their shortcomings . <p> During HARR 's development , he did a head-to-head competition with his process and a jetter truck . He found a culvert with 2 pipes . He cleaned the first pipe with the jet truck and completed the cleaning in 6.5 hours and used 1200 gallons of water . The second pipe he cleaned with his method and was done in 40 minutes and used 110 gallons of water . <p> When using a jetter truck , potentially thousands of gallons of water can be used to effectively clean a culvert . HARR 's method will use a fraction of that . For example , a 60 ' culvert with a diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using between 100-250 gallons of water . Using HARR 's method the water usage and pressure are controlled by the drill operator . The water is pumped through the drill stem to the culvert cleaning attachments . <p> The culvert cleaning tools are built out of a mild steel that will not damage the interior of the culvert . Using a directional drill allows the operator to control the rotation of the tools . This is very important especially when a failure or void is encountered . With total control the operator will be able to back out the tool to determine where the failure is . <p> Using a directional drill gives the operator complete control of the debris within a culvert . With controlled pullback and thrust speeds the operator can remove as little or as much material as they want at a controlled speed . This will allow for the material to be shovelled , excavated or vacuumed as it is being removed from the culvert . Using a pull bucket or push bucket , material can be removed from either end of a culvert.

Reducing air pollution could save millions of lives . <p> New estimates <p> In particular , the new data reveal a stronger link between both indoor and outdoor air pollution exposure and cardiovascular diseases , such as strokes and ischaemic heart disease , as well as between air pollution and cancer . This is in addition to air pollutions role in the development of respiratory diseases , including acute respiratory infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases . <p> The new estimates are not only based on more knowledge about the diseases caused by air pollution , but also upon better assessment of human exposure to air pollutants through the use of improved measurements and technology .

@@1622406 <h> Stripper Wells goes from 1 BBL to 15 BBL for less $100/day <p> Feb 2017 , Jenfitch , LLC working with a private independent oil service firm from Houston , Texas recently conducted a field study on four different low producing oil wells ( Stripper Wells ) in Pecos County , TX . These wells were generating 1-2 barrels of oil per day . Using several different methods of injecting JC 9450 into the well , the production increased up to 15 barrels per day for 5 days and then dropped to 10 barrels per day for two weeks . The service operator then injected 5 gallons per day of JC 9450 into the well casing . The well continued to generate 15 barrels every 12 hours of operations . Hydrogen sulfide was eliminated in the gas phase and liquid phase . Paraffin and asphaltenes were known to be a problem in the system were minimized . JC 9450 changed the surface structure of paraffin and asphaltenes so that it would not form a deposit . The produced water from the operation was tested for iron , bacteria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of iron , bacteria , and hydrogen sulfide . It was observed that the produced water looked cleaner . <p> Stripper Wells are defined as oil ( or gas ) well with an average production of 15 barrels or less per day of oil or gas equivalent . The average production from a stripper well as stated in a study conducted by The National Stripper Well Association ( NWSA ) is 1-2 barrels per day . In the US , NWSA estimates there are over 770,000 stripper wells operating that contributes 11.3% of the US oil production and 8.3% of US Gas production . Most of the stripper wells sit on top of untapped resources . It is estimated between 50- 70% of the oil beneath the stripper well can not be removed for three reasons : 1 ) pressure , 2 ) permeability and 3 ) paraffin . As these fields begin to produce oil or gas at the wellbore , the pressure begins to drop , resulting in lower production . With the amount of thermal energy ( heat ) entering the wellbore , you see a drop-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begins to cross its cloud point threshold and paraffin crystals start to precipitate as the oil moves from the pore space to the wellbore opening . If a wells flowrate is high enough , the continuing thermal mass of the oil entering the wellbore can keep the paraffin in solution , so that the buildup on the wellbore is kept to a minimum . If the flow rate decreases , the paraffin will create a thick deposit in the wellbore which will further inhibit the flow oil . An additional factor is the biofilm in the wellbore and formation . The biofilm will provide additional sites for paraffin to deposit . A biofilm generates a sticky material called extracellular polymeric substance ( EPS ) . The EPS attracts the paraffin crystals , asphaltenes and iron sulfide to form a deposit on any surface <p> JC 9450 is a new technology that use reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) to form a strong oxidizing agent that quickly reacts with hydrogen sulfide , iron sulfide , biofilm , and bacteria .

@@1622413 <h> Reverse Osmosis : How Does It Figure Into a Dialysis Water System ? <p> Better than 95% of all dialysis centers use water purification equipment to purify water for dialysis . The centerpiece of these water purification systems has become reverse osmosis . In conjunction with sound pretreatment , RO has proven itself to be the safest , most reliable , and most economical method of purifying water for dialysis . <p> Water plays an important , life-sustaining role for dialysis patients . And as such , the water used for this critical function must be of special quality . <p> When hemodialysis started to blossom over 20 years ago , many dialysis centers used water right from the tap . We now know that certain contaminants in water supplies can cause severe complications in dialysis patients . Sophisticated water purification systems are currently used to purify water to a level determined to be safe for the patients . And the critical piece of equipment in these water purification systems is the reverse osmosis ( RO ) machine . <p> THE NUTS AND BOLTS <p> Simply stated , RO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salt ions from a solution ( typically water ) . The membrane sieves organic molecules and repels salt ions while passing pure water through the micropores in its surface . <p> The driving force behind RO is pressure , which is typically supplied by a centrifugal pump . This pressure is needed to overcome the inherent osmotic pressure of the solution and to supply enough energy to force water through membrane pores which are only about 5 angstroms in diameter ( by comparison , a human hair has a diameter of about 500,000 angstroms ) . <p> The basic components of an RO system are the prefilter , a pump , and sepralators ( spiral-wound membrane elements ) . The sepralators are placed in stainless steel or PVC housings , which are then manifolded together . <p> RO systems operate in a crossflow mode whereby a single stream is fed into the RO and flows across the membrane surface . Two streams exit--the permeate and the concentrate . The permeate stream contains the water which passes through the membrane and is purified . The concentrate stream contains the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass through the membrane ; the concentrate is typically plumbed to drain . <p> The advantage of operating in the crossflow mode is that it minimizes plugging of the very small membrane pores . However , as a result of crossflow operation , only a percentage of the feed is collected as permeate . This ratio of the permeate to the feed is called the ' recovery ' of the RO . Though it would seem that one would want to have as high a recovery as possible , there is a trade off--the higher the recovery goes , the poorer the permeate quality becomes . In practice , the majority of RO systems producing less than 15,000 gallons of permeate per day operate at 33% or 50% recovery . <p> QUALITY , RELIABILITY , ECONOMY <p> A typical water purification system for dialysis is shown in Figure 1 . The raw city water is fed through a water softener , which removes calcium and magnesium ions . Softeners also remove small amounts of iron ; however , if a significant amount of iron is present , additional treatment should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suspended solids exist , a backwashable sand filter should be installed upstream of the softener . <p> After the softener , activated carbon tanks are employed ( many times , in series ) to remove chloramine , chlorine , and trace organics . It is important to keep the chloramine or chlorine in the system up to this point in order to minimize the chance of bacterial growth . <p> Next comes the RO machine , which typically removes 90% to 95+ % of the dissolved salts . RO also removes bacteria and pyrogens as well as 99+ % of organic molecules over 200 daltons in molecular weight . In some cases where the raw water has a very high level of dissolved solids , a second RO machine in series or an ion exchange unit after the RO may be used to lower the dissolved solids level to an acceptable number . <p> One component missing from the water system depicted in Figure 1 is storage . Most new dialysis centers , however , are staying away from storage tanks , preferring instead the ' direct feed ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loop , which serves the dialyzers . This minimizes stagnant areas where bacteria can establish . In many cases , the unused water is recirculated back to the inlet of the RO . This lowers the feedwater dissolved solids level and thus gives an even higher quality permeate . <p> What level of water quality is necessary for dialysis ? The Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation ( AAMI ) has set forth water standards as guidelines for dialysis centers to follow . These standards list maximum levels for ions found in water as well as for heavy metals and bacteria ( see Table 1 ) . Adoption of these standards had been voluntary in the past , but now , dialysis centers are required to meet these standards in order to be reimbursed by the government . In fact , many physicians , nurses , and dialysis technicians feel that these standards are not strict enough and require water for their facilities that is much purer than the AAMI standards . <p> The trend is definitely toward higher purity for dialysis water . So , the question becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water which meets or exceeds the AAMI standards ? In a very small number of U.S. communities , the natural water supply meets AAMI standards . However , this amounts to less than 5% of the cases , making water treatment necessary for over 95% of dialysis centers . <p> RO vs . DI <p> When choosing which types of water treatment equipment to use , some decisions are easier than others . For instance , water softeners and activated carbon tanks have few alternatives , none of which are simple , inexpensive , and reliable . Choosing the RO machine , on the other hand , is a much more complex task . First of all , some centers choose to go with an alternative to RO known as ion exchange or deionization ( DI ) . Some centers originally used DI , but many of them have since installed RO upstream of or in lieu of the DI . <p> Basically , DI removes ions from water via electrochemical attraction to a charged resin . The resin is contained in a fiberglass or steel tank . The DI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it reaches its capacity , the tank must be taken off-line and regenerated with concentrated acid and caustic . The DI can be regenerated either on-site or off-site . Most centers have regeneration done off-site so that they do not have to keep the concentrated chemicals on-site , handle them , and dispose of them . <p> Comparing RO to DI shows advantages for each . As previously stated , RO will remove bacteria and pyrogen ; DI does not remove pyrogen and , in some cases , can actually bring about increases in the bacteria and pyrogen levels . For this reason , when DI is employed , a membrane filter or an ultrafiltration ( UF ) machine is used downstream to capture bacteria . <p> DI will typically have a lower capital cost than RO , but the operating costs of DI are far greater than for RO . The DI operating costs are mainly for the acid and caustic , and if the DI tanks are regenerated off-site , a charge for labor and freight to and from the local regeneration facility is also levied . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water , about twice as much as the cost for RO . <p> The main operating cost for RO is the electricity used to run the high-pressure pump . Other costs include changing the membrane elements approximately every 3 years and cleaning the RO every 4-8 weeks . These costs typically add up to $1-1.50 per thousand gallons of water , about 50% of the cost of DI . <p> RO is usually chosen over DI by dialysis centers because of the operating cost difference plus the fact that RO is such a good bacteria and pyrogen filter . As previously mentioned , if the feedwater has a high dissolved solids level or a high concentration of one specific contaminant , a second RO in series or a DI unit operating on the RO permeate is needed . The operating costs of DI fed with RO permeate are far less than DI fed with untreated water . <p> The major choice when purchasing an RO unit is which type of membrane to use . The two primary RO membrane types are cellulose acetate ( CA ) and polyamide ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CA membrane is tolerant to chlorine disinfection treatments and is relatively inexpensive . PA membrane is not tolerant to chlorine and it costs significantly more than CA . PA membrane also generally has a higher salt rejection than CA , so if the permeate quality is borderline with CA , PA may work better . <p> Most dialysis centers use activated carbon to remove chlorine from the city water , so there is no need to worry about chlorine destroying the PA membrane . However , many centers disinfect their water loop with chlorine , and this can cause problems with PA systems . In addition , other disinfectants such as formaldehyde are being phased out due to exposure problems . One disinfectant which has shown promise for compatibility with PA membrane is peracetic acid ; CA can be sanitized with chlorine , formaldehyde , and peracetic acid . It is also much easier to disinfect an RO containing CA membrane than one using PA membrane . <p> Since neither CA nor PA membrane has proven itself superior in all situations , one needs to look at each individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nearly all dialysis centers use water purification equipment to purify water for dialysis .

After completing proof of its conformity , performing the initial tests of the type and introducing in-house control of the manufacturing plant , the manufacturer issued a declaration of conformity that is fully in compliance with the EU legislation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to label its AT to 50 pop wastewater treatment plants with the CE mark of conformity . <p> Basic descriptionThe wastewater treatment plant consists of a polypropylene reactor with an inner built-in technological structure . The maximum achievable purification effect is based on the utilisation of low-load activation technology with aerobic sludge stabilisation . The AT wastewater treatment plant is covered with a removable , lockable PP cover . The plant uses a tried and tested system of continual biological purification of wastewater with an integrated accumulation of abruptly inflowing water . This technology is protected internationally by patent No . EP1919833 . Our purification technology ensures the high quality of treated water as well as low investment and operating costs . The technology is also known under the international name of Vertical Flow Labyrinth - VFL . <p> Treatment processTreatment consists of a sequence of several technological processes . Wastewater flows to a non-aerated space , where the nitrogen is biologically degraded and the conditions are created for the partial biological degradation of phosphorus . The preliminary mechanical purification of inflowing wastewater and the decomposition of solid contamination also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several inner partition walls creating a vertical flow labyrinth where internal circulation has been established . <p> Further , wastewater flows gravitationally into an aerated space with low-loaded activation , where , under the presence of oxygen , the biological degradation of organic contamination as well as the nitrification of ammonia nitrogen is brought about . <p> Air is supplied to the aeration system by diaphragm compressors or blowers with a side duct ( high-pressure fans ) that are placed outside the biological reactor . The pressurised air is blown into the aerated space through fine-bubble aeration elements . The pressurised air supplied through the diaphragm compressors is regulated by a control unit ( microprocessor control unit ) through the use of which the wastewater treatment plant may work in various modes depending on the loading . <p> Another degree of treatment is separation , whereby the treated water is separated from the activated sludge , while the purified water is discharged to a water flow or infiltration or is recycled and the set-off activated sludge is returned to the system by re-pumping from the bottom of the feeding space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , the aerated space . A stream flow regulator located in the feeding space allows the use of the built-in retention space in the wastewater treatment plant in the event of abruptly inflowing wastewater , thus preventing the plant from being overloaded . As a result , conditions are created for the discharge of wastewater via leakage into ground water and the reclamation of biologically purified wastewater , as the discharged water does not clog the pores of the filtration layer of the bedrock or filtration plant . <p> Active SludgeActive sludge comprises of waste water particles and micro-organisms , present in certain parts of the wastewater treatment plant . These microorganisms also vegetate in the natural environment ; however they are most effective in biological wastewater treatment plants , i.e. when they are saturated with air and wastewater . Concentration of microorganisms is considerable , as the conditions which the treatment plant offer ensures rapid decomposition of the waste water . <p> Chemical-Free OperationSystems with active sludge are classified as intensive wastewater treatment systems . During various treatment stages , all harmful chemical materials are dissociated , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to collect it in reservoirs and re-use , e.g. for car washing , watering of plants , etc . Biological wastewater treatment plants using active sludge enable rejection of any chemicals during the wastewater treatment process and perform a high level of wastewater treatment . Note not all wastewater treatment plants feature such high parameters of treated water . Application of active sludge technology requires no additional filters and no other equipment ( unless requested by the client or project conditions ) . This is a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly method . <p> All processes of the biological treatment ( treatment of wastewater with active sludge , separation of sludge from treated wastewater and returning of sludge into the aeration reservoir where wastewater is mixed with active sludge , supplying air ) happen in one reservoir . This ensures more reliable and stabilized operation . <p> Active sludge decomposes contaminants and is separated from treated wastewater . Problems such as disturbances of treatment equipment , outflow of active sludge , and unpleasant odour etc. are avoided . However not all wastewater treatment plants are secured from the outflow of sludge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , e.g. August BioPro wastewater treatment systems are equipped with funnel-shaped separation zones . Since the sludge features heavier weight , it settles at the bottom of the equipment and is returned into the treatment process or its surplus is removed . At the same time the treated water ( also called " technical " ) is released via a pipe installed at the top of the system - water is released to the environment or collected for further application . <p> Removal of materials , such as phosphorus and nitrogen is very important , as these materials can access water bodies and increase the growth of plants , thus reducing the volume of oxygen in water bodies . This usually results in reduction of fish and other wildlife in lakes and rivers ( e.g. they suffocate more often in winter , as intensive greenery absorbs oxygen ) , thus disturbing the balance in water bodies . <p> Not all wastewater treatment plants are capable of cleaning wastewater from nitrogen , phosphorus and other materials , as they are not equipped with nitrification , de-nitrification and other zones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposing additional costs . Thus wastewater treatment plants with active sludge are convenient and efficient , as the treated wastewater is turned into odourless and colourless water , free from materials harmful to the environment . <p> Single refillActive sludge is poured into the newly mounted wastewater treatment plant , before letting in the wastewater . Active sludge is delivered from ready operating plants . This is a single action , as the sludge is nourished and reproduces using wastewater ; no additional refill is needed . Full efficiency of the wastewater treatment is obtained instantly . <p> Resistant to Variations of Volume of WastewaterAutomatic operation of wastewater treatment plant with active sludge , resistant to variations of volume of wastewater during the day is extremely practical . For example , in the morning you have a shower , whereas you only use a toilet during the day , and in the evening you wash your dishes and bathe a baby . <p> Using a wastewater treatment plant generates a surplus of active sludge . When you select the right size biological wastewater treatment plant , the volume of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family will be approximately 1 m3 annually . However if you select a wastewater treatment system which is too small to satisfy your needs , the volume of surplus sludge may increase and you will have to remove it more often . <p> Sludge is removed opening the lid of wastewater treatment plant . This can be done by the maintenance personnel or the owner themselves . <p> Even toilet paper does not disturb the treatment process ; however there are some materials that must not enter the wastewater treatment system . They can block or damage your sewerage system in some other way . <p> For example , items such as diapers , condoms , hygienic liners , cigarette ends , plastic , paper and other materials insoluble in water must never enter the sewerage and sinks . Never pour remains of paint , grease or other similar materials to sewerage .

@@1622419 <h> Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids ( MLSS ) Monitoring <p> Activated Sludge Process Overview : The process deals with the treatment of sewage ( and industrial wastewater ) and was developed around 1912-1914 . Activated sludge is a biochemical process for treating sewage and industrial wastewater that uses air ( or oxygen ) and microorganisms to biologically oxidize organic pollutants , producing a waste sludge ( or floc ) containing the oxidized material . Atmospheric air or pure oxygen is bubbled through primary treated sewage ( or industrial wastewater ) and combined with organisms to develop a biological floc which reduces the organic content of the sewage . The combination of raw sewage and biological mass is commonly known as Mixed Liquor . In all activated sludge plants , once the sewage ( or industrial wastewater ) has received sufficient treatment , excess mixed liquor is discharged into settling tanks and the treated supernatent is run off to undergo further treatment before discharge . Part of the settled material , the sludge ( RAS ) , is returned to the head of the aeration system to re-seed the new sewage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw or settled wastewater and activiated sludge within an aeration tank in the activated sludge process . Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids ( MLSS ) is the concentration of suspended solids in the mixed liquor , usually expressed in milligrams per litre ( mg/l ) . <p> If MLSS content is too high the process is prone to bulking and the treatment system becomes overloaded , this can cause the dissolved oxygen content to drop with the effect that organic matters are not fully degraded and biological ' die off ' . Conversely , if the MLSS content is too low the process is not working efficiently , and is likely to be wasting energy whilst not treating the effluent effectively.The typical control band is 2,000 to 4,000 mg/l . <p> RAS and SAS <p> A proportion of the floc is called Return Activated Sludge ( R.A.S. ) and is used to maintain the desied MLSS value .

@@1622424 <p> Artisanal small-scale gold mining ( ASM ) , largely practised in Asia , South America and Africa , contributes significantly to mercury emissions , both in the developing world and globally . A recent study investigates an alternative to using mercury in ASM . <p> The EU Mercury Strategy1 recognises the need for global action to reduce mercury in the environment . This includes actions to help other countries reduce their mercury use and support of the UN Environment Programme mercury programme2 . In ASM practice , gold is often extracted by amalgamating ( ' blending ' ) it with mercury . However , it is estimated that 30 per cent of the mercury used in the process is lost to the atmosphere . Furthermore , amalgamation is inefficient and recovers less than 30 per cent of the gold . <p> Most artisanal miners come from extremely poor backgrounds and turn to mining to escape poverty . They can not afford to process gold themselves and so take the ore to processing centres . These centres use amalgamation - the cheapest but least efficient process . In return miners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any remaining gold by cyanidation . In this process , cyanide dissolves both gold and any residual mercury , forming mercury cyanide . Mercury cyanide easily turns into methylmercury , a highly toxic mercury compound that readily makes its way into rivers and consequently fish consumed by humans . <p> Although cyanidation of tailings is environmentally unsound , cyanidation of the gold ore itself may be a better alternative to amalgamation . This is done by grinding the gold in cyanide , known as ' mill-leaching ' . <p> The researchers examined the potential of mill-leaching with cyanide in a laboratory test with an Indonesian ore sample and in a field test in Ecuador . In the laboratory test , mill-leaching extracted 93 per cent of the gold in six hours . This was better than other procedures , such as magnetic methods , which recovered just 8 per cent . In the field test in Ecuador , a traditional mill-leaching technique using a mill called a ' chanchas ' recovered 95 per cent of gold after eight hours . <p> The results indicate that mill-leaching with cyanide is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency and its reduced environmental risk . It is simple , inexpensive and well-accepted by local miners . However , processing centres may be reluctant to adopt it because they have already invested in cyanidation tanks to extract gold from tailings . <p> The authors recommend further analysis of the socio-economic and environmental impacts of mill-leaching with cyanide . Cyanide is also toxic and miners must be educated to understand the associated risks if this process is introduced . @qwx70990 <p> TheMinamata Convention on Mercury(Convention) , a global treaty aimed at scaling down mercury use and production developed by the United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) , recently surpassed the 50-country threshold required for it to become legally binding for all of its parties .

@@1622425 <p> The Moving Bed Bio-Reactor ( MBBR ) Technology is increasingly being favoured over conventional Activated Sludge ( AS ) systems . This is largely due to the achievable reduction of the plant 's footprint and the ability to maintain a higher concentration of more specialized bacteria . <p> Whereas the AS technology relies on free-flowing bacteria flocs , the MBBR technology relies on fixed-film technology where bacteria are attached to inert biological carrier profiles ( bio-elements , biomedia , biological carriers ) that are retained within the reactor by screens . This eliminates the need for a return activated sludge system and reduces the requirements for subsequent filtration steps . <p> Commonly , the MBBR technology is favoured over AS plants when space is limited and/or costly , especially for Municipal wastewater treatment , since the MBBR components often present a higher initial investement cost per reactor volume .

@@1622436 <p> WatMan is able to deliver both IX and RO technology , so we have no favourites among these technologies . Enclosed are some parameters that affect the decision of which technology to choose.The total investment in a DI water system depends on the nature of the total plant , especially on the pretreatment and the possible post treatment . The layout of the system should be considered carefully . For waters of low TDS , packed-bed ion exchange is more economical to operate than reverse osmosis ( RO ) . Depending on the amount of bicarbonate and silica in medium TDS water , packed-bed may still be more economical than RO . There is no point in using IX with high TDS waters because of the increasing consumption of chemicals . <p> IX needs strong chemicals , however chemicals such as NaOH and H2SO4 or HCl are inexpensive . Strong acids and caustics need neutralization equipment . RO may require special antiscalants and/or membrane cleaning chemicals . RO systems normally use only minute amounts of corrosive chemicals . Neutralization may be needed depending on the nature of the membrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment should be considered when making cost calculations . Possible usage of brine in the softeners should also be considered . <p> RO creates more waste water because the recovery of RO is typically 50-80% : for each cubic metre produced by an RO system , 0.25-1 cubic metres are fed into the sewer . By comparison , the recovery of a modern ion exchange system is usually 96% . It should be noted , however , that the RO reject may still be suitable for a secondary use such as cooling . In a situation like this , the total yield of RO may be close to 100% . <p> IX produces a higher quality of water compared to RO , which normally rejects 95-98% of the minerals . Modern IX technology retains 99% of the salts , or more . It is possible to add a polisher both after the IX and after the RO . As regards feed water quality , ion exchange is more forgiving than RO . Slow fouling of the RO membranes can be noticed from decreasing flux or from increasing feed pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no sudden failure with ion exchange , processes such as slow fouling of the resin are time consuming . <p> RO removes all the particles very effectively , but suitable pretreatment must be involved to remove the suspended solids , iron and hardness from the feed water . IX effluent quality is almost independent of the temperature ; RO permeate conductivity will be made higher by the rising temperature and lowering pressure correspondingly . RO loses up to 20% of the flux ( capacity ) with a 10 C temperature decrease . <p> Low pressure RO membranes working on very low pressure - as low as 5-8 bars - remarkably save energy compared to high to medium pressure membranes . Conventional RO requires up to 10 times more kWh to operate than ion exchange . In large-scale production , energy consumption creates a noticeable expense .

@@1622440 <p> According to an adapted Murphy 's Law , ' anything that can fail , will fail . ' While that universal engineering law has been proven true again and again , many utilities are working diligently to reduce the risk of failure by taking measures to improve the service life of their aging metallic assets . <p> In North America , with the majority of water infrastructure reaching the end of its design life , operators have every incentive to take a proactive approach to pipeline management . Nowhere is this more critical than in busy urban centres , where transmission mains frequently run beneath city streets , posing a greater risk and a bigger challenge to water utilities . <p> In a downtown core , unexpected failure can escalate repair costs and cause major disruptions to business and commuters . An urban geyser from a ruptured pipe or even a hydrant can easily diminish public confidence in the utility and reputations will suffer . <p> Historically , there have been few non-destructive methods to assess the condition of metallic pipelines , forcing utilities to operate these critical assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wasteful , since the majority of pipelines have remaining useful life . <p> To help operators defensively address their pipeline conditions , Pure Technologies provides a suite of tools , technologies and engineering analysis programs that allow for a comprehensive condition assessment of metallic pipelines . <p> In general , the condition of metal pipe is typically first assessed with leak detection technology and a detailed pipe wall assessment ( PWA ) screening . <p> Once PurePWA identifies pipe sections with increased levels of stress , the data can be verified with Magnetic Flux Leakage ( MFL ) , recognized as the industry standard in high-resolution metallic pipe assessment . MFL is the most accurate testing method that identifies pitting and wall loss on steel and ductile iron pipes , which makes this testing method and extra-high resolution appropriate for high risk , critical-location pipes . <p> How MFL works <p> With PureMFL technology , powerful magnets are attached to one of Pure 's three platform tools " manned , pig or handheld . The magnets saturate the metal pipe wall with a temporary magnetic field , while sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects . Where a defect exists , there is a disruption in the field causing some of the magnetics to ' leak ' out of the pipe wall . <p> The data collected with the MFL tool is then correlated to a location along the pipeline using multiple techniques . There are three odometers built into the tool for linear distance integration , inertial sensors for motion integration and pipeline feature correlation . <p> PureMFL data identifies defects as small as 0.25 inches in diameter and 10 percent wall loss , which explains why the technology is regarded as the most accurate in the pipeline testing industry . In addition to locating and quantifying the extent of corrosion in metal pipes , PureMFL technology is also able to identify different liners such as mortar and coal tar . <p> Utility uses PureMFL technology to confirm PWA data on critical pipes <p> In one specific case , a medium-sized utility in the Carolinas decided to take a proactive approach to assess and manage the condition of one of its critical 12-inch force mains . The utility began its screening assessment using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket detection platform paired with pipe wall assessment technology in a single deployment . <p> After completion of the SmartBall assessment , several gas pockets and stress anomalies were identified . From the PWA data , two pipe selected for validation were identified as anomalous , and showing significant stress indicators , while a third pipe with no stress indicators was used to determine a baseline for comparison . <p> In response , the utility exposed these pipes for testing , and Pure 's crew deployed its state-of-the-art MFL external scanning tool to generate a high resolution profile for each of the two distressed pipes . The MFL testing found moderate to significant wall loss on the pipe sections identified as anomalous through PWA analysis . <p> Overall , the investigation will provide the utility with actionable information that can be used to plan a repair and replacement program for their critical pipeline , and assist in preventing future Murphy Law failures . @qwx70989 <p> In construction , preventing the penetration of liquids and gases is essential to maintaining the integrity of a structure .

@@1622455 <h> Berkeley Lab Helps California Get to Zero Net Energy Homes <p> California has established ambitious goals to reduce energy consumption in buildings , including a policy goal for all new residential buildings to be zero net energy ( ZNE ) by 2020 . Now the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ( Berkeley Lab ) has launched two projects to help the state meet its ZNE building goals . <p> One project will provide detailed cost and performance modeling of ZNE homes and identify barriers while the other seeks to ensure acceptable indoor air quality in ZNE homes that use natural gas . The California Energy Commission ( CEC ) is providing $2 million in funding for the two projects . The DOE 's Building America program is also supporting the air quality project , the results of which will inform DOE 's Zero Energy Ready Home program . <p> ZNE buildings essentially generate as much as they consume on an annualized basis , and California has led the way in the United States in laying the path towards ultra-low energy buildings . Carbon dioxide emissions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's overall greenhouse gas emissions , of which about 14 percent are from electricity generation sources and 9 percent from building heating fuels . <p> ' Getting to zero net energy will be a process , ' said Berkeley Lab researcher Brett Singer , who is leading the air quality project . ' These two projects will help the state with both its near-term ZNE goals as well as longer term strategy . ' <p> California has approximately 9 million single-family homes and 4 million multifamily units , according to the CEC . An estimated 50 percent of existing buildings in California were built before California Building Energy Efficiency Standards went into effect in 1978 . Doubling the rate of energy savings from building efficiency projects would result in lower total building energy use in 2030 than in 2014 , despite population and economic growth , and is equivalent to a 17 percent reduction in usage compared to projected 2030 levels . <p> California has just a few hundred ZNE buildings now , while the number of new housing starts is roughly 100,000 a year . ' On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump , but the state is preparing through existing standards , driving towards that objective , ' said Max Wei , a Berkeley Lab researcher leading the second ZNE project . <p> Future homes : gas or electric or both ? <p> Getting to zero net energy usually involves both reducing demand as well as providing on-site energy generation , often with solar panels . However , different building types present different barriers to adoption , whether technical or economic . <p> Wei will analyze the cost-effectiveness of various approaches to lowering energy use in single family and multifamily homes , such as comparing all-electric homes to homes with gas-based heating . ' If we want to achieve deep carbon reductions then ultimately we want to sharply reduce or eliminate natural gas consumption , ' Wei said . ' Another key modeling area is energy storage and demand response and how these could be implemented to lower overall costs .

One key activity will be a detailed survey of builders on current and expected future costs . ' For example , if we find that all-electric homes are more cost-effective in some regions of the state , then that would be an interesting finding , ' he said . <p> Nearer term : mitigating kitchen pollutants <p> For the foreseeable future , California will continue to build homes with gas-based appliances , and as those homes get more energy-efficient , usually by being ' tighter ' or less leaky , ventilation becomes a more important issue .

Energy requirements range from 3.7 to 6.0 kilojoules per metric ton ( kJ/t ) glass produced . <p> Waste Characteristics <p> Two types of air emissions are generated : those from the combustion of fuel for operating the glass-melting furnaces , and fine particulates from the vaporization and recrystallization of materials in the melt . The main emissions are sulfur oxides ( SOx ) , nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) , and particulates , which can contain heavy metals such as arsenic and lead . Particulates from lead crystal manufacture can have a lead content of 20 " 60% and an arsenic content of 0.5 " 2% . Certain specialty glasses can produce releases of hydrogen chloride ( HCl ) , hydrogen fluoride ( HF ) , arsenic , boron , and lead from raw materials . Container , pressing , and blowing operations produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the release agent used on the molds . <p> Cold-top electric furnaces , in which the melt surface is covered by raw material feed , release very little particulate matter , as the blanket acts as a filter to prevent the release of particulate matter . Some releases of particulates will take place in tapping , but furnace releases should be of the order of 0.1 kilogram per ton ( kg/t ) when operated this way . Lead glass manufacture may result in lead emissions of about 2 " 5 kg/t . In all cases , the concentration of heavy metals and other pollutants in the raw flue gas mainly depends on the type of fuel used , the composition of the feed material , and the portion of recycled glass . High input of sulfates or potassium nitrate may increase emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides , respectively . Where nitrate is used , more than two thirds of the introduced nitrogen may be emitted as nitrogen oxides . The use of heavy metals as coloring or decoloring agents will increase emissions of these metals . @qwx70989 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float glass since 1995 in the Forssa area .

@@1622477 <h> Technical release to the environmental industry regarding the appearance of Acetone and MEK <p> PHILADELPHIA -- For many years the appearance of ketones in reductive dechlorination projects has been somewhat of a mystery , frequently blamed on lab contamination . Innovative Environmental Technologies , Inc . ( IET ) , provides alternative explainations . <p> The appearance of 2-butanone ( MEK ) and acetone ( unwanted solvents ) is a transient intermediate occasionally formed as naturally occurring TOC , or the injected organic hydrogen donor , undergoes conversion to solvents rather than organic acids . Additionally , some metal oxides can convert acetic acid into acetone , in applications where ZVI is introduced the iron oxides generated early in the program can be responsible for the acetic acid/acetone ; buteric acid/2-butanone conversions . <p> In addition to the abiotic transformations , when an impacted aquifer is amended with carbon under low pH or nutrient limiting conditions the fermentable organic matter may be converted to a variety of ketones , including acetone or methyl ethyl ketone ( MEK ; 2-butanone ) . The processes might temporarily raise groundwater concentrations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory concerns , unless one completely understands the methods , fate and transport of ketone production . Acetone is a VOC , but it also provides a readily biodegradable food source for soil microbes that perform reductive dechlorination . In groundwater , acetone generally has a half-life that varies from 19 to 197 days . The occasional , transient production of acetone and/or MEK generally occurs when carbohydrates are converted to the undesirable ketones . When ketones appear it is an indicator that the environments pH and/or nutrient supply are driving the biotic conversions of the carbohydrates to the solvents rather than the organic acids . When this occurs the ORP generally will not decrease into the desired negative 100 to 300 range due to the absence of hydrogen production from the fermentation process . Acetone and MEK production is frequently seen by IET early in a remedial program . Most often the disappearance of the acetone occurs as quickly as it appeared as the pH from water hydroylisis at the ZVI surface provides hydroxides . The solvent formation is generally associated with pH levels below 6 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in various laboratory studies and peer reviewed papers for over 30 years . One such pH link was described by Ennis and Maddox ( 1987 ) , working with a substrate of whey permeate . They reconfirmed that at relatively low sugar concentrations , low pH favored solventogenesis , but growth and sugar utilization were poor . Conversely , at higher pH values , growth and sugar utilization were much improved with limited solvent production . <p> Additionally , phosphate limiting conditions effect the production of solvents rather than organic aids . In phosphate-limited batch cultures , Bahl , Andersch and Gottschalk ( 1982 ) described how solvent production occurred after exhaustion of phosphate from the medium . In conditions of excess phosphate , the fermentation produced acids rather than solvents , and thus there may be a case for removal of this anion from commercial media . <p> To confirm the possibility that the o-PO4+ has been sequestered by high carbonate concentrations an o-PO4+ analysis should be performed utilizing both a total o-PO4+ evaluation performed at the in-situ pH and acidified . Under the acidified condition the o-PO4+ sequestered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will provide evidence for the bioavailability of the o-PO4+ . <p> About Innovative Environmental Technologies , Inc . ( IET ) <p> Origins of the Company : Formed in 1998 , Innovative Environmental Technologies , Inc . ( IET ) was inspired by the observed need for a remedial contractor in the environmental industry that could provide state-of-the-art remedial technologies to environmental consultants and engineers . To achieve this objective , IET would have to continuously develop , patent and license innovative and emerging technologies . Further , IET would have to position itself as a remedial contractor and technology vendor to a sophisticated and knowledgeable customer base . Unencumbered by any one product supplier relationship , IET could provide its customers coordinated remedial programs integrating a variety of remedial products . <p> Evolution of the Company : In the early years , IET focused on the development of efficient in-situ delivery processes that would be capable of injecting a wide variety of materials to targeted subsurface formations . These efforts resulted in the patenting of IETs apparatus for in-situ injections as well as the design and manufacturing of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During these early years , IETs focus was primarily aerobic biomineralization processes for the treatment of dissolved and sorbed phase petroleum hydrocarbons . The success of these treatment validated IET as a resource to numerous consulting engineering companies across the country . By 2001 , IET was approached by several of its clients to evaluate and propose treatments for chlorinated solvents . Between 2001 and 2003 , IET proposed and implemented many in-situ programs targeting chlorinated ethenes and ethanes . IET applied various oxidative and reductive technologies during these years , finally focusing on a synergistic biotic-abiotic approach for the treatment of chlorinated solvents ( US Patent 7,129,388 ) . Since 2001 IET has designed and implemented over 700 in-situ remedial projects focused on chlorinated solvents . <p> Establishing and maintaining the relationships with its customers while focusing on the companys image as a technology resource to these customers required IET to evolve into a value-added contractor . To add value to its services , IET chose to provide free data analysis of the projects it had implemented . Together with lump-sum pricing for turn-key remediation services , IET has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while maintaining a connection to the individual projects data . It has been this " connection " that has allowed IET to evaluate the efficacies of individual remedial compounds and the implemented programs .

@@1622480 <h> MiniRAE 3000 Correction Factors <p> Geotechnical Services , Inc. is proud to announce the introduction of the MiniRAE 3000 to the U.S. market . As a premier consulting organization and instrumentation sales company dedicated to providing laboratory and field analytical solutions , Geotechnical Services - a leader in elemental and materials analysis - to offer a complete range of XRF handheld and benchtop instruments for elemental analysis needs . <p> One of the handiest features of the MiniRae 3000 is the ability to use built-in correction factors . The industry standard for calibrating PIDs ( photoionization detectors ) is isobutylene in concentrations of 100ppm ( parts per million ) . Correction factors have been developed for PIDs calibrated with isobutylene to allow the user to quantify specific gases of interest without having to calibrate with that particular gas . This is an incredibly useful development because no one needs to be exposed to toxic gases just for calibration purposes . If you are operating a MiniRae 3000 with a 10.6eV lamp that is calibrated to 100ppm isobutylene and you are looking to quantify benzene , you would choose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up your PID to read in benzene units even though it has been calibrated to isobutylene instead of benzene directly . Therefore , if you are in an environment where benzene is the only gas present , you can actually quantify levels of benzene with the MiniRae 3000 . <p> This feature is also used as a conservative approach even when other gases are present in the environment where you are trying to measure levels of contamination . It is common to choose the most toxic gas expected in the environment detected by a PID , calibrate the instrument to 100ppm isobutylene then , apply the correction factor for that gas . This way if concentrations reach a level of concern for that specific gas , you can respond accordingly . Since PIDs are total VOC analyzers , the instrument is actually measuring all of the constituents in the air within the range of the lamp but it is reading in units specific to the toxic gas chosen as though everything it is reading is that toxic gas . <p> As useful as this feature can be , correction factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general . The confusion most likely resides in the fact that there is another calibration gas that is almost as frequently used as isobutylene in the state of California . This calibration gas is actually a directive of the SouthCoast AQMD ( Air Quality Management District ) Rule 1166 where the PID must be capable of being calibrated to hexane at concentrations of 50ppm . <p> However , the correction factors found in most PIDs have been developed for using isobutylene as the calibration gas . If you set a correction factor in a PID and calibrate it to any other gas than 100ppm isobutylene , you will produce erroneous results . The most common mistake in the field is to calibrate a PID to hexane while applying a hexane correction factor of 4.3 . Since the correction factor of 4.3 is derived from a 100ppm isobutylene calibration you are actually skewing your results by a factor of 4.3 . The only proper way to use the 4.3 correction factor for hexane is to calibrate your PID to 100ppm isobutylene and set the calibration memory to hexane with a 4.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then be measuring in hexane units . @qwx70990 <p> Geotech is a trusted manufacturer and supplier of portable and fixed gas analysers for a wide range of industries .

@@1622499 <h> Are your field soil screening procedures providing you with practical and accurate information ? <p> Environmental consulting activities frequently require that on-the-spot decisions be made in the field concerning the presence or absence of volatile , or even semi-volatile , organic compounds ( VOC 's ) in soil . There is nothing that can replace the value of field experience in ' making the right call ' when the trucks are lined up , the backhoe operator is waiting , and the client is watching the hole in the ground get bigger and bigger . However , the application of basic knowledge and consistent methodology to your field procedures can assist you in the interpretation of field soil screening results . <p> First , are you using the right piece of equipment for the job ? You have to understand the capabilities and limitations of the Organic Vapor Analyzer ( OVA ) you are using . <p> A Photo-Ionization Detector ( PID ) will be limited in its response by the electron voltage ( eV ) output of the lamp in the instrument . Most VOC 's have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipped with a 9.5 eV , 10.6 eV , or 11.7 eV lamp . The 10.6 eV lamp is the most common . In order for a PID to respond to a particular VOC , the IP of the compound of interest must be less than or equal to the eV output of the lamp . There are some compounds that a PID will not detect , most notably methane . In addition , methane can chemically mask the presence of VOC 's . PID 's are subject to poor performance in the presence of high humidity in moist soil . Perhaps the greatest advantage in using a PID is that it does not require a hazardous gas for operation . This can be a great consideration in logistics or cost when traveling or working in an isolated area . <p> A Flame-Ionization Detector ( FID ) will respond to most VOC 's by nature of its destructive detector function . An FID will not be adversely affected by the presence of humidity in moist soil . An FID can be used in methane determination or differentiation by using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A charcoal filter adapter absorbs VOC 's that are present in a sample . Therefore , the determination or differentiation of the presence of VOC 's can be made in the presence of methane . Perhaps the greatest disadvantage in using an FID is the need for zero-grade or ultra-high purity ( UHP ) hydrogen for the detector 's flame fuel source . Once again , this can be a great consideration in logistics or cost when traveling or working in an isolated area . <p> Whichever OVA you are using , current manufacture instruments provide sub-parts per million ( ppm ) digital performance and , usually , dynamic ranges of 10,000 ppm , or higher . Due to the differing responses instrument to instrument , do not change from a PID on one phase of work to an FID on another phase of work . From a practical perspective , both instruments are field-screening tools , not laboratory analysis equipment . If a soil sample exhibits a gross VOC odor that you can not even stand to get near , you may actually harm the instrument you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider a company standard field note procedure for such samples rather than risking the contamination of the OVA 's detector system . <p> Second , you have to understand the nature of volatile organic compounds and semi-volatile organic compounds as they relate to actual laboratory-testable product in the soil sample versus the amount of vapor in a soil sample headspace . The principle is simple . The headspace vapor-in-air concentration of a highly volatile compound may be higher than the actual laboratory-testable amount of the compound in the soil sample as you go from contaminated to clean soil . The opposite is true for semi-volatile organic compounds . The headspace vapor-in-air concentration of a semi-volatile compound may be lower than the actual laboratory-testable amount of the compound in the soil sample as you go from contaminated to clean soil . <p> Third , are you simply waving the instrument 's sample probe over an open split-spoon , handful of soil , or open excavator bucket or are you head-spacing your soil samples ? <p> There are too many uncontrolled factors present in simply waving the instrument 's sample probe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open excavator bucket . In most instances , your OVA will only respond to gross levels of contaminants when using this method . Additionally , outdoor ambient airflow will affect the sample that gets drawn into the OVA . In windy conditions , you might actually be detecting VOC 's from a background source , such as heavy construction equipment or gas pumps . This method provides no controlled methodology to make a determination of what 's happening sample to sample . It also allows no time for semi-volatile VOC 's to release vapors that can be detected by an OVA . <p> Head-spacing soil samples provides for the best possible application of consistent and controlled methodology to your field soil screening procedures . The key word here is consistent . The container you use , amount of soil you collect , or amount of time the containerized soil sample sits are not so important as being consistent with each one . Glass jars with foil and zip-closure bags are commonly used for head-spacing procedures . Use the same type of container for all phases of work . Glass jars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . If using zip-closure bags , test a bag first to make sure that it does not in itself release VOC 's that will be picked up by your OVA . Collect the same amount of soil with each sample . Most importantly , allow each containerized soil sample to sit for the same amount of time . A very common error is to collect samples over the course of the day and then check them all at the end of the day . One sample may have been sitting for five minutes while the first one has been sitting for five hours ! It is usually sufficient to allow a sample to sit for a matter of minutes to provide for a practical indication of the presence or absence of VOC 's . <p> The best possible scenario for controlled soil sample screening , using the headspace method , is to split samples between two containers . This applies to soil samples that are being screened for potential submission to a laboratory and to soil samples that are being screened for differentiation of VOC 's and methane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be screened should be containerized for head spacing . The potential laboratory sample can be tightly wrapped in a zip-closure bag , wrapped in foil , and placed in a cooler for later use , if necessary . In the second instance of methane differentiation , the sample should be split between two containers , and then screened individually using the FID on one and the charcoal filter adapter on the other . A single sample headspace will be depleted by the first analysis and leave an inadequate sample for the second analysis . <p> In closing , apply these basic principles and procedures to your field soil screening activities . You will find that your field data will provide you and your project professionals with more accurate data . Best of all , though , you 'll find that you will more quickly gain the experience necessary to ' make the right call ' when it counts most , in the field . @qwx70989 <p> The Axetris LGDs were operated continuously for two years .

The cleaning power of these machines results from the high temperature output . Sophisticated stem cleaning equipment provides an output temperature of 386F . <p> This article looks into the merits and demerits of using vapor steam cleaners . Their widespread popularity indicates that the advantages far outnumber the disadvantages . Yet , it 's worthwhile to have such an analysis . First , it 's better to deal with the advantages of these machines . <p> Efficient CleaningThe first and foremost advantage of vapor steam cleaners is the high cleaning power . These machines eject high temperature output onto hard surfaces . The output melts or dissolves stains and dirt present on the surface . The molten or dissolved dirt is removed either manually using towels and brushes or automatically , with a steam cleaner and attached vacuum . <p> The whole process is fast and efficient .

That is , vapor steam cleaners can get rid of harmful microorganisms present on the surface . <p> Some modern steam cleaner machines provide specialized anti microbial technology . Machines equipped with such a technology can remove many species of commonly occurring disease-causing microorganisms , including Escherichia coli and listeria . The anti microbial property of these machines is the prime reason why these are widely used in hotels , hospitals , and nursing homes . <p> Quick Drying Vapor steam cleaners offer superheated water as output . The specialty of the output is that the liquid water content will be low lower than 5% . It is often called dry steam output . Dry steam output is not just sharper in cleaning but uses less quantity of water . This means little water is used during the cleaning process , and less mess is left behind after cleaning . <p> ConsThe main disadvantage of industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@1622542 <h> Treatment Process <p> A brief explanation on the treatment process that takes place at Ngethu and Kabete treatment water works is detailed here below . Abstraction : water is abstracted from the source , which it is usually located at a point that is remote from human activity which normally brings pollution . From the source , water is carried through a pipe known as the intake pipe which takes the water to the treatment works . Screening : at the mouth of the intake pipe there are a series of screens whose purpose is to prevent suspended particles from entering the system and finding their way into the pumps . This is the first stage of treatment . The water then enters a tank called a sump from where it is pumped to the next stage of treatment known as clarification . <p> The clarification process which mainly removes second category of particles involves two main processes Coagulation and Flocculation . A chemical known as a coagulant such as Aluminium Sulphate ( or Alum ) is mixed in the water . The Alum distorts the properties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come together ( coagulate ) to form larger particles called flocs through the flocculation process . As the flocs become bigger and heavier they begin to settle to the bottom of the clarifier from where they are removed .

@@1622546 <h> Sharing Footwear - Urban Myth Or Unhealthy Practice ? <p> Evidence exists that in the energy production industry employees and visitors alike are expected to step into old boots . <p> This is the sole verification of what I had suspected was happening . Previously I had only anecdotal accounts of the practice . Sort of like an urban myth . Apparently , when accessing a ' safety zone ' every entrant is expected to pick through a selection of old safety boots . Usually there is a close enough fit available but if not , loose-fitting boots apparently are not a big concern . Oddly enough , perhaps because time spent in the safety zone is expected to be short and free of hazards , a loose-fitting boot is not considered a risk . <p> That being the case , I fail to understand the merits of such a culture . If the risks are minimal , why insist on a full safety boot ? To make matters worse , the boots are loaded with features not required at all in the circumstances . Protection from electrical shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in close contact with live wires . It seems to me this is expensive over-kill for the occasional visit to a safety zone . <p> Furthermore , I wonder where the inventory of old boots comes from ? Are they cast-offs from employees who have abandoned them or are they purchased for the purpose of lending out ? Regardless , the whole idea is fraught with unpleasant images conjured up by the sharing of used footwear . It seems , in this one organisation anyway , there is no discomfort when visitors are invited to pick their temporary old boot . I suspect that the shock of being refused admission is greater than the uninviting prospect of stepping into somebody 's old shoes . <p> There are a number of hygiene and podiatry issues associated with this policy . <p> The law requires that risk of injury be considered when implementing any safety program . Depending on the degree of risk it may be prudent to provide adequate PPE and to insist that any recommendation of protective equipment be mandatory . It 's the safest way out given our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it to ask workers and visitors to share footwear ? The thought of it brings the risk of foot diseases , warts and verrucae to my mind .

He agrees hygiene wise the main concern would be cross infection of pathogens . However , there may be other serious consequences . Since old boots have been pre-formed by a previous user , pressure points can arise . These pressure points are most likely to occur behind toe caps .

@@1622569 <h> Welding Fumes and the effects of Manganese <p> The potential risks of welding operations include the potential to breathe in metal fumes and toxic gases . Fume particles are formed from the vaporisation of molten metal that occurs during the process . These particles are very fine in size and may join together to form larger particles .. <p> The biggest risk is exposure to the manganese contained in fumes that are given off during welding . Inhaling manganese can cause very serious damage to your brain and nervous system . <p> Many workers who are exposed to welding fumes suffer from Parkinsons disease , a major disorder affecting movement and balance . They often develop " manganism , " a disease closely related to Parkinsons that also makes it difficult to walk and move properly . Both manganism and Parkinsons disease cause tremors , shaking , and loss of muscle control . <p> Although the law restricts your exposure to manganese in welding fumes , its limits may not be enough to protect you . The current limit which is set at 5 milligrams per cubic meter per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 milligram 5 times less that of the set limit.Other government hygienists recommend a limit of 0.2 milligrams or 25 times less than the current legal limit . The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) has said that inhaling manganese in amounts over 0.00005 milligrams may cause damage and illness . <p> Controlling the exposure <p> Good local or general ventilation is required to control exposures to the metal fumes and gases of welding operations . The most effective control is local exhaust ventilation in which an exhaust hood is placed near the welding arc or flame , and the contaminants are drawn away from the welder 's breathing zone . The system may consist of moveable exhaust hoods , flexible and stationary ducts , a powered fan , and a fume or dust collector . Exhausted air should be discharged to the outdoors , if possible , it is important that , during the welding operation , the exhaust hoods are placed or set so that welding fumes are not drawn across the worker 's face or into the breathing zone . Good general ventilation should be provided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mobile equipment , and large shovels may be especially hazardous and requires additional ventilation . <p> Other Harmful Metals in Welding Fumes <p> When the welding rod or base metal is iron or mild steel , iron oxide may be contained in the welding fumes in addition to manganese . Breathing in iron oxide irritates your nasal passages , throat , and lungs . <p> Working with stainless steel may produce welding fumes containing nickel and chromium . If you have asthma , exposure to nickel can make your illness worse . Chromium can aggravate or cause sinus problems . According to NIOSH , both nickel and chromium may cause cancer . <p> Sampling Methods <p> There are many ways in order to detect and monitor welding fumes but the most reliable and accurate way is to use an air sampling pump such as the new GilAir Plus by Gilian . <p> There are many sampling heads that can be used for a variety of sampling applications .

Sewage from the stations were conveyed using two twinned 450mm diameter polyethylene forcemains with each station pumping into a separate forcemain . <p> During the review of sewersheds in the area and servicing of new development , a third pumping station ( Reach Street Sewage Pumping Station ) was proposed . The Reach Street Sewage Pumping Station would have an initial capacity of 30 L/s with an ultimate capacity of 120 L/s . In order to ensure proper flushing velocities were obtained within the forcemain without excessive headosses , two forcemains were proposed for the ultimate pumping station capacity .

This approach would have resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs of the Reach Street Sewage Pumping Station construction and to manage velocities within the forcemains , an analysis was undertaken to determine if the three pumping stations could be serviced using the existing forcemains during both normal operation ( two forcemains in operation ) and under emergencies ( one forcemain in operation ) . <p> Forcemain And Sewage Pump DesignIn Ontario good design practice is to select a forcemain diameter which will ensure that the sewage velocity within the forcemain Analysis is between 0.9 m/s ( 3 ft/s ) and 2.6 m/s ( 8.5 ft/s ) . Maintaining minimum velocities ensures that solids in the raw sewage do not settle within the forcemain . Solids settling within a forcemain can be a source of odours and also reduce the forcemain capacity due to a reduction in the effective volume .

@@1622609 <p> Bramhall , UK -- New developments in marker technologies for sorting plastic packaging should not be viewed as the answer to increasing recycling rates , however they could be valuable in other ways leading to higher quality and value in recycling , suggests Axion Consulting . <p> While methods to detect different polymer types , such as fluorescent pigments and digital watermarks , offer exciting potential they should be seen as a way to safeguard recyclate quality , asserts Richard McKinlay , Head of Engineering &amp; Research at the resource recovery specialist . <p> Meanwhile , existing Near Infrared ( NIR ) technology still has much unexploited potential in recovering more packaging such as polypropylene ( PP ) from rigid plastics , polyethylene ( PE ) and PP films , which would go a long way to increasing recycling rates , he suggests . <p> Diversification in the plastics packaging market is leaving the established infrastructure behind . NIR technology detects polymer type , which for many years was sufficient to recover high quality PET , HDPE , LDPE film and PP , but this is changing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream that contains many different components . For example , a shift for UHT milk from recyclable HDPE bottles into opaque PET containers has a negative effect on recycling . The growing use of PET in non-food products can lead to challenges when using recycled PET in new food packaging . <p> " This shift has brought forward the need for an alternative to NIR that can sort material on more criteria , to protect existing recycling processes and drive up quality to access higher value markets , " says Richard . <p> Several projects , bringing together companies throughout the supply chain , are currently researching marker techniques that provide detailed information on what packaging can and can not be recycled . Two methods of marking being developed are fluorescent pigments and digital watermarks . <p> Invisible in normal lighting conditions , fluorescent pigments can be detected under ultraviolet light . Specially chosen for optimum performance while minimising cost , they are safe for food contact applications . <p> Digital watermarks are patterns that can be applied in label or packaging design , or directly to the polymer surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a camera and created at very low cost . Each marker can hold a large amount of data , such as material composition , original contents and suitability for recycling . <p> The development of fluorescent pigments is significantly further ahead than digital watermarking , with some European projects , such as the Polymark project , already completed and others close to completion . <p> " There is , therefore a better understanding of efficacy of fluorescent pigments . There are still many unknowns about watermarking and more independent studies are needed , " continues Richard . " Watermarking could be a powerful tool in the future because of how much data it can hold and brand owners can gauge how much of their packaging is recycled . " <p> For example , the same watermark can be used by manufacturers during production , and by consumers to give product information such as nutrition or recipes . You could even develop a smart bin where you show the bin the packaging and it tells you if it can be recycled or not . Finally , the watermark is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to for maximum value recovery . <p> This ability to share data across the value chain may be very powerful . However , it is only part of the solution , and packaging must be fundamentally recyclable in an economic way , and so compromises should not be made because of the ability to sort the different materials . <p> While markers offer a useful way to detect differences between food and non-food packaging , such as PET drinks bottles and PET detergent bottles , Richard warns that taking this route could lead to manufacturers using packaging that has less value at end of life in the future . For example , using more PET in non-food applications and reducing the subsequent quality of recyclable material . <p> He concludes : " To me , although this type of technology may be a very powerful tool for information gathering , it is not an answer to increasing recycling rates . In my opinion , this marker technology should be seen as a way to safeguard quality of materials for recycling . In terms of increasing recycling rates , I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The only way to increase recycling rates is to do more sorting on more of the plastic fractions that are currently going to energy recovery because its not economically viable to recover them . In order for this to happen , a fundamental change in the economic drivers for recycling is needed .

However , the effect can be minimized . There are pollution prevention and recycle programs which can reduce or eliminate waste generation resulting in a significant savings and possibility exemption from environmental regulations all together .

In fact , the environmental regulatory agency usually will cooperate and assist the sincere company achieve compliance , as best they can . While the regulatory agency is empowered to initiate substantial enforcement action , this is not a common course of action toward a company which has implemented a good faith effort to come into compliance . Enforcement action is generally reserved for those facilities which make no effort to comply after repeated warnings and notifications . <p> The principle environmental regulatory agency in Texas is the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission , or the TNRCC . For the most part businesses will find this agency very open and willing to answer any questions , including the enforcement branch . The TNRCC has a Small Business Assistance Program through which a company can get private consulting at no cost without fear of enforcement .

One of the more common reasons a regulatory agency will inspect a low profile company is in response to complaints from competitors , neighbors , and past employees . It takes relatively low concentrations of pollutants to impact the soil , or make the water unusable . While in and by itself the small amount of contaminated runoff from one site would not have a significant impact , but when that same amount is combined with the small amounts from other numerous other sites the accumulated compounded affects can be substantial .

Both resulted in significant cost to the company . <p> The environmental regulations are complex , confusing , ambiguous and often a matter of interpretation . Besides the federal and state regulatory agencies , there may be county and city ordinances to contend with . There is as much a tendency to over comply with environmental regulations resulting in significant unnecessary costs , as there is not to be in compliance . Depending upon the complexity of the business in terms of process materials , discharges , emissions , and wastes generated , it is advisable to get assistance in determining the compliance status of a facility . The regulatory agencies are usually able to resolve most concerns . The assistance programs and workshops mentioned above are good places to start . <p> If an independent consultant is retained beware of alarmist claims of $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware of official sounding certifications .

The agency will advise a company if a clean up plan is inadequate , but can not so advise if the action is excessive . So if proposal cost seems excessive , obtain a second opinion . If enforcement is involved it is advisable to retain an experienced environmental attorney . Until a trust and credibility is established the consultant should not contact the agency directly on behalf of the company without legal counsel , and certainly not without the companies prior knowledge .

@@1622661 @qwx70987 <p> Grass is familiar to everyone , which is distributed all over the world , such as farmland , residential green belt and square lawn , and you can see it everywhere and anytime in a year . Generally , it is used as feed for livestock and poultry , but now it can be a treasure with the way it present changed . That is biomass pellets . <p> The Benefits of Grass Pellets <p> Grass pellet is a kind of green energy resource . With the wide distribution and sustainability of raw materials , the biomass pellet becomes an available alternative to traditional fuels and relieves the shortage of fossil energy . What 's more , grass pellets can help keep agricultural open space , and provide a new revenue stream and profit center to the farmers and other landowners . It has a great potential as a low-tech , small-scale , renewable energy system that can be locally produced , processed and consumed . It has a positive impact on rural communities and helps people become independent from foreign oil . <p> Besides , grass pellet can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same BTUs as wood pellet . Grass biomass pellet is much better for the environment because it emits less greenhouse gases than oil , coal and natural gas do . Furthermore , grass is perennial , does not require fertilization and can be grown on marginal farmland . Because of the rising cost of fossil fuels , the shortage of hardwood pellets and the need for energy resource , grass pellets have gained an extensive popularity . The most important point is that they can be made at home completely . Forming the grass into pellets allows the materials to be handled and stored easily , transported economically , and burned efficiently . One advantage to this method is that grasses dry in the field , which reduces the drying cost at a pellet mill . <p> Comparison between Grass Pellet and Wood Pellet <p> The combustion characteristics of grass pellets are different from wood pellets . Grass pellets in general will produce much higher ash content . And possibly create a clinker and slag formations . Fortunately , research has indicated that adding 20% wood pellets to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass pellets that must be paid attention to before using in a pellet stove or boiler is the increased risk of corrosion . During combustion , many grass pellets at a higher temperature will generate corrosive called chloride . Most pellet stoves and boilers are designed to purely burn premium wood pellets . if grass pellets are used in most pellet stoves and boilers , it will accelerate corrosion , which could destroy the unit within a few years , so be very careful . Hemp grass pellets produce the least issues . <p> As for people who are interested in investing in biomass pellet industry , grass pellet mill is an ideal option because of the facile raw material and good performance . The raw materials for pellet mill can be grasses everywhere from lawns , grassland , or farmland like unwanted hay , switch grass , alfalfa , straw , etc .

Now there has been a growing interest in grass pellets for the pellet fuel industries . <p> Grass pellet mill is different from wood pellet mill in feature . Generally , grass pellet mill operates at higher speed . The lower density makes grass easier to gelatinize . Higher productivity can be achieved through higher die speed , reducing the cost of grass pellets . Grass pellet mill is featured by compact structure , low consumption and large capacity . It can utilize all kinds of grasses to make pellets as fuel , while wood pellet mill is faced with a shortage of raw materials due to the forest protection . @qwx70989 <p> Fish feeding is one of the most important factors in commercial fish farming because feeding regime may have consequences on both growth efficiency and feed wastage .

@@1622681 <p> A condition known as Legionnaires ' disease has made headlines after it killed a dozen people in Flint , Michigan in 2014 and 2015 and sickened hundreds in New York state last year . A rare but severe type of pneumonia , Legionnaires ' kills roughly one in ten people who contract it . The cause of the disease is the Legionella bacterial strain . Water loving , Legionella can contaminate hot tubs , water fountains , plumbing systems , and water-treatment cooling towers . <p> The name for Legionnaires disease goes back to the bicentennial of the United States . Some 4000 members of the Pennsylvania State American Legion , a group of World War II veterans , had traveled to Philadelphia for the American Legion Convention in 1976 . Ultimately , more than 200 of those legionnaires fell i 'll while 34 others died after contracting a mysterious disease that would later be named after them . <p> Months after the outbreak , Joseph McDade , a scientist at the Centers for Disease <p> Control determined that a bacterial strain was behind the epidemic . Working backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely came from the water-cooling towers on top of Bellevue-Stratford hotel hosting the American Legion event . <p> Fast-forward to today and such water-cooling towers are still one of the most common culprits for Legionnaires outbreaks . Perched atop most large commercial and industrial buildings , cooling towers are an intrinsic but often hidden part of the urban and industrial landscape . Mimicking the human bodys method of cooling with sweat , cooling towers are more efficient at cooling than using solely electricity . <p> Cooling towers , however , also can be breeding grounds for bacteria and even just determining that there is an outbreak of Legionella in a tower can be a challenge . " There 's no good test for it , " says Max Martina , president of Griswold Water Systems ( GWS ) . <p> To control Legionella and other waterborne pathogens , building operators have traditionally used a toxic chemical soup . Biocides help control bacteria , but they tend to be corrosive to metals and can damage cooling towers , so operators also add corrosion inhibitors to the water . <p> A corrosion inhibitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Pacific Gas and Electric Company of California in 1993 immortalized in the eponymous film with Julia Roberts . PG&amp;E had used a carcinogen , hexavalent chromium , to control rust in cooling water towers , which ultimately polluted the soil and groundwater . <p> While hexavalent chromium has since been banned for this use , there is still no perfect chemical solution for water-cooling towers . " There is this constant dance of injecting the cooling tower with chemical substances to control corrosion , bacteria , and scaling , " Martina says . <p> In some cases , the bacteria within cooling towers can become resistant to a given biocidejust as bacteria in humans evolves to resist antibiotics . When this happens , it requires building operators to rotate biocides . <p> Complicating matters further , a typical cooling tower uses vast amounts of wateroften millions of gallons annually . Roughly one-third of this water is flushed down the sewer because it is so loaded with toxins that it can not be recycled . <p> An IoT Solution <p> Several years ago , Martina decided to confront the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than toxic chemicals . " The genesis of nonchemical is not new , " Martina says . " It grew out of a customer desire to eliminate these toxic chemicals from their facilities . I know of four people in this industry who have all died from pancreatic cancer . I am not casting aspersions on the industry but chemicals like isothiazoline are really toxic . " <p> The approach allows building owners to stop dumping chemicals into their water-cooling towers and to recycle any wastewater for gray-water applications . What is new , however , is the use of IoT to elevate the effectiveness of the treatment methodology and surpass industry standards . <p> Martina says that the IoT technology provides four benefits : First , it enables the company to ensure water savings takes place by tracking the efficiency of the cooling towers . Second , it enables the GWS service team to respond immediately if there is a system upset , thus reducing system downtime . Third , the technology can track whether the equipment is effectively treating the water . Lastly , the technology gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-time data . <p> To integrate the technology , Martina enlisted the help of Hollis Controls , a systems integrator based in Southern New Hampshire , to configure the remote-monitoring technology and connect it to local networks . Hollis Controls , in turn , brought in See Control , now a part of Autodesk to offer the cloud-based platform . <p> While systems integrators like Hollis Controls specialize in writing firmware and software for hardware , they often reach out to partners when it comes to writing scalable web applications . <p> " The big problem in an IoT application like this is that if Max can get this out to the world population of cooling towers , at some point , the amount of data and analytics would break most conventional web applications , " says Bryan Kester , head of IoT at Autodesk . The companys Fusion Connect platform enables companies like this to test a new market concept for cooling towers without worrying about having to scale the infrastructure , Kester says . <p> The Pushback <p> While GWS has installed the electric-based purification systems in hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomerates have been pushing back . " Its kind of a crazy industry , " Martina says . " When I got involved in this , I did n't  understand how cutthroat and aggressive it can be . I have a chemical service partner who has actually had his tires slashed by a competing chemical services company . There is some of that , but one would hope that it is in a minority of cases . " <p> Martina says that chemical conglomerates and their local agencies and affiliated chemical blenders are trying to discredit the technology . Others will try to entice their customers with tickets to prominent sporting events with the hopes that they will keep buying their chemicals . " We spend a lot of time talking about the science and the research that shows it works and 400 or 500 case studiesactive users with references , " Martina says . <p> " What is scary is the chemical service provider does not have an incentive to save the customer water . Sometimes , the less-reputable firms will operate the tower less efficiently so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring the purchase of even more chemicals . This is known in the industry as feed and bleed , " he explains . <p> The Future <p> GWS technology is gaining traction , Martina says . " We reckon we 've conserved more than two trillion gallons of water with several hundred installations we have internationally and probably 1200 tons of toxic chemicals have been eliminated as a result of that , " he explains . " Our next step is to integrate analysis for water metering for all of the applications we do . " <p> Autodesk is also reflecting on how to support them . " We have an artificial intelligence engine that we are testing that we will launch later in the year . We could invite GWS to be a beta user , " Kester says . " If they do want to get ahead of any predictive scenarios either around the quality of the operation or the water , we can use our AI engine for that .

One of the fastest growing methods involves pipe bursting of existing pipe and replacement with new larger diameter pipe . The existing pipe is shattered into small pieces and pushed into the surrounding soil . A new pipe of like or larger size is then towed into the borehole . Pipe bursting can be used for water transmission mains , wastewater force mains , and gravity sewer lines with excellent results .

@@1622719 <h> Policy Management " DCSCA " Drug Supply Chain Integrity <p> When the Drug Quality and Security Act ( DQSA ) was signed by President Obama on November 27 , 2013 , advocates hoped that the confusing patchwork of State laws governing drug pedigree and tracing would finally be replaced by a comprehensive solution for the 3Ts ( Transaction History , Transaction Statement , and Transaction Information ) of the increasingly complex pharmaceutical supply chain . Title II of DQSA , the Drug Supply Chain Security Act ( DSCSA ) focused on building " an electronic , interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs . " Encompassing every link in the supply chain manufacturers , repackagers , wholesale distributors , and dispensers , as well as third-party logistics providers the legislation promised to deliver one law governing the identification , management , and traceability of drug products within the United States . <p> Working on a ten-year implementation schedule , the system is expected to deliver the following capabilities upon completion : <p> " enable verification of the legitimacy of the drug product identifier down to the package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the drug supply chain ; and <p> facilitate more efficient recalls of drug products . " <p> Since the system was designed to " enhance the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations ability to help protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be counterfeit , stolen , contaminated , or otherwise harmful , " implementation required the FDA to " develop standards , guidance documents , and pilot programsto support efficient and effective implementation . " <p> The first implementation phase deadline came in January 2015 with " lot-level management " for manufacturers , wholesalers , and repackagers to share the " 3Ts " at the Lot or batch level of identification . For hospital and retail pharmacies , the deadline for the same " lot-level management " will be July 1 , 2015 after an approved extension from the FDA . Identification of individual items ( the mid-phase of the implementation ) has to be in place across the entire supply chain by 2019 , with the final phase , the ability to track an individual item back to the original manufacturer , in place by 2023 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail and hospital ) carries some additional responsibilities . In addition to the receipt and provision of " 3T " information , systems must also be in place to segregate and investigate suspect products ( required in the original January 1 deadline ) , to verify that all suppliers are authorized trading partners , and to securely retain the transaction data for at least 6 years from the date of the transaction . In addition , while the DSCSA was designed to provide a consistent framework across States , individual pharmacies still bear the burden of compliance with all existing state licensing requirements.Since pharmacies operate at the retail end of the supply chain , there is a risk that pharmacy managers will interpret compliance to the DSCSA as simply being the passive receipt of " 3T " information from their upstream trading partners . This could not be further from the truth . Without the implementation of comprehensive and consistent policies , procedures , and processes to ensure compliance to the evolving standards of DSCSA compliance , individual pharmacies and their parent organizations will face stiff violation penalties from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these requirements could be the most cost-effective business decision you 'll make all year . @qwx70988 @qwx70989 <p> Richard McKinlay , Senior Engineer at resource recovery specialist Axion Consulting suggests the recycling industry and infrastructure needs to move to a complete supply chain approach if it is to thrive and succeed .

Solid state electronics and simple optics provide the basis for our superior stability and sensitivity . The Ebert mount monochromator and user-selectable bandwidth give the system maximum flexibility . Our short-path dynamic nebulizer/burner configuration is highly efficient . An inert needle , precisely positioned in a high flow venturi , delivers sample to the corrosion proof impact bead . This results in a tremendously high nebulization effect for all types of sample matrices . <p> This is the oldest and still most commonly used technique , particularly for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a deuterium lamp ) with broad emission is used to measure the background absorption over the entire width of the exit slit of the spectrometer . In the 210VGP &amp; Accusys 211 the deuterium lamp is in-line with the hollow cathode lamp , thus eliminating the need for a double beam system . The benefits of a single beam system are more energy , smaller size , lower cost , and a more sensitivity . <p> The Buck 210VGP is a single beam AA which has proven itself worldwide as a workhorse . Our simple , single beam optical layout may buck convention , ( no pun intended ) but we know it works better . Let us explain . <p> Double beam instruments were originally designed to overcome poor hollow cathode lamp characteristics , noisy Power Supplies , drifting detectors &amp; amplifiers , thermal expansion variations in optical components ( mirrors , beamsplitters , mounts , etc . ) By using a high light-loss optical component , the beam splitter , to divide the signal beam from the hollow cathode lamp , served to correct for these low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sample measurement , compensation between the reference and sample beams was maintained . In later years , the addition of a deuterium continuum lamp for background correction introduced a second beam splitter ; thus cutting the hollow cathode lamp energy in half again . This does not even take in to account the 6-10 additional Mirrors used to define the optical path for these large , heavy and expensive ( albeit very stable ) double beam AAS instruments . <p> So , after fixing AA instruments for 20 years Buck set out to design a single beam AA just to see if it could be done . Well it worked , and since 1992 the 210VGP has been delivering superior results due to it 's simple optical layout providing a high energy throughput .

His older component designs have been copied by at least 100 companies worldwide and in many cases , are still in use . He designed the controlled air and after burner combination , which was later called " Pyrolytic Gasification " by the Engineering Society of the United States . <p> Fly ash and dirt were the bane of the old incinerator design that caused a bad reputation for New York apartment buildings . It became a national joke in the 60s . The Hoskinson design was a totally new design that eliminated this problem and gained immediate acceptance worldwide . <p> A demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press corp of London led to more than 1000 machines being built by Middon Industries of Walterhampton , England the first year ! <p> Throughout the next 3 decades , Gordon Hoskinson manufactured and sold thousands of units to many of the Fortune 500 Companies , the White House , other federal agencies , nearly all international airports , and most of the major medical centers in North America . <p> After his experience in Korea , Barbados and other countries in the 90s , he was retained as a consultant by a firm in Indiana to develop the next generation medical waste modular combustor based on his decades- long proven experience and technology . <p> Two years of intense research was completed , and from that research , major innovations have been added to our latest version of Hoskinsons successful designs legacy . <p> It just makes sense to use the waste and garbage that our society creates and turn it into a responsible and clean source of renewable energy . <p> This is the ultimate Renewable Energy Solution available today . Our Waste-to-Energy power plant is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stable and continuous electricity for homes and businesses . And in the process , our design also meets or exceeds all applicable environmental requirements without the use of extensive and expensive anti-pollution control equipment . <p> Each Plant uses our proven and proprietary pyrolytic gasification process which reaches temperatures of nearly 2,000F that very efficiently disposes of waste , pathogens , and other pollutants . Operating at these temperatures very efficiently converts even high-humidity content waste into power at up to 6 MW per 150-tons per day of waste . Higher BTU content waste may produce up to 10 MW per unit . <p> The Plant uses virtually no external fossil fuel , produces no discernible pollution , and uses proven and innovative Hoskinson technology developed by Gordon Hoskinson over the last 45 years , which makes it is easier to maintain and operate . Staying true to a " keep it simple " philosophy also reduces the Total Cost of Ownership and provides for the potential to operate each plant at a profit . <p> We can increase the waste throughput using our unique scalable design to consume up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corresponding increase in electricity production by co-locating up to four of our gasification and combustion units into one Facility . This multi-unit deployment strategy also provides for a rotational preventative maintenance schedule for each unit without shutting down all operations . Additionally , geographically distributing our Waste-to-Energy Facilities around larger communities results in more efficient waste collection operations that can consume thousands of tons of waste per day . <p> Our modular " bolt-together " design keeps on-site fabrication to an absolute minimum which increases the quality and speed of the installation . Full Facility operations can be initiated within 12 months or so from the time of purchase . Download our latest brochure here for a summary of features . <p> The Hoskinson Group has the experience and knowledge to solve the problem of waste that many cities face today . <p> In many cases , the electricity-generating component of the Facility provides a financial bonus to the dire need of removing the waste and usually provides a profit center for the community or private enterprise . In these times of tight budgets , this can help bridge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Father of modular pyrolytic gasification and combustion , Gordon Hoskinson has dozens of inventions and patents in the waste-to-energy sector . He and his companies have manufactured thousands of machines to convert waste into energy over the last 45 years , regardless of the type or variety . The following describes many of his accomplishments throughout his long and successful career .

We have considerable technical ' know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gasifiers and Internal Combustion Engines . The technology we employ incorporates fully proven technology which provides efficient production of energy from waste . <p> ITI 's business strategy is to leverage the efficiency and price competitiveness of its technology to retain ownership of a proportion of the equity or earnings stream of every project it is involved in . Thus ITI seeks to develop Build Own Operate projects for its own account or with clients and Joint Venture partners which allows it to remain a long term project participant . <p> Generally , ITI 's strategy has been well received by the market . While there are certain clients who would prefer to simply purchase plant , through joint venturing ITI is prepared to supply equipment on much tighter margins thus reducing the capital cost of the project , lowering the risk and enhancing the IRRs . Furthermore , the plant is capable of markedly greater performance than we would be able to warrant as capital goods suppliers so by remaining involved in the operation we can maximise the value extracted from the assets . ITI 's strategy is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale ' , directly into the equity of the projects or into development of new ones . <p> With more established technologies this approach would be likely to extend sales cycles or project development negotiations , however with a new technology in a market where there is little established competition a joint venture approach is if anything reassuring to our clients . Project development cycles are generally quite extended in this sector and by working with our clients in this manner they have the opportunity to understand the technology and we are able to ensure that suitable precedents are set in planning , permitting and operations . <p> Build , own and operate : ITI will identify and develop the site and finance , construct and operate the plant . ITI will retain 100% ownership and control , so of all the options it provides the best value return and greater financing leverage for future projects.Joint Venture : ITI expects the majority of its projects to be undertaken in Joint Venture , either with one of its development partners or with waste management contractors , energy off-takers or site owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will house one or multiple projects . ITI targets 50% equity ownership of each project , though acknowledges that in some cases there will be more than one partner involved so ownership may diminish . The partners in the JV will charge their services ( management , operations and maintenance etc ) to the SPV on a pre-agreed , open book basis.Technology licence and performance royalty : Where a potential client or partner does not wish to set up a JV ITI offers the option of an annual licence fee and performance based royalty agreement ; subject to certain performance criteria ITI would capture a substantial share of the nett income or revenue stream of the project . In most cases ITI will provide the O&amp;M to the plant and even where it does not it will remotely monitor and manage the optimisation of the plant through a remote SCADA system.Gasifier sale : ITI may make the occasional sale of a gasifier in order to seed a market with a reference plant .
