( WJHG/WECP ) -- UPDATE June 29 , 2016 10PMGlenn Burns , the Chief Meteorologist at WSB-TV has issued a statement about his report , which we talk about in this article . A copy of that clarification issued minutes ago is linked below. **30;221;TOOLONG Story : June 29 , 2016 9:30 PM Despite what an Atlanta TV station claimed on-air and on its website , no flesh-eating bacteria has been detected in waters off Florida Panhandle beaches . <p> Beaches are open and the water is fine . That 's the message tourism leaders want to make sure the public knows in the wake of some incorrect information from a television station in Atlanta . <p> WSB-TV Chief Meteorologist Glenn Burns took to social media and the airwaves Wednesday warning people to stay out of gulf waters due to " toxic fecal bacteria . " In a tweet with a link to a station story , Burns wrote " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Florida Panhandle . " <p> On the air Burns talked about the advisories while standing in front of a graphic highlighting Okaloosa County and Walton County in a bold red outline with the words " NO SWIM ADVISORY TOXIC FECAL BACTERIA " on it , and listing areas like Fort Walton Beach , Destin , Miramar Beach , Seaside and Rosemary Beach . <p> Here 's the text of what he said on the air at 4:31 pm local time . A video on WSB 's Facebook page of this broadcast had been viewed more than 1.5 million times in less than 5 hours Wednesday . <p> " If you 're headed down to the Florida Panhandle beaches to cool off this weekend , be advised now , " No Swim " advisories are being issued by the National Weather Services and toxic fecal bacteria big problem now Fort Walton Beach , Destin , Miramar Beach , Seaside and Rosemary Beach . So " No Swim " advisories are in effect for really toxic levels of fecal bacteria . That along with very toxic blue-green algae . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to these beaches that are posted where we have these " No Swim " advisories . So just be advised that when you head down there , we could see these toxic levels of fecal bacteria continuing and very dangerous to swim in these waters . And you know they call this kind of the flesh-eating bacteria and that 's what we 're dealing with now in these Florida Panhandle beaches . So just wanted to advise you of that and again the local health departments will be posting signs all along those Florida beaches to keep you advised as you head down there this holiday weekend . " <p> But there 's a problem . The NWS does n't issue swimming advisories Burns refers to and never has . The Florida Department of Health , working in conjunction with county offices does as part of the DOH 's Healthy Beaches Program . A story on the WSB website initially mimicked what Burns said about the NWS issuing advisories but was changed to reflect the correct information . <p> Also , the " flesh-eating " bacteria Burns referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) which can be caused by vibrio vulnificus , NOT enterococci ( fecal bacteria ) . It 's elevated levels of enterococci *NOT vibrio vulnificus* which prompted a health advisory at six testing locations in Okaloosa County and " No Swim " advisories at two testing locations in Walton County . <p> So what is all this testing , why is it done and what does it all mean ? <p> FDOH 's Healthy Beaches Program covers weekly water-quality testing done every year from March through October . The program has done weekly testing since 2002 . <p> Testing is done at seven locations in Walton County , thirteen locations in Okaloosa County , ten locations in Bay County , and six locations in Gulf County . Besides the already mentioned locations , all other testing locations in Okaloosa , Bay , Walton and Gulf Counties came back as either " good " or " moderate . " <p> So what is enterococci ? According to the Florida Department of Health website , enterococci " are enteric bacteria that normally inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and animals . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution , which may come from stormwater runoff , pets and wildlife , and human sewage . If they are present in high concentrations in recreational waters and are ingested while swimming or enter the skin through a cut or sore , they may cause human disease , infections or rashes . " <p> So what are the levels used in testing ? From the DOH website : " According to studies conducted by the EPA , enterococci have a greater correlation with swimming-associated gastrointestinal illness in both marine and fresh waters than other bacterial indicator organisms , and are less likely to " die off " in saltwater . If an enterococci result were observed to exceed 70 colony forming units per 100 milliliters of beach water sampled and a resampling result also exceeds this value , then an " Advisory " would be issued for the sampling site . " <p> So what can cause levels to fluctuate ? A heavy rain which causes runoff into gulf waters is usually the culprit . If you have a long dry stretch followed by a heavy rain , enterococci levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of days . <p> The most recent testing was done Monday June 27 and the results were released Wednesday June 29 . No word yet on if additional testing will be done . <p> Who 's most at risk ? Generally people with weakened immune systems are most at-risk . If you 're otherwise healthy , you 'll probably never notice anything out of the ordinary . If you have something like a big cut or wound , it 's best to stay out of the water until that heals , no matter what the test results say . <p> Local hotels and condominiums are reporting calls from people looking to cancel their vacations based off of the report on WSB that has spread like wildfire on social media . <p> Before the report aired , in Panama City Beach , numerous hotels are reporting strong numbers for bookings for the upcoming 4th of July weekend . It was a similar story in Walton and Okaloosa Counties . <p> Local tourism leaders reached out to WJHG and WECP to help clarify the situation . <p> " As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware , there is a story going around that 's causing some confusion , " wrote David Demarest with the Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau . " The end point should be that this does not apply to Panama City Beach , and monitoring shows that our beaches and water are in good condition . " <p> Okaloosa County sent out a tweet saying " Okaloosa County beaches are NOT closed to flesh eating bacteria or any bacteria ! " <p> And the Walton County Sheriff 's Office sent a tweet linking to the local test results . <p> Best advice : Use common sense and stay informed . If there 's a serious health risk to the general public , you 'll hear about it from us here at WJHG and WECP. ===========Edited to clarify necrotizing fasciitis can be caused by vibrio vulnificus. @qwx38779 @qwx38785

Only a week ago , the president had acted to suspend America 's refugee program and halt immigration to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries that the government said raise terrorism concerns . <p> As the White House worked to reinstate the ban , Trump mocked U.S. District Judge James Robart , appointed by President George W. Bush , as a " so-called judge " whose " ridiculous " ruling " will be overturned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ban was lifted by a judge , many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country . A terrible decision . " <p> Trump 's direct attack recalled his diatribes during the campaign against a federal judge of Mexican heritage who was overseeing a Trump University case . Justice Department lawyers could be called upon to answer for his words as the travel ban case reaches the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals . <p> The order had caused unending confusion for many foreigners trying to reach the United States , prompted protests across the United States and led to multiple court challenges . Demonstrations took place outside the White House , in New York and elsewhere . One was planned later Saturday near the estate in Palm Beach , Florida , where Trump was spending the weekend and where the American Red Cross scheduled its annual fundraising gala . <p> Robart 's ruling , which the Justice Department promised to challenge , led federal agencies to unwind enforcement of Trump 's executive order . <p> The State Department , after initially saying that as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sudan , Libya , Somalia or Yemen had their visas canceled , reversed course on Saturday and said they could travel to the U.S. if they had a valid visa . <p> The department on Saturday advised refugee aid agencies that refugees set to travel before Trump signed his order will now be allowed into the United States . A State Department official said in an email obtained by The Associated Press that the government was " focusing on booking refugee travel " through Feb. 17 and working to have arrivals resume as soon as Monday . <p> The Homeland Security Department no longer was directing airlines to prevent visa-holders affected by Trump 's order from boarding U.S.-bound planes . The agency said it had " suspended any and all actions " related to putting in place Trump 's order , which the White House argued was " intended to protect the homeland . " <p> The Justice Department was expected to ask the 9th Circuit to set side Robart 's ruling so the ban could go back into effect.Trump made clear what he ridiculous and will be overturned , " Trump tweeted . " When a country is no longer able to say who can and who can not come in &amp; out , especially for reasons of safety &amp; security - big trouble ! " <p> After a pause of several hours , the can come into U.S. ? " <p> Sen. Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee , criticized Trump for " attempting to bully and disparage yet another federal judge " and said he seemed " intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis . " Trump 's rhetoric also could put government lawyers defending his order in a tough spot . <p> " Either they have to defend the statements that Judge Robart is a ' so-called judge , ' which you ca n't do , or they have to distance themselves from the president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law professor Arthur Hellman . <p> With legal challenges pending , two prominent Middle Eastern air carriers announced they would resume carrying passengers from the seven affected countries . Qatar Airways and Etihad Airways , national carrier of the United Arab Emirates , said U.S.-bound travelers from those countries with valid visas would be allowed to board . <p> In Egypt , Cairo airport and airline officials said they have received instructions from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection to suspend President Trump 's executive order . <p> Government-backed Qatar Airways is one of a few Mideast airlines operating direct daily flights to multiple American cities . Its U.S. destinations from its Doha hub include New York , Chicago , Los Angeles , Miami and Washington . <p> At New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport , volunteer lawyer Renee Paradis said most of the flights involving passengers from the affected countries were to arrive later Saturday . <p> " Anybody who comes here on a visa is supposed to be allowed in , so we would anticipate that somebody who is in the air would be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , as with everything this week , it remains to be seen what happens on the ground . " <p> The executive order has caused chaos within the government and the courts . Trump fired Sally Yates , an Obama administration holdover who was serving as acting attorney general , after she said the Justice Department would not enforce it . In Washington on Saturday , demonstrators chanting " No hate , No fear , Refugees are welcome here " walked from the White House down Pennsylvania Avenue.Hearings have also been held in court challenges nationwide . <p> In arguments to the court , Washington state and Minnesota said the temporary ban and the global suspension of the U.S. refugee program harmed residents and effectively mandated discrimination . <p> Federal attorneys had argued that Congress gave the president authority to make decisions on national security and immigrant entry . <p> But in his written order Friday , Robart said it 's not the court 's job to " create policy or judge the wisdom of any particular policy promoted by the other two branches , " but rather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " comports with our country 's laws .

Heimlich , Creator of Anti-choking Maneuver , Dies at 96 . <p> By Washington Post&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp <p> Posted : Sat 3:14 PM , Dec 17 , 2016&amp;nbsp&amp;nbsp <p> Updated : Sat 3:54 PM , Dec 17 , 2016 <p> AL.com Henry J. Heimlich , the Cincinnati surgeon whose " bear-hug " maneuver has been credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of choking victims but whose aggressive self-promotion and unorthodox medical ideas cast a shadow over his legacy , died Dec. 17 at a Cincinnati hospital . He was 96 . <p> He had a heart attack , said a son , Phil Heimlich . <p> In a career spanning seven decades , Henry Heimlich zealously promoted lifesaving procedures and techniques he invented or refined . Besides the first-aid rescue maneuver introduced in 1974 , these advances included a now-common surgical procedure he helped develop in the 1950s for people with severe esophageal damage and a valve for chest drainage that was widely used during field surgery in the Vietnam War and in emergency facilities . <p> Dr. Heimlich , 96 , uses his maneuver for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 96 , uses his maneuver for the first time to save choking woman <p> Heimlich dislodged a piece of hamburger from the 87-year-old woman 's airway and she quickly recovered . <p> Heimlich was a charismatic speaker with unshakable faith in his abilities . He repeatedly circumvented established practices such as publishing in peer-reviewed journals , and he presented himself as a medical David fighting an establishment Goliath when confronting skeptics . <p> And opposition was not unusual . <p> His attempts to make the Heimlich maneuver the chief or sole response in choking and drowning situations encountered resistance , and his later efforts to use malariotherapy - exposure to malaria - to treat illnesses including AIDS , cancer and Lyme disease were fiercely criticized . <p> " It 's the pattern , " he told The Washington Post in 1989 . " First , they say it wo n't work , then when it proves to work , they say it 's nothing new . Most people can not accept some guy coming in who 's not totally involved in the politics of the field , coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 years . " <p> He was colorful and combative when defending his most enduring contribution to medicine , the " bear hug " that became known as the Heimlich maneuver . In his public speaking engagements and sundry television appearances , Heimlich often selected the most attractive woman he could find in the audience to demonstrate the maneuver . <p> The slightly risque nature of his showmanship led to appearances on Johnny Carson 's " Tonight Show . " <p> " Listen , Johnny , " Heimlich quipped , " if I can do this maneuver on a human , I can do it on you . " <p> Ronald Reagan , on the campaign trail in 1976 , New York Mayor Edward I. Koch and actresses Marlene Dietrich and Elizabeth Taylor were reputed beneficiaries of the Heimlich maneuver . But the degree to which it entered the public consciousness did little to end his battle with medical associations that gave only qualified support to the Heimlich . <p> His research relied too much on anecdotal evidence and too little on quantitative data to persuade the American Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Association . " You ca n't establish scientific truth with a popular vote , " Don M. Benson , then-anesthesiology chairman at Aultman Hospital in Canton , Ohio , told the Wall Street Journal in 1979 . <p> In 1986 , the American Red Cross recognized the Heimlich maneuver as a useful rescue technique in choking incidents . But the organization would not endorse it as the primary response in drowning cases , and Heimlich wrote the organization 's leaders , essentially accusing them of letting people die while they dawdled on research and bureaucracy . <p> By training , Heimlich was a thoracic surgeon , or a specialist in chest surgery . When he began developing the Heimlich , in 1973 , he was the chief of surgery at the Jewish Hospital of Cincinnati . <p> Although the backslap was a common response to choking at the time , it sometimes caused an object to become lodged deeper in a victim 's throat . ( Heimlich dismissed backslaps as " death blows . " ) And physician-inventors had proposed gadgets such as the " Throat-E-Vac " ( a vacuum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) without much success . <p> Heimlich knew that air remained in the lungs after an exhalation . That air , he believed , could be used to expel an object . He experimented on an anesthetized beagle and eventually realized that with an upward thrust into the soft tissue under the diaphragm , an object could be dislodged from the throat . <p> The maneuver is elementary , as the doctor wanted it to be . The rescuer stands behind the choking victim , with the rescuer 's arms around the victim 's waist and then delivers a sharp , upward abdominal thrust , just above the belly button . <p> He wrote about the first-aid technique in the June 1974 issue of Emergency Medicine . He explained how the maneuver worked and urged readers to send him success stories . He sent the article to science and health writers in the mainstream media and said that more than 2,000 stories of being saved by the maneuver came back within a year . <p> Heimlich parlayed that early publicity into popular support for his anti-choking technique . In 1984 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next year , then-Surgeon General C. Everett Koop , who said he once performed the maneuver on a grandson , called the Heimlich maneuver " the only method that should be used for the treatment of choking from foreign body airway obstruction . " <p> In 1986 , Koop 's pressure led the American Red Cross and American Heart Association to recognize the Heimlich maneuver as a useful rescue technique in choking . But the Red Cross also recommended that the Heimlich maneuver be used on drowning victims only if mouth-to-mouth resuscitation failed because of a " solid body " airway obstruction . Water in the airway is not considered a solid body obstruction . <p> Autoplay : On Off <p> Henry Jay Heimlich was born Feb. 3 , 1920 , in Wilmington , Del. , and raised in New Rochelle , N.Y . He often accompanied his father , a social worker , on his rounds of New York state prisons . <p> After graduating from Cornell University in 1941 and its medical school in 1943 , Henry Heimlich served as a Navy surgeon during World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a Marine unit helping Chinese allies in the Gobi Desert in Mongolia , and he often operated in a field hospital without electricity . <p> In 1951 , he married Jane Murray , the daughter of dance studio personalities Arthur and Kathryn Murray . His wife died in 2012 . <p> Around the time of his marriage , Heimlich began working as a thoracic surgeon at New York City hospitals . He devoted his spare time to developing new medical devices and techniques . On a napkin , he sketched an idea for using a section of a patient 's stomach to construct a new esophagus to treat esophageal damage caused , for instance , by cancer or the ingestion of a caustic chemical . <p> The idea got the brushoff from several hospital executives , but he eventually secured a $300 grant and laboratory space and tested the procedure on dogs . He published his findings in the journal Surgery in 1955 , and two years later , he successfully performed the operation on a human . Heimlich , for years , was credited as a prime developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became standard in operating rooms . <p> In later decades , a dispute arose over whether Heimlich had purposely underplayed the contribution of a Romanian surgeon who performed the procedure on a person before he did . That doctor , Dan Gavriliu , called Heimlich a " liar and thief " when the Cincinnati Enquirer contacted him in 2003 for an investigative story about Heimlich 's career . Beyond dispute , however , was Heimlich 's role in popularizing the procedure . <p> The newspaper 's investigation found that Heimlich credited Gavriliu in a 1957 Surgery article but in later years gradually diminished Gavriliu 's role . <p> In the 1960s , Heimlich introduced a simple valve to drain severe chest wounds . He said he was motivated by his memory of the primitive conditions he worked under in Mongolia . He fashioned a prototype using a toy noisemaker , which functioned as a one-way flutter valve when attached to a drainage bottle . <p> Decades later , he said that he started a company to manufacture the valves in 1964 and that a doctor from a Navy medical research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Both innovations - the reversed gastric tube and the chest valve - were variations of existing procedures , said Thomas Schlich , a medical historian at McGill University in Montreal . <p> Schlich said of the esophageal operation : " I do n't see that it had a great impact , nor was it really original . " The same is true of the chest valve ; Schlich said Dr. Heimlich altered a device that already existed . <p> In the mid-1980s , Heimlich began experimenting with malariotherapy , in which a patient is intentionally given malaria in the hope that the high fevers caused by the disease will cure or relieve another infection . An Austrian psychiatrist , Julius Wagner-Jauregg , won a Nobel Prize in 1927 for malariotherapy of neurosyphilis . The usefulness of the strategy , however , has never been proved . <p> Heimlich believed that malariotherapy could treat HIV infection , among other illnesses . He took his clinical trials to Mexico and China before bowing to pressure and shutting down the project . <p> " He was grasping at straws and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roepe , a malaria scientist at Georgetown University . " If something is not a legitimate proposal in the eyes of the broad medical community , then you do n't get funding , and that 's why he took it abroad . " <p> A group of scientists and doctors from the United States and Mexico had petitioned against the HIV project , which was funded by a group of Hollywood supporters including actresses Amy Irving and Estelle Getty , the New Republic reported . <p> " This exploits the AIDS crisis , exploits the generous and caring entertainment community , and it exploits the good that Heimlich himself has done in the past , " said Paul Bronston , national ethics chairman of the American College of Medical Quality and a petition supporter . <p> The doctor 's most vehement adversary was his estranged son , Peter , a fabric importer who had a website devoted to attacking his father . For more than a decade , he contacted hundreds of reporters ( sometimes using pseudonyms ) to denounce his father as a fraud who promoted dangerous medical treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son 's attacks . His three other children stood by their father and defended his work and character . A complete list of survivors was not immediately available . <p> After his contract at the Jewish Hospital of Cincinnati was not renewed in 1977 , Heimlich spent about a decade as an advanced clinical professor at Cincinnati 's Xavier University . He remained through recent years the chief evangelist of the Heimlich maneuver and his own legacy . <p> This May , he received a flurry of attention for performing the Heimlich on an 87-year-old woman choking on a piece of meat at their senior residence in Cincinnati . Heimlich said it was the first time he had used the maneuver in an emergency , an assertion apparently contradicted by statements made to media outlets in the early 2000s. @qwx38779 @qwx38785
