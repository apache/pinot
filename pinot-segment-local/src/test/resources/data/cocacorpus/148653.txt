An ordinary pot works as well , but it takes 3 times as long and requires 6 times as much electricity , gas , etc . <p> Fourth , you mince an onion and crush a few garlic . By a few I mean a lot = <p> Fifth , you saute the onion and garlic in a deep pan until golden brown . Cast iron works great(*) . I use one of these . Use more oil than you think.You probably want to cover 1/4 of the bottom . I used olive oil . <p> ( * ) Way better than teflon ! <p> Sixth , get the beans out of the pressure cooker . Drain the water and dump them in the pan . Mash some of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Make sure they do n't  burn . This should take ten minutes or so . Add oil if they look like they are going to burn . Also , turn down the heat . <p> Some strategies for discovering things that go unnoticed would involve ignoring the " junk mail " and go to the ( usually smaller ) shops in the side streets . These often offer better deals because they do not sell low margin junk and compensate for it by volume and advertising like the mass stores . Yesterday I alluded to the fact that search engines may have begun to suffer from the same problem by ranking according to popularity or by being gamed by specific writing styles ( aka " marketing " in the real world ) . In other words , search engines show the main streets , first and foremost , and not so much the side streets . To wit , a search engine would show a main street shop if it had just one item of what you were asking for instead of showing a side street shop with more selections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are judged by the network rather than their inherent quality . <p> One way of discovering new blogs is to use other blogs as a reference . This , I think , does not work nearly as well as it could . <p> I do not think a blog roll is any substitute for that . Blogroll often turn into word for it , but it was n't fit for publication = ) , consequently grow huge , etc . They are often not reflective of what the bloggers actually read . <p> Maybe it is time to return to the roots : A blog is really short for weblog and in a blog one is supposed to write about what one did on the web on that particular day . It may be as simple as a rough edit of ones browser history . <p> I usually start my " program " with a relocation closer to work and shopping . This allows one to she 'd at least one car . The rest is just variations and polishing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a frugal antisuburan lifestyle without car dependence , hour long commutes , and big houses . <p> Note that this is fairly similar to the college lifestyle without the room mates and eventually with better stuff . Being a graduate student , which is an excellent study in enlightened poverty , I was ready to dive right into this , but for the more " established " with societal expectations and a developing appreciation for bling , I realize it is not so easy . <p> The steps to get ready are very similar to going cruising by which I mean serious cruising as it moving aboard and sailing around for many months ( not a short charter in the Caribbean ) . The primary requirements are as follows : <p> Obviously the right mindset is the most important . You have to want the " destination " more than you want the other things in your life . If you do not think about it constantly , it is not likely to happen . This has nothing to do with magical thinking about attracting things into your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abut something constantly means having made it a top priority . I have thought of various things along the way : Not being mortgaged , anticonsumerism , capitalism , environmentalism , etc . These are all compatible so it worked for me . <p> Second , I did not have a huge weight dragging me down . I had moved often and so I did not have a lot of accumulated junk . In other words , I was not owned by my stuff . However , a lot of people are really owned by their stuff . If they ca n't move because it would mean that they would have to give up their sofa set , then they are owned by their sofa set . Here , possessions need to be substituted for anything that is less or not tangible : Hobbies , missions , dreams , relations , etc . <p> Third , I could walk . Not only could I walk 6 miles on a daily basis , I did not mind it . For someone going cruising , walking almost merits its own chapter , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car or a bicycle . Sure , a bicycle is convenient , but you do n't  always get to park it and so it is not always available . Walking is a prerequisite ; specifically the concept of walking is . I see many wives and couples around the housing developments in their sweats our walking swinging their arms around with ipods strapped to their shoulders . This is walking for exercise . If you walk to get somewhere and is n't dressed in neon , please do n't  swing your arms like that , okay ? = <p> It may take as much as a year , maybe two , to get comfortable with this new mindset . For changing your mindset , you can either talk to people ( this is tricky , since there are very few of them ) or read blogs or books . For downsizing , start selling or giving away or using the regular tricks . Most importantly , stop buying . For walking , just go out and do it . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287410 @2287410/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Disclaimer : This post has gotten wildly popular on the internet so in many cases this post is the first and only post many people will read . Regular readers will already know that I 'm married and that we split expenses 50/50 . Hence , our combined budget is $14,000/year . For first time readers , let me point out that I have , however , been living on $7,000/year or less for at least a decade and I 've only been married for 5 of those years . Getting married meant saving money on things like rent , but it also meant having to compromise and spending money on things which I rarely use and otherwise would n't have bought myself . Speaking in terms of budgets , its been a wash . I spend as much being single as being married . <p> Okay , that does it . I 'm getting tired of the pervasive media articles that detail how people are " surviving " or " barely managing " on what qualifies as average or definitely median household incomes . This is like writing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their height issues complete with tips and tricks on how to cope with their shortage . Ha ! . For the record , 510 " is the average height of a US male . Fun fact : This is also the median , since there are few 12 ' tall guys to skew the distribution . <p> The waterfall that finally crushed the camel was this yahoo article which discusses how a single person " survives " is living well on $20,000/year , but that 's just one out of many . In particular , it followed an initial article on how a family survives on $40,000/year . This is pretty close to the median household income in the US ! It means that about half of everybody , that 's 150+ million people , is currently living on LESS than those amounts . Surely , that 's no secret , and surely that 's not very remarkable either . <p> here 's an article with a family that 's struggling on $250,000/year . Poor guys ! They spend more on cleaning services than I do on pretty much everything combined . Regardless of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goddamn broom myself before I started talking about my financial struggles . The gall ! <p> The media must be living in a bubble that is entirely separated from Main Street . Look , it is n't that hard to find someone who lives on $10,000/year , or $5,000/year . I can even provide a couple of pointers to people who live on $0/year . ( And no , they 're not living under a bridge ) . <p> The problem is , and I think I get it now , is that the media is in the business of pushing content in order to sell ads , so they must write for the biggest common denominator . It makes strategic sense for a magazine to write articles about families who spend $48,000 per year and now struggle because they had to cancel their netflix subscription . Or for a magazine to write articles about families who spend a quarter million per year and now struggle because they had to give up their daily fireworks(*) . People can sympathize with people who are similar to themselves and the entitlement-class always thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forgiven . <p> ( * ) Thanks Mo ! I 'm stealing that one . It was just too funny . <p> However , I still have a problem with the numbers . Back in the days when I started this blog , I made the mistake of calling it Early Retirement Extreme . The first problem was the word retirement which means different things to different people ( see FAQ ) . The second problem , which is relevant here , is the word extreme . <p> I get many comments from so-called complainypants that I 'm too " extreme " . The extremeness seem to revolve around lentils and the low amount of money I spend , about $7,000/year . <p> Let 's make another attempt of dealing with the lentil issue . ( Please bear with me , it frustrates me because some people will read some post I wrote about about lentils and discard the ideas of early financial independence outright without a second thought because they do n't  like lentils . That is a sad loss of potential and all because this author likes dal . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I used to eat lentils in grad school because it was quick and easy to cook . Consequentially , some now think that 's all Ive been eating for the past 15 years . This is not the case ( see below ) . I suspect if I had said I used to eat ramen as an undergraduate , people would understand perfectly . But nooooI ate lentils so I 'm weird . Anyway <p> The second and more important aspect is the $7,000/year . The Wheaton Eco-scale explains this in a brilliant way . Consider people living at different budgets , e.g. $100k , $80k , $60k , $50k , $40k , $30k $20k , $15k , $10k , $7.5k , $5k , $2.5 , $1k , and $0k . Now , what Wheaton observes is that people who spend one or two levels below you are inspiring to you in terms of budget reductions . People who spend three levels below you are slightly nutty and people who spend four or more levels below your level are crazy or downright extreme . This holds no matter where you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inspiring , 30k is nutty and 20k is crazy . If you spend 30k , then 20k and 15k is inspiring , 10k is nutty , and 7.5k is crazy . Conversely , people who spend a couple of levels above you are considered prodigal and wasteful . <p> The problem is that budgets denominated in dollars are very one-dimensional . If you look at the article above of a guy who spends 20k/yearthats almost three times as much as I do while living in the same area ( San Francisco bay area ) , I note that he does something I do n't  ( go to bars ) but I have something he has n't  ( health insurance ) . Otherwise we have and do many of the same things . <p> What is the difference ? If I had to venture a guess , I 'd say I 'm more frugal ( the way your grandparents were frugalin fact what I do wouldnt be considered very extreme by your grandparents or great grandparentsId probably be average from their perspective ) and I adhere more to a do-it-your-self ethics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , he does n't  have a car ( but in San Francisco , that would be normal ) . <p> What really is remarkable is the similarity in lifestyle despite the disparity in spending . <p> I really hope that this is empathetically understood , especially by those who say they 're " not willing to be as extreme as me " someone who spends 15-20k would be a typical example . What I hear is essentially that they 're not willing to learn how to stretch their dollars further . They 're saying that they 're not willing to get the same thing that I have for $500/month instead of the $1400/month they 're paying . They 're not willing to learn or to think beyond their current frame of mind . <p> To be clear , the ERE efficiency strategy will get you a $20k lifestyle ( if you 're single ) or a $40k lifestyle ( which is the median for a US family ) for much less money down . Why wouldnt anyone want that ? Just about the only ones I can think of who does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm sorry , but I find this to be the most frustrating part about this blog or the ERE project as a whole . I may just be a very bad salesman . <p> Now , just for fun , I 'll answer the same questions as the ones in the article above . Contrast and compare in the comments . <p> Note : You can find a breakdown of my $7,000 budget in the frequently asked questions . I have been living on $5-7,000/year for about a decade now . This includes 5 years as a single and 5 years being married . <p> Do you avoid a lot of the expenses that many of your peers spend money on , such as technology and meals out ? <p> I would think so . I usually go to the mall to perform a kind of an anthropological expedition once a year and I see nothing there which interests me . Really nothing . Its mostly mid-range consumer stuff which will tragically end up in a garage or a landfill about ten years down the road . Except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , mostly because I hate eating out . My wife cooks practically all of our meals . However , we do have many of the same things . We have internet , netflix , and a car ( my wife drives it , I paid for half of its price and half of its operational cost in exchange for occasional rides ) . My computer is a seven year old 12 ? powerbook . <p> What 's your typical meal ? A very typical meal would be a salad from the garden ( cucumber , tomato , lettuce , mesclun ) with homemade thousand island dressing ( **26;0;TOOLONG , just try it , that 's all there is to it ) followed with pasta with a sauce based on beans , canned tomatoes , zucchini from the garden , onions , and olives . I douse this with hot sauce . For some strange reason , I 'm famous for eating lentils . I did that when I was in grad school because its quick and easy but since my wife took over the cooking and I took over the dishes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore . <p> What about clothes ? Practically never , by which I mean maybe once a year ( usually socks and underwear ) . In the winter , I usually wear a suit+jacket and a Hawaiian shirt ( can you tell , I got style ) or even a dress shirt . I also have a pair of jeans and a couple of " participation " t-shirts . In the summer I wear a pair of white dockers shorts . A lot of my clothes ( I do n't  have a lot ) is 10+ years old . The reason it lasts that long is that I line dry it . I will also wear clothes until it fails catastrophically ( rips ) . I 'm not opposed to Goodwill and Salvation Army , but usually they do n't  have my size of pants , 33+34 ; sweaters and jackets last decades ( my current one is almost 20 years old ) ; and t-shirts are incidental . <p> What about going on dates ? Were both homebodies . When we first met , my wifes friends dragged us out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ended up back at my placeless noise , easier to talk . Our dates consisted of home cooked dinners . These days I suppose our dates consists of walking the dog . <p> Do you indulge in any luxuries ? A lot of my stuff falls in the luxury category . For instance , the suit mentioned above is a $500 suit ( I bought it on sale for $100 ) . This may sound expensive until you realize that the suit is old and thus it holds up rather well . The amortization rate , that is , spreading the cost out over the years comes to very little . When I buy tools or other things to enjoy , I buy near the top ( this is why the Mall does n't  work for me ) . For example , I 've acquired several $300 hand planes for my woodworking . This may also sound expensive , but realize that if I ever tire of wood working , I can sell those for close to what I paid for them . This makes them much cheaper than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , many of my hobbies are financed by selling my old gadgets . My one exception is my martial arts training . I spend over $1,000 per year on that or almost 15% of my entire budget . <p> Do you have any savings for emergencies ? What , do you mean if I suddenly needed to raise $100,000 in cash because there was a sale on real estate ? Sure , I do . <p> Do you anticipate or look forward to having a higher salary one day ? I 'm financially independent . To me more money and higher incomes are more of a way of keeping score in the rat race and I left that race . Sure , I would like to have more money , because I like money and having more of it is nicer . I do n't  find it worth the sacrifice and I only consider it incidental to the things I do or that I 'd be willing to engage in . I would say in some respects , money does serve as a proxy for value . For instance , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that people are willing to pay $10 to read my ideas than I am at receiving the royalties . Ive been asked why I did n't  keep working in order to have more stuff or more " financial security " ( I would have been a millionaire at 38 if I had n't  retired at 33 ) . However , I already have all the stuff I would possible want to spend my time taking care off ( I do n't  like dusting and organizing stuff ) , and beyond a certain net worth , more net worth does not protect you financially . In other words , if there 's an event ( like hyperinflation ) that could cause you to loose one million dollars , it could just as easily cost you five million dollars . <p> What about retirementdo you plan on ever saving enough to retire ? Already did it . If one is frugal and do n't  make the mistake of buying the two financial independence killers on credit , that would be " more house than you need " and " more car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the " buy and throw away " merchandise in the mall , even an average salary ( which I had ) will allow a person to become financially independent at a rather young age . You do n't  need a six figure salary to pull it off . <p> Do you have any advice to others trying to live on $7,000 a year ? Yes , read this blog or just ask your grandparents . $7,000 for one person , which translates into $14,000 for our two person household ( which is located in a city with a cost of living index of 131 ) seems extreme today , but if you go back 50 years and compare how people lived back then , it is n't all that impressive . Furthermore , by many accounts people were happier back then . They werent zooming around trying to buy the newest cell phone model or waiting for the waiters in order to eat , and stressing out about their resumes in order to keep living their leveraged and amped up lifestylesif you call that living . Okay , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sane choice , and its everybody else who 's extreme . <h> 162 users responded in " How I live on $7,000 per year " <p> @Hummingbird You sound like a typical consumer who lacks imagination when it comes to doing things without spending money . <p> Jan said , <p> What if I want to play a round of golf or 2 ? <p> John Doe said , <p> This " $7,000/year lifestyle " is n't particularly accurate , honest , relevant , or impressive . I think $15,000 or $20,000 is a more accurate price tag and you have provided few details about the quality of what you get for your money . <p> 1 . If you bought a new RV with your half-million nest egg , its not honest to only count the trailer park lot rental toward your expenses . We cant all just have nice RVs drop from the sky . <p> 2 . If its a broken-down , used , nasty , stained , ill-smelling RV , then you need to indicate that . If you 've invested " sweat equity " cleaning it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( We cant all be handymen nor do we all have time to fix up ramshackle trailers . Especially if we have to work because were not independently wealthy . ) <p> 3 . You need to better explain the " $500/month rent plus utilities " . My daughter pays over $700/month for a small apartment she found through Craigslist in a semi-run-down residential neighborhood on the outskirts of a college town in middle America . Maybe an RV rental space alone in the outskirts of San Francisco is $500/month . But that requires owning an RV . Something does n't  add up . Maybe you live in a trailer park plagued by meth dealers ? <p> 4. $75/month for " high-premium " health insurance ? It must be nice to be young , healthy , and have the freedom to be active all day . Most of us do n't  have those luxuries . <p> 5 . Food is $100/month ? You got to be kidding me . Most of us spend that much a week . And if you live in an RV park , pray tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of us need to own land for that . And the time , money , skill , and water required to cultivate a productive garden are n't  free . <p> 6 . If your wife takes the car to work every day , you 're stuck home alone all day without a car . That does n't  cut it in most places in America where public transit is **27;28;TOOLONG and the climate is harsh much of the year . Maybe you can take the city bus across town , but those of us who have to work do n't  have the time for that . <p> 7 . So you buy expensive power tools , somehow sell them in used condition years later for almost their asking priceand do n't  count those in your expenses ? Something does n't  add up . If you have great skill as a salesman , maybe you can do this . But we all do n't  have that . Most of us can expect to get 50% at best from the sale of gently-used goods . <p> 8 . So you do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you , the human race would be extinct within a century . Some of us dedicate our lives not to penny-pinching , karate chops , and other adventuresbut to raising the next generation whether our own genetic offspring or others ( adopted children , stepchildren , etc . ) . Were changing the world , impacting lives , sacrificing our own fun to serve others . And its not cheap . Kids do n't  learn in underperforming " ghetto " schools where under-qualified teachers cant control classes and students do n't  feel safe . So now you need to try to live in a better school district . See #1 . Living costs skyrocket as the quality of public schools improve . And you 're talking about 2 cars , more food , more clothes , more utilities , more health care , etc . <p> You want the cheapest arrangement of all ? Move home with your parents . Rent is $0 . Many parents of adults in America have spare bedrooms ( empty nests ) . You could probably live for less than $7,000/year and be a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll tell you that much .

Get a hobby that you 'll love and make money from ( raising chickens for eggs or honey bee keeping ) . Each takes about 500 dollars to start up but you 'll make up your money in a year . Then there are all the free produce markets available even to people who are not indigent . Nice selections and free weekly . Saving up to 150 a month for myself . My greatest expenses are utilities , insurance companies and prescriptions . But 2015 I hope to live on 10k or less .

Ive been doing ERE for longer than Jacob ( 20 years ) , though I have less saved and only achieved FI 5 years ago .

Food , for example : I spent an average of $100/month , rarely eat out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could slash that in half , but that $50/month is an amount I can generate with fun work and instead i fight my ingrained frugality to buy premium items .

My guess is this question is asked for similar reasons . <p> The fact is that you do work full time as an x ? at x ? , you are still on someones payroll , although you say that you have enough money to stop working if you wanted to but you work because you like your work . <p> So the bottom line is that you work full time as an x in the conventional way .

" <p> P said , <p> I can see how this would be awkward question . You could honestly answer financial analyst / planner , but then those sorts of guys are expected to be raking in serious dough , and living fat . Maybe you could say you are a artist , writer ( of the financial sort ) , or a philosopher / guru . <p> I usually joke that I am retired . Most people usually ask you for your occupation however , in order to compare themselves against you . If the person who asked you was an accountant and your answer is financial analyst , then you are pretty much in the same group of incomes on average .

This is a classic High School Reunion question to determine who has what and do the mental social ranking exercise which I find offensive yet I have found this happen only a few times during the year . <p> When pressed about school I always state I am still in school ( true ) and when the retort is I am still working on graduating , I always share back I am finishing my 5th degree and then list the schools and graduate degrees . This always leaves a look that is priceless and places the status ranker in a fetal position a lot of fun ! <p> When pressed on career , it is really the same process of sharing my passion for technology , environment , farm , simplicity , frugality and focus on life and not using rank , position or any of the status driven social strips . Then I work to discuss a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , someone will push , push and for career strips or experience and I just laugh and state I am still working which is not my ultimate career so I am seeking to fulfill my ambitions of retirement . It usually makes the point yet every once and a while I will do the school strategy and I do a non-stop 15 minutes career de-brief without allowing for discussion . Given people who are asking out of bounds question are not really interested in the person , the look is priceless as they are wanting to escape the conversation and never come back . <p> Also , my perspective is 95% of the people are sincere and interested about others yet every once and a while the High School Rankers are out in force which elicits , for me , a difference response . <p> firefighter said , <p> Ive read that the Queen of England , who meets people of all kinds of different socioeconomic status , is known to use the opener question , " What is your current project ?

Lots of times people ask questions simply trying to be social . <p> When Im asked what I do , I say I 'm a mostly retired lawyer , and I write . I rarely get a follow up on that , and we move on to other things , with that social question out of the way . <p> Truth is I do waaaay more than that , but it only matters when I want to say it . <p> Working Rachel said , <p> This question does n't  bother me . Of course , I do n't  usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you make/how posh are you ? " sort of way . Maybe that 's how people mean it , but I generally assume they just want to know how I spend most of my time . The briefer question " What do you do ? " make it easier to interpret it that wayI sometimes say I 'm a writer even though I make virtually none of my income through writing . <p> This has been a question that has really only bothered me since I 've been retired . Usually that is a conversation stopper . It seems I was much more interesting to people when I was a venture capital CFO than I am as " retired . " Ironic , as my life is much more interesting now ! <p> But I recently had a fun moment in writing class during break , when a couple of classmates I was talking to said " you 're retire , right ? " I told them I was . They asked me what I used to do , and when I told them , they looked shocked . We talked about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a creative person , and " finance-type " just does not compute in their minds for what they know of me . <p> I loved that , because whatever judgement anyone would have made of me when I answered as the " CFO , " was much less accurate than the ones that my writing classmates have of me as " writing student " . <p> For my part , I am trying to ask people now " What do you like to do ?

Since working for a living is a primary activity of most people , asking about it is ezpressing interset in you and asking " what kind of stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that you have and ERE lifestyle is somewhat separate from that issue . I think its important not to get too too literal about answering the question . Just give an answer that is partially truthful and which tells them something important about you . <p> guess us young , financially independent types really need a new word . Since to be retired really kind of requires being retired from something . I do n't  think you <p> Rich said , <p> Well it depends on the person . True friends do n't  care what you do , they know who you are inside . Acquaintances and strangers mostly care because they want size you up .

@@42287414 @2287414/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> The following generic question is a very common when it comes to early retirement . It goes something like this ( you can adjust the numbers slightly ) : <p> " I am thirty-something years old and I have managed to save a few hundred thousands ( or more ) . Is it possible for me to retire already ? " <p> The answer is yes . Although extreme early retirement is still quite rare there are more people out there that retired in their late twenties and thirties ( I do not consider forties extremely early , that is " just " early ) than the few famous examples would suggest . Hence early retirement is a realistic proposition for those who desire it . <p> To retire early by becoming financially independent , you must solve the following problem <p> your annual expenses &lt; 3% of your invested savings <p> This equation is much more important than absolute numbers . <p> For instance , if you have $500,000 saved but this is due to having flipped a house for a $200,000 profit and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past ten years , the equation does not hold , because 3% of $500,000 is only $15,000 which is far from $120,000 . With these numbers , you are rich , but you are not wealthy ; primarily , because with an annual expense level of $120,000 chances are very good that you do not possess the knowledge and attitude to live well on $15,000 a year . <p> Now , you can solve that equation either by reducing your expenses or by working longer to save more money . The most common problem in solving this equation is to spending most of ones income like in the example above . This means that expenses are high relative to the income and that savings are low relative to their expenses , at least until you 're at least 50 years old . In general , most peoples expenses match to their income regardless of how much they make . To retire early , you have to avoid this . This means living on much less than you earn . <p> Living on much less is entirely possible . This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great many cost cutting measures . Cost cutting , especially when it is done to something close to your heart , like , say , your lawn , or your patio furniture will hurt . <p> Instead of downgrading , choose to live differently . Do not accept a second-rate lawn or a second-rate car . Dump the lawn and a car entirely , and live on cruising sail boat or in an RV . Or rent a single room , or get a bigger place but live with others , perhaps your family . Travel the world by visiting your international friends instead of resort hotel staffs , though Im sure they 're nice people too . Develop an inexpensive but sophisticated taste . Here , you must be creative and creativity stands in direct relation to your quality of life . Creative retires do lots of stuff . Some hang out on their sailboat in the Caribbean , some buy a house in Argentina , some compete semi-professionally in their favorite sport , some travel around , others tend to their garden , or read all the classics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must live a " normal life " characterized by driving , shopping , and paying bills , extremely early retirement , which can hardly be considered normal , can only be achieved by either winning the lottery or by downgrading your " standard-of-living " , shopping with coupons , buying cheap things you do n't  really like , putting an egg-timer next to your shower , and that is no way to live . <p> Extreme early retirement also means taking a different attitude to things . Some people , typically the busy ones , generally want everything to work and if it stops working they will pay for someone else to fix it for them . This is because they themselves either have no skills or lack the time to fix it themselves . Others take pride in being able to fix a broken pipe , a broken engine , put in a new floor , and so on , and consider it a hobby . In turn , they do not pay other people to work for them and so they do not have to work themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a lot of things on their own . It is also often the case that if they cant they know someone who can . They have a wide network of people from many different backgrounds unlike specialized workers who mostly know other specialized workers in the same field . <p> Obviously , it also depends on your attitude towards work . Perhaps writing reports and finding ways for your company to market a new product made overseas to consumers is a fulfilling and appealing way to spend your life . Perhaps it is not . Perhaps you find it motivating to spend your life striving for that corner office , or maybe the office with a window , or a 5% annual raise . Or maybe you have other ways to feel accomplished ? Maybe you use your work as a social outlet ? It is certainly a lot easier to find young people at their job between 9-5 ( and outside of those hours they are usually tired ) , but there is a significant number of people not working all week . Not as many , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally more interesting people than the workaholics who only know their work and the current top five shows on TV . <p> The main question you should ask yourself is thus not whether you have enough money , but rather whether you can envision yourself living an unconventional life outside the boxes that most others live in . If this is the case , the money to do so can be earned fairly quickly . The challenge is mostly in the mind , and so this is the real question you should be asking yourself . Can you be happy without doing what everybody else is doing ? <h> 69 users responded in " Can I retire young ? " <p> @jaybradfield Theres an 80/20 rule for this . For instance , someone who 's retired would likely consider himself so even though he does n't  have a chauffeur to drive him around instead of doing his own driving . On the other end of the spectrum we have a 100% self-sufficient farmer who must work a lot to live . You 're right in pointing out that DIY should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , I can save several hundred dollars an hour ( e.g. a $200 mechanics problem that takes 10 minutes to fix ) and so I DIY . In other cases , it makes more sense to work and buy . In general , the more skilled you are , the higher your hourly wage , but that goes for all things . In many cases , spending time on learning DIY has a much higher ROI than time spent on further education to increase your compensation , you 're much more likely to be close in terms of the law of diminishing returns wrt your specialization than in spending two minutes in learning how to save $5 by making your own window cleaner corresponding to $150/hour . <p> another equation , from Jacob at ERE . Here , Jacob has assumed a typical modern investment portfolio , which I do n't  believe to be <p> jacqueline branch said , <p> my comment is , its good to retire young it gives more time to spend with your kids and family near and far . it also gives that person time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career path , ro go back to school . <p> This post really got me excited . I never thought retiring early was even a choice , I 've been indoctrinated from an early age to work as hard as possible until I retire at age 65 what a disgusting way to live ! I 've now seen what 's possible , I 've really opened my eyes and I 'm using all of my free time to plan and earn my early retirement ! Thanks for sharing Jacob . <p> Stevo said , <p> Jacob <p> Well said , and thanks again for bringing up scenarios not found in main stream PF magizines and blogs . Many people can not fathom living outside of the boundaries established by society and advertising . There is a world outside of the Matrix . One can live in it and not lose out on a happy and fulfilling life . <p> Stevo <p> Las Vegas . <p> Socratic said , <p> I fight hard each day to control family expenditures . Having a wife ( who does not work ) and a teenager makes extreme retirement impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early retirement almost impossible . But I figured a way . Once the kid goes to college my wife and I can move to Thailand and retire at $1200 per month without the wife making too many sacrifices or divorcing me . <p> Big fan of Jacob and readers if this blog . <p> leeholsen said , <p> Socratic , there 's places you can live in the usa for $1200 a month . <p> for instance , at my current level of spending ; i could retire today ; but i like what i do well enough and i get benefits 2nd only to a teacher ; so i 'm just ramping up my savings . <p> but if i retired today , i would probably move to lake conroe texas that has some great golf course communities . there 's things to be live in there that i could probably keep my spending under 1200 ( 1500 currently ) and still have Houston as a resource ( med center , airports ) . i think if you look , you can find something near where you live . <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual salary raise I would have been more motivated by an annual hours cut . That would have been a real motivator ! But typically in that industry increased seniority just meant longer hours and more difficult work . They had it all wrong ! <p> Being an employee contrasts hugely to the situation where you have your own business or are self employed , where your increased productivity or skills would allow you to get the same amount of work done in less time for the same pay . <p> The premise of getting paid by the hour is deeply flawed and very demotivating . In fact , with such a stupid system the more effort you put in the less you get paid for each unit of effort . Its just not scalable . Hence I fired the idea of a " career " . After following ERE principles I am now financially independent and my " work " becomes more scalable and efficient every day . This applies particularly to having more time to do things myself , avoiding multiple stages of tax . <p> RapMasterD said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4% number . I 'm itching to fire my job . I 'm 52 . My eight year younger wife still works , and we have a young child . We 'd take down expenses a bit , but savings would be hard to come by . <p> My goal would be not to touch the nest egg until she dumps out of work in about 6-8 years . Then I 'm 60 . Then we 'd take down expenses moderately more . Then I think we could indeed swing the 3% thing . <p> The benefit of not touching that nest egg for . let 's say.nine years is that at 4% , the nest egg grows by 50% . Or so I think . <p> I 'm a borderline INTJ/ENTJ . I 'm getting more " I " as I gain more seasoning . <p> I really like the 3% rule and I think it is very practical . I currently make around $33,000/year but my expenses are $12,000/year . Assuming I had $750,000 saved I could easily withdraw 3% each year and live off of the $22,500 . I am not even counting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only question is how long is it going to take me to save $750,000 ? Well I am 29 years old now and the goal is before the age of 55 . I think this is reasonable but I would love to cut it down to 50 . Thanks for sharing Jacob ! <p> The common cause of failure in my life is the lack of direction . It is n't that I am not doing . I am not lazing around at home , and doing nothing . I am doing things . The problem is that I 'm doing too many different things , not sticking to one thing for a long enough time to see results , changing directions often , and then wondering why I am not a success . I keep on changing the game plan , as ERE says in this article here . <p> Retired at 47 said , <p> I want to offer some wisdom on Retiring Young . <p> What you want now , at 25 , 30 , 35 , will change over the course of your life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It happens to everyone . <p> What you need to plan for is that what you think of as Retirement now , may not be a good fit for you . In fact it may be the worst idea ever . <p> When I left it all behind I first moved in with traditionally retired relatives in Arizona . I did what they did , lived near them . <p> OH.MY.GOODNESS . <p> I can not think of a more dire or dreadfully boring existence . I lasted fewer than 3 months . <p> Turns up that what I thought of as Retirement was a MASSIVE MISTAKE for me and my values at 47 . I hate golf . Ugh . <p> I strongly , STRONGLY , suggest that whatever goal you have for retirement , that you take 3 months to 12 months off in your mid to late 30s to see if that is what you want . <p> Test it out . Give it a spin . See if that is the goal you *really* want to go for . <p> I can think of NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goal and then after 10 days realises that they do not want what they sacrificed decades of life to get . <p> Give yourself a practice retirement , first . <p> Whatever that is FOR YOU . Try it out . Do that for 3 months to a year . See if you REALLY want to do that . <p> I am living in Slovakia and here we have different possibilities as in USA or UK . I am also trying to save a lot of money to retire early . But under retirement I mean exit my fulltime job and continue working on my own projects ( info websites ) without boss and daily travel to work . This is retirement for me . I will be 30 and I hope that in 5 years I will achieve this goal . <p> Jezza said , <p> I love ERE . What a find ! <p> I 've just recently turned 34 and semi retired ( .. ! ! Finally ) Ive been constanrly at this for the past 10 years straight now and I 'm really glad to arrive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now but upon doing further math , nowmade very little difference apart from saving me a further year or two of hard work . <p> I began buying real estate in mid 2007 after four years on low wage saving a small deposit and things snowballed ever since . Bought a second apartment 1 year later and a house one year later , then another that same year . Sat on those knowing that given time the rents go up and most importantly the values in Australia climb steadily . I receive all my working years tax baxk for losing money while the capital grew by around 8% per year . When I did sell , the absolute max tax I paid was 23% because of the 50%CGT exemption made huge sense to me while workers paid as nuch as 47.5% tax on their income . <p> So using just $30,000 of my own money on that first deposit I gree a multi nillion dollar <p> nemu said , <p> here 's the path to retire on your own terms , in 7 steps : <p> 1 ) Pay off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means living in a crappy studio apartment and eating ramen everyday for a couple of years , do it . If you want to buy a car , get a reliable beater . Get insurance for $25/month from 4AutoInsuranceQuote . Forget about buying a house until your debts are paid off . <p> 2 ) Once you are out of debt , stay out of debt . The only exception to this rule is a vehicle and a house . If you want to get a nicer car , buy used and be able to pay it off in a year or 2 . <p> 3 ) If you are going to stay in the same spot for at least 10 years , buy a house , preferably with at least a little bit of usable land . An acre is good , 5 acres is better . Take the amount you are pre-approved for and cut it in half that 's how much you should spend on a house . Come to the table with at least 20% down and make a couple of extra mortgage payments every year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , forget about buying a house and rent instead . <p> 4 ) Develop multiple revenue streams . Do contract work . Start a business on the side . Invest in a business as a silent partner . Raise chickens , breed dogs or grow apples . Build websites . Buy and sell antiques . Acquire rental property . Sell something that generates residual income . Learn to play the currency markets or trade stocks . Do whatever you can to generate income from multiple sources . <p> 5 ) Grow these multiple revenue streams to the point that they generate enough consistent and reliable cash flow to replace your current income . <p> 6 ) Make as much as you can . Save as much as you can . Give away as much as you can . <p> 7 ) Retire ! - the sooner , the better . Be sure you understand that " retirement " does n't  necessarily mean you stop working , it just means having the freedom to do what you want to do , when you want to do it . <p> Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure your wealth by the value of your assets . Markets change . Valuations fluctuate . Instead , measure your wealth by the amount of cash flow your assets consistently generate . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287417 @2287417/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> With a name like early retirement ( extreme ) I get a lot of inquires about how many millions one needs to become financially independent . A brief search in the personal finance blogging world reveals several bloggers that are aiming for the millions . Not this guy . <p> The idea that you need to be a millionaire is predicated on having enough investments to draw a retirement income of $40,000-$80,000 . Studies based on long term market behavior show that one can draw down 4% of the principal and expect it to last 30-40 years if heavily invested in stocks . 3% would last a lot longer . Divide $40,000 with 0.04 are you get 1 million . $80,000 a year requires 2 million and there you have it . <p> However , I think time can be spent much better than working 15-25 years to accumulate millions of dollars . If you do like I do you can enjoy a $40,000 lifestyle for $11,000 instead . How is this possible ? The answer is VERY SIMPLE . <p> Instead of buying everything as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wait and instead cook other dishes that do n't  require red peppers . At some point the peppers will be on sale for $0.50 and then I cook dishes with red peppers with gusto = . That 's 71% off or the difference between $40,000 a year and $11,000 a year . <p> here 's another example . We recently got a fax/answering machine/telephone for $25 . It took three weeks to find it , but if we had gone down to office max or ordered it on amazon , one of similar quality would have cost more than $100 . So that 's 75% off for the same thing . Of course sometimes its less easy . We have been looking for a queen sized bed for under $200 for quite a while now . We got our present California king for $150 and sold the head board for $75 later for a net outlay of $75 . What did you pay for your bed ? <p> One may argue that it is not true financial independence to have to research ones purchases , engage in comparative shopping , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . One has to be careful with the money and this is not what true financial independence is about , right ? However , my counterpoint would be that if one has to spend 25 of the best years to save $2,000,000 just to avoid having to learn about quality/durability , bargain hunting , and how to be patient , then that is not exactly independence either . <p> I was flat broke , without a job , and $50,000 in debt at one point in my life . It took me fifteen years to turn it around and achieve financial independence . <p> Now , looking back , I realize that anyone in the US can achieve financial independence in as little as a few years , how long it will take depending ( mostly ) on the lifestyle you want to maintain . <p> Frugality is a part of the formula as it is one aspect of being " in touch " with your money . Wasting money is simply bad on many levels but most of us waste a large percentage of the money we earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that traps many of us in the rat race and forty years of being chained to jobs we would rather walk away from . <p> But besides wasting money on wants , most of us spend way too much on needs . Housing is the best example of this . You can buy a house in the traditional manner , a thirty year loan , and for the first ten years , almost 90% of what you pay on the mortgage is taxes and expenses . <p> The other mistake is to buy more house than you need ( more money wasted on a want ) . There are several very legitimate options that can turn the cost of housing into an asset . For example , I bought a duplex , lived in one side and rented the other . My net monthly cost of housing was less than three hundred dollars and when I sold the place three years later I made almost $90,000 . <p> Taxes and transportation are also places where many of us are asleep at the wheel . On average , based on fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 70% of the average household income . Reduce that to 20% and you could live on half of what you are spending now . <p> If you could do that , you could kiss the rat race goodbye and work three days a week doing what you enjoy . <p> You do n't  need a million to escape ; all you need is enough to maintain your lifestyle . The less that takes , the sooner more options will be open to you . <p> It is quite possible to live a middle-class life in the US for $12,000 a year IF your housing is earning you money , your transportation costs are minimal , and you reduce your tax load . <p> But you cant get there with the kind of thinking that got you where you are today . Einstein said it best , " A problem can not be resolved at the same level of thinking that created the problem . " You will need to think AND live outside the box to live differently than is the norm today . <p> I appreciate your contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , <p> Hi Jacob <p> are you saying that you live off 11k per year ? Do n't  you live in california ? do you rent or own your own house outright ?

The $11k is after tax money , but I imagine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite small . <p> Wifey handles everyday microfinancing ( I handle taxes and investments ) , so I only see what we earn and what we save , whence expenses must be the difference . I do know some numbers though . <p> This would be my share of our budget . Rent : 700 ( my half of the rent of the house ) by far the largest expense . I 've considered getting an RV ( because we move around a lot anyway ) and move to reduce this to $250-300 . The wife is resisting though . Food : 75 ( my half , this used to be much higher , like $200+ ) but I instituted draconic measures which made it a lot cheaper and a lot less expensive e.g. beans instead of steaks ) Utilities : 30-40 ( my half ) ( depending on season ) Dish : No idea 20-30 ? ( its the most basic plan ) Landline+cell+dsl : No clue , the net is flat rate and she mostly calls those on her pay-nothing-per-minute list . I never use the phone ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the car only goes grocery shopping a couple of times a week . We have the highest deductible geico would offer ( and we get the BRK shareholder discount : O ) ) . Wifey works at home . I cycle to my work . <p> When we first moved here we spent quite a bit more but now we 've scouted out all the inexpensive options where to get groceries , tv ( there 's ZERO broadcast reception where we live ) , net , etc . .. <p> When we lived in the midwest , my expenses were around $6-7000/year . That house ( rent ) was slightly smaller , and we did not have landline , dish or net . <p> Our health insurance is paid by my employer so I do n't  include that , but I 've verified that I can get a high deductible plan for around $80/month should I lose my group health insurance . <p> While I agree being frugal and looking for discounts is a smart way to live life , I like to think that I work to have money to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars in retirement , which is why I 'm investing in my ROTH IRA now , but I also want to enjoy the best years of my life because who knows how long I 'll be around . What if I , god forbid , die when I 'm 40 ? Sure someone will get all the money I saved , but I 'd rather live now and enjoy some of the finer things in life . I agree you should always spend like you 're earning less than you are , but being so stingy must be painful . If I want red peppers in my salad , I 'm going to buy them today and not wait for a sale . If they 're on sale , I might be more inclined to buy them but less likely to use them . That 's just how I am . <p> You know , you can make almost anything work if you really want to and make the decision to be happy . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ her every cent counts its like being like a straw in the wind . If you bend with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning meals , they are simply planned by sales and we adapt to that . To make it more specific , its like we have a baseload meal plan ( beans , rice , potatoes , .. + things that never go on sale ) and then we spice it up with whatever is on sale . <p> In terms of enjoying things , I personally find the expectation to be the greatest enjoyment . For instance , if you drink soda every day it does not taste nearly as well as if you drink it every other week or every other month . <p> For instance , my amazon wish list is 11 pages long ( I kid you not ) . I could easily afford everything on it , but if I just went ahead and ordered everything , I would not get nearly as much enjoyment out of it as when I space it out and reward myself from time to time . <p> I would not really have any regrets if I get hit by a bus tomorrow . I kinda have a " live every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " approach to life . 10157 @qwx420157 <p> I 'd like to reinforce Jacobs figures by providing my own . I live in a high-income ( and apparently high-net worth ) neighborhood of a high-cost East coast US major metropolitan area . I share a house with a roommate , so the cost splitting is probably similar to Jacobs situation ( except for healthcare ) . Monthly : <p> Note that I 'm far too lazy ( for now ) to follow Jacobs lead when it comes to food . I just do n't  like food preparation , or even shopping for food . And you can see that that laziness costs me , with twice the food costs of Jacob even though we probably live in areas where food costs are similar . <p> So my annual costs could range from $10,000 to $16,000 depending on how I want to live that year . Even splurging at $16,000 a year , its still far less expensive than most people imagine they can live , either married with no kids , or single sharing a house and related costs with another single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , and how much that adds to annual costs , in dollars per child . 10157 @qwx420157 <p> hereverycentcounts said " being so stingy must be painful " . <p> That 's a perfectly legitimate expectation . But I 've found it to be routinely untrue . Nothing feels more fundamentally American to me than to enjoy the pursuit of a life of liberty and happiness . Once you reach the Dominguez-Robin crossover point , you feel freedom , and you might think its a discrete event . You 're there . But its decidedly grey and continuous . It is possible to be freer , and you feel it when you either lower your outgo , increase your income , or some combination thereof . Some people talk about the velocity of money , but in these terms its more accurately described as the velocity of freedom . The faster you become freer , the more you appreciate the simplicity , the parsimony , the frugality , the fitness of the universe . The people , the places , the events , the ( very few ) things , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx420155 <p> Yeah , I like cooking as you might have guessed from the disproportional number of discussions of recipes and kitchen utensils on this blog . I 'm a fan of Iron Chef America and I used to read a lot of cook books . Give me a random assortment of ingredients and I can whip up something good without consulting recipes . Perhaps this is why sales shopping works for me . DW actually does most of the cooking and she 's more traditional . If I got free hands , I could probably cut it down to $50 . <p> Your hourly rate for researching alternative purchases is very high , so you 're well compensated . One does n't  get paid for patience that is in extremely short supply in our culture . But patience does seem to be a crucial ingredient to your plan . <p> Jacob , I agree I could probably live on $11k with the exception of medical costs they would run be an extra $150-$250/mo and growing as I get older . <p> However , most folks are planning for 2 people would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I would say my wife can not live at that level with me however I think our expenses could be at the $35k level with both of us factored in. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @2million We share the operational cost which is $22k for the two of us . I simply took that number and divided by two to get mine . This is a NorCal number and we have allowed ourself some operational luxuries . I guesstimate that rent could be cut by 200-400 and some of the utilities could go to ( by getting an apartment ) . The cable and one of the phone lines could definitely go ( if it was up to me , they would go as would the car ) . The DSL could go too ( and be replaced with dial-up ) . So going on the back burner we could probably take it $5k further down . With the midwestern plan B we could live on 2x$5k or 2x$7k with luxuries . Then there 's the more radical plan C which involves an RV . DW is not too keen on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a level where nobody is really frustrated with expenses although I think DW really would like to turn the thermostat up a bit whereas I really would like to cancel the cable . <p> Ha ! Great Website . You echo my thoughts exactly about money and how to conserve it . Very good stuff . There is something to our consumer society that makes it economically strong , but it might carry some fundamental social problems too -three letters NIU . <p> A few years ago I came up with 1 million to give me one hundred dollars a day . Your model seems to be more up to date . Where did I get the idea of $100/day ? I bought a motorcycle in England and rode it across Europe for six months on about $100 a day before coming back home to the States . When I got back I rode a bicycle across Northern Illinois on about $40/day ( that includes the eqwuipment and food ! ) More on that at GITride.com <p> The idea of conserving and saving instead of spending goes against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting seems to be , no *is* the right thing to do . I 'm RSSing this one <p> Thanks for the info . It seems like a pretty bare bones sort of living do you take vacations or have any sort of expenses for dining out or going to bars ? what about clothes or hairdressers or dentist etc ? Do you still work or do you live of investment income ? <p> thanks <p> Claire 10157 @qwx420157 <p> Thrift Canada , thanks for your per child cost estimate . Of course , if you werent working , your child day care expense would go down and your own joy with child would go up , eh ? If you stayed home , do you think you could lower your monthly additional cost per child to around $600 ? ( Or $300 / month split across two parents ? ) <p> I agree that its not terrible to go by what 's cheaper each week in the market for food choices . I just happen to be very picky and go with my specific hunger when picking what to eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wo n't really want to eat otherwise . I figure spending money on food is the most important investment of all , since you are what you eat . <p> I think its also possible to live in a rental basement while having 3 or 4 or more kids and actually be paid by government to raise your kids . After all , Canada needs new labor force and one earns the benefit to supply the future labor force . In this case the expense of raising kids is negative . <p> I personally choose to stay balanced . I own ( or my mortgage/bank owns ) a modest town house since I 'd like to have bigger space for kid as well as a backyard . <p> In a bare bone situation I calculated the only cost would be diaper and very limited clothes bought from thrift store . You can definitely have kids for less than $100 a month . ( that 's before s/he enters college. ) 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @claire The operational budget only lists the bare bones . We do n't  budget for anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered by savings ( just means that a little less goes into investments that month ) . I do n't  take vacations . I go to enough conferences to want to stay at home when I get time off . The kind of vacations I 'm interested in does n't  cost much money . I want to do an AT thru-hike or some long distance cycling . I 've also looked into traveling on a cargo ship e.g. doing something out of the ordinary for vacations . I positively hate resorts . I had to go to Hawaii for a conference once . This was one of those " never leave the hotel grounds because there 's nothing else within a 20 mile radius deals but you can work out in the fitness room , spa , souvenir shopping , swim with the dolphins , visit our 15 restaurants , see the hula dancers . Boring ! I only left my hotel room a couple of times to go to the beach . DW occasionally flies out to her family ( while I stay home with the dog ) . We eat out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't put the feet up , portion sizes too small , no spices , having to deal with other people to get my food and sit next to other families ( I love drive-in ) ) . DW would like to eat out more . I can count on my fingers the number of times I have been to a bar in my life . My idea of a good time is being at home with friends , drinking cheap swill and hideously expensive whisky ( Ardberg ) , and doing stupid human tricks or watching a movie . Not sitting in a smoke filled room shouting to get heard and paying $7 for drinks . Just never liked it . My clothes is 1/3 hand-me-down/overs ( shirts , sweaters ) , 1/3 thrift ( overcoats , pants ) and 1/3 new ( jackets , shoes , shirts , suits , socks , underwear ) . It is usually worn until it reaches terminal failure in obvious spots ( less obvious spots get patched ) . DW gives me a buzz cut every other month ( with my thinning hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder length hair for a while that just needed a cross cut with a pair of scissors ) . DW does go to a hairdresser and never seems to be happy with the results . My major ongoing entertainment expense is hockey . I pay $100 a year ( in advance ) for unlimited pickup ( rather than $7/play ) . Also I pay $100 in league fees three times a year . On top of that there 's replacement blades , new wheels , etc . This probably comes around to $500 a year total ( fees included ) . I still work . Just before I was planning on pulling the plug , I was offered a research gig here in CA . Once that is up ( its a limited term position ) or DW gets a job elsewhere , I 'll stop my W-2 work ( unless someone offers me a job at an investment company , a start-up , a non-profit org , or something equally exciting ) . <p> @ Thrifty Canadian I have frequently wondered where the official ( ? ) $250k/child estimate originates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids I would make it clear from an early point that if they wanted to go to college that they better study hard enough to get scholarships or otherwise pay their own fare e.g. probably living at home while attending the nearest community/state college/university . <p> Why should people set their sights so low to only have $40-80k income ? I am putting in 40 years and my goal is to walk away with $15,000,000 in net worth . That will be worth about $5 million in 2007 dollars . That should support indefinitely a initial income draw of about $165,000 ( again 2007 dollars ) before taxes and adjust upward with inflation from there . <p> @ Adfecto I cant speak for everyone here , but my goal is to stop working as soon as possible . You could n't pay me ANY amount of money to work for 40 years of my life . If I find myself working for more than 20 years , I will consider myself a failure . Some people enjoy getting up and going to work every day ; I do not . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and I for one hope to live them as leisurely ( and simply ) as possible . <p> This is a question of life choices , though . If your goal is to have a high disposable income after 40 years , then your plan sounds reasonable . <p> LC said , <p> adfecto I think that 's the point . You can easily work for 40 years and have tons of money when you retire , but why do that when you can retire earlier on less and enjoy freedom while you 're younger ? I personally ca n't think of what I would spend $165,000 per year on . My mortgage will be paid off and we have a middle class lifestyle with a nice vacation every year for $24k/year ( $16k if we had no mortgage ) . <p> Diane said , <p> People think being thrifty is some kind of sacrifice , deprivation or no fun . Nothing could be further from the truth . To me , its like living a life full of magic . When there 's something you 've been wanting and suddenly it appears in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its like you 've won some kind of cosmic lottery . <p> I first experienced this when I hiked the Pacific Crest Trail . I would have all kinds of magic happen to me . For example , one day just when I was wishing I had a better hat , a hat appeared on the trail hanging on a stick in my favorite color ! At one point I accidentally sat on my sunglasses . I wore the broken glasses for only one day when I noticed a pair of sunglasses hanging from a branch in a tree . When I needed to go home suddenly , I needed a carry-on bag for the train . While walking down the street in a small town I stumbled on a bag full of giant purses . Free carry-on bag . And so it went . <p> If trail magic is real , why couldnt there be the same magic all the time ? Turns out there is . You just have to tap into it . Its so much more fun to live this way . It happens to be cheaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If red peppers is n't your item , find something that is . <p> I can find some thing in common with some of what you say . I enjoy researching my purchases , I managed to save as much as 40% . I am not willing to go to extremes ( no pun intended ) ! I will do more research as the price increases . I enjoy it , but I do n't  let it take over my life . <p> deegee said , <p> For me in the USA it is health insurance which is not the #1 part of my ER budget and it is rising quickly , having risen 50% in just the last 2 years . Even using ehealthinsurance.com , I am still paying nearly $700 a month for just me . I cant find any high-deductible plans for the very low premiums some of you have stated here . I envy those of you who live outside the USA who have a single-payer system , making HI much more affordable . <p> That being said , I did not need $2M to ER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my investments have since risen to over $1M . My annual expenses are still only $22k , so my SWR is just over 2% . <p> Luke said , <p> We 've found that the big European discounters Aldi and Lidl ( do n't  know if you have Lidl in the US ? ) are great for short-lived offers on food staples . <p> Were not vegetarians ( although were trying to eat less meat ) , but have found them to be great for discounted bacon etc. that starts off with a 30% discount and then has another 30% taken off after 3-5 days as they need to move on to the next offer . <p> The freezer is our friend when its possible to fill our boots with good quality cuts ( normally German and boy do those germans like their meat ! ) for a fraction of the price of the same quality from the regular supermarket ! 10150 @qwx420150 <p> The bed example was n't perhaps the best example , because it makes it seem like barain hunting is a full-time job . How often do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I was in college I got by just fine on roughly 10-12K a year living expenses excluding school of course . I enjoyed life , and realized that social experiences are worth far more than any object I could buy . Once the money starts coming in we seem forget that we ever lived on less . <p> brian said , <p> @Diane thanks for the note . I think you are absolutely right about the magic that accompanies frugality . I am constantly amazed at how things come my way for free or at a radical discount if I just wait long enough . Last week it was pair of shorts and the week before a cook book . <p> SVwashout said , <p> People are surprised that silicon valley can actually be pretty affordable for living expenses . It has the reputation for high costs and high wages , which is true for most folks who work as professionals in large tech companies . But I 've found that I 'm able to live on roughly what Jacob spends , although of course no one would consider that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation to spend well below capacity is not reaching for early retirement its really about not having to worry about getting laid off and possibly being out of work for a very long time . My financial cushion has allowed me to take on more risky assignments , and also to slack off in front of management when it suits me . Early in my career I found that I liked some parts of my job far more than others , but it was a package deal or so I thought . Now I just trim off the pieces I like and leave it to my co-workers to pick up the rest ( for me its the powerpoints and meetings I avoid ) . Fortunately I 'm pretty good at doing the stuff I enjoy so its been win-win . And if a new manager hires in and wants to change the rules on me , I can look him in the eye and give him the " go ahead make my day " . So for me working inside a large organization became fun after I got to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that I 'm never getting another raise or promotion ( although I 'm still in the bonus pool ) , but that 's a price well worth my freedom in my opinion . This also wont help those who aspire to supervisory positions , as my attitude is obviously unsuited for management . Fortunately I saw early enough that would not be what I wanted to do , so I avoided getting trapped on that road . <p> Anyway my point is that even if you love your job , its still worthwhile to make some sacrifices early on to get into the position of not having to worry about stuff that keeps many people awake at night . <p> Oh and a tip for Jacob fresh produce is very expensive at the national grocery chains here ( and not just WF ) but you can get amazing discounts at ethnic grocery stores . Sometimes quality is iffy , though , so you have to look carefully before you buy , but the savings can be pretty substantial .

Unless you 're making less than that in interest , not only should your principal last forever , but it should actually GROW . Am I missing something here ? <p> BeyondtheWrap said , <p> @joer1212 : Youre assuming that your portfolio will grow by the same amount every year . But that not what happens in reality . There will be periods where the markets will not return as much , or where your net worth will decrease due to crashes , recessions , etc . However , if you keep your spending level at 3-4% of the original principal plus inflation , it should last the appropriate amount of time , according to historical data , regardless of what happens in the markets ( unless , say , something much worse than the Great Depression happens ) . <p> Squash was .74 cents a pound and yellow bell pepper was .64 cents each yesterday at my local store . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night but why .

It is worth it . It seems that you pick up in hotel/motel rooms on your luggage . Before you know it , you got bed bugs . I am referring to the mattress . The mattresses sometimes got bed bugs .

I live in So.Cal . Does anyone have any tips for me ? Please ! <p> Marcia said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are starting " too late . " At age 50 , we had almost nothing . At age 61 , we have two homes fully paid for , one in Massachusetts and the other in Hawaii .

No heat needed in the winter , almost no clothes needed , car will last forever since there 's nowhere to drive to , and entertainment ( the beach ) is two minutes away and 100% free all year . <p> How is that for inspirational ? <p> greenie said , <p> I guess I try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not getting to retire young ; way past that . I have gotten to do work I 've wanted to do such as run an organic farm that I used to own , freelance write , etc. and I considered having the chance to do this sort of financial independence . <p> I 'm back working a f/t job , faced with the need to save for some sort of retirement . I 'd rather not live an impoverished old age down the road . At the same time , having seen two friends die at a younger age than I am now , and my dad not live to retire , I feel the need to balance saving and planning for the future with enjoying life to the fullest . <p> I want to trek around Europe , and I need to do that while I 'm physically fit . I am planning a short bike trip , so ditto for that . I enjoy eating good food and feel that it keeps me healthy . And music and gardening are both passions that I put some money into . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know how much Ill end up saving ; some of that depends on my employment situation . I know I could put every spare penny into savings , but for me that 's not the way I want to live . I know I wont need $80,000/year to retire on ; never have earned even close to that . I could live quite well on $20,00 at this time . I 'm saving about 40% of what I earn pre-tax at this point , although my salary is n't high given the non-profit work I do . If I got a housemate I could bring in extra money , but am really enjoying having my own space right now , but it is an option . Ultimately I think we all value different things and we need to realize what is important to us and plan accordingly . <p> Its worth finding ways to be frugal now so you can make things work in the long run .

@@42287420 @2287420/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Note : In this post I discussed some of the aspects about my former career while I was still working . One of my problems was " lack of adequate replacement " . Like some people have pointed out , most people need something to do . However , I would point out that this does not need to be a job . It could be taking care of a bonsai tree ; or it could be working as a gardener . In terms of the suggestions below , they are remarkably constant . The only thing that 's changed in the two years that have passed is that I no longer foresee starting a bookstore . <p> What does early retirement mean for those who chose to save so intensely and early for retirement and essentially had enough money to stop working around age 30 ? This is a question I have been asking myself and for which there does not seem to be any conventional solutions . <p> In most cases , at least as far as I understand from reading Smartmoney magazine , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the kids , or seeing the world . None of this seems particularly appealing to me ( I do n't  have kids ) right now . In 15 years , maybe , but not now . <p> Conventionally , I should be doing what most phds with a few years of experience do , that is , try to work myself to death in the desperate attempt to get tenure . Except for the death part , that is actually what I still do even though I in principle could quit . However , having seen first hand where this road can lead I must admit that I am no longer so sold on the idea as I was 5 years ago . here 's my cost benefit analysis : costs : 95% of the students , grant writing , committees , relatively poor pay , forced mobility , department politics , and did I mention , 95% of the students benefits : making my own schedule , 5% of the students , and doing research . I think having the freedom to take half the day off on Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes with a constant pressure to perform . It feels equally nice to work 9-5 and know that you are not supposed to work outside of those hours . Call me naive , but I have finally realized that 95% of the students at higher ed do not really seem to want to be there . Some professors live for the enthusiasm for the remaining 5% , but I do n't  think the 1 in 20 ratio is high enough for me . Research is interesting and frustrating . Interesting because everything you do is a " first " e.g. you have discovered something that no humans have known before . Frustrating because there is a ton of dead ends that must be explored . It is really 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration . Just imagine trying to come up with something creative when you know that in all likelihood it will fail . Then repeat and do it again . In addition , most researchers , myself included , are working on things that are only interesting 5 other people in the world . There 's a slight shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good 20 papers . Forsooth , you can find them in university libraries around them world , even ! However , 30 years from now , I will just be a set of initials in some dusty journal that will only be read by some poor suffering grad student . I am after all not working on curing cancer , so while somewhat meaningful , my work is perhaps not terribly important except for those 5 persons in the world . Its not a terribly bad life though . One gets to influence events in the sense of deciding where thousands and even millions of tax payer/alumni money gets spent . There 's all the free traveling to conferences etc . I have been to 14 countries so far and never paid a dime . Its not exactly a luxury vacation , but the similarities are probably larger than the differences . However , I wonder whether I am going to spend the rest of my life doing this . If I do , I 'm projected to pass $1,000,000 when I 'm 40 , but what am I going to spend that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra dollars is knocking on my door already . There is also significant opportunity cost . Maybe I will be wondering what if I had done something differently . The question is , what is the alternative . I think it is exceedingly important to live a life of no regrets . Okay , so I could in principle retire , but I have n't . Why not ? One problem is that I have not found anything sufficiently meaningful to replace a full fledged career with . In contrast to a job a career should be a means of self-actualization and I tell you if you actually have a career goal in mind , this works out quite well . If you do n't  , then it turns into a job fairly quickly , whoops ! <p> Financially independent is a better description of my situation . Maybe people are n't  meant to retire this early . Its almost like breaking the law of the rat-race e.g. " you still have so many years left in you " . <p> Perhaps Beingfrugal.nets sons mom said it best when it what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . Yeah , I might want to change my tires . <p> here 's my list of possible re-tirings . <p> Start a PF blog ( I have previously thought of becoming a tech writer and this seems to fit the bill ) . <p> Start a bookstore . <p> Buy a small farm , breed an army of sheep and take over the world . <p> Sell my soul to Wall Street . <p> Become a watch maker . <p> I have started on 1 . The question is whether I can make a career out of it in the traditional sense of a career e.g. something that takes up much of the day and keeps me active while being somewhat meaningful and self-actualizing . <p> As you might have surmised I am not really sure about this . It turns out that it is a lot harder to figure out what to do with financial independence than to achieve it in the first place . It is definitely something I should have thought of earlier in the process . <h> 44 users responded in " What early retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Youve asked the $64,000 question , but with inflation , its a bigger question than that . I am a generation older when people are retiring after 30 years careers . However , at 55 I do n't  feel old enough to do this , so I am forcing myself into a new green career . What are you passionate about ? What would you like to see in the world or in your neighborhood that is n't there yet ? Scary questions . Easier to complain about the rat race . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> " What would you like to see in the world or in your neighborhood that is n't there yet ? " I think that has been the main motivation for my current career , but I am no longer so sure that the world needs yet more scientific publications . But this is a really good question for which I should find an answer . <p> DNA said , <p> I did n't  see the cryptically-hinted at finance degree and/or series exam on the list . Personally , I did the latter ( series 65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job a few years back and it led to interesting and remunerative work with venture cap firms . <p> If I could retire ( meaning shift my attention from acumulating money to something else ) , I would like to persue having a survival retreat established . Hidden underground retreat complete with provisions and the resources to grow/capture my own food if it should become necessary . A place that no-one new about and that even my friends and extended family did not even know existed . <p> I am always worried the value of my $ dropping quickly because of the devaluating fiat dollar . I would enjoy setting up the perfect low-cost self-sufficiency homestead retreat . I can imagine from reading a few of your posts that perhaps you would find enjoyment in establishing something of that sort . <p> I have heard it said that many twenty- and thirty-somethings are suffering from mid-life crisis as the ratrace becomes more intense . It seems that you have found it because of your fiscal situation . What to do with all your timeyoure probably like mewhen I took that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what career I would be happiest in , the counselor told me , " Oh , youd basically be happy doing anything . " <p> Thanks a lot , counselor . <p> What about writing a book ? Youve done something most people have n't done/wouldnt be willing to do ; it might make good subject matter . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> I have a multi-layer approach . I have learned that I need to do things in five areas to be happy , so when I retire ( seven more years ) , I will focus on those : <p> 1 . Intellectual I need things to think about . Reading , watching movies , taking ( and teaching ) classes , and talking to friends as well as figuring stuff out all exercises my brain . If retired , I could do more of this . <p> 2 . Physical I need movement . I like to do things that improve strength/speed , aerobic capacity , balance/grace , and flexibility . Currently I like ultimate frisbee , ballroom dancing , a tai chi/yoga/pilates class offered by my gym , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , and a boyfriend . If I were retired , I would have fewer dealings with co-workers , but might be able to see my favorite friends more often . <p> 4 . Creative I cant just consume ; I have to create to be happy . That includes writing , making cards , baking , throwing parties , putting together scrapbooks of my travels , trying new recipes , knitting , thinking of presents for people , that kind of thing . <p> 5 . Spiritual for me this means contributing to the welfare of others . I have donated blood , taught first aid , donate money to worthy causes , reduced my energy usage , subsidized family members for once-in-a-lifetime opportunities , that kind of thing . <p> I think my creative and spiritual needs may compare to your need for self-actualization . <p> I feel like when I retire , I will just do more of the same kinds of things I do outside of work now and be very happy . <p> However , I also know a lot of people think they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they actually retire , it turns out its not enough . Or all their activities are relaxing , but they do n't  need so much relaxing anymore once they have retired . I may turn out to be one of those people ( although I find it very difficult to imagine ) . <p> If so , any post-retirement career I have will probably involve helping local public school teachers in various ways such as running a school club or creating simulation games for units the kids usually hate . It would be fun ( for me ) and useful , but it would also be okay if I cant find some way to get paid for it . <p> I can relate , except I just finished my first undergrad degree in Accounting . Since I paid my way through school , there is the regret in all that money I dumped fornothing . I really do believe that college was really not meant for me.but I suppose I had to go through it to figure that out . Although I was one of the 5% looking for inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dependent . That is my goal . On anything or anyone . So growing my own food fits largely into my plans . I also do n't  want to spend a lot of money on land and property because all I am buying is land and property and all these $250,000+ places is a bit much for what is essentially brick and cement organized nicely . <p> There are alot of very general ideas I have . I like cooking , but I do n't  want the stress associated with running a food establishment . I like riding my bikebut I like to go at my own pace to places I want to go to . I want to own a private library . <p> I have a 2 year plan in place where I plan on saving a bit of money and then evaluating my options and my state of mind . Well see how that works out . <p> After I achieved financial independence ( FI ) , I kept working for another five years to be eligible for an early retirement package that included health care and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rat race , I took a six month breather . Then I started looking for an investment property ; I had sold my last one a couple of years before and did n't  want another during the interim so I could concentrate on the stretch run . <p> I found the property and closed in December 07 . Now I am doing a leisurely rehab . I find the work very interesting and engaging . It is basically project management with as much hands on , physical labor as I feel like . <p> Also , I feel the work falls into what is known in the Zen tradition as " right livelihood . " And to contributes to the community in that I take ugly or neglected houses and make them attractive . I also add value to the rental stock and provide affordable housing . <p> Not to mention , I have always made good money at it . <p> I also blog , write , do seminars and I am a publisher ; but all at my own pace . If you visited my blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at Amazom.com . <p> But your point is right on , the key to enjoying the freedom of FI is to have work that keeps you engaged and eager to get out of bed every day . But it is also nice to have the option of just pulling the covers over your head and listen to the rain on those mornings when you feel like it . <p> I hope you find your calling ! But based on my experience , it might not be just one thing ; it is more likely to be one main thing and several more that you turn to for diversion . <p> John said , <p> Congratulations on Financial Independence ! <p> It sounds like you 've come to the same question that I came to during some time off in Japan a few years back . The problem you are probably facing is that all your life you 've probably chased after goals . A phd , Financial Independence , etc . <p> The problem is , what happens when you 've reached your goals ? What happens when there are no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to automatically look for another goal to chase . I can tell you from experience that you 'll end up with the same feeling at the end of that goal as you do now . <p> The only answer Ive found is to stop focusing on goals and start living every day just for the experience of being alive today . There is a great book by Thich Nhat Hanh called Peace is Every Step which is about enjoying every single day of your life . <p> It might help you focus more on who you are and what you enjoy and less on setting goals to be accomplished . <p> Good luck with the big questions ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Goal chasing .. or maybe just accumulating accomplishments . Maybe that 's really the same thing . I put the book on my list . <p> LivinLaVidaIraq said , <p> I want to pour myself into educating my Daughter .

See ya ! <p> GammaPoint said , <p> Hmm , I 've thought about this before . I am aggressively trying to become financially independent ( even before I get my first " real " job that is n't graduate student work ) so that I can have the ability to retire if need be . But at the same time , I 'm not entirely sure what I would do with the time . Half the day can easily be spent working out , but I am most concerned with what I would do intellectually . Sure , its nice and fun to read books and learn new things , and maybe that would be enough , but maybe its more enjoyable to learn things and then be able to apply them in ways that other people can appreciate . This probably is easiest to do when you actually have a job . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ton of languages and then travel all over the world . Of course , that would be really expensive so scratch that one . Perhaps I 'd try to learn more about computer programming and contribute to an open-source software project ( Ubuntu or something like that ) . I do n't  know really , and am curious what you end up doing . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @GammaPoint What I 've done is to write this blog and a book . This has actually been more intellectually satisfying to me than my former career because it allows me to cover a lot of different areas at the same time . I never found that to be possible in academia . Will I do this forever ? Probably not . <p> In terms of physics one of the things I have thought about doing is to revive " garage physics " . Making simple experiments using kitchen utensils e.g. how do you build a transistor using " primitive " ingredients , how would you build a battery , a kind of low-tech high-concept laboratory . It seems to me that modern physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to build a Geiger counter and demonstrate the theory ? Most buy the counter from a supplier and go from there . <p> GammaPoint said , <p> I can see the book and blog being intellectually stimulating , at least for a while . If you 've got the time to put into a blog it can be really rewarding . If , on the other hand , you 're so busy that you quickly hack together a post ( as my blog was many years back ) it sort of stops being fun . I do think the book is a neat thing though , and I 'd like to write one myself one day . <p> In fact , one of the nice things about being financially independent is it gives you the luxury to be an author ( which is in general a very , very competitive thing to be in , especially if you are n't  a " big name " at least from what I hear ) . If you do n't  *need* the money than you can do it for pleasure and slowly build up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun too and would be very intellectually stimulating . <p> About the physics , that would be cool . Although I think in defense of modern physics , skills have gotten so specialized because that 's what is necessary to make rapid progress . From a funding and societal progress perspective , there may be little value in having a bunch of well-rounded physicists when they can simply lean on each others specialties and focus on developing those . I 'm a computational theorist , and while I understand the theory behind some of the more complex codes that I run , it would take me a number of years to actually write that sort of thing myself . I guess this is similar to a experimentalist just buying a Geiger counter off the shelf . <p> GammaPoint said , <p> Just to clarify on my above comment about specialization . I do think specialization is the fastest route to progress , but being well-rounded is something that I aspire to be on an individual , what-makes-me-happy level , so I understand your motivations. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @GammaPoint I know a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes open source code for stellar dynamics . <p> twloughlin said , <p> Interesting . Perhaps I am one of the fortunate few on the planet , but I do n't  feel as if I have anything from which to retire . I am a college professor who teaches acting and directs plays in a theatre department , and while I work hard , the work is really disguised play . Getting tenure was a breeze for me , because my situation was just right , as were the politics . Never stressed about that . I work a little more than half the year ( two 14-week semesters ) and have the rest of the year to myself for whatever I choose to do . I am in control of what I want to do , and my students , all young people pursuing careers in the theatre or entertainment , are all very bright and energetic and engaging . Audiences who come to see my shows have a good time . Generally I do not deal with " mainstream " students outside my department . The picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced as an artist in the academic world . I will retire at some point , but I wont be retiring because I need to escape the rat race . I 'm nowhere near the rat race . I 'll retire because I 'll finally need the sgleep . <p> I think , right now , I 'm about where you were 4 years ago . I just wrote a post about it . <p> I 've looked at FI as an end goal for so long , then one day , suddenly , I have to look at it as the beginning of something else . I like what John had to say above about getting out of the goal-oriented mindset . Perhaps I should consider setting that as my new goal . Oh wait = 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @twloughlin You are lucky indeed . Some of it is field dependent . Many of the sciences are now ruled by soft money requiring professors to spend a lot of time writing grant proposals instead of doing research ( or alternatively give up most research and go to a teaching college ) . As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **32;57;TOOLONG Tenure seems to be going away and getting replaced with adjuncts for many fields . In the 1970s tenure was easy but there 's been an increasing glut of PhDs putting people in a holding pattern ( called postdoc ) for longer and longer periods . Someone with a PhD in science can easily spend 10 years before getting tenure now if he s lucky enough to get it . <p> I have n't quite thought about whether I have reached the point of FI . I do love my teaching jobalbeit at a fairly low-level institution . How else could I yap all day about poetry and the likeand have people listen to me ( or pretend to ) . I have lots of autonomy . I cant imagine not being a teacher . <p> I guess 32 is a very young age to think about retiring , however it 's an inspiring thought that anyone would be able to retire at this very young age . Maybe this would happen only if a person was too impatient with his work or maybe have won in a lottery draw and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great web siteThey say like minds think alikeI say like minds think similar Weve the ability to make a difference ..

I too worked in Academia and have to say that I am actually still very passionate about teaching . I think that the great students make up for the slackers , but I have a 4/4 teaching load , and I think that my passion is becoming so stressful and sometimes monotonous that it is time for a change . <p> I have no regrets about the last 20 years . I also got to travel extensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation and any comments are welcome . <p> Two weeks ago I applied to convert a life-time guaranteed position at a private university into a half-time position , and as I pretty much expected I was told NO WAY . <p> I do have kids ( 12 and 14 ) , who still need me , and I feel that there is just no balance in my life . I hardly see them and spend more time with other peoples kids than my own . <p> I love to cook , but feel stressed because I still have to grade finals , write letters of recommendation , answer Emails at 10 pm . <p> Recently things changed in our family and I can financially afford to quit and to have a good life , even with perks like travel , my big passion . <p> I realize that nobody is going to take my knowledge or my degrees away from me . However , I have to come to terms with the fact that I will not be a Professor at University X in the future . I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have warned me that I will regret this decision . That makes me feel a bit uneasy . <p> I am sure there will be days when I will miss the crazy and lively campus environment , but why can I not be a student on campus , take a class in another field , write , teach informal classes , tutor , do something for others , teach ESL to immigrants ( I am a linguistics and language prof ) <p> My list of things I want to do is seemingly endless . <p> I am not sure what I am asking here , but did anyone experience guilt over early retirement , giving up a career others would kill for , and how did you make the transition ? I am also giving up quite a bit of income , but I will be fine without it . So why the guilt ? <p> This is my first time ever to contribute to a blog . Forgive me if this is not the best writing .

Strangely enough that has renewed my interest in my current field . <p> I always thought I wanted Early Retirement so I would n't have to work . This stemmed mostly from the b.s. eventually starting in every place Ive been at ( which I always start out LOVING ) . But I was never aiming toward something , just running away from something . This of course has been what I 've always read as the worst reason for retiring . <p> Now I 'm sure I just want Financial Independence , because I want an occupation , not a job . If that makes sense . <p> Petra said , <p> Hi Evelyn , <p> Not sure when you wrote that piece . Still , I wanted to comment . <p> Do n't  feel guilty for giving up that career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( you ) to get the career they want : you are making room for someone else to do that job , someone who is hopefully very enthusiastic about getting to do that job . <p> Meanwhile , you will be capable of creating a life for yourself the way you want it .

You only wont get paid ( much ? ) for it anymore , but that 's OK , because money does n't  have to be a motivator for you anymore . <p> I am still working , and still need to , too . But I have seen with a lot of people that the transition is scary , and it probably will take you some time to adapt . But I have also seen all people adapt to their new life , and like it a lot .

With the farm the " objective " is to preserve the old buildings and make use of the natures bounty ( root crops , summer vegetables , mushrooms , fire wood , berries etc ) . It is extremely satisfying to grow ones own food and learn while doing it . <p> Other than the above , we spend a good amount of time reading , exercising , meeting family and friends .

@@42287421 @2287421/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I have visited 14 different countries out of the 30 or so developed countries in the world . From my superficial touristic view , I have noted that in all these countries , people earn money at day jobs , spend it on stuff , and generally lead predictable lives . The difference between countries is so much smaller than the difference between individuals . From this I have concluded that travel is not worth it , at least when it comes to going to other developed countries . <p> I have lived in three different countries , all some of the richest countries in the world . This has allowed me to gain a certain outside perspective on specific cultures , at least the wealthy ones , and traditions that can not be gained from tourism . Cultures ARE slightly different . Some are reserved . Some are civilized . Some are moral . Some are friendly . Some are lazy . Some are hamfisted . Some are hardworking . Just like people . <p> However , on the whole , national cultures are far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you will find you have more in common with other carpenters regardless of their nationality than you do with their neighbor . There , I just saved you a lot of travel time = however , perhaps this has to be experienced to be fully realized . I still run into people who should be smart enough to realize that their nation is not the best because its people are somehow chosen . <p> If you want to learn something about people , I suggest you talk to your neighbor rather than someone from another country . <p> Perhaps my perspective is clouded by being concentrated in developed countries . However , this is where most tourism go anywhere , so why are people going ? <p> I know people that buy the tour guides and plan out which landmarks to see . I note that most locals never go to those landmarks . This suggests to me that the landmarks are irrelevant to the culture despite being promoted as being the essential part of the culture . Why do people go to see the views if they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes its about the shopping , but seriously . Global trade means that you can now buy the same limited number of goods all over the world . Why go to Paris , when you can buy the same things down at the corner store . Similarly , sometimes , its about the food . But really , I do n't  need to go to Greece to eat at a Greek restaurant . Yes , maybe its not the same , but its pretty damn close . <p> Sometimes people travel to get away from it all ? My question then is , what are you running away from ? And why are you running ? I have never felt a need to get away from my normal life that could be cured by a one week getaway . <p> It used to be that travel meant something . Like an expedition you would work to go somewhere . Nowadays , you just hop into an airplane and 12 hours you are in another country on the other side of the world that is almost identical to your own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to consuming food or things . Is modern tourism just yet another consumer experience ? <p> Have you ever considered traveling slowly ? Moving from city to city until you get to the destination ? I think sailing is an interesting way to travel slowly . I submit that you do not really know a place unless you have worked a job there , opened a bank account , and lived as a native rather than just briefly passed through while taking pictures . Living abroad makes for more personal growth than flying around in a tincan as a tourist . If you have some useful skills , you can even travel for free and get paid for it .

Went back recently and there was throngs of local people both at the Taj and the Qutb Minar ( local site in Delhi ) . I know from having read your blog quite a bit that you do not get travel . That 's ok , I do n't  get sports ; or stock analysis = ) <p> Why I travel said , <p> I did n't  read all the comments but from the looks of it Jacob and quite a few of the commentators have never " really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling and vacationing . <p> I agree that people who " vacation " ( or do business trips ) usually would n't experience as many benefits as people who " travel " . <p> Some of the reasons I travel ( this time in South America but I have been all over the world in developed and developing countries ) : <p> 1 ) Not my number 1 reason but for the sake of this blog I 'll start off with frugality : I can live a more comfortable life on 1/3 the expenses then in my own country . Excellent for the 2-3 months in between jobs . <p> 2 ) Health : I can eat fresh organic fruit and vegetables at a fraction of the cost as the foods we get at home that are sprayed with chems then spend a month or two between being picked and the time they are eaten . I 'm not big into cooking but love to eat so I can go to a restaurant and buy a big healthy meal for 3-4$ Its actually impossible too find anything like that in my native country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , same thing , 1/3 the cost and alot of the time the facilities are better then in my native country . <p> 3 ) Education : I study spanish everyday in SA . Its great for the mind and who knows one day it might help me job or career wise . Its also alot of fun to interact with the locals . Also Jacob you could taste and learn some mean low cost healthy dishes in Asia . I got into wine in Italy which is now turning into a passion for me . <p> 4 ) My heart ( my number 1 reason ) : I have met so many amazing people all over the world ie friends for life . The perspective Ive gained is immeasurable and I wish I could share it with everyone . From staying in a small Nepalese village in the Himalayas for a month to going up the Mekong in Laos to stay a small village there to going to Bosnia and seeing what happened there . There 's just way too much to list here but you get the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at home in NA . <p> Anyways I 'm running outta time here have a flight to Colombia to catch ! ! ! <p> @Edward Yes , yes . I too have watched rooftops and town squares from hotel balconies , listened to various water ways at practically all hours of the day , encountered various wildlife ( deer , dolphins ) that few people get close to , and been on the top of snow-covered mountains . I was not that impressed . Perhaps I 'm not alive or perhaps its just a difference in temperament . I 've felt and feel much more alive making a scientific discovery that nobody else knows about yet after months or years of effort ; finding a new intellectual perspective on something I took for granted ; sailing a small boat on the ocean facing waves taller than a house ; riding a bike for more than 6 hours ; sparring with wooden swords ; shooting trap or plinking beer cans ; assembling a watch with wheels small enough to fit under a fingernail ; eating a meal made 100% of ingredients I grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 10 miles away from where I live . I suppose this is why I do n't  value travel much . Its very rare that I 've needed to go very far in order to have those experiences . <p> Radeonic said , <p> Unfortunately I have to disagree with your article . I 'm born from Hong Kong and now living in Vancouver . I try to go to Japan as my destination spot once every two years with my hard earned money and I could n't disagree with you more . <p> You might as well write another article saying we humans are all the same , we consume " sustenance " , breath " air " and then wait till we die of old age ( or cancer ) . Life is different in the nuances and the subtleties . <p> If you 're going to say life in Hong Kong is similar to Vancouver then there is n't as big of a contrast there is . The culture and lifestyle is one of THE big reason why my family move to Vancouver in the first place . <p> As for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I love the food , there are tons of food that 's local only and if you 're eating MCD when you 're traveling , then you 're doing it wrong . <p> Not to mention I love the transportation in Japan , efficient , punctual and clean , unlike the clusterf*ck in North America . <p> I think its fine that you do not enjoy travelling , but for me , going to a vacation in Japan is the ultimate indulgence I can have . <p> Radeonic said , <p> Also , I do n't  know what landmarks you 're talking about , but all the landmarks I 've been in Japan are filled mostly with locals than anyone else . <p> And as for food , you can still only get home grown Kobe beef in Japan , 99% of " Kobe " beef outside are grown in Australia . And let me tell you it is also a one in a life time bucket list thing that people have to try , it is simply to die for when I had it in Kobe . <p> Also , no good Okonomikyaki in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuna , our convenience totally sucks compare to the ones in Asia , no decent authentic Karaoke places , no bullet trains , again another one for the bucket list . Also You can not get an outdoor hot spring ( where you have to be naked and not the North America BS you have to wear swim suits ) before breakfast served in your room and then a 10 course dinner at night also followed by more hot springs . <p> Then there 's Kyoto where you have literally hundreds of temples and Shrines that are at least a hundred years old within walking distance from the train station , tell me which place in North America has that ? <p> Bob said , <p> Travel is fun , but I 'm not too sure about the " developing yourself " aspect . In my view , an hour spent productively on the internet , exercising or hanging around with intelligent people will do more to develop yourself than a whole week of looking at poor people , eating street food ( aka. tourist food ) , and meeting " locals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can speak english and other travellers . <p> Sure , if you 're a total history/sociology buff you might get something out of it , but in 99% of cases all you get is a few weeks ( or months ) of having fun . Nothing wrong with that , but let 's not delude ourselves by justifying it as a " life-changing " experience . <p> Heck , you can probably have more " life-changing experiences " by spending an hour online or in the local library . <p> I 've actually been to TRIUMF ( for a conference ; as well as being encouraged to apply for a staff positionif I 'd done that , my life might have taken a much different turn , anyway ) . I did do that tourIve done quite a few accelerator tourand given my background , I did n't  learn much , but I see your point . Often , though , I think pixels will get you 97% there . <p> OnTheWay said , <p> Ultimately , travel is like opera or hip hop . Either you like it or you do n't  , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sevennotemode said , <p> Here is another good reason not to travel : <p> " Gatwick baggage chaos : holiday-makers face flying without luggage . " <p> from the newspaper today . <p> Who really needs all that hassle , stress and inconvenience . <p> I have also been to see one of the seven wonders The Taj Mahal . The place is a dump with hundreds of poor local people begging and selling crap . No thanks . <p> greenie said , <p> Well I suppose then you wont be standing in line in front of me at the Louvre ! I have n't gotten to do much traveling so far and am so looking forward to going to Europe for the first time . I 'm saving up for this trip and I 'm totally psyched ; will even make myself get on a plane to do it ! <p> Why do I want to travel ? I look forward to seeing the paintings and sculptures that I 've only seen pictures of in France , Italy and the Netherlands . The architecture . The street scene and markets . The food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we have here in the US . The people . <p> When I travel , even if only to Montreal , I love to wander the streets for hours and take it all in . Sample the food , go to farmers markets , talk to people I meet . I guess I 'm just curious about the rest of the world . <p> I 'm learning French , speak some Spanish and will tackle Italian next . I plan on unleashing my abysmal attempts at speaking the local language on the unsuspecting locals . Will see how I do : - ) . <p> Down the road maybe I 'll want to live in another country . So this is sort of an exploration as well . I guess I do n't  find much of the US " culture " of big box stores , TV reality shows , NASCAR , fast food etc too attractive . I 'd like to see if I find a better fit for me . I 've never really found that I " get " the culture of the US. 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287431 @2287431/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> In the past I have made random comments about living out of a suitcase . I have done so in the past and it is entirely possible in fact I arrived in the US with just a suitcase to fit in the necessary clothes , cookware , and electronics in a large suitcase . At some point someone asked me what one should bring along and I promptly filed the question on my ever-growing to-do-list ( item #29 ) of blog topics and then forgot about it . When the simple dollar used the suitcase to illustrate a point about the amount of stuff we carry around , I remembered the original question , so here goes . <p> Living out of a suitcase comes with the following advantages : <p> It is very easy to pack up and move . This is thus ideally suited for students , salesmen , contractors , globetrotters , speakers , and other people that move around . <p> It puts a very hard limit on the amount of things you can own . Not only do you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and space . Anything you buy has to be space- and weight-exchanged for something that originally was in the suitcase . Otherwise you lose the advantage . <p> Personally , I have a big Samsonite suitcase . I wont bother to go in and measure it but suffice to say its within airline regulations and in retrospect it may be pretty average as far as big goes . I paid $95 for it years ago . On transatlantic flights , people usually bring two of these just to give you an idea . <p> To bring list : <p> Towel : A towel is the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have . Naturally you need one , but only one . I used the same towel for four years at which point I ceremoniously declared it dead . I recommend a medium sized towel . It dries the body as well as a big towel but it takes up less space . Roll up the towel ( rather than fold it ) when putting it in the suitcase . This goes for the clothes too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of storing clothes . <p> Toiletries include tooth brush , floss , and shaving kit . It is presumed that you buy the toothpaste , soap , deodorant , and shampoo when you arrive and ditch it when you move . If you want to rough it , you can use baking soda for ALL of these . For the shaving kit , I use a straight razor with replaceable blades . I have found that if the beard is kept wet , I can go for half a year without replacing the blades . This avoids the strop and other gadgetry of a real straight razor and the cost of the high tech multi-blade instruments . <p> You need one pair of leather boots for walking in all seasons , one pair of dressy shoes , and one pair of trainers . Make sure the boots and the dress shoes are the same color . The reason is that you only need one color of shoe polish . Forget about the sponge and use the oldest pair of socks in your inventory ; speaking of which <p> You need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis socks , all black . A 12-day laundry cycle just under two weeks works well for a single person ( if you can do your laundry with another person divide all of the following numbers by two ) as that seems to correspond to an amount of clothes , split into warm and cold washes that just fill up a laundry machine . Why 13 instead of 12 ? You might step in something wet . <p> You also need 12 sets of underwear . I 'm presuming that you wo n't sit on something wet . Briefs take up much less space than boxers . <p> You need 12 t-shirts . If you are forced to weak business casual , make that collared shirts . If you are forced to wear business , make them shirts . <p> You need two , maybe tree , pairs of pants . I prefer chinos , jeans , and some light technical sports pants ( for laundry , sports , and rain ) . If you need to wear suits you will want to modify this plan . Instead of the sweater get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get two pants that match the suit jacket ; also include a couple of ties . Just make sure that EVERYTHING MATCHES WITH EVERYTHING . If nothing else , you can never go wrong with white or dark blue shirts . <p> You need one sweater . Make sure it matches the shirts and the pants . <p> You need two large plastic bags to hold your laundry . You can bring them or get them later . If they rip , get new ones . They do not take up much space . <p> You need one jacket . I recommend a three layer Goretex jacket . Make it black . If it has a hood it should either be detachable or go into the collar . This will work as business casual and it will be good for three seasons . Summer = no jacket . When it get cold , wear your sweater under it . <p> You can bring either a wide brimmed hat or an umbrella . Also get some sunglasses . If you tend to throw them away a lot , get cheap $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My raybans are from 1999 . <p> You need one needle , and a few rolls of thread that matches the color of your clothing : probably white and black . Include a couple of safety pins as well , they are always useful . <p> For scissors , I prefer the leatherman squirt because this can go in your key ring along with a photon LED light . I would also in get a Swiss army knife with corkscrew , can opener , and screw drivers . <p> Get a small first aid kit . <p> For cooking , I use a one gallon pressure cooker . Get the best you can afford . I use a Kuhn-Rikon that has been going for 8 years now ( although the rubber gasket on one of the pressure valves is getting a bit stiff ) . Bring one stainless steel plate . I prefer steel because its not plastic and it does not shatter . Also bring one cup . There is no need to bring more than one fork and one spoon since it is the odd person that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knife , I prefer a short serrated utility/tomato knife . This will keep cutting and can be used on the steel plate with no adverse effects . Also get a set of small storage containers , maybe 2 or 3 . Each should be the size of one of your meals . Wrap all this in your shirts and put them in the suitcase . <p> I generally do not bring any food . There are often issues with customs . Also , it takes up space . The only thing I would bring here are spices . The rest you can buy as you go along . <p> You need a small backpack . I got my favorite backpack for free at a conference . It holds my letter sized laptop in a letter sized compartment for paper . The laptop will play your music and your movies . Never buys movies . Either rent them , borrow them , or get them via netflix , etc . <p> You also need a pen , a pencil , and an eraser . One binder should be enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes one hole at a time . It does not take up much space . You can also get a tiny stapler . <p> You need one set of bed sheets . I highly recommend a pillow . A pillow will take up quite a bit of space , so get a small but comfortable one . Fashioning a replacement pillow out of shirts gets old real fast ( well a month anyway ) . For the blanket get a fleece liner from a sleeping bag and get a sleeping bag rated for room temperature . Depending on how warm it is , you can use either the sheet , the sheet+fleece liner or sheet+liner+unzipped sleeping bag <p> This should include everything you " need " . For exercise , use body weight exercises although you may want to consider adding a piece of nylon rope for jumping ropes . Be very careful about not buying books ( very heavy ! ) , CDs , or DVDs . In particular , do not buy anything unless you just wore something else out . Find hobbies that do not require equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think about acquiring stocks and bonds as a way of " having " and " owning " rather than buying furniture and toys . It can be just as fun . <h> 37 users responded in " How to live out of a suitcase " <p> However , I 'd think you need only 2-3 pairs of socks and undies if you 're getting by with only 3 pairs of pants and 1 sweater . ( Are you wearing the same sweater every single day through the cold seasons ? ) Socks and undies can easily be washed in the sink each night and hung to dry . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> The ultimate goal is one set of clothing , of course . I 'm not so much into hand washing ( although I should be ) . The numbers are based on filling a laundromat and the average time before an item starts feeling funky ( in my case ) . <p> When I did my RTW trip early this year , I actually did everything in a small carry on backpack ( not a backpacker backpack , but a student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodwill ) . I had three pairs of everything ( shirt , socks , underwear ) plus one pair of pants plus what I was wearing . I have a small portable clothesline and did wash every couple of days in the sink . ( After I got back it was a couple of weeks before I stopped thinking , " Uh , do I have enough clean underwear or do I have to do laundry today ? " ) <p> Of course I was staying in hostels/motels and eating out so I did n't  need any of the household stuff . <p> @FB yep , it fits . Of course , you 'll be wearing a set of clothes and the jacket , when ou travel . It takes a few hours to fit it all together ( e.g. you stuff your backpack and the put the backpack in the suitcase .. also the handle of the pressure cooker has to come off using the SAK screwdriver of course . <p> For conference travel less than 5 days I usually go with a small backpack . Ill just about hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick or so . <p> How do you people dry it fast enough for handwash ? I did the hand washing once and after 24 hrs it was still damp so we had to get the hairdryer out . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Good post even if you do n't  want to live out of a suitcase ( I do n't  ) , its a good primer on what items you " really " need . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> I only know three tricks to getting hand-washed stuff dry in 24 hours or less . <p> 2 ) After you wring it out as well as you can , lay it out on a towel , roll the towel up , then twist the towel to force as much water as possible into the towel . ( This still does n't  get things as dry as the spin cycle in a washer does , but it helps . ) <p> 3 ) Fans help quite a bit . Of course most hotels do n't  have fans , but you might have a ceiling fan in your home . Hanging things outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> Living out of a suitcase is an excellent guideline in keeping my house from overflowing with impulse buys , and odds and ends that do n't  fit anywhere . <p> The drying with a towel technique works really well . Hang clothes outside at all times , weather permitting . I find that inside my house , the bathroom is the best place to dry . I hang them on the curtain rod and they 're ready to go the next day . <p> I live by handwashing . Its quick and easy . Keep your clothing to a mix of cotton , rayon , nylon , or polyester blends whenever possible and you cant go wrong . <p> Layers make everything last longer . The underpinnings fall apart faster and are easily replaceable . Keep everything nude ( for women ) , white or black ( for men ) , and its that much simpler . <p> one binder for all personal files ? I wish ! I 'd really love that , but am nowhere near that stage . I do need to seriously reduce my paper file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binder ? What files do you throw out ? You probably just keep it all on your laptop ? <p> what about other writing , if any , you do ? or notes on research or other projects , etc. ? <p> For me , I do n't  think I 'd lug any cookware around . It seems easier to just buy kitchen tools once one settles/moves in . Its nice to have new , clean cooking gear anyway . And what about a bed ? Just a sleeping bag ? <p> When I move again I will probably just try to sell all my current furniture , definitely not try to keep anything . Furniture also depends upon the place you have certain things do n't  fit all apartments , different apts. have different furnishing needs , too . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Well , the published stuff is eminently backed up . You can just go into a library and get it = Most other stuff is on servers out of my control . The only critical thing on my computer is my book and I back that up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = <p> The sleeping bag works fine along with a blanket/liner and a sheet . <p> Keep in mind that the above fits a lifestyle that usually moves between furnished rooms . If not , yes , get free or used furniture and sell it for what you bought it for at the end . The only piece of furniture we really paid for in the past five years was a new mattress ( old mattresses are sleepable but no fun ) . <p> And ALL apartments have the same furnishing NEEDS . One bed , one table , one chair ( per person ) . But they do have different WANTS . <p> Alex said , <p> @ Jacob I disagree that all apartments need a bed , table , and chair . In a pinch you could always spread out a sleeping bag or a few blankets for a " bed " and eat sitting on the floor . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> I 've slept on the floor of my apt for five years with blankets . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Chris How long did it take to get used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to a regular mattress ? <p> Alex said , <p> @ Jacob I slept on the floor for a couple months before getting a bed in my room . It did n't  take any getting used to , in fact the bed took a few weeks to get used to when I got it . I had lower back problems the entire time I slept on a bed . About a year ago I went back to sleeping on the floor and have had no back pain since . <p> Jeff said , <p> hey Jacob , Can you elaborate on what kind of razor you use ? I use a gilette from about 2001 with replacable gilette multiblades . The replacements are expensive about $1.50 per blade I think and they only last me about 2 months each , maybe a little less . So it costs me about 10 dollars a year to shave ( not counting shaving cream ) ? Is there a cheaper way ? <p> Also just saw your post about GE . I started buying it around $15 on the way down last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How awesome . They are a conglomerate of so many overpowered industries . They 're in banking , communications , healthcare , energy , and technology . All on sale for a normalized P/E of 5 . Got ta love it . <p> Thanks , Jeff <p> Joseph said , <p> Jacob , have you been able to find any trainers that last particularly well ? I do n't  want to have to spring for a new pair again and again and again = 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Joseph No , so I get cheap ones . For the amount of running I do , I do n't  require a lot of fancy features . <p> AnneRose said , <p> Thank You ! Ive been living the gypsy lifestyle , but have the majority of my belongings in a paid for storage unit . <p> I am working on reducing to One Suitcase , and learning new hobbies that require very little space to carry if any at all . <p> This is a great list . I like the idea of living out of a suitcase , but at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a traveler though , so maybe it does not have to be this extreme for me . But perhaps I could change it to " living out of a small car " ? <p> In any case , this post provides us with ideas and inspirations to get rid of even more clutter .

( Now with the checked bag fees it seems like everyone else is doing that too ! ) <p> I agree with everything posted and would just suggest using a chamois to dry your clothes quickly . They are thin and pack very easily too . <p> After sink washing , wring your clothes out as best you can . Then roll them up in the chamois and walk on it to get even more water out . vern guarantees it will be dry by morning ! <p> When I came to Arizona to work for three months ( I only have a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't  have free hobbies that do n't  need any equipment , so I packed fewer clothes so that I could fit my knitting , spindles , and fiber in there . I just use my motel sink to wash a few pairs of underwear or a shirt or two every few days . Hang them on the shower curtain rod , and voila ! Handwashing is not hard work at all . Its mostly soaking . I do very little agitating with my hands . If you soak long enough , you can get out anything . Washing machines are tough on clothes . If you are n't  using a laundromat washing machine ( and thus have complete control over the cycles ) , let your clothes soak in the washtub a while and then agitate for only a few minutes . <p> As for baking soda for deodorant , I 've been doing that for quite a while . I do n't  add water like the commenter in the baking soda post does . I pat it on dry . I find that one application lasts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after showering or bathing with soap , and as days go by the smell goes away . <p> Hah , I love the " I 'm presuming that you wo n't sit on something wet " line . Your list contains way more items than I 'd ever want to put in a suitcase , but I guess there is a big difference between living out of a suitcase and traveling for fun with a suitcase . Great tip about baking soda . <p> et said , <p> A largely self sufficient garden with necessary tools in a tool box not really ! Add a few chickens and you 'll need even more <p> I wonder what you think about ERE outside of the US , here in Australia our interest rates are much higher than the US and the even the idea of finding an apartment for $400 a month is fanciful . Right now our dollar is also at parity with the US , it wont stay like that forever and we can count on a good 15% fall in its value I think but that wont come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two pants , three shirts . For underwear , i think five is a good number . A synthetic towel take way less space . If you keep your hair really short you need a really small towel . Clothesline and pegs . Jacket , pair of boots and pair of sandals . <p> A good alcohol stove would be great . But you can you always learn to make one from an empty beer can . Here in Brazil you can get alcohol good for cooking in any gas station . <p> No scissors , no army knife , no folding knife , no can opener . One good real knife . No screwdriver . Hand-made bamboo sticks for eating . A bowl ( plastic or metal as it does n't  break ) for both eating and drinking . <p> For sleeping , a sleeping bag over a sleeping pad . Two bed sheets . A pillow is really a good comfort . <p> A bike for riding . A tarp for sleeping outsides . Everything fits on bike panniers . A medium or small backpack is useful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take with you . If you like having a library of books available all the time or a collection of racing bikes that you ride , then this lifestyle might not be right for you ! Before you go , work out the bare essentials and be like a surgeon when it comes to excising useless belongings , using a list like this . <p> I 've never tried living out of a suitcase however the concept really fascinates me . When I was a student I stayed at home to save money . This post has really got my juices going , just imagine not being shackled to one place travelling from country to country living out of a suitcase or an airline .

Lately , though , I have been wondering whether I am missing out by not having a career . Everybody I know seems to think that a career is important . <p> Answer : I think many financially independent early retires have thought about returning to work at some point . A lot of people go to work everyday and at least some of them say they love it and that they are very passionate about it so I can see the attraction of spending your time taking on some exciting project .

You probably have somewhere around 16 hours a day to devote to doing what you want when you want and pursuing all sorts of interesting activities . With a career , other people will be telling you what to do and/or what to think about for at least 8 hours a day . These 8 hours will be preset which means that if you feel like doing something else , you wont be able to do so . Employers will also expect you to think about work outside of work , so we are probably looking at 9-10 hours a day minimum . Add commute time and you may be left with only 3-6 hours a day most of which will be spent being tired in front of the TV . You can probably say goodbye to most of your activities .

This leaves you 10 days most of which will be used to create extended weekends around major holidays . However , in real life things happen . Maybe you get a good offer on a ticket to Aruba . Maybe you get invited by a friend to go hunting . If you have a career , you typically have to say no to these things . <p> Also , since you will be spending all your time at work , you will not have the time to do very much yourself . This means that your expenses will grow much higher . Expect them to double or even triple as you lose simple skills like cooking , gardening , and develop the need for a car , business clothes , and keeping up appearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should you ever decide to return to a life of leisure . <p> Aside from these issues , also consider whether a career would lead to a satisfying life . Most people climbing the corporate pyramid tend to neglect the rest of their life . It seems to be more the rule than the exception that the more successful they are at their career , the unhappier they seem . They barely know their spouse or their children and they certainly have no idea who their neighbors are . You would likely stay confined to your cubicle all day long following procedures and filling out forms and only get out to fetch coffee for the boss or run to the photocopier . Also , you will have to wear a suit , follow a dress code and probably a bunch of other codes as well . While listening to the mandatory motivation seminars can provide a brief sense of feeling good for a few hours , your job is not really to be creative or passionate . It is simply to make money for the company and sell as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , maybe try to arrange so that you can work for just a few hours a day . This can be hard to set up because employers prefer employees that need work to pay their bills as such a need is a great motivator . Thus they may not consider people who only want to work a limited amount of hours . <p> In conclusion , it is of course up to you . Know that if you do decide to give up a life of leisure and focus on a career instead , there is lots of stuff you can buy to briefly compensate for any unhappiness you may feel towards your choice . A new set of golf clubs or maybe a new suit , for instance . Psychotropic prescription drugs are also popular . Remember being unhappy about your corporate mission statement is a disorder that can be treated . Ask your doctor about it if it comes to that . <h> 46 users responded in " Should I go back to work ? " <p> Your cost of living must be quite low if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would this still be the case if your circumstances change ( marriage , kids , a desire to travel the world , go to university etc etc ) ? If the answer is no , then a few years working to put aside a a bit more money may not be a bad idea . <p> tracysimplylivinginspain said , <p> I take it working freelance does n't  constitute career work ? Freelancing allows you to accept only the projects you want ( and if you 've got your retirement money already taken care of , you do n't  have to accept projects just because you need the money ) and work the hours you want . You do have a boss , in a sense , your client , but if they really make your life miserable , you do n't  accept any more projects from them . <p> It sounds from the beginning of your post that you 're toying with the idea of going back to work ? After almost two years being semi-retired , my husband and I are also looking at what wed like to do next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge is exciting . When you 've got ideas , you want to act on them . Sometimes retiring can mean shutting yourself off from the world , at least a bit . <p> However , I would never go back to a 9 to 5 job and I have n't had one for over 20 years . Sure , its precarious at times , but I would never give up all the time we have had with our 3 kids , the time to think and enjoy the slow periods . Yeah , maybe one might say we did n't  take advantage of our talent as much as we could ( we had a graphic design studio ) we never had our work in the trade journals or became internationally recognized but we made a living and certainly have enjoyed life 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @traineeinvestor Yeah , here 250k would provide 7.5k/year ( in present dollars ) forever which would be enough for marriage ( I can attest to that , I am married and I spend less .. in fact marriage with the right partner drives costs down through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost as much as you can afford ) , many people sail the world for less than this , but paying 20k/semester at a university , no wayI got enough schooling as it is a library card is free though , so . <p> **25;146;TOOLONG No , I would n't consider ( my ) freelance work a career although I guess it could be . This blog is probably closer to a career if one can call it that , but I would n't call it that either , at least not at this point . When I think of career I am thinking of some job related progression where each step builds on the previous . I 'm not seriously toying with the idea of " going back to work " . This post , like several recent ones , was written more to " bring balance to the force " . Now , hypothetically though , could I go back to work ? I find that I do n't  make for a happy employee . I am too independent for that . I am also very interested in learning things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an apprentice or as long as I feel I get something out of it . Otherwise , I would really only work as a partner on a project or solo . <p> tlblack said , <p> " When I think of career I am thinking of some job related progression where each step builds on the previous . " <p> Its interesting to note that by your definition of career , when I was a teacher , I did not have a careersince I did n't  feel like advancing or going anywhere ( like becoming a principalugh ) . <p> I agree with Tracy , freelancing is a career . <p> And I have to say , the one thing that keeps me the most worried about the idea of early retirement is inflation , that great unknown . Freelancing seems like a great way to keep ahead of that . <p> Dr Anonomous said , <p> I once had a patient who was a relaxed , aging hippie kind of guy . He was healthy . <p> Then , he got promoted at work and put in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and working long hours . He developed a health problem that I could n't treat , so I referred him to a specialist . The specialist kept the problem from getting worse , but it did n't  get better either . <p> The guy eventually finished the project , retired , and took up an interest in ethnic music . The health problem went away . <p> I do believe that voluntary work is good . That 's why I still see patients . Frugality is necessary because it let 's us choose the kind of work we do , the amount of work we do , and the amount of stress we take on . <p> I do n't  think $250k is nearly enough to retire with at 34 but you seem to be living frugally enough to make it work . I think I would work a while longer until I had saved up enough so that my wife could retire with me and we had enough money to travel and pursue hobbies we enjoyed . <p> All the people that are passionate about their careers that I 've met wear whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many of them work a short bike or bus ride from home and none of them spend their day following procedures and filling out spreadsheets and forms . <p> They 're all programmers working at startups whose mission they believe in . And they typically make a lot less money than their skills and experience would get them elsewhere . <p> Even if I won 32 million in the lotto ( pretty much the ultimate in financial independence ) I 'd still try to have a job . I 'd just be much more selective about which job I take and how long I stick around . <p> Admittedly this is a bad time to try to find a job . But is there any harm in going back to work ? Jacobs view is a pretty pessimistic idea of work . I 've had jobs that were worse than he describes and I 've had jobs that were way better than he describes . Just because it is a job does n't  inherently make it bad . <p> The whole point of financial independence and early retirement is to be happy and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a job to be happy . Maybe you 've got too much free time and need to fill some of it up . Maybe youd like some extra spending money . Or maybe there is some field of work that you are passionate about . <p> If you are financially independent and the job is bad , then walk . At least you have that option . <p> Stephanie said , <p> That 's a pretty narrow definition of career ! <p> I 'm going to give mine . Its something that , as a practice , if stopped , would affect ones income or potential for income . So , as a freelancer , I work from home , with no boss or prescribed schedule . If I need money , I work more if I do n't  need money , I work less . If I *stopped* working , my career would slide : my clients would find new people to work with , and the momentum I 've built over the past 10 years or so would start to wane . Though I 'm not climbing any social ladders , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to make money and maintain clients , but I also need time off to do my own thing . <p> Many , many artists live this way : living simply and working minimally on commercial work , saving the rest of their energies for personal work . Both the personal and commercial projects contribute to a body of work that I would definitely call a " career . " <p> If this person you 're giving advice to were to find something that they loved that had potential to earn money , yet without compromising independence , voila a career ! And it is n't such a bad thing <p> And as an aside I also have the question 20smoney asked . Isnt all this market volatility affecting your income , if you earn entirely through investments ? If my life savings were to drop by 125K , say ( or half of the questioners savings ) , and I had no further income , I would be pretty panicked . <p> Also a question that 's been nagging me , when reading this site knowing the impact of peak oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of oblivion in the next 15 years or so ? How can you maintain enough hope in the market to the point that you can forgo all career potential ? ( Or maybe you 're not ) <p> You call yourself a realist , not an optimist , so I 'm honestly curious about this I have very little faith in the market , though overall I feel I 'm more of an optimist than you = 10152 @qwx420152 <p> &gt; How much would you be impacted in the stock &gt; market dropped 50% or so ? <p> That 's a very valid question to ask ! In my own portfolio , I can say that the 2008-2009 market drop of 30-40% caused my investment income to drop by about 10% . The portfolio has more or less recovered its value and income from it has increased above the 2008 levels ( I 'm not including the continued deposits into the portfolio and their effects that have elevated everything much more ) . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> &gt; knowing the impact of peak oil , do n't you &gt; think the markets will crash to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so ? <p> I would rephrase that question slightly : at what point is the cost of oil ( or other portable energy sources ) going to affect the market ? <p> Our collective experience over the years is that a doubling of oil prices causes a global recession that society works through . Technically speaking , weve actually endured an even higher increase in oil prices recently from $35/barrel up to $120/barrel ( and then right back down to $35/barrel ) . The market(s) had problems , but it endured . <p> Its also important to see potential shifts in where energy comes from . If oil prices are high enough , then making oil from coal becomes an option . If oil prices are significantly higher than natural gas/propane , then well switch to those cheaper sources . There are many oil production methods which are currently not used because they are not cost effective . <p> So my suspicion is that we will have growing pains in 15 years , but no collapse . I 'm not so optimistic when we talk about 50 years in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resonated with me from this post is your statement that " passion is an internal quality rather than an external quality . If you are not a passionate person , it is unlikely that you will be passionate just by taking up some career . " I agree . I find that I am not a passionate person , except when I grow angry at overt idiocy . Regrettably , there are too many opportunities for that in our society today . And often my anger is , as Shakespeare wrote , " sound and fury signifying nothing . " So we can leave that aside for now . <p> Instead of passion , I operate on curiosity . I like to solve problems . This only becomes a significant challenge when the solutions become routine and uninteresting . I sometimes think that I have a problem-seeking mentality because I need ever-more-complex problems to satisfy my curiosity and avoid frustration . I enjoy reading about subjects that I am entirely ignorant of because even the basics are new to me . <p> Life , with or without a career ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide sufficient problems to keep me occupied . And the first , and most pressing , problem is to satisfy my needs . I have solved this problem for all necessities but health . I have an intractable , chronic health problem that challenges me to find a solution other than allopathic medicine because the cost of doctors and drugs puts too great a strain on my capital . Or perhaps the solution is to cultivate a spiritual/psychological outlook that does not fear death , even if it comes earlier for me than for others . I am drawn to Stoic philosophy and the Japanese bushido because they both foster such an outlook . <p> I have to confess that I do n't  fear the collapse that peak oil might bring . It promises to be an encounter with the most compelling and fruitful sources of real , life-at-stake problems that someone in the post-modern era can envision . <p> Mo said , <p> Any imaginable economic catastrophe will have a negative impact on all but the very rich and its very unlikely you 'll become very rich by going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra years . <p> The scenario described in the post involves a 3% withdrawal rate . Based on historical data , there have not previously been time periods when a 3% withdrawal rate was not sustainable . So , it would take an unprecedented economic catastrophe in which case there really is n't any guarantee that any job , income , or money would be safe . After all , something would drive such a collapse , and that something could eliminate your job , even if you were a self employed farmer ( e.g. flood , drought , war , etc ) . <p> DW said , <p> Frank and I prefer you retired , content , and occupied with your numerous side projects . I think you are too busy currently for a " career " . <p> here 's my personal opinion based on what I would do if I were in your situation . I would create a movement . Sure , you could work a bit more and save a bit of cash . Or , you could use your blogging-fame and free time to help move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a commune-type environment ? Or , maybe do something like helping clean up the wreckage from natural disasters ? No suit and tie needed ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I think Mo and George already covered most of what I was going to say wrt market drops . A 3% withdrawal rate has historically survived a couple of world wars , a decade long depression , an oil crisis , and a bunch of other stuff . Now , I prefer dividend stocks which provide an ever steadier source of income some of which is reinvested to cover inflation . Hence market drops are actually quite welcome as they allow buying in at a higher yield . <p> The question of peak oil is important . The historical numbers are based on a period of ever increasing oil production . Will they also hold for decreasing production ? My opinion is that the market will be more resilient than the jobs , in particular certain sectors will be more resilient than others . The market may drop a lot but that 's only because the whole market includes , say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not need to own that . <p> I tell you what I mainly own : phone companies , big banks , **32;173;TOOLONG , and drug manufactures and dealers , excuse me , retailers ( cigarettes and prescription ) . All of these are pretty vital to keeping up a functioning society and/or in very high demand ( during a depression ) . <p> If such companies have failed at some point , then having a career in marketing , business administration , advertising , or research will have failed long before that . That 's probably most peoples careers right there since there are not that many people anymore doing " real " work anymore . ( Def. of " real work " : When you can put the product you made in the hand of any person and the response is " I get that . I can use that . " ) <p> Keep in mind that the market is not just a magic way of getting 10% returns forever . I think we often forget that it actually does represent underlying companies where people have their careers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I worry about is some kind of communist takeover or the death of the capitalist way of arranging matters . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Jason Phipps Short of starting a commune ; any ideas of how to do more than what I am already doing with this blog ( +eventual book ) ? Suggestions are welcome . <p> @Jacob Good points regarding the market and the relationship with the functioning economy . I do have some fears on the how much of a " market " the market actually is anymore with thing such as high frequency trading , market manipulation by the powers that be , etc. there have been so many sketchy behavioral aspects of the stock market in the last year or so , I 'm starting to lose faith to an extent . <p> I think you can easily monetize this blog by selilng some type of informational product like an e-book . I think you 'd do well pricing it higher than most e-books since you have a good , dedicated following . Would love to hear about your progress in such areas . <p> Another alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to do whatever it is that you enjoy . Live frugally during that time , and spend a portion of it trying out different start-up ideas that excite you . To us , a career is n't important . Doing what you love and being able to do what you love is . <p> Does this need to be an " either / or " discussion ? Tim Ferris talks about mini retirements ; finding a balance between working and not working . Western society does n't  seem to like that much and it is hard to find a balance <p> Then there is considering which aspects of " work " you are missing ? Need mental stimulation ? Take a course . Want companionship ? Find others to mix with ( or have children ) The list goes on often we substitute " work " for lots of others aspects that we need as human beings . <p> deegee said , <p> Do n't  forget to include as an option working part-time . This way , you can still maintain an income while freeing up additional time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ( 2001-2008 ) before I retired fully 15 months ago at age 45 . I kept my health insurance and pension eligibility ( for one year ; it got frozen in 2002 ) , and added to both my retirement and non-retirement savings . <p> I do n't  think $250k is enough to retire on at age 34 , either , even if you are single and childfree like I am . You will need to live off your non-retirement investments for at least 26 years before you can tap into any retirement ones , and then a few more years until Social Security ( if you are in the USA ) kicks in . <p> For me , health insurance has now become my biggest ( and fast rising ) expense , as I do n't  want to endanger my fiscal situation should I become i 'll and have to shell out too much money and ruin everything . <p> I was very glad to be rid of an awful commute , even 2 or 3 days a week , when I retired . While I liked my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . Nor do I miss any of the interaction at the office . It seems like another life I lived for 23 years . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @deegee Not all , perhaps even few , careers or rather types of work allows for part time work . Mine ( academic research ) certainly did not . Funding agencies expect full-time ( meaning whenever you 're awake ) commitment . Now wrt health insurance , I assume you 're not into the HDHP/HSA option ? I looked into what it would cost when I am 55 and it comes to $201/month in present dollars . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> Hi Jacob , <p> Thank you for all the great articles . I have been reading and reviewing this blog since Oct and really appreciate the help you have given my family of 5 . We are now debt free and living on 50% on our way to semi retirement in 4 years . <p> I have read about 20 of the books you have suggested.only the textbooks types have been a challenge . <p> One area I ( and maybe others ) could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking dividend producing stocks . I know you say that returns during the time of building up your portfolio give minimal difference during the short run ( say 4 years ) . I need to start educating myself on the whole process with hands on step by step method . However I must admit it is depressing to save half of our families income and only feel comfortable with 1-2% growth thru CDs . <p> I assume you do n't  feel comfortable listing your picks but maybe you could lead us thru some kind of exercise that you walk us thru a process , give us research to do , and then as a group we could share what we came up with ? <p> Anybody with me on this request ? 10152 @qwx420152 <p> @chris The best way to learn about the stock market , is to use the stock market .

The downside is I have more complicated tax filings than the vast majority of investors . <p> I am probably doing you a disfavor by telling you what I have ( bad analogy : telling a beginning motorcyclist that they ride a Ninja Z1000 , say ; not a good first bike and probably not a good second bike either for that matter ) , especially if you just go out and buy them ( because you would n't get the same price as I paid and how would you know when to sell ? ) . here 's my current list : BEE , COBR , CUZ , DD , EHI , EOS , FTR , GE , MO , OLP , RYN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WWVY .

It will introduce a whole new business or work routine to you and for a few weeks it will really be exciting and interesting .

It was an interesting time of my life . <p> I have worked three times at a sort of boring seasonal job . Its not the most fun job , but I would do it again because of the people . <p> I worked for 7 years selling flowers on the street corner . There are so many things about that experience I will cherish for all my life . <p> I even enjoyed those fun times flipping burgers at a restaurant which I did for 5 years or so . <p> Working is n't all bad . It is a way to explore a part of your creativity . There are interesting people you may meet . I like to learn and have learned as much or more from jobs as I have from colleges and libraries . <p> I would want to retire so I could be free to work when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary .

I would prefer another way of doing it . You offer another way , but its really the same way as we are conditioned . You just push the retirement date earlier than most people . A third option would appeal to me , to have your flexibility with regards to working or not , but to actually do work from time-to-time . It is sad that companies regard people with holes in their resumes so poorly . <p> Jen said , <p> I think most peoples jobs are not that fulfilling .

I am now 48 with a web design business . <p> Last August my youngest went off to college and at the same time I started really hating my work . I did not want to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the business . <p> Instead , I took a part time job as a personal care aide at an assisted living facility near my home . Its minimum wage ( I make $75/hr doing my " real " work ) but it has helped me get out of my rut . <p> Many people travel to shake themselves up and experience different cultures and worlds I found it changing the diapers of old ladies and listening to their stories . I doubt I will stay here forever , but I think the right kind of job at the right time can be a source of real growth .

@@42287457 @2287457/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> The title of the book is " Early Retirement Extreme A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence " . <p> You can find the links to get it , either through amazon or through the printer in the upper right sidebar or just click on the links . If its all the same to you , I prefer the printer , since my royalty is 50% higher if you go that way , but do n't  feel obligated/charitable . <p> The aim of the book has been to present the theories and principles behind extreme early retirement in a comprehensive and cohesive fashion . It contains everything you would want to know about financial independence and retiring early . In a way it is a way for me to achieve canonical closure on this subject . Technically I can just refer people to the book now . I do n't  have to keep repeating myself over and over on the blog anymore . <p> It took a lot of thinking/work/research to do that since my blogging has been less than organized(*) and also incomplete in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book reads more or less like a text book . I think it contains everything you want to know about extreme early retirement . It will give you the philosophy , the generalized principles , and examples and techniques of how to apply them . <p> ( * ) This explains the repetitive blogging . <p> The book does not contain any step-by-step plan ( although I will write such a book if the demand for it proves sufficiently high ) . Instead it gives you the tools to formulate your own plan . <p> The reason for this choice is the realization that everybodys situation is different . In my experience only a few people who read my blog are willing to follow prescriptions to the letter . Most people prefer a more moderate approach or more importantly their own approach . Since everybody has different goals , the book has been written in a way to allow readers to formulate their own plans while focusing on increasing their economic efficiency to the degree they desire . <p> In a world focusing on profit-maximizing and everything being quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few sales , but I 'd like to point out that this book is a challenging read , not a quick read , nor an easy read . There is not a whole lot of hand-holding and there are no personalized stories featuring Jack and Jill . It contains topics spanning subjects such as business operations research/management , personal finance , economics , ecological economics , sociology , and some related personality psychology . Learning everything in the book + references would in my opinion correspond to an MBA in personal economics . This is not a book which will teach you how to get rich by making a few phone calls . If this is what you 're looking for , I 'd rather you do n't  read it . It does not have lists of N tips to do X. You can find those in other books . <p> I asked some people , who have read the book , to grade the difficulty level and here are the results <p> Click the image to enlarge it <p> In comparison , books aimed for a mass audience are generally written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should buy it ? <p> I have put a lot of work into the book . I suspect that if you like the blog , you 'll love the book . So if you 're a regular reader of the blog , seriously consider the book . If nothing else , itll be like reading a two years worth of writing , which have been edited , proofed , and neatly organized in a cohesive manner . <p> People who are tired and uninspired reading normal personal finance books . This book will challenge the way you think about the world . For example , <p> Minimalists who want to go beyond photographing , cataloging and blogging about their 100 , 77 , 50 , or 37 things and take their minimalism to the next step using systems theoretical concepts . ( Popular lifestyle bloggers have a weird fascination with the number 7 . ) <p> People who are tired of memorizing lists of 3000 ways to save money and want to understand the general principles of why these tips work so they do n't  have to memorize lists anymore . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA funding limits . <p> People who want to cut their grocery bill to a quarter rather than in half . <p> People who want financial independence to do what 's meaningful to them but do n't  feel like making money blogging about how awesome they are or who do n't  want to start a dropship company on ebay . For example , <p> People who want financial security BEFORE starting a family . <p> People who want to change career , e.g. white collar workers who want to learn a trade and blue-collar workers who want to go to college . <p> People who want to make a difference doing things which are n't  traditionally rewarded in the working place , such as traveling , volunteering , semi-professional sports , arts and acting , saving the world , <p> People who want to start a business without having to take on debt to support themselves during the startup phase before the company makes money . <p> People who are concerned about the way consumerism is affecting the environment and who want to do something about it rather than just fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who realize that buying a $4000 electric bicycle made out of sustainably harvested bamboo and lithium batteries is n't as " green " as fixing up an old bicycle . <p> Middle class people who feel trapped in their lives and who work 95 for five or six days a week and yet feel they 're getting nowhere financially speaking . <p> People who are asking themselves whether work is all there is to life . ( It is n't ! ) <p> People who feel trapped by their mortgages , car payments , bills , lack of savings , and few remaining years before retirement . People who feel that they have n't saved enough to enjoy retirement and who need to change their financial course rather quickly . <p> As a gift from consumers who do not understand why you do n't  want more stuff ( yes , I do see the irony in this ) . <p> And who should NOT buy it ? <p> If you 're still at the novice stage of looking for context-free tips and tricks , you 're likely to miss the point of the book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tactics and does n't  go into strategic principles to the same degree as the book . <p> Anyone looking for a guaranteed " financial independence " -plan to copy . The book contains no plans whatsoever . Rather it gives you all the tools to make your own plan . Itll " teach you how to fish " , but it wo n't " give you a fish " . <p> Anyone looking for a get rich quick and easy scheme . Sorry , like any other valuable skill , ERE is hard work ( but oh so worthwhile ) . <p> Anyone who is looking for an investment plan . Sorry , there is n't any . Popular investment plans as approved by genius investors , Nobel Prize winners , science , billionaires , etc. change flavor every ten years or so . You are never going to find a financial plan that will provide high returns AND be good for the next 50 years . If you disagree with this basic observation , there are hundreds of other books you can read . If you actually read them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a book you can breeze through in a couple of hours . Its more like a one semester course . <p> Anyone whose self-worth is heavily invested in their degree , their corporate title , their houses curb-appeal , or their new car . The resulting cognitive dissonance might be too much to bear . YOURE NOT READY FOR THIS ! <p> It terms of length it corresponds to 150250 blog posts . However , this is not one of those blog to book projects where the author strings together material from their blog and pass it off as a book . The book has been written independently of the blog . I probably have to confess something here . Once I started writing the book ( June 2008 ) , I saved my best ideas for the bookif you wonder where all the diagrams I used in my early posts went ; well , now you know . <p> You can see a table of contents by clicking on the link . I do n't  really think I need to provide a writing sample , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustit contains all of chapter 1 and some of chapter 2 . Otherwise , just consider some of my better blog posts and imagine how theyd be like if they followed a coherent structure and had no typos or grammatical mistakes Yes , the book was edited and planned out . The blog posts are n't  . <p> These days it has become popular to write e-books . If it was a traditional PDF e-book with their big margins , double line spacing , and fancy stock photos , the book would about 500 pages long . This would probably be divided into 4 e-books of 125 pages each and packaged with a bunch of mp3 files interviewing my blogger friends discussing how *awesome* we are . Given the amount of contentabout 2-4 times more than a typical e-book offeringId sell the package for a cheap but fair one-time price of only $197 ( $1347 value = ) by hyping it in a coordinated " launch " that uses the word " amazing " a lot , but that 's not how I roll . <p> Instead you get about 100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line spacing printed on dead trees in a once popular format called a " book " for $19.95+shipping . I picked the book format because I would like it to become a classic rather than a hyped one-nighter informational product . I have reserved all rights for myself , so it will be available forever . Compared to a PDF , the data integrity of a book is incredibleit survived several weeks in Zevs backpack , yet remained readableand the concepts of the book should remain valid for many years to come . You should be able to pass it on to your grandchildren and the concepts will remain valid . <p> Admittedly , the book has no search box , but it does have an index , which hopefully is n't as frustrating to use as it was to create . Also you can underline and make notes in it . Its also good for clobbering people on the head with every time they ask you why youre not into mindless spending . The book can also be composted . Try that with an e-book . <p> It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very distracting . Zev and I had a big discussion about that which I won by veto . My argument was that if seeing a parenthesis like ( see section 5.2 and page 211 ) in the middle of a sentence bothers you , just try to ignore it . Do n't  feel compelled to look everything up as you go along . <p> If you buy it new , itll cost you $19.95 . I had to put the price somewhere . Some people have asked me why I 'm not giving it away for free since I 'm financially independent : For the same reason that sports stars do n't  play for free and rock stars are n't  giving away their music for free ! Putting a price on something makes it possible to see how much the work is valued by other people . In this case , I figured that the cost of a pair of pants or a restaurant meal would be a good marker . <p> No , I 'm not going to trade you my book for your pants , but you just might try inviting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that if you have any interest in personal finance you will find more value in the book than you would in eating out for one meal . If not , well , then there 's probably nothing in the book which can help you with your financial situation . Its beyond you . Or you 're beyond it . <p> If twenty bucks is too outrageous for you , you should be able to sell it again for about $15 thus recovering most of your cost . You cant do that with an e-book . It may also be that ownership of the book would cause you to exceed your carefully cataloged and documented list of 37 possessions causing a loss of face in the world of online minimalists . In this case just declare that books do n't  count . Or leave it in an inconspicuous place denying any ownership to it . Say its " your friends . " Or just sell it again already . <p> Would you want to sell it ? I do n't  think its a book you 'd want to reference constantly . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably good to reread once a year . Much like a good book on investing , its worth rereading a few times . The book has been tested on people and shown to teach them something new each time they reread it . I also tried testing it on our dog , but he was mostly interested in chewing on it . Dogs are stupidchallenged . <p> Anyway , in the name of saving money , why not get it from the library ? Well , go ahead and ask for it . I 'd love to see it appear in libraries . If YOU do n't  take action and request it from your library , you probably wo n't see it . More than 100,000 books are published in the US each year and they wo n't all automatically respawn in your local library . Typically libraries have a page somewhere , where you can ask them to buy books which are n't  in their catalog . Consider doing this even if you already bought the book . Spread the word . However , also consider your opportunity costs in waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , but some people have reported saving thousands just by reading the blog . Of course how much you can save depends on the difference between your starting point and your ending point , duh ! The ending point will be an interesting and enjoyable life at $6000/adult/year . That 's probably less than what you 're spending now . <p> It took almost 6 months between finishing the first step ( which took 22 months ) and the last step . Keep in mind that standard book publishing takes around 2 yearsand that 's after the manuscript is in. 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287459 @2287459/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> For little over a year I have been blogging about the fast track to financial independence and the possibility of early retirement if one so desires . No matter what anyone says , there is a choice between " working and spending " and " living and doing " , and I wanted to make that fact well known . I do know for a fact that this blog has played a role in getting on track to be able to quit the rat race permanently within the next 5 years for at least a handful of people and this is the reason I keep writing . <p> So far I have been writing about what I know and what I personally find interesting when it comes to extremely early retirement thus leaving it to readers to pick and choose between what was useful and what was n't . <p> However , this is likely not the most efficient approach if I want to provide value and help people with their goals . Therefore I would like to know what kind of posts you would find most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions <p> Theory , philosophy , and big picture posts ( graphs and eqs . ) . <p> Personal anecdotes , e.g. autobiographies . <p> Rants , opinions , and inspirational posts . <p> How-to posts ( specifically on what subject ? ) . <p> Anything else ? <p> I think there is already an abundance of information about paying off debts , how to save 15% in retirement accounts , clipping coupons , gaining interview and resume skills , where to shop for the best deals , etc. so I do n't  intend to touch those . <h> 47 users responded in " Let me know which topics you would like to see in the future " <p> I subscribe to a lot of **26;207;TOOLONG blogs , and the majority of them have a plethora of " how to " articles , theories , philosophies , etc .

This is YOUR blog . I 'm already retired but still find lots of value here . <p> To my thinking , it would be a mistake to try to please readers because , you never will please them all . " To thine own self be true . " And well keep coming back . <p> Sally said , <p> I like to read rants/opinions because I enjoy your point-of-view . = 10151 @qwx420151 <p> How-tos based on anecdotespick any of your goals and write related how-tos . So in the food goal , youve already given us ideas about actual menus and actual recipes , and could show us how to pack your bicycle or what your pantry looks like or any other specifics on how your or other people you 've seen have worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opinions , and when your way of looking at things differs from majority or currently accepted ways or current assumptions , those are good too . I like graphs and equations that make things clear , too . <p> In other words , I vote that you keep doing what you 're doing . <p> Laura in MT said , <p> How about ideas and advice on navigating the health care " system " when you cant get insurance through work or independently due to " pre-existing conditions . " <p> I 'd also like to see ongoing exchanges of stories from folks whove achieved early frugal retirement or are almost there . Could help the rest of us with fine-tuning our strategies or give us some great new ideas . <p> shawn said , <p> How you analyze the companies you choose to invest in .

Thanks for introducing me to the burpee and convincing me to quit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and been enriched by different types of your posts . In the future , I 'd like to read more anecdotes about the contrast between your way of life/thinking and those of others . So , I guess I like anecdotal rants = <p> " They " always say write what you know . Your posts so far have been from the heart and I would n't change a thing about them . <p> There are a lot of self-help and financial blogs and sites out there . Although the how-tos and case studies are useful , it is the quality of your writing and your unique perspective that continues to give your site its real value . <p> As I 've been drinking for a few hours I can keep babbling away until you reach 50 let me know . I do n't  comment much but enjoy most of what you write . I very much like your rantish/opinionish posts , and would love to get more of the fitness stuff that you mention obliquely . And a guest post from DW would be nice ! You also post interesting comments elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I sincerely appreciate your non-conformist views on the prevailing consumer culture and other subjects . <p> Investing " as a science " is something I study and enjoy . I too would like to know more about your investment choices . <p> As Imani said , keep up the good work , your writing style , opinions , and attitude are what attracted me and have kept me coming back . <p> -Spork <p> Pipps said , <p> I would like to hear more rants , personally . I like rants . <p> mcskj said , <p> I kind of enjoy the personal stories . I really like the pictures of your camper and your experiences with living full time in it . <p> To me , the best of the blogosphere is when bloggers share their personal life experiences and what theyve done , seen , or learned . I find it an interesting juxtaposition of reading about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and yet how we might still be similar ( say in a socio-political context ) in many ways . <p> Jeremy said , <p> Expand a bit on what you and DW did while you were dating ( assuming you did n't  go out for meals/cinema etc . How you told her about your frugal extremeness ( was it on the first date ? ) . <p> I would like to see Rants and personal anecdotes i do n't  like or read the posts where you do technical data and do graphs etc <p> SimplicityinKansas said , <p> An idea Many of your blogsphere have goals and aspirations . Perhaps a section where we ( the readers ) can have a section on goals and post progress against those goals on a quarterly basis . This will share success stories and further the doxology of simple , frugal and free . <p> Also , I like the idea of a guest posts on goals , progress and aspirations as well as techniques on how to achieve ones intentions . <p> So , perhaps more interaction yet the posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read and reflect upon . Keep up the great work ! 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Youve touched on how your relationships with other people affect your own thinking . That could be expanded more into a " how I fit into the world " series and " how to shape perception " . <p> Cold hard numbers on how the economic downturn is affecting your portfolio and income . For instance , I 'm tracking my dividend income over the past few years and seeing how it is affected . <p> Karl said , <p> Love your blog . Thank you Jacob and Happy New Year . <p> My favorite parts are rants &amp; personal anecdotes . What do you friends &amp; family think of your plan ?

Would love to read more about your living arragements ( with DW ) in rv. 10158 @qwx420158 <p> I like the shortcuts to more complex financial formulas , like the ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be cool to have a post with all of those in one place , and a brief explanation of how the shortcut was derived . <p> What I really appreciate most about your writing is that the signal-to-noise ratio is remarkably high compared to many of the blogarrhea-infected bloggers out there who take 2,000 words to say what 20 could have more successfully communicated . <p> Keep it up ! <p> BTW , I live in a motorhome as well , and by choice , as well . <p> cache529 said , <p> hmmmaybe more on minimalism ( like your pressure cooker and how everything fits into it ) . In the next few days I 'm planning to inventory every single one of my possessions down to little binder clips so I can pare down my " stuff " . <p> also , " how-to " convince your DW to live in an RV or move abroad ? <p> maybe I missed this , but how about a how-to or suggestions on how to invest the 70-80% of income which one is saving for extreme early retirement . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I spend . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I totally agree on the areas you should stay away fromhonestly if you did write about those I 'd probably think someone hijacked ERE . <p> I like the rants , opinions as well as theory and philosophical stuff . You do n't  see too much of that on other PF blogs . Also maybe more on the ecological benefits of living the way you do . <p> I would love to learn more about your investing process for income . How do you select companies to research , when do you decide to pull the trigger , when do you plan on selling , do you sell options , futures , sell short , day trade or anything else . <p> Also , when would you consider your retirement investment scheme a failure ? For me it would be if dividend income falls back to my monthly expenses and starts going lower .. <p> Just keep doing what you are doing . I was/am well on the way to Early Retirement , although I did n't  realise it was that , I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked very hard at times and enjoyed evey minute of it e.g. as a primary school teacher . When I found your blog amongst others I realised that I was not so odd after all . Although my retirement wont be as extreme as yours it will be very early ( I am sort of retired already but still rely on my wifes income but she loves what she does ) . I am working on learning to invest for income so she can retire early when shes ready . <p> Very early retirement does n't  have the same ring to it as Early Retirement Extreme . <p> -cheap travel ideas -cheap and healthy recipe/meal ideas -cheap entertainment -keeping friends and doing stuff with friends while not spending gobs of money -what to do with the money you save <p> These are the areas we struggle with . Jenny <p> cat said , <p> Keep doing what you are doing . I find your blog a daily inspiration . I like hearing about the RV and personal anecdotes . Would be interested in DVs thoughts too at times . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those questioning you living in the RV . <p> How about sharing your net worth , the exact stocks you invest in , the amount you invest each time , the amount you have invested , return/loss. , etc . I know you 're not a financial advisor but its good to see the progress in hard numbers . Personally I find it inspiring . <p> jenn said , <p> I enjoy the majority of your posts , particularly personal anecdotes as well as rants , opinions , and inspirational posts . I liked the December series you did . And I want to thank you for inspiring me donate my toaster along with a lot of other useless junk and clothes that were taking up space . It was rather appalling to see how much money I had wasted buying some of these things ( many years ago ) but I wont be doing that in the future . And there 's no point in hanging onto stuff just because I made a mistake buying it . I also discovered a lot of useless unwanted gifts that people had given me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of gifts but no more ! So I guess I 'd like to see more on minimalist living . <p> Seth Miller said , <p> I 'd enjoy more rants on : -the educational system -overpopulation ( have you read " Fewer " for the opposing viewpoint ? ) -thoughts on what makes some self-motivated and others not and how to combat this in oneself and possible children . -cycling ( your love of bike riding is one of the things that got me sucked in to this blog ) <p> Oh , I hope you do n't  change much . Your blog is so much fun , and so inspiring . I get the biggest kick out of it . We are retired and living in an RV , way , way , way less extreme than you so I get lots of good ideas from your posts . Keep on ranting and pointing out the flaws of our consumer-goods-driven ways . <p> One of the other comments mentioned that it would be interesting to know when and how you introduced your DW to your fringe ideas on living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that story . <p> I would love to hear your thoughts on how you think you life would be different if you had kids . Could you still be FIRE now if you had some ? <p> The reason I ask for your thoughts on this is I constantly fine myself reading your blog while thinking " yes a good idea I like that , but with kids how the hell would that work ? " <p> Thanks ! Tim <p> Sam said , <p> You could point out that voluntary simplicity is worthwhile even if bad luck causes you to delay some of your dreams . I 'd say its important *especially* if you hit some bad luck . <p> I 'm older than you and have been frugal longer than you . I 'm not financially independent yet because two " acts of God " delayed my plans . I 'm still happy and comfortable in spite of the setbacks . I would have had a much more difficult time if I had been living a consumerist lifestyle , used up my cushion , and lost everything when the bad luck came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I still plan to retire at a younger age than most people if I continue my fugal ways . Bad luck is not likely to last forever , but I can be happy even if it does . Frugality gives me that cushion . <p> Racetoendtheratrace said , <p> Jacob , There is too much crap on the internet . You are a radical voice of reason . I like your philosophy on life &amp; money . Some how-tos to flush it out are nice as well . Racetoend the ratrace <p> pony said , <p> Hi , <p> Next time you make an investment ( say in shares ) , provide a step-by-step walk through of your rationale in choosing that particular investment . Lots of detail with graphs / diagrams etc . <p> KevinW said , <p> I appreciate that your posts cover both abstract philosophies , and concrete directions with all the nitty-gritty details . A lot of blogs and books have one without the other , and come off as half-baked . <p> I would n't change the direction of the blog . However here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you decide when to invest in skills and facilities to DIY , vs. when to rely on public/paid services . E.g. you cook from scratch and pick stocks , but IIRC use community laundry and buy food from a grocer . What 's your litmus test for insourcing or outsourcing ? <p> Entertainment . I spent a summer living with one car trunks worth of possessions and went stir crazy . There was reading , the Internet , and computer games , and after that the choices seemed to be A ) buy some stuff or B ) pay to go " out on the town . " <p> Just-in-time versus bulk supply . Buying in bulk makes things cheaper , but is at cross purposes with minimizing living space and transportation needs . Do you buy anything in bulk ? If so how do you decide what 's worth it ? <p> Is moving to a suitable location a necessary step in ERE , or can it be adapted to work anywhere ? If the latter , how do you adapt to the country , snow , hurricanes , <p> Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I too would like to better understand your investing methodology . How you research , what your requirements are before you invest , etc . <p> And I , too , keep wondering my little one , and the corresponding costs , fits into all of the extreme planning framework . <p> Thanks for all of your insight so far ! <p> Kris said , <p> I would like to see more posts about minimalism and small-space living . <p> In the past I 've enjoyed your posts about how all of your cooking equipment once fit into your pressure cooker , about how all of your possessions once fit into a single suitcase , and about how later all of your possessions fit into a single closet . <p> And by the way , even though I 'm a former part-time photographer , I like the fact that your blog does n't  contain photos . So many blogs include stock photos that add nothing . ( They 're the visual equivalent of verbal cliches . ) <p> Save the photos for facebook , as you did with the photo of your RV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad that it was n't in this blog . ) <p> Another wish : for my own admittedly selfish reasons , i hope that you continue to not include advertising in your blog . ( Or if you do decide to add advertising , I hope that its text-only ads . ) <p> And as I write this , it occurs to me that your minimalist , uncluttered blog design reflects a key message of this blog : minimalist , uncluttered living . <p> brauhster said , <p> Any thing that interests you . Secondly a link or primer on how to get an online stock broker set up so one can buy and sell stocks , bonds , &amp; CDs . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I am new to the blog and I have enjoyed everything I have read . As to any topics for the future , I suggest anything that will help the average bear make the transition from our 1995 to 2006 " boom and whoosh " to our 2007 to 2025 " doom and gloom " . For the average American family of four , ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , back to the Beaver Cleaver era of living . Instead of the 3000 square foot McMansion , we have the 1200 square foot Ranch , aka starter home . Instead of a Lexus and a Hummer , we have the paid for 1992 Honda Accord . We now have the beginning of the savings account instead of the Visa Card . Instead of the $2500.00 washer and dryer , we have a pair of standard machines that will not fly to the moon , but will wash and dry clothing and costs no more than $600.00 combined . This is the transition I am talking about and its almost too late to even afford this change of lifestyle . I also enjoy your posts of minimalist living and downsizing . Your posts and articles are excellent for your age group let us say the 30 somethings to the 40 somethings , and also convey well to a few of us Senior Citizens . Most people though , will not sacrifice too much and live as simply and cheaply and save as much as you have done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog and agree with most all principles shown on it . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287468 @2287468/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I think this is a worthwhile effort . Learning how to do intermediate bike repairs is not very difficult ( I did it ) and you can acquire tools as you need them and likely be able to buy them with the money you earn . I would recommend starting by fixing flats ( your cost for a bulk patch is around $0.15 , the bike shop charges $10+ ) and adjusting brakes and gear shifters ( about $35 in tools ) . <p> You can read about one way to do it in much greater detail here . I have used my repair skills primarily on my own bikes and volunteering on a needed basis for a shelter . <h> 4 users responded in " How to set up a bicycle repair company " <p> Hi , Jacob . I plan to read this all on reparing bikes . It may be something that can be a small side business for us. but I 'm not sure as we live in Ohio &amp; really not that many people ride bikes . I mean , its like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus 2 . We do n't  have real rider friendly roads . I feel it would be a good use of my time though to learn to fix bikes &amp; also plan to get a book on lawn mower repair . Thanks for the small business ideas . We need more of them . There are so many people with no work here right now . <p> Steven Austin said , <p> Temperature is really not much of a problem for bikers just need to get some non-cotton , technical gear ( so that your own sweat does n't  chill you ) . Low temps plus precip can be tough on bikers , and even tougher on bikes on dry days , a little dust always can get in your drive train , but on wet days , the water transports dust , grit , glass , etec. directly onto your drive train . <p> All this to say that the temps in Ohio shouldnt affect biking / bike repair business , but the infrastructure and social willingness to accept bikers on the roads might affect it . <p> here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AKA lawyer who can charge $25 for witnessing a signature and unleaching , oops , I meant unleashing his or her signature-watching skills for a huge hourly rate . Thats way better than bike fixing . I 'm sure it takes several years of school to properly learn how to observe a signature , but the investment is worth it . I just had the unholy displeasure of taking part in a real-estate deal signing . <p> Chuck Findlay said , <p> Bike repair is within reach of almost anyone that has a bit of mechanical skill and a basic set of tools , and a few inexpensive specialty tools like a tool to take the chain apart . <p> This low start-up cost is good to work on your own bike to save money , but its bad for someone as a business as there are hundreds ( if not thousands ) of people in most cities that can do it . And when the economy goes south ( doing it right now at an ever-accelerating rate ) those people are going to be looking for under-the-table income . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Way too much competition for the pathetic income it will make . <p> Refurbishing bikes ( painting and making them look new ) that are old and beat and then selling them would likely pay better then just repairing other peoples bikes . But it takes a paint gun , compressor and skill to paint well . You cant do it well with paint cans from Wally-World . <p> The best way to make money is to have multiple income streams as any one of them will unlikely make you a good income , but 10 of them may do it . <p> I have a handyman business , I do all kinds of things for people , I paint , do plumbing , electrical work , siding houses , frame work , roofing , yard work , put in doors and windows , clean carpet and furniture , tile flooring , remodel basements , some auto repair and 15 other things . <p> Carpet and furniture cleaning is the most profitable ( I can do $40.00 per hr on carpet and $90.00 on furniture ) I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it full time as it gets old moving furniture all day long and I had a heart attack so I moved to less-stressful work . But every time there is a new expansion of unemployment from some factory closing there is all kinds of carpet cleaning flyers put up around town . But these new guys do n't  do furniture as it scares them to think about cleaning it . <p> No single one of these skills pays the bills 100% , but all of them combined does a good job of generating a good amount of money . <p> The only thing I try hard to not do in a home is drywall work as I dislike it , but I have a fellow contractor that does it and we trade work and often work together on large jobs that would be hard for a single person working alone to do . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287480 @2287480/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> After going on about the zen and glory of padded envelopes for some time now , I have realized that a refresher on how to retire extremely early ( for those who are younger than 35 ) and how to retire in short order ( for everybody who is older ) might be in order . After all , this is this blogs name , so here is a step by step guide on how to retire in 5 years in just 6 incredibly tough quantum leaps ( sorry , no babysteps , kids ) . <p> First build up the required dose of motivation . In my experience , at least 800 milliJacobs(*) are required , but more is always better . The reason for your motivation is not so important . Maybe you are tired of paying for your friendly bankers kids college education . Maybe you think the focus on consumption has gone haywire with the introduction of the electric can opener . Maybe you just want to do things that are more interesting that padding resumes and wormHking for the man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight . You are not going to get there through small changes and the eternity of babysteps . Nobody becomes an Olympian by taking the easy path . Early retirement must take precedence over creature comforts and other spurious needs that advertising and marketing tells you to have . No pain , no gain . <p> Stop spending money . Ideally you should spend money on a place to sleep and a place to eat . Early retirement and financial independence is largely incompatible with having a personal game room or taking out a second mortgage to install a bowling alley in the basement . Allow $50 for food a month . If you run out , stop eating ( refer to points 1 and 2 ) . It builds character ! I 'm just joking , but watch what you eat , you can only benefit . You should allow about $5 a month for transportation . This will easily be enough to resole shoes or get new tires for your bicycle . I 'm not joking . <p> Achieving financial independence is like taking on a second job . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make anything themselves anymore . Well , it is possible , but it requires some effort . To assist with this effort , throw out your TV . This gives most people an average of 4 hours a day : First to learn how to live without buying everything at Walmart . Second , to apply those skills . Learn how to cook very nice meals for $50/month . You should also get back in shape to actually be able to ride a bicycle without suffering from heart attacks or sweat for that matter . Learn about money and learn to network for things : my ironing board for your bicycle . Learn how to do simple repair jobs , mending socks , fixing a broken radio , toilets that wo n't flush . Make that one toilet . After all , how many do you really need ? <p> Watch your bank account grow by staggering amounts as you spend less than $500 out of your paycheck a month , mostly on rent , while pocketing the difference . <p> Multiply your monthly expense by 300 and compare it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the former , you are free ! Come join us other early retires as we wonder what makes someone want to work for 40 years of their life while only having a pile of stuff to show for it at the end . <p> ( * ) Meaning I probably used about 25% more tenacity than was absolutely required . <p> I would say in summary that for me the path to early retirement was more of a journey to an unknown destination . I did not have a plan of what to do , when I decided to become financially independent . In fact that was not even my original plan ( I just wanted to avoid mortgaging myself to a job ) . Practically everything out there , books , retirement plans , tax laws , is tailored towards having people work and work and work with , as I see it , consumption of stuff being the only justification for their existence . Has anyone else noticed how politicians refer to people as consumers rather than citizens ? Wow ! I mean , just wow ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . <p> Peoples situation are complex , but one thing , I think , that many people do n't  realize is that they have a lot more control over their own life than they think they do . If they knew this would they really choose the option of working from dawn until sunset merely to fill their homes with more and more things ? <h> 52 users responded in " How to retire in 5 years " <p> I 'm up for the challenge . I shall take the plunge , onward from 50% to 75% , then consistently dwindle down to 100% to savings . I should be able to reach 75% by August . I 'm in ! <p> greenie said , <p> I seriously wish I had figured this stuff out years ago . I 'm way too old to retire young ; at this point I just want to be able to stop working jobs I do n't  want to work ! My basic goal is to relocate someplace warmer , maybe overseas , and where I will enjoy being outdoors a lot more than here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with continuing to do some work ; just would rather it be on my own terms ! <p> So I just did your calculations ; I 'm a lot closer than I realized , including selling my modest house and car which are both paid off . I 've got maybe $15,000 to go . I 've recently started saving 50% of my pre-tax pay at work in a 401K . I 'm not a high income earner but that means I could hit the extra $15,00 needed within a year . That 's pretty exciting . <p> I 've drawn up a list of allowable expenditures for now . I am working on fixing up the house to put it up for sale so there are some necessary expenses there . Otherwise pretty bare-bones ; well for me that is . I do have to have a car for work , and I do n't  live in an area where being car-less is feasible . My goal is to live in a place where I will no longer need a car however . And food ; $50/month ? No way . I 'm not eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not willing to subsist on just rice and beans . Produce is expensive here and winter is long so I have to buy what I do n't  grow ; do n't  want to live on just potatoes and onions that I stored ! But still , I 'm getting closer to actually doing this . Will consider renting out the extra bedroom soon as well . And am selling stuff online and locally as I clear stuff out so that will add up too . <p> And not being young anymore , eventually I 'll even qualify for Social Security , although it will be low . Exciting to contemplate though ; I 'd love to be out of here before next winter ! 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287481 @2287481/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> This is an interesting challenge which I believe I could do if I had to . To reiterate : This posts shows what I would do . As always , I am not you , and it is your responsibility to decide whether you want to and whether you need to hire a certified financial professional to consult before following any of the ideas listed here . <p> Let me define four terms first : <p> Wealthy means having enough money to cover all expenses for a long time . <p> Rich means having a large income . <p> Poor means having a small income . <p> Broke means not having enough money to cover all expenses for a long time . <p> It is possible to be rich and broke for instance . Consider a guy with a Porsche who does not have enough money to put gas in the tank . It is also possible to be poor but wealthy . Although being poor excludes living in a mansion and having a spendthrift lifestyle , the virtue of being wealthy is that one never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to worry about is getting the bills in the first place . <p> Currently the Federal minimum wage is $5.85 per hour . It is scheduled to increase to $6.55 per hour on July 24th 2008 and to $7.25 per hour on July 24th 2009 . Here I will just use the $5.85 number . I will also assume a standard work year of 2000 hours which results in a wage income of $11,700 . Using a tax estimator from one of the nation-wide tax companies , the taxes on this amount is estimated to be just under $300 or 2.50% . This leaves us $11,400 to work with . <p> Now it is obvious that with an income like that , it does not make much financial sense to live in New York or California or other extremely high cost of living areas . I think this is the main mistake many people make . They complain about the high cost of groceries , the high cost of gas , and the high cost of rent , but they would not even consider moving to a cheaper part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it here " over " I like my job " to " All my friends and family live here " . The thing to realize is that if you are paid a minimum wage AND you want to be wealthy , you simply can not afford to live in a particular place just because you like it or want it . You have to make a choice : Which do you want more ? To be wealthy and not worry about whether the next paycheck covers all your bills or to live somewhere you like keeping in mind that even if you move , you would probably get to like that place too ? Nobody can make that choice for you but yourself . <p> Assuming that the choice is to become wealthy . The first step is to move into a place that includes at least some utilities ( heat , water , garbage , or electricity ) and costs less than $500 in rent per month . You can get some decent places in the midwest in that range . It is important to pick an home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to walk , the more flexibility to you have . In my opinion a person ought to be able to walk 2 miles back and forth to work each day , but why not aim for 4 miles ? It is also nice to pick a place which is fairly close to a supermarket , but not as important as being close to work since you wont be going shopping that often . In terms of living arrangements the second suggestion is to live with someone else that also brings in an income and then split the rent . Try to be flexible . A one bed-room apartment will work for two people . One could sleep in the living room . Again , it is a choice you make . Another thing to keep in mind is to shop around . If you can save $50 on rent a month , that is $600 a year . <p> Now let 's assume you find a one bedroom apartment for $400 / month with no one to split the expenses with . That 's $4800 a year . This leaves $6,600 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that . My guess is that they will come around to no more than $1000 if you save diligently on whatever is not included in the rent . For instance , turn appliances or lights off whenever they are not in use , turn the thermostat down ( ours is set at 64F during winter and 76F during summer ) . The leaves $5,600 . <p> If you have a car , sell it . If you really need a car for yourself at some point , you can rent one or get a cab . Otherwise walk . I would recommend start looking about for a used bicycle . That should cost no more than $50 . For grocery shopping I would get a used back pack . The old army webbing system , I forget what its called , works well and can be had for less than $50 at a surplus store . <p> It goes without saying that if you do get a TV , it will be broadcast only . A standard cable subscription can easily cost close to one grand a year ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic cable ( sometimes you have to ask for the " basic " basic ) and a dial-up internet . In this case I would pick the net connection . <p> Food can be radically simplified . Do n't  eat out unless you absolutely have to e.g. dinner with your boss and the rare birthday party . A few times a year tops . Buy most things in bulk : Toilet paper , 20lbs bags of potatoes , 10lbs bags of onions , 25-50lbs bags of rice , 15lbs bags of beans . Only eat the vegetables of the season yes , vegetables are seasonal , although they can still be bought out of season they are much more expensive . Consider only eating meat once or twice a week . Skip the milk . Learn how to cook . I used to live on this while I was saving for retirement . Food should cost no more than $50 a month or $600 a year if you follow these rules . <p> You are now down to $5000 . <p> I would not go without health insurance . Skipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of bankruptcies . However , on this financial plan you will be saving a lot of money which should allow you to have a fairly high deductible . Of course it is also important to stay healthy . Eating like above and walking to work every day should keep you free from a lot of obesity related diseases . The cost of health insurance will probably be in the $500-$1000 range a year . <p> In terms of clothing , shop at thrift stores , mend holes , wear it out . The annual costs are trivial ! <p> This leaves you $4000 with all points covered . Did I forget anything ? <p> Here is how I would prioritize it : <p> Pay off all credit cards ( if any ) . There are many methods such as debt snowballing . The specifics do not matter as much as throwing all the cash you have at this serious problem in order to get rid of it ASAP . <p> Establish an emergency fund . Some people would advise you to do this first rather than paying off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , it means that they are no longer maxed to the limit . This in turn mean that you can put emergencies on credit . The reason for this priority is that your emergency fund earns about 4% in interest whereas paying off your credit cards saves maybe 20% . The size of this emergency fund should be several months of living expenses . I prefer 6 months , some people prefer 12 months , but you should not make it less than 3 months . Your monthly living expense here is $617 , so 6 months equals $3700 and it should take about a year to save that amount . <p> Once this is done open a retirement account and start saving a fixed amount every month . This does not need to be a large amount in the beginning . If I was in this situation , I would actually consider taxable accounts as well since they can be used to boost your income because the funds are not locked down until you reach 59+ years of age . Regardless , if you have come this far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A final suggestion is of course to spend some of the time you would otherwise be spending watching TV or " hanging out " to improve your skills and education so as to earn more than the minimum wage . I realize that individual situations are different . In fact a majority of people who earn minimum wage are high school students that flip burgers which makes this " guide " useless for a majority of minimum wage earners . However , my main point with this post was to show that despite a low income , it is still possible to become wealthy if wealth is truly something you want . <h> 28 users responded in " How to get wealthy on minimum wage " <p> Jacob , Another good posting . You 're quickly turning into one of my must-read blogs . <p> I 'm taking the plunge tomorrow and getting up two hours early to ride my bike to work . Well see if its worth it ! <p> DNA said , <p> I agree you 've got a good thing going here ! There are very few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . I also like that you discuss environmental and health reasons for doing so ( among other reasons ) . <p> " Your Money or Your Life " and " The Tightwad Gazette " were huge influences for me right after college and helped me avoid big debt , but your savings goals blow my out of the water ( I save 40% of gross salary &amp; consulting income ) . <p> A couple of comments on this post : I live part-time in a mid-sized midwestern city and $400/month would be really tough to find in a safe area . I do n't  know about more rural places . Also , a catastrophic health insurance policy will run at least $150/month ( like the kind students can buy ) . I think you 've left enough cushion with the $4K figure to cover these , but it would seriously affect the amount one could save or use to pay down existing debts . <p> What you describe fits many immigrant groups who have come to the USA and eventually prospered using this formula . I would n't advise having kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraception ! <p> Heidi said , <p> I live in Tulsa , Oklahoma ( one of the least expensive cities in the country to live in ) and think that the $400 quoted is in line . The first home I bought here cost $14,400 in 1997. ( 900 sq ft / structurally solid good roof / esthetically very VERY UNappealing ) . We sold it this last spring for $50,000 after refinishing the hardwoods , new vinyl , new paint in and out , landscaping , etc . You can still find homes in the 25K range here , ( very poor but " safe " neighborhoods ) if you look but that need a lot of cosmetic work but are structurally OK . ( Note that we rented out the home for the last five years of its life for $350-$450 per month ) . I only put 5% down on it and mortgage payments with taxes and insurance included were $165 per month . More importantly , it allowed my husband and I to put a little extra aside each month to work on another ugly house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The $400 for a garage apartment w/ utilities is very do-able . I often wonder why more people do n't  retire here . A 600K home in Seattle is 150K here and then you could potentially live off the interest . <p> Not enough is said about buying as modest a home / car as you can , until you can get some investment and/or rainy-day dollars accumulated . <p> Jon G said , <p> I disagree that most minimum wage earners are kids . I have a Bachelors degree and was in my 30s and was making minimum wage . I was still able to save for retirement , only because I was living with my parents . <p> I 'd add a few other pointers , gleaned from my semi-demi-exboyfriend , the Emperor of Cheap : <p> * Buy all incidentals at yard sales , estate sales , and thrift shops . This includes things like kitchen implements , tools , plant pots , camping gear , artwork for your walls , etc. * Also at yard sales , buy candles . Use them to navigate the house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * Furnish your home from yard sales and estate sales . Never buy a piece of furniture new . This includes tables , chairs , sofas , lamps , and the like . * Learn to cook , and never eat out . You 'll find you eat better , save a ton of money , and you can entertain friends inexpensively by hosting them for dinners and breakfasts. * Find free and low-cost ways to entertain yourself . Hiking , bicycling , picnicking , and camping ( using mostly second-hand gear ) are very cheap and lots of fun . Watch local listings for free community activities ( in our part of the country , NPR stations post these on their websites ) . * Meet people by joining groups who hike , bicycle , dance , and the like . Maintain an active social life . * Volunteer . This is a great way to make new friends , to engage in an activity you enjoy , and to make a little difference in your community . The Emperor , for example , volunteers as a rangemaster at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of guys who share his interests in shooting , hunting , fishing , and hiking ; at the city museum , where he was invited to become a docent ; and at libraries , where volunteers get their choice of free cast-off books ( this is where he gets his cookbooks ! ) . <p> The Emperor lives like a real emperor on less than 12 grand a year . He owns a new Camry ( paid for in cash , thanks to his proclivity for savings ) , travels where and when he pleases , and lives in a ( paid-off ! ) house that 's perfect for his needs in a safe area where his car &amp; homeowners insurance are half of mine and his property tax a third of mine . He has n't  held a regular job since he was in his 40s , when he and a friend challenged each other to quit their jobs and embark on " bumhood . " While the pal was a stockbroker and could afford this shenanigan , the Emperor was a journalist , not a trade that lends itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ever went back to work ; neither has ever expressed any need or desire to go back . <p> Living proof that if you 're determined and very smart about spending , you can thrive and be happy on a modest income . <p> I would question , however , whether you can get health insurance for $500 to $1,000 a year . The last time I tried to buy insurance on the open market , it was $350 a month , and because I had incurred a hairline fracture of my wrist in a hiking accident several years before , the insuror refused to cover ANY broken bones and any back problems ( i.e. , if you get in a car accident , you 're sh** out of luck ) . The Emperor went bare until he reached Medicare age . He was in the active duty Air Force Reserve , and so whenever he was on duty , he got a free checkup , free dental cleaning , and a years worth of blood pressure meds . He was very , very lucky that he never got sick or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is a great post . I listened to Dave Ramsey talking about how to be wealthy on minimum wage last summer and I like the twist you 've given it pay the credit first . That 's what I did . <p> I am SHOCKED to learn about housing prices in the midwest ! I knew they were low , but not so low . When you originally did the calculations for minimum wage at a total of about $11,000 per year , I actually laughed . That barely covers my living expenses for the year . Its funny that someone above referenced prices in Seattle I live here . When I hear that a decent home can cost $60,000 elsewhere , it makes my boyfriends and my decision to buy a " frugal " $400,000 home laughable . <p> I wanted to mention though that here in Washington state the minimum wage is significantly higher than the national minimum . I do n't  want to bother looking it up , but I assume other high cost-of-living states or cities have this as well . Or maybe not . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in WA is something like $7.89 and its raising to over $8 next year . But with cost of living so high here , I do n't  think it could be any other way . <p> Your posts always inspire me . Thank you ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> $400k in the midwest will get you a 4 bd , 4 bath , 3 car garage , 3000+ sqft house with either a couple of acres of land or " fake lake " front access . Of course , the cost of living adjustments are not the same , so there are fewer high paying jobs to pay for the upkeep . Still , housing costs are way more out of whack than incomes . A $400k house in CA could be bought for maybe $60-80k in the midwest . Does anyone know what the price levels down south are ? <p> THANK you for this post , Jacob ! Ive been looking for articles about thriving on minimum wage . <p> I make more than minimum wage but I find the whole idea of living and loving life on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blogging this week about some of my financial goals for the year . A secret goal that I have n't started writing about yet is to cut my expenses down to mimic life at minimum wage . And THAT is The Great Money Challenge ! <p> Circumstances beyond my control started me on the way to living frugally , at least learning " how to " . Now I am becoming obsessed with saving money every way I can , that happens when one loses half their income . What happens when you can only pay minimum on credit card bills ? There 's no way to be able to pay off one at a time . <p> Racetoendtheratrace said , <p> Good post . Unlike my wife and kids will be that militant with the constrained spending . But it is doable . Many immigrants do what you are saying on a regular basis . <p> Housing prices are low in the South . In NC we have purchased a number of good homes in decent neighborhood for less than $100K for 3 bedrooms and 2 baths . Rents are about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom is not out of the question there . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Terri With a minimum wage income , credit should never be obtained in the first place . Sounds harsh , but its the truth . <p> Maus said , <p> @jacob Hate to burst your bubble because I like the concept of this post , but you forgot some significant payroll taxes that take the net pay down a bit : <p> I lived like that as a student but as a masters graduate I lived it up for a year and a half . Now I want to go back to my old lifestyle so I can spend more on passive income sources and eventually retire . I regret my house purchase and the commute . I will overcome ! <p> Paul Navoneyes , he saved up all the money , but he also says he did n't  have a life . Sometimes I feel the same way ( though I 'd rather work in a factory like he did , not in a cube ) , but societal expectation dictate that one should have a life = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a life outside work but at the same time retire early ( say , at 40 ; Im 33 now ) , though maybe without millions .

" All my friends and family are here " would be . Why ? Because you invariably depend on them financially to a certain extent , whether its to chip in for rent , cover your expenses in emergencies/unemployment ( because min-wage employment is characterized by employment instability and hours that are often cut back depending on seasonal demand shifts ) Say you work at McDs in LA and decide to move to AK , where the cost of living is lower . ( Minimum wage is lower as well in LCL areas , so it may be a wash ) McDs is not going to transfer you to Little Rock , you 'd have to quit , move , then reapply in a region with no couches to crash on while you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work there . I know a guy who changed states and lived in a homeless shelter while he worked and went to school . If you have kids , this is not a reasonable option , and you 'd have to live in a motel until you could earn enough to shell out for a deposit . Because its unskilled labor , being hired depends on proximity , networks and sheer luck . Your network would need to be rebuilt from scratch , and that 's why people do n't  just do that . If you fail to find employment in a timely fashion at home , you 're on someones couch someone who knows you , trusts you , and might know someone who has a new job for you . If you fail somewhere else , you 're homeless , and its even harder to find work then . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287484 @2287484/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Step one : Figure out what you need <p> When I was single , I eventually figured out exactly what I needed ( see my minimalist kitchen post for details ) to cook my food ) . Since getting married it is clear that those needs have changed . Without an inventory analysis ( * ) it is impossible to know what needed and what is merely nice to have . <p> here 's how to figure it out . <p> First do all the dishes and put everything back in its place . For the next week , every time something is used and cleaned put it in a corner of the kitchen table rather than putting it back . If you need something and it is in the designated corner , take it from the corner . If you need something but it is dirty , clean it and then use it . For instance , if you need a cutting board and have a cutting board sitting in the sink do n't  take a clean cutting board from the cupboard but clean the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should try this to see what we really need in our kitchen . This will be a good exercise should we be required to downsize at some point ( for instance next time we move ) . <p> Improvise as much as you want . For instance , I enjoy improvising solutions hence my minimalist kitchen was quite small . Less improvisation would lead to more needs . The important thing in this little exercise is to figure out what is actually needed and what is just kept around because it might theoretically be handy . <p> After a week we expect to have a good idea of our needs . <p> Continuing the exercise for another 3 weeks will give us a list of probables things we do n't  really need but which would be nice to have on occasion . I am guessing that the breadmaker and maybe the coffee machine falls in this category . Mostly I use caffeine as a vocational drug thus I do n't  drink much coffee at home . <p> The things that have not been transferred to the kitchen corner yet are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done for tools , books , liquor or spices , computer games , clothes , etc . <p> Step Two : Adapt to your needs . <p> Now that you know what you really need , what you probably need and what you do n't  need , I suggest the following strategy . <p> Sell the unneeded on eBay , freecycle them or give them away or put them in storage . They have only been taking up space for the past month and will probably continue to do so . <p> Keep the probables but put them at the back of the cupboard or the top shelves . Reorganize . Since these are rarely used they will probably last forever . Do not replace them . Also try to remove them from your wish list and peoples gift lists . Getting more of these is really a waste of planetary resources . <p> For my needs , I like to use really high quality stuff . Once you tried it , going back to Walmart quality or even Bed Bath &amp; Beyond just does n't  feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I would like to eat my soup with a silver spoon and slice my onions with handforged steel . I like French copper pans , Japanese knives , and Swiss pressure cookers . This is less expensive than it sounds . Most likely you only need two good knives which cost about the same as a set of 12 average knives . Similar for pots and pans . For plates , spatulas , cooking spoons , etc . I prefer wood . These wear down but they are carbon neutral so they recycle instantly in the wood stove . Also they do n't  scratch the pots and pans . As for bowls stainless steel last forever . I try to avoid plastics especially black plastic . Plastic in cooking is just wrong and as far as I know black plastic releases some kind of chemical is it is heated too much . Maybe they fixed that by now , but at least with wood there never was a problem in the first place . <p> One problem is that I have some things from a time when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , morality states that these must be worn out first . This is the price we pay for failure to plan . Of course we could throw them out or donate them to thrift stores , but I still feel/think that this is not the most ecologically sensible thing to do , since it just inflates demand of the use and discard consumption cycle . <h> 19 users responded in " How to downsize your kitchen " <p> I do have one issue . There are some items which do n't  get used in a month , but are needed . For example : <p> 1 ) My wife and I do n't  have people over every month , but we do so on occasion ( a few times a year an average of once every 3 months or s ) , so we would typically only use 2 plates in a month . However , when we do have people over , we need plates for them to eat on , so we should probably keep these ( or are you advocating spending money for plates each time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 cutting boards . One small , and one large . We use the small cutting board 95% of the time , and may go a month w/out using it . However , when i cook a large item ( like a turkey ) , I use the large cutting board . I could get rid of the smaller cutting board , but then I would be spending more money by using the large cutting board daily , as it takes more water and soap to clean the large board . I know its not much , but it does add up over time . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Ah yes , but you already know those special cases , so can you just add them to the rest . Here I wanted to figure out what we use on a regular basis without being too draconic about it . I plan to post a list next week about our findings . So far its working quite wel . <p> This is a great post and we 've cited it in our Sunday Review Favorites . Keep up the great blogging ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best quality for your mainstay items , I finally dropped $400 for a VitaMix blender and am loving it . ( I had been considering doing this for the last 2 years and finally did it ) I can make my green shakes so much better , and it has become a nearly daily mainstay in my other cooking too . <p> There is no comparison to a consumer blender , it is a quantum level beyond . 10158 @qwx420158 <p> A piece of cardboard makes an excellent cutting surface if you do n't  have a wood board . For most tasks you can brush it off and reuse it for weeks . <p> I discovered this at my job because we have a lot of cardboard boxes and I needed to cut some veggies in the break room , but I thought I 'd mention it for those who are interested . You could go quite a while without a wooden cutting board if you just had a bunch of cardboard boxes around that you could cut pieces from . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> With a ( cheap ) serrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate , if you do n't  mind sacrificing the point . <p> I 'm starting to downsize my kitchen by passing things on to my children , both starting to set up their kitchens . <p> I remember people chopping vegetables on newspaperis that OK to do ?

I think nowadays even color print may be okay due to soy based inks . <p> here 's a tip : Make sure you tell people who come over to your house that you LIKE not having lots of kitchen gadgets and to please not buy you any for gifts . Otherwise , here 's what happens : Your parents come over for dinner , you serve them wine in coffee cups b/c you do n't  give a shit about that kind of thing , and then for your birthday or xmas , you get a set of wine glasses along with the comment , " I knew you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shit in the bud . <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> I have absolute carloads of stuff primarily because I live in my family home and there are generationss worth of things here . <p> My approach is : keep everythings and keep it organized , and eventually wear it all out . <p> I figure everything will be worn out and have to be replaced in about 200 years . <p> Basically , I do n't  go shopping except for food . Even clothes that I have will probably last the next 5 years without shopping . <p> The other thing is , I fix things . When a handle breaks , I fix it .

In a moment of clarity I decided to use the money for one year trip around the world , instead . Traveled with ONLY what I could fit in carry on luggage . Living with so little for that year and seeing entire ( amazing ) restaurants run from only 2 burners and no counter space radically redefined both my needs AND wants . Choosing that trip over a new kitchen was one of the best decisions of my life .

@@42287511 @2287511/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> My housing story is as follows . During grad school I lived in dorm with shared kitchen and bathroom facilities . This is not a big deal when you sleep from 3am to 10am . I usually had everything for myself . The cost of this was $270/month ( I 'm trying to remember past exchange rates ) for a small but really well designed room with a table , a bed , a sink , and lots of storage . This was 10 minutes of walking from my job . <p> I then moved to the US and got the entire top floor of a duplex . This was my first experience of " supersized American " . It was possible to do sprints in the living room without running into a wall . It was furnished with garden furniture . I met DW shortly thereafter and we started living in each others homes . The cost was $400/month and this was 20 minutes of walking from my job . <p> Since this was a waste , we rented a 1000sqft house half a year later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This cost $660/month divided by 2 . It was an old house which had been standing empty for a couple of years before we moved in , so pretty much everything in that house broke while we lived there but the landlord was quick to fix it . It was 25 minutes of walking from my job . <p> Anyone noticing a commonality ? ( Price and distance ) . <p> Then I got a job in CA . We now had a 1500sqft ( maybe larger ) with 2 bdrms and 1 bthrm and an attached garage . In CA style , we parked the car outside and played hockey in the garage . This also had a landscaped garden which cost a fortune ( several hundred dollars per month in water ) to keep alive in the dry climate . It was $1400/month plus significant utilities . It was also 100 minutes of walking from my job . I got a bike . <p> The trend was broken . <p> I did not really feel I was getting my moneys worth and the landscaped garden was really hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finite CA water supplies , ) . Vacuuming took an hour , etc . Man , almost every room took an hour to clean by itself . There was simply too much maintenance and too little adventure . And I was paying a premium for that ? ! ? After this experience/experiment , I decided that I would never want a McMansion or a house in suburbia within the constrictions of a home owner association . <p> I started thinking about living aboard a boat . It sounded exciting , but DW was n't buying it . I was a little bit worried too . What if the head ( toilet ) was operated wrongly in the middle of the nightthen we would wake up with screaming bilge pumps and step into knee high water ? No , clearly I did not know enough about boats . <p> Tiny houses ( tumbleweed ) sounded exciting . Small housing and the possibility of home ownership while maintaining the flexibility to move around in our professional careers ( moving every 2-3 years gets old as soon as you hit 30 at which point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DW was n't buying it . <p> Instead we bought an RV after some initial preparations and this is where we are now and where we have been for the past year . It is or was 50 minutes of walking ( 15 minutes by bike ) from my job and it cost $280/month/person ( rent+utils ) . <p> Lately , we have been thinking about buying land in New England ( Maine or New Hampshire ) . As shelter is calculated the same way as a latte(*) in terms of how to calculate the true cost of recurring expenses , we could replace our current situation with real estate costing up to $150000 or so . If we buy something ( in cash of course ) less than this amount we would come out ahead . <p> ( * ) I drink coffee , but I would never buy coffee " out " unless in dire circumstances .

Probably does n't  fit too well into an extreme early retirement . <p> Any thoughts on quality of life w/ regards to kids ? Obviously , raising kids is a huge responsibility and a lot of work , but also a hugely rewarding ( maybe the most rewarding ) thing in life . <p> Look forward to your thoughts on that .. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kevin Kids can be had and raised in an RV . Some designs have bunk beds ( ours do n't  ) , which would do away with the hassle of making beds daily . We do not have any plans for kids as I think this would negatively influence our quality of life mostly in terms of loss of time and freedom and the extra work that bringing them up entailed . Also I can think of projects that are more rewarding to me than successfully raising kids . I do n't  mind kids , but I would prefer them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In terms of what kids would cost , it would seem that the consensus ( at least on this site ) is that they cost as much as you can afford . I know that feeding , clothing , and entertaining a few additional mouths would not cost a whole lot for me . Others would " need " to move to certain school districts and " need " to set their kids off with their own room , travel soccer , toys , fashionable clothing , cello lessons , tutors , nannys , daycare centers , and college degrees , etc. and that would obviously cost a lot . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I think its sad people " assume " you have to live in an RV to reach ERE . Obviously all your tricks wo n't work for everyone , like the other Kevin said for me ( one son , another little one on the way ) an RV probably wont work . The whole point is to take your experiences and adapt them depending on your level of extremity . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kevin M My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) with a queen size double bed and two bunk beds , which fits two adults and two teenagers . Admittedly , they ca n't bring much stuff , but it will fit the people , their clothes , and the food . It could be done . Obviously in such a case , I 'd prefer to spend most of my time outside doing things and REALLY consider any purchase . <p> Alex said , <p> @Kevin M- Seeing as it was my comment ( from a previous post ) that prompted this post , I feel compelled to pipe up . I was n't assuming you have to live in a RV . But it does seem like you have get your living expenses to a level that is 3% of your savings ( I believe this is what Jacob said at one point ) . To do that you could live in a RV , boat , cheap house/apartment , but you definitely cant buy into the modern American middle class lifestyle . <p> That 's definitely a good thing in a lot of ways , though there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an extreme lifestyle not for me . For example , well-educated children , cable tv , a house in a safe neighborhood , a happy DW , etc . Count me in for ER , but not ERE . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Alex Yeah , most posts these days are inspired from comments on other posts . The RV thing is an " old " issue though or at least as old as the time we have lived in one . <p> I do n't  think I ever hit a 97% savings rate ( I wish . It would mean needing to work less than a year to become FI ) . I was close to 90% just before I quit my fulltime job , but most of the time while working fulltime I have been around 80% after-tax . These days , I 'm down to a measly 50% . <p> Indeed , the modern American middle class lifestyle is very expensive if everything has to be bought and billed . <p> Incidentally , we have cable TV ( and internet ) , this neighborhood , the RV/mobile home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( helpful and attentive neighbors ) , and while an RV is not a house it has everything a house has except separationactually it has more such as backup battery power , a one week emergency water supply , and about 6 weeks of winter heating ( propane supply ) . My DW is happy ; at least she 's not complaining = and given kids , I would have almost all day to help them with their homework and teach them stuff . <p> I may have imagined you said you need living expenses to be 3% of net worth to retire , if so , sorry , my bad . <p> After your post , I ran a Craigslist search on apartments in my city that are $200-$400 , it came up with some scary places = I do think you 're right though , housing is the single most important expense to manage . <p> Ideally , the easiest thing would probably be to pick up and move someplace cheap . I 'm kind of scared to do that though , b/c it means starting some place where I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of thing . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Alex My DW has a cable TV feed ( directly into the eyeballs like gamma rays ) which keeps her calm = I hope she does n't  read this comment , LOL . <p> Go for 200-400/adult ( income earner ) . If nothing usable is found , bring in more adults . But its likely mainly a location problem . I would not expect to find anything with a foundation around here ( sf bay area ) without at least 3 adults . Hence the RV . <p> For professional reasons , I have had to move constantly every few years for the past decade ( I 'm on my third country and 7th place in the 4th city since 1999 ) , so moving is something I 'm used to . Put in an aggressive effort when you move . Join a club or two instead of hanging back with the spouse . <p> Alex said , <p> @the other Alex : thanks for the episode recommendation , I think I 've found some new idols. 10156 @qwx420156 <p> @Alex sorry if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to the earlier Motley Fool discussion forum he linked to . I 'm with you that I could not personally live in an RV long-term . My wife would not hear of it , and with a son , another kid on the way and 2 75lb dogs , it would be a squeeze . We lived in a 750 sq ft home until this July and that was tight when we were all in the same room . Maybe I 'm just spoiled . <p> TylerOSU said , <p> Funny you post this Today Jacob , my wife and I just moved our new used RV to its lot in BigValleyWoods ( google it , awesome place near Sandy , OR ) . <p> We bought 28foot Kit Companion Road Ranger for $3k . Just big enough for us , but we too are syphoning off a TON of our possesions on Clist , Ebay and Goodwill ( speaking of which have you seen their prices lately ?

Here are 2 of ours to add to the mix . <p> The easiest way for us to do this right now would be to move into our ski condo where the monthly fees $138 include water , heat and hydro a great deal in my opinion . Property taxes are $400/yr for just under 300 sq ft . The condo cost us $78500 cdn , purchased almost 2 yrs ago . <p> If we sell everything , we could easily retire there and find part time work that interests us . <p> Our other option is to move into the cottage full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and costs $900/yr for property taxes and $165/month for everything else . The cottage cost $83000 cdn purchased 6 yrs ago . <p> We are keeping our options open . Right now , we are enjoying pieces of everything we like and depending on how long both of us wishes to work , the timing of when to quit changes . <p> I am already working part time and we are about 3 yrs away from paying off the mortgage on our main home a restored and updated circa 1854 house .

Naturally , if you are still working , the only one that applies is the minimal cleaning needed ! <p> Plus : there is a sense of adventure living in an RV ( or on a boat , which I did prior to meeting my husband ) that you do n't  have in a house . Maybe it is simply because you are living life a little differently than the norm ? <p> We are retired , and not ERE .

Thanks for being a role model , Jacob . I wish there were more like you but then I guess our economy would collapse . Hooray for the worker bees and their endless consumption ! 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Keeping your options open , yet knowing what you can tolerate , provides the best opportunities for cutting housing costs . <p> I 'm not an RV person , so looking for real estate deals offers the fantasy that we could make a lifestyle change . Right now , in western Oregon and SW Washington , there are some sweat equity opportunities for homes with a half acre or more starting at $80k . Some are livable as-is if you do basic clean-up &amp; painting . Most would benefit greatly from an added $10-20k and then you 'd be set . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but property taxes typically run $1000-2400/yr depending on size and vicinity ( Castle Rock , WA , for instance , has higher property taxes than most locations ) . <p> The homes run from 700 sq ft to 1600 sq ft , so many are suitable for small families . <p> @George Thanks , that 's really great ! I have only really used craigslist for searching so far ( very much in the early stages of this quest ) . Any similar sites for WA , NH , and ME would be much appreciated if anyone knows . <p> In my area there are very few trailer parks . There were more a few years ago , but some of them were closed to cash in on the real estate boom . <p> RVs , too , really suck in cold winters . They werent designed to be lived in during cold conditions . They are very energy inefficient and too many water pipes are exposed to the elements . <p> Finally , its hard to have dogs especially large dogs when living in an RV . Some parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be tough on walls and doors and RVs just are built sturdy enough to take the continual abuse . <p> Its a shame there are so few housing options . For me , I did n't  want to live in apartments with their thin walls and lack of outdoor living areas . I bought a townhouse when I moved out my mothers house when I was 22 . A house *is* a huge financial drain . But , for me , I still ca n't think of any viable alternatives . <p> My house is now paid for . I 'm considering building a 400sq ft studio on 40 acres I own and then either sell the house or rent it out . Now that I no longer pay interest on a mortgage , I could pull in $1000+ a month in income renting it . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @mockum Yes , many places have a 25lbs pet limit and equally many have a no pets at all policy . Heatwise , I would n't go much further north than I am now . The RV company Arctic Fox makes insulated RVs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly . We have a basement in our RV , but those that do n't  can put at skirt under/around it . I think our greatest loss is through the single-pane windows though . I bet if I changed those <p> Jacob answers a good question : " Do I have to live in an RV to retire extremely early ? " <p> esummers said , <p> Jacob <p> I 'm 37 and have followed a similar path to you . I have a 6 figure job that I hate and I 've been saving 60% since I was in my mid 20s . Living way below my means . My net worth is about $700k . I 'm ready to leave this corporate nightmare that is killing me day by day . <p> I 'm single and want to live in an RV . My goal is to follow my fly fishing passion through the Rocky mountains , Alaska , Canada , etc . I want something small , but nice . Large enough for 2 people to comfortably live out of . I would prefer a used RV ( I always buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jackie said , <p> I think living in an RV for a number of years , banking &amp; investing the money saved then if one decides to purchase a home down the road it can easily be done with money saved . In addition , there are many parts of this country where you can purchase a foreclosed home for around or under 100K in a decent neighborhood . We purchased our home ( McKinney-suburb of Dallas ) for $110K in a gorgeous neighborhood . Though i never tried living full time in an RV , I did have an RV we traveled in for about 4 years . It was a wonderful experience but i would have to say difficult , on a limited budget , if you have kids ( we have 2 ) . You see a limited budget only allows you to purchase a smaller RV like 21 ' or under . While i would n't mind living with my DH in an RV this size , i would n't even dream of living in cramped quarters with kids . In my travels i noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have kids with them ( kids were grown ) or if they did have kids , their RVs were large-to the size of a mobile home . It is not difficult to envision a couple living full time in an RV since this is very doable and quite easily so . But not so much when kids are in the equation . <p> Jackie said , <p> One more note . I cant understand for the life of me why anyone would want to retire extremely early . My father attempted this in his early 40s only to be bored to tears . He traveled , golfed , fished , read . Later he asked himself-now what ? After 2 years of retirement he had enough and returned to the world of work , full time , in the same career ( Accountant ) . He then worked until his 60s and was much happier retiring at this stage in his life . <p> I am in my mid 40s and have zero desire to retire early . My siblings and friends are all in the late 40s , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few are stuck in corporate rate race as well . <p> I think for many people under 60 its not retirement that they really seek but rather a sabatical ( ie:a year off ) or even a change of scenery or career . <p> Retiring too soon before being financially ready to do so can seriously jeopardize financial security in old age when one is less likely to be able to return to work . <p> I am sorry but having 780K at age of 37 does n't  mean money will last , in the absence of employment , until your 80s or even 90s . When you consider inflation , the rising cost of living etc. that money will be long gone in less than 40 years . <p> Futhermore , as more people lose homes in this country , the cost of staying in an RV park will rise substantially . You see others will seek ways to survive with their families and living in an RV will become much more appealing to the masses that had not considered this lifestyle in the past . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid between $5 &amp; $15 a day at a park ( including water , electric , sewer ) Nowadays you are looking at $20-50 per day depending on the location . I suspect that number will rise as the masses turn to Rving as a means of survival on limited incomes . Unless you are childless and with considerable income in bank and investments , please please please reconsider early retirement . <p> One of my neighbors ( in her 40s ) absolutely HATED her abusive corporate job which gave her 95K income . She had invested and saved for years and decided to change careers to a more " socially concious " one . She now does tours at a natural museum and teaches children about the environment . She absolutely loves it . While it does n't  pay anywhere near what she made before , it pays the bills and certainly made her life and career much more enjoyable . In addition , since she lives frugally , has no debt , and substantial savings/investment ( which she does n't  touch ) she feels safer knowing that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George ( the original one ; - ) said , <p> @Jackie " I am sorry but having 780K at age of 37 does n't mean money will last , in the absence of employment , until your 80s or even 90s .

When I retired from the military at the age of 41 , my spouse and I had enough assets and income to raise our daughter and enjoy our frugal surf-bum lifestyle . Nine years later , life just keeps getting better . However , we noticed that very few military retirees even considered the idea of retiring on their pensions , let alone did the analysis or the preparation . It just seems foreign to our martial culture of service . I asked the veterans on Early-Retirement.org about the military issues of early retirement , and we started building an outline of a book which has just been published . Thanks to Jacobs kind invitation , I 'd like to spread the word here . <p> All royalties will be donated to military charities chosen by the contributors . ( The contributors love to share and teach , but I figured theyd draw the line at enriching me . Besides I 'm financially independent , and I need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wounded Warrior Project and Fisher House , and therell be more to come . <p> The book shows military veterans and their families how to achieve financial independence and enjoy a successful retirement on their terms . There are no tricksERE readers already know how it works . Most service members have learned to handle a somewhat different standard of living than the typical consumerism lifestyle , and theyve also had the significant life experiences to help them sort out their priorities . Veterans and their families have the skills , the self-discipline , and the clarity of values to make ER happen . A military pension ( with cheap health care ) means you can ER as early as your 30s , of course , but even one tour gives service members the tools to ER from a bridge career after the military . <p> This is not a benefits catalog or a career manual . We teach veterans and their families how to leverage their unique military benefits for retirement , not just for another job . The chapters are packed with real-life examples of how others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started over five years ago on Early-Retirement.org where the contributors told their stories , reviewed the chapters , and even helped choose the book covers . Bob Clyatt ( Work Less , Live More ) helped me with the table of contents and the format . The Kaderlis chipped in with frugal lifestyle and perpetual-traveler tips plus a lot of writing and publishing advice . I closely followed Jacobs self-publishing posts . In the end I determined that a traditional distributor is , for now , still the best way to get this book into overseas military exchanges . <p> As the book works its way onto those shelves , I 'd appreciate volunteers willing to step up with donations to libraries on military bases and local communities . I 'm taking care of the Hawaii State Public Library system plus the Pearl Harbor and Schofield base libraries . <p> I 'd love to hear more stories from military veterans and family members .

@@42287521 @2287521/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Sometimes I get emails asking me whether I think joining the military ( with its early pension benefit and paid education , etc. ) is a good idea . Seeing that I do n't  know how to answer this ( I grew up in a country where the military relies on a very small professional core and drafting about 1/3 of all young males ( determined by a lottery ) for 6-24 months ) I asked Nords who wrote The Military Guide to Financial Independence and Retirement for some advice . <p> here 's our credentials : my spouse and I graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy . I retired after 20 more years in the submarine force . She did most of her career in Navy meteorology &amp; oceanography and spent a few more years in the Reserves before retiring . Our daughter is attending college on a Navy ROTC scholarship ( she listened to our USNA stories ) and she 's thinking of joining the submarine force too ( so maybe she did n't  listen to everything we said ) . Collectively we have five decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how the military looks like the road to riches . After you 've read about it for a while , the answer seems so simple : <p> Join the military at age 17 . <p> Endure frugality for a couple decades while exploiting your benefits . <p> Retire at age 37 with an inflation-fighting pension and cheap health care . <p> Youre set for life ! <p> Upon further reflection , the military seems to be the perfect match for extreme early retirement . Whos better than the military at understanding how to optimize resources , save money , develop a disciplined goal-setting approach , foster teamwork , and maximize mission accomplishment ? <p> Yeah , I know , you military veterans are laughing your assets off right now . Straighten up for a second while we try to get the point across to the impressionable young recruits . If extreme early retirement is n't what the military is all about , then why did you guys join up ? If you 're not getting rich , then why would you put up with the martial life ? <p> First we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tables are at this Department of Defense link . The benefits package includes " basic pay " , a housing allowance , a food allowance , and a clothing allowance . Pay is taxed but allowances are tax-free . Additional pay and bonus money is earned for longer obligations , advanced training , deploying to combat zones , or volunteering for duty like submarines or special forces . Some before-tax pay can be sheltered in the Thrift Savings Plan ( the federal version of a 401(k) ) but the military does not match contributions . <p> Military pay varies widely : the most junior enlisted ( E-1 ) earn only $18K/year in basic pay , along with ( mostly ) free food , housing , and uniforms . Depending on housing expenses ( which vary by location ) the total compensation package is $28K-$30K . The first few promotions and pay raises are relatively rapid compared to civilian careers . After six years that junior enlisted has advanced to the E-5 paygrade and is paid $32K/year ( plus the other allowances ) for total compensation of $45K-$50K . <p> Officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $55K/year . After six years , a nuclear-trained engineering officer in the submarine force can volunteer for an additional service obligation that will raise their total compensation to just under $130K/year . <p> Next there 's the benefits . Medical care on active duty is free . Dental insurance is cheap , as is $400K of term life insurance . Disability benefits are included . Vacation is 30 days per year . You get plenty of free training frequently during off-duty hours ! Active-duty benefits and the GI Bill will even pay for you or your family to get a degree . <p> Finally , how does this compensation stack up against a civilian job ? For the first 20 years of service , about the same . The military expends an incredible effort comparing specialties to their equivalent civilian careers , and adjusting pay &amp; bonuses to encourage servicemembers to stay in uniform . For most of the last decade , Congress required the militarys annual pay raises to close the gap between total compensation and the Employment Cost Index . Congress declared victory in 2008 and is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet after 20 years there 's still that righteous retirement , no ? <p> Yes , but the pension only vests at 20 years if you resign at 19 years and 11 months then you 're not eligible . ( But you keep your TSP account . ) You can complete 20 years in the Reserves or National Guard , but that pension only starts paying when you turn 60 . All pensions are calculated on basic pay , not total compensation . For most servicemembers its barely a quarter of the former compensation , and then more is deducted for federal taxes and survivor benefits . Yes , the retirement does have the same inflation-fighting cost-of-living adjustment as Social Security . Yes , Tricare retiree medical insurance is incredibly cheap ( slated to rise to $45/month ) as long as your doctor accepts the reimbursement rate . <p> At retirement the E-5 of the earlier example can reasonably expect to be an E-7 earning $85K/year , which would equate to a gross retirement income of about $24K/year . The submarine officer will get at least one more promotion ( and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERE standards , especially with inflation protection , that 's more than enough . <p> Yet consider these statistics : During most of Americas history , only 1% of the population has been on military duty . Todays total active-duty force is only 1.4 million , and that 's down by nearly 30% since the 1991 Gulf War . ( The services are about to embark on another round of cuts which may bring them as low as 1.2 million . ) Only 15% stay for at least 20 years . The Air Force ( with its well-deserved reputation for comparative " luxury " ) has as many as 30% of its members make it to retirement . In the Marine Corps ( with its own hard-earned reputation ) the fraction is 8% . <p> If the retirement system is so good , then why do five out of six servicemembers quit before 20 ? <p> Let 's look at the first glaring issue : workplace mortality . That pension looks pretty good because a few of your battle buddies are n't  going to be alive to collect it . <p> Next is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force , its a high-stress and physically-active lifestyle . Chronic fatigue is the norm , as are workweeks far in excess of 40 hours . ( No overtime pay , either . ) Combat mortality may be at an all-time low , but that means the wounded warriors have ever-more severe injuries and disabilities . Although servicemembers spend most of their time outside of a combat zone , they still risk their lives every day by training with high-power equipment , explosives , hazardous substances , and hostile environments . Its not as bruising as professional football , but 20 years of daily abuse takes a toll . One mistake or a moment of inattention can wipe out years of safety . <p> Although death and serious injury are relatively rare , there 's still the workplace environment . For example , submariners and aviators have less personal space than convicts in the federal prison system . Soldiers and Marines regularly train in harsh environments . There is very little consideration for work/life balance , let alone for a day off to take care of a sick kid . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform your chain of command wholl care for your kids when ( not " if " ! ) you 're both deployed at the same time . Those caregivers have to sign a statement affirming that theyll do so , or you 'll have to leave the service . <p> If you 're not sure about joining your local police force or being a firefighter , let alone cleaning toilets or doing other humbling jobs , then you probably do n't  want to risk your health in the military either . <p> The military imposes strict rules of professional and personal conduct , some of which would be illegal in any Fortune 500 corporation . Servicemembers are required to maintain ridiculously high standards of appearance and fitness , including hair and body fat . They 're actively discouraged from smoking or chewing tobacco , having tattoos or piercings , riding motorcycles , or drinking alcohol . Hair coloring , nail polish , and makeup are heavily regulated . Drug use is out of the question , even on leave or liberty . Military records are far less private than for civilians . Even military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of command especially in base housing . <p> Maybe those five out of six servicemembers quit because theyd seen enough . Maybe the question should be : Why would you join the military in the first place ? <p> For some its the only way out of a bad life or a dead-end environment . Others did n't  know what they wanted to do , as long as it was n't school or shifts at Taco Bell . In my case it was the irresistible challenge : I could prove myself and be a part of an incredible team . Other veterans joined for the crash course in motivation , commitment , and self-discipline . Youll have far more responsibility in your 20s ( especially in the Marines ) than most civilians will get in their 30s . Even better , you 'll have the training &amp; experience to handle it . Recent college graduates manage million-dollar budgets and make life-or-death decisions before they get their graduate degrees . <p> Above all , the initiative and perseverance have to come from within . " Getting rich " will not fuel those drives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades . You keep going because you 're " making something better of yourself " , and your military skills will also keep you on the track to ER . <p> The best reason to join the military is for yourself . The worst reason to join is for the money . <p> Some time ago , I wrote about the free college education that you can get through ROTC . I think a military career is for some people but not all . Like all careers , there is good and bad things you must contend with . If you like the majority of your career , then it may be a good choice for you . <p> Wes said , <p> Aside from the detailed analysis ; when you 're in the military , they OWN you ! <p> As a current active duty enlisted member in the Navy , I can vouch for this write-up . ERE can be had from this career path , but if you 're doing it for the money , you 'll burn out real quick . The hours are long , the dangers are glaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group I am with can not wait to get back to civilian life , and they 're not even halfway through their first contract . You give up a lot of personal freedom to serve , more than you would working a civilian job . That can be troublesome for a group so focused on being free . <p> I joined for the challenge and experience . I took a pay cut , leaving a white collar cushy job to see what else was out there . Being a little older than the average recruit , I was somewhat better prepared for the not so great parts of military life . Bright-eyed , bushy-tailed , fresh out of high school teenagers get hit pretty hard with the harsh realities of their decision to join . And what are the go-to coping mechanisms for many enlisted members ? Retail therapy and boozing . <p> I 'm not banking on the current retirement pension lasting , so the ERE plan is my hedge . A lot of the steps to an ERE lifestyle are already built in . Cheap housing close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap food , tax advantages . But there are certainly other costs that you 'll pay that do n't  involve money . <p> As discouraging as I 'm being , if I knew what I know now , I would have been at that recruiting station as soon as I received my diploma . I received everything I expected from my enlistment while gaining a lot of perspective of the world around me . But hindsight is 20/20 , and the 18 year old me would n't make the lifestyle choices I make currently . <p> Cristhyano said , <p> Join military , kill other people and fuck other nations for the oil then return home with war trauma . Now you can retire and enjoy your life . <p> Maus said , <p> Even mercenaries have to fight and die for their pay . This post was a great reality check . It strikes me that even one period under military contract would be a sufficient training ground for ERE , but for the skills and accomodation to deprivation/frugality rather than the compensation . Bottom line : I would n't join up unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gene said , <p> " Join military , kill other people and fuck other nations for the oil then return home with war trauma . Now you can retire and enjoy your life . " <p> Very well said . <p> Andre900 said , <p> Military members that joined up after ( about ) 1990 must serve 25 years for a full pension . Moreover , there 's no guarantee that the military will keep someone for 25 years . Often , its " up or out ! " 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I retired from the US Army in September , 2002 , with 30 years of service . It was an excellent experience and I am very proud to have been there . The retirement benefits I have are excellent . Some say Tricare is not too good , but when your wife has a $10,000 operation , and your out of pocket is $50.00 , I cant bring myself to agree with that . The active duty medical care and now the Tricare for Life has provided me well . In the US Army and other services you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way " . If you can lead when you need to , and follow when you need to , then you will do alright . The problem with staying in for the long haul is not the job , not the deployments , not the skills needed , nor anything other than some of the creeps you may have to serve with . You could be under a commander who is a father-figure and would give his life for his people , or you could be under a dictator who is feathering his own nest , or you could be under an airhead who knows next to nothing about the military . This is the luck of the draw . Also you get in with some head cases who can get you in a bad fix by association . Mostly , your going to succeed by your taking care of the person your working for . Senior NCOs and Officers have a comfort zone , and when that zone gets rattled , they immediately look for some of their staff to smooth the waters . You do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then when you need a phone call made , the Officer makes the phone call and the doors fly open for you . Also , if there are any wars , you need to be in them . The folks at DA who review your packet for promotion look for wars on your record , like Desert Storm . After DS/DS if your packet did not have a Kuwait Liberation Medal ( KLM ) in it , your packet was going back in the cardboard box . If you had the KLM your getting the next rank . My buddy at DA told me the packets are prescreened , and the ones without the war and medals are boxed and shipped back declined . Now we have the Afgan and Iraq wars so there is now more to go around . That makes the promotions more readily available . As I said the secret is to pull the next higher rank out of the mud . Then that higher rank will pull you along with them every time . The military does not provide all of my retirement funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have other funds coming in through investments and partners . Things change often in the military so I have now been out nearly ten years and I am not the most up to date on how it is today . I am so very pleased with my service and benefits . I would recommend it to any who have the inclination to go the route . It is not easy , no , but if you are so inclined , it is great . <p> dotcomvet said , <p> There 's also the method of being a civilian contractor , working 4-5 years , and returning home to ERE . <p> A friend of a friend is doing it . <p> anonymous said , <p> how many 20+ year military ERE ? I suspect most of them develop a puritan work ethic and keep on working post military . <p> what 's the divorce rate for military ? It seems like it would be hard on families . Divorce and child support will tank any ERE dreams . <p> what 's the injury rate for military ? Anything from a mild knee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot more difficult . <p> Some gigs might be relatively easy , such as Navy or Air Force , but being a ground pounder in a war theater involves plenty of risk . Somebody has to drive the fuel trucks through hostile territory , or run point on patrol . <p> In any case , there is probably some minority that run the gauntlet and manage to military ERE . Statistically , its probably better odds than the private sector , where you do n't  get health care , and savings can get eaten by wall street . Perhaps being a school teacher or other civie government functionary is a reliable approach . <p> Andre900 said , <p> Good post HS . My best friend from childhood enlisted in the Navy in 1983 . ( The Air Force recruiter was out to lunch , so he wondered down the hall to the Navy guy . ) He served 22 years . The major complaint he had was going out to sea .

He s 47 years old and has been retired from the Navy for six years . The Navy worked out very well for him , though it was n't easy by any stretch . <p> Liz Tee said , <p> Its often a love-it-or-hate-it life . Divorce rate is high , even after retirement . The ex ( OCS/submariner ) and I were married for 24 years when he retired and we divorced three years later . <p> It takes a personality that can thrive in a chain of command . Leadership is the key to advancement . People who plan to coast wont get far . And like already mentioned , you do n't  always get to choose to stay . <p> Another consideration is the US Coast Guard . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its a small force of dedicated folks . <p> As for retirement pay , it stops when the service member dies so widows will need a backup , and the plan offered by the service is rarely the best choice . <p> If that ends up happening , it will totally change the entire equation . <p> I cant speak to any of the other branches , but from my experience in the Coast Guard , " They 're actively discouraged from smoking or chewing tobacco , having tattoos or piercings , riding motorcycles , or drinking alcohol . " is only true in the most superficial sense . Its about equivalent to when you head out and someone says " be safe " . There is zero enforcement of any of that . Yes , they do make you stay fit , but I see that as a plus compared to the civilian world , not a minus . In the Coast Guard there is much less of the " wear and tear " type activities endured by the Army or Marines . And once you advance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Best of all , you spend your time saving lives , preventing and cleaning up pollution , and intercepting drug cartels and human traffickers , instead of shooting at ( and being shot at by ) foreigners for purely political reasons . <p> Bakari said , <p> " It strikes me that even one period under military contract would be a sufficient training ground for ERE , but for the skills and accomodation to deprivation/frugality rather than the compensation . " <p> Actually , the people Ive met in the Coast Guard have been the most consumerist Ive ever met . Once they come back from sea , with a big built up check , they blow the whole thing , like they are trying to make up for lost time . I work with people who make the same as I do who own boats , RVs ( and not to live in ! ) , motorcycles , and who buy a new car every 2 years . Almost everyone has an iPhone or Android .

But they do n't  teach you to be frugal any more than going on a weekend camping trip teaches you to be frugal. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I think grad school is a better training ground .

@@42287524 @2287524/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Occasionally people protest that if everybody retired early , the consumer economy would collapse(*) . Similarly , I imagine the PR people working for Nike receiving correspondence that if everybody went into the shoe industry , the world would quickly find itself covered in shoes . Obviously , you see the " problem ! " <p> However , for the sake of the argument let 's assume that everybody really did decide to stop consuming . What would happen to the economy ? <p> It is important to realize that a consumer economy in which people go to work in order to buy stuff is not the only form of economy . It is just the current one . <p> For example , its now been some 40 years since mankind set foot on the moon . No astronaut has visited the moon in my lifetime . As a kid I used to read books about space from the 1960s and 1970s depicting lunar colonies , Mars colonies , interplanetary space travel and even interstellar space travel . None of this has come to pass . Priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttle program . Humanitys vision has turned inward . These days were more concerned about whether some 13 year old sings well enough to win American Idol and what data rate we get on our phonethis determining the speed by which we can share pictures of random cats . <p> The story of NASA in many ways resemble my space dreams in reverse . Weve gone from buying passage on other countries rocket launches , to having a space shuttle , to having a space station , to sending probes to other planets , to landing men on the moon . Hat tip to wherever I saw that observation . <p> Space exploration aside , the consumer economy simply reflects ONE choice among many of what humanity as a species has chosen to focus on . What an interesting legacy . In particular , when archeologists dig through the landfill strata associated with the 20th and 21st century , theyll find our pottery shardsit so happens to be that the biggest and most solid ceramic products we 've made in abundance are toilet bowls . That humans once went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astronauts . Jason and the Argonauts . <p> But for now , a consumer economy is where its at . <p> PS : If you 're interested in a trying to understand humanity within the context of the entire universe as an evolving story , I highly recommend The Universe Story . <h> 18 users responded in " Alternatives to a consumer economy and the point of humanity " <p> Its almost ridiculous to argue with the " what if everybody " argument , simply because its so flawed . What if everybody had no kids like you , Jacob ? Human population would go extinct ! You are evil ! ( sarcasm ) <p> Alternatively , what if everyone in the world participated in the consumerist culture . And by everyone , I mean EVERYONE . Including our friends in Africa and the middle east . The earth simply lacks the ability to sustain a global population of Nike wearing , SUV driving , plastic toy playing ( and throwing away ) culture . But the people challenging you with the " what if " argument fail to ask themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of limited resources ) . <p> There are plenty of successful and happy cultures that are not consumer based , who live in a sustainable environment . I think we can learn from the . <p> ( I 'm reading Radical Simplicity right now , so I 'll admit I 'm slightly more passionate about this than usual ) <p> A fellow I follow on G+ posted a link to this post . I read the first bit and immediately ridiculed " invest 75% of net " assuming you were talking about take-home of $45K or more . <p> Before I realized that you were talking good sense I wrote this as a p.s. in my comment to my friends post : " I created a " voluntary simplicity " scheme for myself in the late 70s . Owned a big old house / raised 5 kids yada-yada nobody would believe what I got by on . But my aim was n't to become wealthy : my aim was to reduce my footprint and un-slave myself .

How are we going to adjust the economy itself ? I 'm not sure " bit by bit " makes sense to me. = <p> cheers ben <p> Christine said , <p> Hey Jacob . Interesting post . I 'm interested in learning more about other ways to order economies . It seems only logical that we cant continue focusing on consumer goods but I have to admit , I have n't thought a lot about how else an economy could be structured or how people could be employed . <p> I get enthused about ideas like those expressed in this post.choosing a different kind of economy . I think- " How Great would that be ! " then I go out into the world and interact with the other denizens of the humanity in my neck of the woods and I think there 's no way these people will change . I changed . But then I 've always felt a wrong-ness about the way things aresince I can remember .

With the productivity available today the alternative is clear , spend time on personal development . Did you know the US produces MORE manufactured goods that ever before , yet with 8 million fewer employed in manufacturing so much for the " death " of manufacturing . The productivity gains in aerospace since I 've been in the business are astounding , so its no surprise that one can live very well today with a fraction of the labor of previous years . <p> Once I get to FI , I 'll be able to spend my time on things I WANT to do , instead of on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving 50% of post tax at this point ) . As it is , I could work 40-50% time and be very comfortable . <p> As far as NASA and the rest of the government sponsored space program : 95% of it is a huge sinkhole . Nothing more than trillions pissed away for ego , plain and simple . On the national scale , its the equivalent of having a fancy sports car or a Mc Mansion loaded with fancy furniture nice for show , but overpriced and relatively useless in any practical sense . NASA was born and bred to show the commies who was better at tech , and to help develop technology for flinging nukes half way around the world . All it knows is how to spend vast sums for dubious ends . <p> The space shuttle is the worst piece of engineering junk in space flight . Look at its record : Fantastically expensive ( over a billion per launch ) with a horrible record of reliability , having destroyed 1/2 the original fleet of 4 ( Enterprise does n't  count as it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for what ? Hey , let 's go to the space station , which was built for no other reason that to give the shuttle some place to go . Please Jacob do n't  yearn for the Shuttle program . Quietly celebrate the demise of this destructive , wasteful program . <p> The economies are gradually switching over to System D economies , stores and startups that are under the table and pay in cash and do n't  pay taxes . Its a perfect gig if you are disablied and not allowed to work officially . Over 1.6 Billion workers are apart of this economy and growing . Some are taking advantage of Americas Government Tax Payers by particapting in this system . Its even easier with the internet . <p> Although I decry the foolishness of our current consumer society as much as the next guy ( unless the next guy is Jacob ) , I would rather see our culture waste its money on cell phone upgrades than on worthless showoff nationalist crap like moon exploration . Seems to me that that 's the national/social equivalent of the narcissism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  do anything . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Gerard I agree that the space race was more a case of nationalistic cold war vanity/demonstrating of nuclear launch capacity than anything else . However , I think also for those who actually went into space it seeing the Earth without artificial borders gave an entirely new understanding of the ridiculousness of our petty intraplanet disputes . If more people could have this experience , maybe humankind would n't be so self-destructive . More politicians and more poets need to go to space . <p> Reader said , <p> What many people are n't  aware is that seemingly useless endeavors like the space race are actually beneficial . Cellphones , self-inflated life rafts , fire-resistant fabrics and hundreds of other inventions we take for granted today would never have been possible without the space race . <p> Its not exploration or research if you already know what you 're going to get in the end . <p> Good to see a few voices here ( other than mine ) pointing to the obvious nationalistic agenda of the space age which was just a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time ! I was just as sucked into the space age message as you were while growing up , so I kind of understand where this post comes from ! <p> @Jacob , I see in your response that you 've given another spin on the " poet angle " that I made on another space post(*) . I wrote back then , and I still maintain , that if travelling all over the World has n't  necessarily opened peoples mind to accepting diversity and fragility , I do n't  expect travel to space to accomplish much ! Sorry , but we are simply condemned to repeat mistakes of the past , nothing else ! Send a couple of poets , sure ! They will come back and write poems about a ) how the " moon light on Hainan " was the best b ) the " gunkholers " of Chesapeake looked the " most resilient " from space . c ) etc ! <p> Lately , I have taken an extremely dim view of Humanity ( and I blame it on keeping a lot of your company for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) how do I link to specific comments on ERE Blog ? <p> @Reader , Just touching upon one point for brevity here : <p> People were travelling on steamliners with need for lifeboats ( rigid/inflatable ) even before there was space travel , and we already had torpedoes ( compressed gas ) , so it was definitely a matter of putting the two together ( and there is evidence that they did get that self-inflating rafts business figured out by WW-II itself ) . <p> I find this notion of falling back on scrap meal achievements from the White Elephant Space programme very disagreeable Remember the ballpoint vs. pencil anecdote about the Yank and Russki space programme ? <p> &amp;#8212 &amp;#8212 &amp;#8212 <p> To Hell with uberexpensive , jingoistic space age ( which it still is , except it is now India vs . China ) , gizmotastic vapourware , covering the Sahara with PV Panels , mining the Pacific for Uranium . <p> new challenges : finding a way to support a society without mass employment , and ultimately finding something to succeed the consumer society . Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to <p> Indeed , this is largely a non-interesting hypothetical . But since it seems to bother people : <p> Its important to remember that , absurd as the overconsumption , overwork economy is , those of us with high savings rates benefit from it . The returns you get on your savings exist because , effectively , you own productive assets ( whether through stocks , bonds , or whatever ) . Part of what makes those assets productive is the labor that runs them . If everyone works less , your productive assets produce less . Less production means less income for you and for everyone , which means less ability to fund projects that you want ( like sending a man to the moon , which ultimately is just another form of consumption ) . <p> There are a lot of moving parts here , which is why people interested in this should pick up a first-year graduate economics textbook to think through some simple models . I suspect that in the end , if everyone decided to work less , we could all still retire before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to be less , well , extreme . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287525 @2287525/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I have started to use baking soda to brush my teeth ( again ) . I do n't  do this to save money on toothpaste , which is cheap and often free thanks to the lunacy of coupon clipping ( this is the only place where we do this ) . Rather , I do it to save money on the dentist , who is evil and sadistic . For someone who is contemplating skipping dental insurance , this becomes a concern . <p> Baking soda raises the pH ( I knew that ) while bacteria in the mouth creates acid ( low pH ) as a byproduct ( I knew that ) which destroys the enamel ( I knew that too ) . I just did not put those things together and thought that the main reason for including the baking soda was for its abrasive effect . In addition baking soda causes a lot of saliva which is why you can just put the powder on the toothbrush and start brushing . This saliva further helps the acid disposal process . <p> DIY toothpaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of salt , baking soda , and high proof alcohol . The rest is just taste and advertising . Speaking of which ; did you know that Listerine was originally invented to cure athletes foot ? Instead it was turned into a mouthwash . Nothing wrong with that . Just good business practice . <p> Of course the main action is mechanical , so you could brush your teeth without any toothpaste whatsoever , and I suppose really frugal people chew on a stick . In that case , just keep your toothbrush in the sun to fry the bacteria with free UV radiation ( not behind glass , glass has sun factor 40+ and stops most UV ) . Alternatively , if you 're a consumer , you just buy one of those electric toothpaste where you do n't  have to move your hand and UV light so you do n't  have to walk all the way over to the window to put the toothbrush down , but instead have to work a job to pay for it . Also the consumer product has the side effect of stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soda toothpaste = I like the way you talked about the solar UV things and putting the toothbrush in the sun . I never thought about putting the toothbrush in sunlight ( and no I do n't  own a uv light thing for my toothbrush ) . <p> Gamma said , <p> I also use baking soda to brush my teeth . It leaves my mouth feeling fresher than 95% of the toothpastes on the market . <p> My only concern " and one that I have n't been able to find an answer to yet " is that I 'm supposed to eliminate salt due to high blood pressure and baking soda is sodium , correct ? <p> DJ said , <p> I 'm a dentist . I think you are completely right about not needing toothpaste . Mechanical cleaning is what 's important . Flossing is far more important than brushing . Do them both , but if you only did one thing for your teeth , it should be flossing . <p> A lot of " competing " brands of toothpaste are made by the same companies . The strategy seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you are more likely to pick one that is made by that company . <p> Wow , how can one go wrong with a recommendation by a dentistflossing is one thing you should do for your teeth . <p> DJ said , <p> Dental plaque is mostly made up of anaerobic bacteria . Flossing breaks up the plaque and allows oxygen in so it can kill the anaerobes . <p> I 'm probably telling you more than you wanted to know .

I went to dental school 20 years ago . Many of the continueing eduaction classes I have taken since then have dealt with childrens dentistry rather than adults . Adults are so borring <p> If my memory is correct , the plaque needs more than 24 hours to get to the point where its damaging to your periodontal health .

A nice thing about this blog is having experts commenting . A resident dentist is a pure bonus ! I have been one who visits the dentist office on the every six months basis for cleanings . Being retired military , I have excellent dental insurance at almost no cost , so I " use " it freely and copiously . I consider my personal dentist outstanding , and I sincerely hope I am long gone before he retires . If you might comment on something for me , I will ask a question . My dentist has two hygienists on staff . Each 6 months I get one or the other of them for my cleaning . Their methods are totally different , although equally effective it seems . One uses a high speed water jet , and a high speed polisher . The other uses the older method of " hunt and scrape " . Both measure every other visit for bone loss .

I came to the opposite conclusion ( but I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of the toothbrush on your gums ( try it , you can put much more pressure without injuring yourself ) . Its like motor oil in a motor .

Can anyone tell me whether it produces some kind of foam as well ( softening the harshness from brushing , like toothpaste ) ? 10150 @qwx420150 <p> Okay , I 've tried it ( baking soda as toothpaste ) and I do n't  like its abrasive effect , similar to " whitening " toothpaste ( which I dislike for the same reason ) . The best toothpaste IMHO is something that foams in your mouth ( for the " motor oil " effect mentioned above ) , and no crap in it ( fluor , abrasives those are for people that brush once every fifteen weeks ) . <p> here 's my advice on teeth brushing . I 'm not an expert , although I 'm well-informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  copy their advice blindly . I found that I can have caries-free , smooth teeth ( smooth , when I run my tongue over them ) by using a toothbrush with many , dense , soft hairs ; a non-abrasive toothpaste ; a soft brushing technique ( massaging rather than scraping your gum ) ; flossing ( as the brush does n't  get to the most critical places ) . Finding a good brush is the hardest part , since the new fashion seems to be few stiff brush hairs ( poorly cleans teeth IMHO , pushes back your gum making your teeth sensitive to cold , but makes you consume more toothpaste which means $$ for the manufacturer ) . The only good ones I know are the Sensodyne Search 3.5 ( not manufactured anymore except in the UK , AFAIK ) and the newer Sensodyne " ultra soft " . Theyre good because they have the features I mentioned above , unlike any other brush . <p> Dancedancekj said , <p> As a younger dentist ( still in dental school actually ! ) I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually the ones that do n't  have good oral hygiene in the first place . There are exceptions of course , but taking care of your teeth is so simple and effective that it does n't  make sense not to do it .

I 've recently been brushing with mainly water and then I use baking soda on my tongue , and brush with highly diluted baking soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth have been much better . The glycerine in toothpaste adheres to the enamel and prevents re-mineralization not to mention the chemicals in toothpaste like SLS and fluoride . Yes fluoride is a chemical .

If you cant do that without blowing your Achilles tendon , your saddle is too low . Of course you will never lock out your knees when actually riding . This is why the heel should be below . Under normal riding conditions , your foot stays more of less parallel to the ground . This will set your saddle position at approximately the correct height . You an try to adjust it by a few millimeters up or down to find something that works better for you . <p> Once you got that fixed , let 's look at simple riding technique . Many only apply force on the down stroke . This may apply even to folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushing leg not only acts to push the pedal down and the bike forward , which is good , it also must work to lift the " lazy " leg , which is bad ! You will find you can increase your speed with little effort if you " take some weight off " the pedal on the pedal which is going up . <p> Most modern bikes comes with tons of gears because tons of gears sell . You got to be aware of " cross-gearing " . Cross-gearing happens when the chain is not running straight . You may think you have 21 gears if you have 3 rings in front and 7 cogs in the rear , but effectively you do n't  . The gear run and shift best if the chain runs more or less straight . In fact a single-speed bike will have a perfect straight chain line which is completely silent and close to 100% efficient . For multiple gears , this means that if you use the lare chain ring in front , you should be on the smaller cogs in the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be on the middle cogs . And for the small chain ring , you should be on the largest cogs . Effectively , you have far fewer gears than 3+7=21 . <p> Few people maintain their bikes . As a result the chain starts squeaking after a few months . Now , some people just spray it with WD40 Do not under any circumstance use WD40 on your bike ! ( Theres only one place on a bike where you can do that : Removing handlebars ! ) . You need to get a cyclone chain cleaner , some citrus cleaner and some chain oil . ( Link to amazon for the one I use . Note , I use Park Tools because a ) They have a wonderful book which tells you exactly which tools to get ; and b ) Because of their reputation , you can easily buy and sell the tools used . ) You can get the citrus cleaner and the chain oil at your local bike shop . Go with Park Tools generic lube or get some triflow . First clean the chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cyclone ( or a similar gadget from another tool supplier ) . If you 're used to using a brush to clean the chain , you 'll be amazed how well the chain cleaner works . Wipe the chain off with a rag . Now , put 1 drop of chain oil at the pin on each side for each link . Yeah , I know ; takes 10 minutes or so , but just do it . It may be easy to squirt oil all over the chain , but that just means itll collect too much dirt and you 'll have to clean it again next week . Clean the chain once a month . Experts may wish to use different chain oils depending on whether they ride in a dry or a wet environment . I have n't really gotten to that stage yet . <p> Also , just like keeping your tires properly inflated will save gasoline , keeping the tires properly inflated will save energy . On a bicycle , running underinflated will be felt directly . It is perhaps no surprise that running underinflated on your bike will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news is that new tires will be substantially cheaper . Maybe $25 instead of $250-$500 . <p> The post script concerns the rider . Frankly , most modern people are in a terrible physical shape . Yet many expect to be able to get on a bike and start a daily 6 mile commute immediately . Or they figure they can easily ride 20 miles . This is true to a point . You can do that to a point similar to how most recreational 5k runners can run a marathon without preparation . Except ! They will be in ( tendon/joint ) pain for days after . <p> A good gauge for what you can expect on a bicycle is to multiply the distance you are able to run by 4 . If you can run two miles a day , you have the cardiovascular work capacity to bike 8 miles a day without overtraining ( you get tired and cranky ) . If you can do a 4 mile run without complications , it will not be a big deal to ride 20 miles . <p> Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendons are involved . What I 'm getting at is the fitness level . Most people have a good idea of their fitness level when it comes to running . Few seem to have the same intuitive understanding when it comes to riding . Besides , endurance and stamina are not the same thing ! <p> Hence : Start slow ! Do n't  add more than 10% to your last longest ride when going longer . Do n't  add more than 10% to your weekly mileage . If you follow this simply rule , you 'll be fine . <p> * Get a luggage carrier with bags . So much more comfortable than cycling with a bag on your back <p> * Always take a tire repairkit. takes about 20 minutes to repair a tire and not hard at all . Do n't  forget to bring a small tire pump <p> * Take some standard tools that fit your bike for immediate repairs . Most things can be fixed with only 2-3 tools <p> Have fun = <p> Brad said , <p> Thanks for sharing this . I 'd also be interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any alternatives to purchasing a chain cleaner ? Is my rag and degreaser method not sufficient ? <p> Holly said , <p> I 'll take this opportunity to " de-lurk " and ask a question . <p> I 'm not very athletic , but I bought an old-fashioned coaster bike ( an early 70s Ross ) at a yard sale for $10 . With help from the internet I managed to replace the inner tubes and raise the seat . ( Ill try oiling the chain next not knowing any better I sprayed it with WD40 ) . I now keep it at work to use for short errands . However , it has mountain bike tires on it and is very hard to pedal on the street surface . My question : Is it worth replacing the tires or should I save up for a better bike ? ( I do n't  think I 'll ever use it more than for short distances . ) <p> hatetowaste said , <p> good suggestions ! I 'm a woman in my fifties , have been biking for recreation and fitness for about 10 year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . ( live in a 4 season area , snows too heavily in winter ) I found once I got used to being in the seat for long periods ( bike shorts a necessity ) , I could go for very long periods . I can easily bike 25 miles , and do 60 but tired and cranky ! = I couldnt run for even a mile ! I do walk about 4 or more miles a day though . Biking is fun , do n't  give up too soon ! Most people could do more than they think , especially using some of the tips in the article . <p> there was a time i had a mountain bike and she and i had the best relationship ever between a man and a machine . That was until she was decommissioned . I would like to get a new one but the thing is that i work from home and sometime a few minutes walk away so getting one is out of the question for now . I liked the fitness i had when i was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ill definitely take these under advisement . The only one I knew about was the tires being inflated , and Ive definitely felt the difference there . Although I have heard that people will let some air out of their tires and race across the desert . I wonder what kind of damage that will do ? <p> Karine said , <p> I live in Richmond Ca , and I go to Contra Costa Community College for yoga and Salsa classes . I 'd really like to do that using my bike instead of car , but I 'm afraid of being run over . Are you ever worried about it ? Being a on bike seems like a very vulnerable position . <p> S said , <p> Karine , when I first started riding it was *very* scary to ride in the street with cars which I think is a big obstacle for many people to not riding their bikes more . What helped me was finding a local group of cyclists who did a lot of social rides . Critical Mass can be a good place to meet people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are n't  so good for beginners . I got used to riding on the street and felt much safer in a group so I could work my way up to riding in the street solo . After that I started commuting 5 miles to work daily for 4 years and havent gotten in a wreck with cars despite living in a car-centered city ( Atlanta ) . That said , some roads still scare me . I do n't  ride on hilly 6 lane roads in the suburbs . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Brad Do you get all the dirt off the chain with the rag ? The cyclone will do that . An alternative version is to take the chain off and soak it in citrus cleaner . Then use a hard brush . <p> @Holly Unless you want to take a razor blade to all the knobs on the tire , I 'd just buy some slicks for it . You can look for sales at nashbar.com . The reason for that is that you say you ride short distances . <p> @Izzy The reason mountain bikers let air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tires out faster . It also makes them susceptible to snakebites ( when you run over a rock and the tube gets pinches between the rim and the rocklooks like a snake bite ) . <p> @Karina Yes I am . I avoid overpasses and other " narrow " spots with fast traffic . I use google satellite . I 'd rather take a 1 mile detour than risk an overpass . It is often possible to find a parallel side road to the main road that one would take by car . <p> The main challenge is light crosses . Good riders can outaccelerate cars and get through the cross before the cars get through . Slow riders will find themselves moving after the cars which is more hairy . <p> I was going to write a post about the two things a lot of bike riders do wrong . You mentioned onethe saddle height . I think a lot of people have a too low saddle b/c they feel safer if their feet can touch the ground , but they should n't be able to ( on a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is designed with the crank slightly forward so that I can touch the ground and still get full extension when I pedal . I was getting pissed off with having to dismount every time I stopped , and I was also sometimes wobbly getting started . I cant do a track stand , and I refuse to do those stupid things I see some bike riders doing , like making donuts in the intersection to avoid dismounting . I love having a bike made so that I can touch the ground . Electra Bike Company makes them ( the Townie ) and recently Trek got into it with their Pure model . <p> The other mistake I see riders make , which you did n't  mention was having the gear too high . Pedaling cadence should be quite brisk . The rider should feel able to keep going indefinitely ( aerobic ) . If the thighs are always burning ( anaerobic ) , the gear is too high . I see so many people traveling along a flat road and they are pedaling so slowly and I can tell its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting a good workout by making their muscles burn , but from everything I 've read from the experts , the rider is supposed to be pedaling fairly quickly . It shouldnt feel hard . <p> Jeremy said , <p> How fragile is the cycle chain cleaner ? <p> A few Amazon reviews talking about them falling apart . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @veganprimate First let 's define high RPM. 70 is considered low . 110 is pretty high . Beginners may be as low as 50-60 . Recommended is 90 . I usually ride around 80 . It is very individual though . Higher is n't necessarily better . The reason higher rpms are recommended is that the for a good long distance rider , the aerobic limit is higher than the stamina of the joints . They do n't  do higher rpms because it is easier . It is n't . Its more work , but there 's less wear and tear on the joints . Whether you run aerobic or anaerobic has more to do with how fast you 're going ( your power output ) . It is certainly possible to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fused plastic . Mine seems pretty solid . <p> skunk1980 said , <p> What is the difference between endurance and stamina ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @skunk1980 Stamina is a measure for how long various body parts last . When you reach the limit of your stamina , you typically have to abandon . Endurance is roughly how long you can go without a break . <p> In terms of athletic focus : **44;382;TOOLONG . Marathon runners have endurance . Ultramarathoners have stamina . <p> You can extend your endurance simply by slowing down . Not so with stamina . It is entirely possible to abandon a long race 5% from the finish line due to lacking stamina . <p> Check out this back issue of Bicycle Quarterly ( periodical for commuting type of cycling ) which suggests inflating tires to optimum levels , and not necessarily as high as tire pressure as possible , to optimize both comfort and rolling resistance . <p> Seat hight really s$%ts me when I see people cycling . I feel like yelling at them " ITLL BE EASIER IF YOU PUT THE SEAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is people who do n't  get out of the saddle ! Its pretty easy to go up hills and you do n't  need a bazillion ! gears if you just get out of the saddle . <p> " Whether you run aerobic or anaerobic has more to do with how fast you 're going ( your power output ) . It is certainly possible to run anaerobic at high rpm . " <p> I would say its not necessarily how fast one is going , but ones anaerobic threshold . Someone in really poor shape can reach anaerobic threshold on a flat road in the lowest gear ( so some thigh burning may be unavoidable ) . But as ones aerobic fitness increases , one could increase the gears and still be running aerobically . <p> My understanding is that newbies believe they should feel a burn as proof that they are getting a workout , but its not good for their knees . They can increase the gears as they get fitter , but the gear should always be low enough that they stay in the aerobic zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are geared much too high for all but racers . Also , three chainrings and the associated front shifter are rarely needed . That is particularly true for casual cyclists living in areas with few hills . <p> Unfortunately the vast majority of bikes sold in bike shops either hav 21-27 gears ( including duplicates ) . The 3-speed internally geared bikes are n't  really much of an improvent since the gears are too widely spaced and and are impossible for the average personn to repair if they have problems . <p> Some bike shops are starting to stock 7 or 8 gear ( no triple on the front ) bikes with fenders and racks for commuters which would also be appropriate for casual bike path cyclists . If you 're just starting out they would be worth a look . <p> The beginner would be wise to avoid mountain bikes unless he/she is actually going to use it for riding off road . The bars are usually too low and knobby tires are not needed on pavement . <p> Thanks for the post . Great to see people getting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used where possible graphite type lubricants in a very light oil/solvent. dries quickly , and if the chain is dry-ish ( as opposed to coated in sticky oil ) it does n't  catch sand and dirt , and lasts ages . need to apply very little after riding in the rain is about all . ( also very lightweight so it lives in the bag under the saddle with the tyre levers and spare tube ! ! <p> Keep biking all . Cheap , healthy , and easy on the joints ! <p> Dave said , <p> Transmission fluid for cars works well for chain lube , it does n't  collect the dirt and dust that regular motor oil will . <p> Excellent advice , I always like to get my hands dirty from time to time and its very rewarding to work on something that 's real as opposed working with spreadsheets and emails . The tip on saddle really helped me and I 've optimized my bike so will enjoy riding it for longer . Thanks for the great information Jacob . <p> Ive been doing bike commuting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the saddle tip ! <p> Maybe this is a dumb question , but why is using WD-40 bad ? I 've done that on my bike the entire time I 've owned it ( 14 years ) . That said , the derailleur is definitely developing some issues that I need to figure out . <p> Finally , any tips on proper maintenance in snowy climates ? My ride is the bike equivalent of a beater . I 'm hoping to have some $ in a year or so to buy a quality road bike and save this one for the 4-5 months of the year where salt eats at everything . <p> Should I be washing the bike after each ride or will proper lubrication protect it enough from salt ? <p> Did some more research on WD-40 and now understand why its not great for bike chains . Ordered some TriFlow and some Simple Green degreaser . Will be interesting to see if that helps my riding out its hard enough biking in the winter ! <p> Patrick said , <p> Where did you get that info about setting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the advice , then perhaps that should be with the HEEL of the foot on the pedal , for set-up purposes only . <p> I have seen advise too , that the crank should not be strictly vertical , but rather following the line of the seat tube . <p> People may wish to experiment . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Patrick Trial and error from setting up bikes for many people ( and riding myself for many years ) . I advise NOT to lock out the leg while actually pedaling . The lock out is only used during setup . The reason is that the ankle is not parallel to the ground while riding . <p> Not sure what you mean by the crank being vertical ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @David The more you can do to clean away the salt the better . It does n't  take long for salt water to rust up the drive train . At the minimum I would wipe away the water after each ride . Then clean and oil the chain weekly . Also , if sand/grit is going to be less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer where it attracts dust . <p> I think in principle , you could also hose the drive train down with WD40 , but you 'd have to keep doing it . The purpose of WD40 is to remove water not to lubricate or protect . <p> Yeah , I 'll have to break down and do some more preventative maintenance after each ride then . Its an old bike but it still works quite well even though it wo n't do if I get into serious road racing/endurance ( its a mountain bike with very fat tires ) . I do n't  want to run it into the ground because Im lazy . <p> Sucks a bit because biking is already so much slower than using a car , but Ive gone from biking due to financial necessity to actually enjoying it in two months ( despite almost all of my rides being below freezing , and occasionally below zero F ) . <p> Interesting to read your idea that the ball of the foot be placed on the pedal . It seems to me that placing the heel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm always open to reading other points of view . <p> Enjoy your blog , thanks again ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Patrick The method is just a rough guideline . After getting the saddle height more or less correct , I suggest shifting it up or down by a few milimeters and trying that out for a few days to see if it feels better or worse . My method will get you in the ball-park though . <p> Posted this in the fitness journal of the forums , but I adjusted my saddle height with Jacobs tip and shaved 30 seconds a mile off of my 20 mile training loop ( from 6:00 to 5:30 ) . My stamina still needs to improve , but I can feel the wider torque band with the higher saddle position . <p> I can probably go 10-15mm higher but its hard messing with your center of gravity in the winter when grip is less than optimal . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @thegoblinchief If you want to go faster , start incorporating intervals in your ride . Whenever you pass a milepost or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but increase your pedaling to 90rpm+ for a minute or so . Then switch back . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287533 @2287533/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I submit that intrinsic motivation is hugely important for a successful early retirement . If you have somehow lost your intrinsic motivation , retiring early may lead to a boring if not directly miserable life . What is intrinsic motivation ? <p> There are essentially four cognitive processes : motivation , willpower , thinking , and feeling . <p> Motivation and willpower are the two cognitive process that get things done . The other two significant cognitive process are thinking and feeling . In many cases advertising and adopting other peoples beliefs uncritically have dulled peoples ability to think . Indeed , most people do n't  think , but this essay is mainly about motivation which is more important for early retirement than the ability to think . <p> Motivation is the initial spark that starts a course of action . Will or willpower is what keeps the action going until a result is obtained . <p> Motivation can be divided into intrinsic motivation ( from yourself ) and extrinsic motivation ( from other people ) . This indicates the source of the motivation . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external reward like money , fear of punishment , social approval , etc . <p> Quick check : If nobody was " looking " and your actions had no consequences for you whatsoever , would you still do it ? In that case , you 're internally motivated . ( Stop looking for loopholes in the example . ) <p> It seems to me that children have lots of intrinsic motivation . Tell them to go and play and they have no problems . Tell adults to go and play and 90% of them are clueless . Adults want to compete or do something seriousfew adults will do things for their own sake . What is the reason for that ? <p> Maybe the school system and our general reward system . Research has shown that tangible ( quantifiable ) rewards tends to reduce intrinsic motivation . <p> Give a child a set of crayons and they will play with them for hours . Now tell the child that if they go and play with the crayons they will get a reward . The child will still do it . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to just pick up the crayons and start drawing . Drawing has been associated with a reward . It will not be done without the reward . Intrinsic motivation has been turned into extrinsic motivation . <p> To give a personal example . I usually write because I like it . In those cases , I am intrinsically motivated . If , however , I start writing to increase my traffic or I write an article for money or I write certain types of posts which are bound to cause lots of comments , I am extrinsically motivated . <p> This is interesting because reinforcing behavior with rewards is a kind of extrinsic motivation which has shown to work in dogs , and as such it underlies most management of humans . I think the difference with humans is that once the hygienic factors ( something to eat , somewhere to sleep ) are satisfied , extrinsic motivation does not work nearly as well . <p> The monetary component of the hygienic factors is easily satisfied by financial independence . <p> Despite this , as people " grow up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly more extrinsically motivated . They will not work unless there is a reward . They may in fact find themselves unable to lift a finger unless some manager tells them what to do . Extrinsically motivated persons therefore need to have their tasks assigned to them . <p> Even for entertainment they need to buy activities where music and TV is either consumed passively or they need activities where someone tells them what they should do to have fun . They buy their entertainment . They can go on an organized hike but theyll never go on a hike unless they pay someone to tell them when and where to go . <p> This can easily reach the tragic condition in which all intrinsic motivation has been lost . Such a person will see early retirement as a very boring life indeed . First the person will watch their entire DVD collection . Then the person will clean their house . After a year they 've had enough of the boredom and theyll go back to work . <p> People who are exclusively extrinsically motivated fully rely on other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They see no purpose in tasks motivated intrinsically . In my experience they have often completely forgotten that they were once intrinsically to do things just for the sake of doing them without the expectation of rewards . <p> To shield themselves from this realization they will use any kind of world view to condemn those who are intrinsically motivated : <p> Work without remuneration has no meaning . Activities are only worthwhile if you pay for them or get paid for them . <p> It is your duty and responsibility to society to work and fit into your assigned position ( You got ta do what you got ta do ) . <p> To each according to their need and from each according to their ability . ( This message has been approved by the Chairman of the Communist Party . Workers of the world , Unite ! ) <p> People who are not pursuing career goals are lazy(*) and lack ambition . ( At least they are not suffering from careerism ) <p> Responsible adults work . Having pointless fun is for children . <p> ( * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't always a sin . The worst sin used to be reserved for unhappiness , because unhappiness made it impossible to properly relate to the divine . <p> Intrinsic motivation likely has a lot to do with your sense of self . I find that those who are intrinsically motivated often have a strong sense of self . Conversely , extrinsically motivated people seems to have a weaker sense of self . This is not necessarily naturalit is likely just an evolved characteristic . Those who have a weak " feeling of self " believes they are what others think . If you are a producer , you become your product . If you are in the service industry , you become a brand . If you are a consumer , you become what you own . The person behind no longer matters . <p> In fact , the modern humans lack of self or the desire to negate the self to be part of something greater seems to be a required but not sufficient ingredient for fascism to take hold . Modern humans are in a very real way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be governed by a strong leader . They are suspicious of individualism and they are happy to give up individual rights in support of the whole . Anyway , I digress <p> In our consumer culture we have a really hard time figuring out who we are . We often confuse who we are with what we do . We often think of others and ourselves according to what they or we buy . If someone accuses you of being unhappy ( the original deadly sin ) , your first inclination is to show your stuff : " See , I got a fancy car . I 'm not unhappy " . <p> In that regard , it is interesting to note that there are two kinds of " normal " . The first " normal " may refer to how well the person is adapted to the beliefs of others , that is , how well that person fits into society . The second " normal " may refer to how well the person is adapted to the persons own beliefs , that is , how the person behaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " normal " tends to follow the first definition , unfortunately . Indeed , lots of prescription drugs are designed to make people complacent and reduce their spirit to make them fit in better . On a psychological level , people who have given up their sense of self and identifies fully with the group , their company , or their vocation are considered better adjusted compared to someone who retained some form of individuality and internal motivation . This is troublesome . <p> It is easy to tell someone to regain their self , but that 's probably not going to work if indeed intrinsic motivation is the primary cause of " self " . The key is to do something for its own sake . <p> Doing things for their own sake makes for a successful " early retirement " . Failing to do so makes for a failed early retirement . Once you start doing things for their own sake , even boring things become meaningful . Perhaps more accurately : They turn into play . Play does not have to be spontaneous . It can be heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it is done for its own sake , even if that means doing the dishes . <p> Maintaining motivation is a constant challenge for lifes bigger tasks , whether investing for retirement or pursuing a degree . Some combination of accountability , self-control , clearly defined goals , and genuine interest is the answer . <p> To me , a lot of intrinsic motivation is about the curiosity . Its sad that we refer to curiosity as " childlike " and I mourn its relative absence in most adults . Curiosity atrophies with disuse , which happens quickly in a 10+10 cubicle . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I think the schooling system does a lot to kill of the willingness to learn . I blame it on my psychological block towards poetry . I 've always been a voracious reader ( of mostly nonfiction ) and I think that helped to alleviate the boredom otherwise associated with classroom drudgery . <p> Ah , same here on all counts . My eighth grade teacher commented that I do n't  let school interfere with my education . <p> I think that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much opportunity to explore curiosities and interests that are off-sequence , even if they are sparked by something taught in class . <p> 10YearsBefore said , <p> Hello Jacob , <p> I 'm very new to your blog , did n't  read a lot yet but like it a lot . Thank you ! <p> Do you know of any sites practising early retirement in Europe/Belgium ? Tax , social security and housing rules are very different here so a helpful hand for reaching early riterement here would be very welcome . <p> This latest post on intrinsic motivation and your site in general help me a little bit in my decision to part from my conformist girl friend who wants marriage , nice house and money from jobs . I love her very much and I will suffer leaving here , but I recognize myself in your lifestyle so much , that I realize going further with her will not do us any good . <p> Stanley said , <p> I suspect everyone still has intrinsic motivation , sometimes its just so beaten down that it takes some time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups would provide enough of that extrinsic motivation to get started pursuing your interests until intrinsic motivation can take over . <p> Youve just struck upon one of my greatest calamities of the last several years . I 've tried so hard to get my creativity and motivation back . It seems I lost it around Summer/Fall of 2003 . See , I can even tell when I dropped off interest and curiosity as my daily companions . I thought I was doing pretty well before that . Several large scale life changes from 1998 to about 2010 ( they keep on coming , and yes , most are my doing at the core ) keep me going to find what I have lost or feel I have lost . <p> Robert Muir said , <p> Coincidentally Financial Samurai just posted a similar entry with an interesting video of a Daniel Pink lecture : <p> As FS alludes , I think the key to internal motivation is purpose . Far too many of us plod through life with some vague goal of some day " retiring " to the good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder we sit around waiting for others to tell us what to do . <p> Maz said , <p> The communist dictum of from each according to their ability to each according to their needs is in many ways the slogan of a society where intrinsic motivation ( to use your terms ) has triumphed . I.e. , people freely associating and contributing under conditions of common abundance . <p> Great post , Jacob . I believe it is normal to have a balance between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation , but I also believe that the indoctrination of the young by the state and media is part of the process by which people become wholely and solely dependent on the opinions and beliefs of others . <p> People need to take back sovereignty over their own lives . It can be a painful process when you 've been used to another way of living , to be sure , but I believe its the only one that leads us away from eventual tyranny and toward true happiness and fulfillment . <p> I fully agree with the intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfie Kohn . here 's a short , fun video contrasting Kohns views with The Office : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=G59KY7ek8Rk <p> Dan Pink ( mentioned above ) shares similar ideas . Those who are intrinsically motivated are fueled by their passions , and they produce great results , often with financial success as a by-product . So the criticism " Work without remuneration has no meaning " is actually a false dichotomy . We CAN have fun and get paid for it . <p> Its kind of sad how quickly the childlike innocence which let 's us be creative is destroyed . I remember playing with toys for hours , and now I 'm on the internet for x amount of hours every day . Its easy to see how motivation gets destroyed . <p> erik said , <p> Good stuff . Adds the clarity of language to some loose thoughts <p> I think a major problem with extrinsic motivation comes when 20 years have passed and the person feels very unfulfilled . With only tangible and frivolous rewards gained , the life so far feels hollow . <p> I 'm young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation leads to long lasting satisfaction . So far , I think this will probably be the case because I always feel like I could die right now and be okay with what I 've done . I had a great day today , so what does it matter if it ends now ? On the other hand , if I was just looking to the future for some reward with a current life of bland suffering , I 'd probably WISH to be dead so as to avoid something unpleasant . <p> That 's what I 'm goin with anyway . I enjoy your writing , Jacob . Hope you do well with it . <p> Theo said , <p> I am glad that you finally touch upon this topic . Extreme early retirement sounds great in theory but to do what ? ? ? Most people who lose their jobs go through a stint of depression even if money is not an issue per se . There is just something utterly depressing about " having nothing to do " . <p> This is one the last taboo of our society but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopia for most people . Without work most people would also be without any social life but for their family . This can be very stressful on the family unit . And I do n't  want to think about the poor single guy without work and without family . There are a lot of lonely people out there . It is taboo but very real <p> Jon Rosko said , <p> Theo , <p> With regards to social spheres I believe that for the most part people more or less take the friends they make in life for granted . In a sense the places where we typically make friends like school , work , sports , church etc .. guarantee at least someone with whom we can socialize with . Those places also act as a filter , whereby only people with certain similar worldviews congregate . <p> Though I am not yet retired early , I suspect that creating and managing a fulfilling social sphere becomes more deliberate . Fulfilling emotional needs is intrinsically motivated , one typically makes emotional connections with a person from internal motivations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and situations to make those friends usually arise from engaging in extrinsically motivated activities like the examples I cited above . Just to make things clear , engaging in sports ( like Jacobs sailing ) , religion , or even " work " do n't  absolutely necessitate extrinsic motivations like fame , societal acceptance , or money . They just usually do . <p> I also think that your example of an unemployed single guy is a non-sequitur at best and a juxtaposition at worst . His financial situation is at the absolute opposite of the one who is financially independent and retired early . Even a person who is retired at 65 is not equivalent to one who has purposefully retired early . " Free time " does not make these 3 types equivalent . <p> Jacob , <p> You 're intrinsically motivated to pursue sailing , but is that motivation also reflected with your other sailors ? It seems to me that for a sport like that money/fame are out of the picture for those who engage in it , so you must be in similar company . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are no longer thrown into a pool of people unless you choose to throw yourself in ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Jon At the level I/we sail , we are doing it for the challenge and to improve our sailing skills . When I played hockey , people played for the same reason . There were probably some of the younger ones ( 15 or so ) who were playing to get on a regional team . <p> In terms of social sphere , you answered the question . I manage it by throwing myself into various pools . Also this blog has been a source ( I keep getting surprised how much in common I have with the readers I have met . Rationally , I shouldnt be but not having much in common with 98% of the population is a normal state of being for me . ) I have n't found another person in my area who has made it to ERE yet though . A friend of mine made it to ER and we go biking and sailing . <p> Joris said , <p> I agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates are quite different . 3% above inflation seems to be regular for an American savings account . In Belgium it is n't even evident to have an intrest rate above inflation . So I try to save as much as I can . ( 33% now , in 9 years when mortgage is finished it can be 72% ) . One thing I really regret is that we cant pay extra on the principal of a mortgage , we can only refinance the whole , which most of the time is not interesting . <p> Interesting discussion regarding aspects of motivation . I think along similar lines with Maslows Hierarchy of Needs as each level is met in a sustainable manner , we can move onto the next one . <p> But there are those who are afraid to face the next level George Orwells character of Gordon in " Keep the Aspidistra Flying " portrays this characteristic so well . Some seem to keep making the same poor decisions so they are unable to move onto the next level of Needs . <p> A fascinating discussion in an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Joris , I do n't  know about the US , but in Canada a " high interest " savings account pays under 1% right now , lower than inflation . Bonds yield 2-3% and stocks yield from 0% to 9% ( with the least risky around 3-4% ) . Because stocks also have a possibility of increasing price , it currently makes sense to invest in stocks . I do n't  think our investment environment is much different from yours , but I do n't  really know . <p> If you want to retire early , how much you save will have much more impact than what return it earns . For example , if you want to double $10,000 , you either need a 15% return over five years ( unrealistic ? ) , or you could save another $10,000 . Once you get closer to your goal , investment returns become more important . If you have $150,000 , a 7% return in a year will provide more increase than a $10,000 deposit . <p> I want to add that I had a hard time identifying what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue . So I thought back to my childhood and how I spent my free time and adapted that to current things I 'm interested in . I took an active role in developing a passion instead of letting it find me . <p> This post hits hard for me . I like to think of myself as having a lot of intellectual curiosity , and I suppose I do , compared to others my age . But even I feel like in my personal life , I set up too many artificial extrinsic motivators . For example , I only seem to do writing when I set up to participate in something like NaNoWriMo ( where you write 50,000 words in a month ) , or when I sign up to run something at a certain date . <p> I do n't  know how to get my sense of play and intrinsic motivation back <p> @Lise : I am sure there are still things you do out of intrinsic motivation ( watch tv ? spend time with friends ? ) . Just do more of those things and follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hey man , Good job writing this . I just wanted to say that you got a good writing style under your feet . I was interested in your other posts and wanted to just kind of read a little bit of each one but I just could n't stop reading and felt like compelled to finish each page fully . Your writing is good man . Keep it up ! <p> JoHuntet said , <p> Loved the article , really demonstrated the need for intrinsic motivation in our lives . Unfortunately I wish you explained more on how to find it . I realize now that the emptiness I feel in my life is due to lack of intrinsic motivation . I was labeled as " gifted " from a young age and conditioned to do things for praise . To this day I can not remember a time when I did something for myself and not for recognition . It goes so far to say that I actively avoided activities in which I knew I would n't get praise . I would quit once the praise stopped . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements because they were willing to peruse things regardless of praise or criticism and now reap the rewards if their dedication . Me ? I have never had a job that paid more than minimum wage , I have no hobbies that give me pleasure and am falling into a deeper depressive state with the knowledge that I have no sense of self . <p> RMcD said , <p> I have to disagree that someone who is externally motivated needs a job . <p> " This can easily reach the tragic condition in which all intrinsic motivation has been lost . Such a person will see early retirement as a very boring life indeed . First the person will watch their entire DVD collection . Then the person will clean their house . After a year they 've had enough of the boredom and they 'll go back to work . <p> People who are exclusively extrinsically motivated fully rely on other people to tell them what is worthwhile and what is no " <p> See this does n't  make sense at all . Unless the work is exciting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to work ? And why would they pay someone to tell them what to do , the internet is full of people willing to offer advice for free . I seriously have to disagree . I think that someone with no personal motivation would be much much more inclined to view jobs as boring than someone with internal motivation ( would be driven themselves to do better ) . <p> I would say that I have next to or no motivation , and yet I find that the idea of a job seems incredibly boring . <p> W2R said , <p> Jacob , what a great essay . You said , " Tell them to go and play and they have no problems . Tell adults to go and play and 90% of them are clueless . " <p> I am one of the lucky adults who not only is retired and can play every day , but also belongs to the 10% that enjoy playing . This is especially true if I have access to my iPhone ( with games installed ) or my Wii , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel I have done my time in the working world , and I really do n't  see a need for any external reward for playing . <p> I wish that everyone could have as much fun as I have had since retirement . <p> Anon said , <p> This post is brilliant . <p> fuyu said , <p> If you find yourself most motivated by external factor like how your friends view you , how do you shift back to being internally motivated ? <p> fuyu said , <p> external factors* 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @fuyu Its said that to make something a habit , you got ta do it 15+ times . When motivation has turned extrinsic , we often feel reluctant to get started on an activity that wed otherwise enjoy because " nobody is telling us to do it " . The key is to " do it anyway " . Eventually the realization that we actually enjoy the intrinsically will be reestablished . It just requires a follow-thru on the original desire , about 15 times or so . <p> fuyu said , <p> @Jacob Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph of this post , I was alarmed about the future depicted and a feeling a little hopeless . It confirmed my previous thoughts . I 'm confident I can reach ERE in 9 years or less , but even in my most optimistic thoughts , I imagine I 'll crack after a month into retirement and go back to work . <p> I 'll try your advice today and commit to it for a month and hope it works . Thank you ! <p> Bando said , <p> I think it is interesting how you link intrinsic motivation to a strong sense of self . I would have said that the exact opposite is true . I feel more motivated when I remind myself to let go of the the ego . Rejecting statements like I am smart , I am funny , I am lazy , I am attractive in favor of just " I am " enables me stop chasing or avoiding those adjectives ( what others and I think of me ) and just do what seems like fun and meaningful at the time . <p> your objectives ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live your life ? You should be confident in what you want . It 's a feeling that comes from the inside . It 's a revelation that can only comes from you . <p> OnTheWay said , <p> I think the Known vs . The Unknown also affects our motivations . I 'm struggling with that now . My work life is a Known thing , and I have a long list of work-related things that I never want to do again that list is motivating me towards early retirement . <p> Now my early retirement life is an Unknown thing . I have some ideas of things I will do but its very vague but I 'm a smart guy and I know I 'll figure it out , but I also know I really cant know for sure beforehand what this life will be like . This is much less motivating to me . <p> So for now I focus on the my anti-bucket list I know for sure that I never want to sit across from a smart co-worker and tell them they are being laid off for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that look in anyones face ever again . And that 's just the start of the list ! For me , this is much more motivating and concrete . 10158 @qwx420158 <p> Yo yo J .. what ARE you smoking ? Seriously this is a fantastic post . Well done . I will refer back to this often . <p> I have the issue that I am too intrinsically motivated that I really struggle with the idea of doing paid work for the sake of fitting in with society . To battle this I have job hopped for 5-6 years in an attempt to find a Job that provides me with some internal satisfaction outside of just receiving the paycheck . I am no where near early retirement which bugs me , because all I do all day is imagine my life filled with endless play , and activities to indulge in for their own sake . I have such a long list of things I enjoy doing outside of work that I cant for the life of me understand why someone would choose work over the freedom of retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to save money to reach this goal , and I find career planning is not on the top of my to do list , even though making more money will allow me to achieve financial freedom faster . I suppose my question is how did you stay intrinscally motivated to stay working a job until you reached early retirement ? Did you somewhat still enjoy the job you had up until this point ? I find myself trying to think of ways to generate more passive income faster , rather than ways to make more money from a career . I am still selling my underused stuff and finding ways to further reduce my expenses , whilst increasing my savings rate to 60% , but I ca n't help but feel that I am not living up to my true potential whilst working a seemingly necessary job until I can finally retire . I think I will just have to put up with my eager mind and use my enthusiasm for freedom as leverage to increase this process as fast as possible . <p> Edward said , <p> Working every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUVs and McMansions , its extremely difficult to keep my intrinsic alive . They want to stomp out that patch of patch of grass as quick as possible and turn it into a parking lot . When I get somewhere warm on a beach , I sit down somewhere isolated and throw rocks in the water and think of nothing until my intrinsic comes back . It can take 4 or 5 hours of sitting there doing nothing but looking at the water and the occasional crab or weird bug . Quieting down the mind to empty all the crap chatter from others is n't an easy task , but it can be done . Extrinsic can return to intrinsic if you can completely get away from the world . I suggest those sand-floor cabanas in places like Tulum which do n't  have any TVS or even electricity . Just two or three days there and your mind will open up into childlike happiness of play . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287536 @2287536/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I am 30 years old and on track to retire early in five years . It was n't until recently that I decided to pursue early retirement . You see , I have always been very ambitious . I always wanted to climb to the top . In my chosen field , this meant making equity partner at a prestigious law firm . Making millions a year and getting a corner office with a skyline view . But , somewhere along the way , my enthusiasm for my profession waned . I saw my role as a lawyer for what it really is : a corporate pawn who fights frivolous lawsuits . I started to see my job as a waste of my time . . . and for what ? And at what cost ? Lawyers routinely work very long hours for many years before they even have a shot of attaining the type of success I sought . And I just could n't see myself on my death bed , after having worked four decades as a lawyer , being satisfied with how I lived my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make life worth living . I realized I needed to live , not for work or professional success , but for the more important things : family , friends , personal development , love . <p> My initial reaction was to quit my job outright . Assuming I could cut back on spending , I estimated that I had about six years of living expenses saved up . ( This was before I learned about safe withdrawal rates , etc . ) I thought I could start up a business writing and selling mobile software . And in a few years when I started running out of money , I could start over again and get another corporate job . Now I 've always been able to defer gratification , but this is totally opposite . This would mean living my life now at the expense of my future . Who would want to hire a 40 year old former attorney with no real experience in the last ten years ? Also , a few months later , my enthusiasm for writing mobile software subsided and I was left with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a way out . <p> One day , someone suggested I consider early retirement . I had no idea what this entailed or how much money I would need to save . Initially , I brushed aside the suggestion , as the thought of continuing to work was unpalatable . But some days later , I began to explore the possibility and developed a plan . In the coming months , I developed a clarity of purpose and became convinced that early retirement was a goal that I should strive for even if I should prove too weak to reach the final destination . My plan included three primary elements : <p> lower expenses ; <p> increase savings ; and <p> develop investment plan . <p> Lowering expenses was somewhat difficult , as I was under the belief that my expenses were already quite low ( by my standards ) . Many lawyers are encumbered by massive debt from law school . Fortunately , my previous employer sponsored my law school education . This is where I consider myself the luckiest ( aside from my good looks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a position to retire because of the $75-150K in debt they had to take on for the privilege of calling themselves lawyers . In my case , the biggest expense was rent , which at $2,500 a month , constituted over half of my total expenses . I recently took care of that by moving to an apartment with a roommate for $900 a month in rent . I stopped eating out on a regular basis . I also started monitoring and categorizing my spending on a daily basis using an on-line tool . Now I know where every dollar goes and I can track my performance over time . I am planning to spend $30K a year going forward , now that my budget is on a diet . I can do this without sacrificing the things that are most important to me , such as spending time with friends and visiting family . <p> Increasing savings goes hand in hand with cutting expenses . Right now , I am planning to save 25 times annual expenses of $30K , for a total of $750K . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved and my current savings rate of $70K a year ( not including 401(k) and IRA contributions ) . A withdrawal rate of 4% is cutting it close , but the thought of working long enough to save that amount of money is enough to make me sick . I am open to the idea of working part-time or on a consulting basis to make money as necessary , for example , to help my parents or to pay for my childrens educations . <p> As for my investment plan , this is where I need the most work . Despite the stock markets continuing rise , I firmly believe that the fundamentals do not support current stock prices . I know market timing is not a good idea , but I can not overcome my convictions that the market is overpriced . I never buy anything I do n't  believe is a good value , so why make an exception for stock prices ? Thus , all of my non-retirement savings are currently in cash or cash equivalents . Hopefully , the market will cool down so I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vanguard Total Market Index ( VTI ) and the remaining 40% in Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ( VEU ) . I currently hold a mix of stocks and bonds in my retirement accounts , and once fully invested , my asset allocation will be 80% equities and 20% bonds . <p> The biggest question is whether I will be able to last another five years . Changing law firms , while difficult , is still possible in this economy . However , as the saying goes , same shit , different day . I could work as corporate counsel , but the thought bores me as well . Am I making a mistake by spending the next five years in a job I dislike ? I am trying to make the most out of my time outside the office , but that is making my work existence all that more difficult . Your comments are welcome in the comments section below , as well as as on my personal blog Thoughts of an Anonymous Lawyer . <h> 76 users responded in " A way out for a young lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rich guys . Nor do I believe that men are only attracted to pretty women . Its one characteristic that makes men more attractive . Making yourself less attractive wont necessarily doom you , but it would be silly to ignore the fact that it could cause you problems . <p> I think its telling that most of the people you see discussing extreme early retirement do n't  have kids . Its very easy for one person to decide to live a frugal life , slightly harder to get two people on board , but to live a frugal life with kids means skimping on your children , something which goes against our parental desire to provide the best for our children . <p> @Alex I just consider myself lucky that I 've found a MAN who 's willing , able , and happy to live for under $2k/month in Washington , DC . Its not a cheap place , but $2k covers the basics and a little freedom . = <p> hickchick said , <p> @Alex Were planning to start a family soon . Its already in the budget . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @hickchick can you explain a little how you budgeted for a family ERE style ? Just curious for future purposes <p> @alex my girl is also very frugal-minded . She never took for granted the trappings of my income and has adjusted to my gradual increase in frugality over the last couple of years . <p> @financial samurai love your blog , btw . A lot of law students are so driven they 've always walked in a very straight line from achievement to achievement that they lost sight of the bigger picture . when they near the goal , they realize that it is n't what they really wanted . <p> Alex said , <p> @Mrs . Micah- its very impressive that you 've managed to live for under $2K a month in DC . As you say , its not a cheap place to live . Has your $2k lifestyle meant sacrifices about where you live ? safety , living space , schools , proximity to the Metro ? <p> Virtually every 40+ attorney Ive met has been divorced at least once . So just because you continue being an attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , it would suggest that being an attorney and having a marriage is just unlikely period . <p> The legal market has been really rough for me , so I 'm not in a position to just choose to switch jobs or anything . Most people I know that have been laid off have struggled in finding work . I know many law grads that have also been unemployed long term . <p> So , with that caution , I would say keep the current job and milk it for as long as you can , at the very least until the economy recovers , if it ever really does . I guess this is common sense , but I should mention it anyway , if you are dead set on making a switch make sure you have another job fully lined up and THEN make the switch , do n't  just quit your job and think you 'll get a new one just because you want one . <p> In terms of women and frugal lifestyles , it is indeed possible , but it is exceptionally rare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender roles and certain values it kind of pushes onto people . One of those is women competing with other women generally with material possessions , which even can include quality of partner . Many women judge each other based on the income of the womans husband . You can deny this as much as you want but if you are willing to be truthful you will have to acknowledge this . <p> I want to also point out that most men are also not frugal . Society also tells them that to attract women you need flashy cars and high income . So I 'd say most men at least try to give that appearance , and then will feel it incumbent to spend lavishly on the female and shower her with gifts . <p> Therefore , the men and women posting on this blog are both very rare . On this blog I 'd say that chances are everyone posting is frugal . Finding a frugal partner though , outside of this blog , will obviously be difficult for both men and women . <p> It actually makes more sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if you can meet a person that is similar to you . If you already have a partner , then you should still see if you can get it to work , just expect that problems can and do arise . <p> bigato said , <p> I would suggest you a exercise to make you think . Start Excel or Linux equivalent . Take all yours expenses and put them in order of importance . First probably you would put housing ; second I guess food . For the others , only you can tell . In the second column , put how much that expense costs you per month . On the third column , make a formula to multiply the second column by 300 , so you will have what you need to cover that expense for life . <p> As your expenses are in order of importance , now take a time to see how much you would need to cover only the very very essential expenses . I cant talk about how much since I 'm in other country with another currency and another economic reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , you should consider something near this as the measure of what is really essential to life . <p> Now you are able to tell how many days more you will work to have each of your expenses covered . Make a column in your spreadsheet to calculate that . See how much of each of your basic expenses is already covered . And now you will really know why you are still working . Now you 're alone with the crude reality . Take a good look at the numbers . Is it worth to work to have THAT expenses covered ? Its fine if you answer yes ! But that means you will have to put up with your job a little more . I think there is a conflict between you hating the job and you desiring some things in life . You just need to be clear about how much you are willing to work to cover what . If you will never want to spend as little as the more frugal people , that 's fine . But remember that there is others ways of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of the lifestyle you are choosing now . <p> I probably have a different perspective , because I 've been at a big law firm for 20 years . I might be your boss the nice one who dresses casual and spends a lot of time with his kids not the important one in the corner office . <p> I have come to expect that most associates will want to leave big law at some point for one reason or another , and I respect people who make up their minds to go do what they want . I also like to stay in contact with them they do all sorts of interesting things both inside and outside the law . <p> That being said , I have seen a number of them leave before they were financially ready to pursue dreams of being professional gamblers , sports agents , tech entrepreneurs or what have you and then end up back in the law at a lower salary a few years later when those things did not pan out . <p> Although five years may seem like a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that when you get close to 50 , at least as long as you buy yourself some more life years by staying healthy . I think you are likely to be happier in the long run if you gut it out now and make sure you have all your ducks in a row before you pull the trigger on your plan . And try not to burn any bridges with your co-workers and bosses you never know when you might have contact with them later in life . <p> Regarding your investments , you are right to be suspicious of the market its in a highly unstable equilibrium right now . Remember Warren Buffetts first two rules of investing . ( 1 ) Do n't  lose money ; and ( 2 ) see rule #1 . This becomes even more critical as your nest egg grows and because your time horizon for needing that money is relatively short . I myself am currently out of equities almost entirely , but will probably get back in to some of them if I see that Dow components or other stable dividend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . <p> Best of luck to you , my young Paduwan . <p> AnotherAustinite said , <p> This story was very familiar to me , including the thoughts about quitting , living off savings and trying to develop mobile software . I had a similar dilemma ( see mini-retirement vs. deferred gratification ) and contemplated trying to get into mobile development ( among other things ) during my **26;428;TOOLONG anonlawyer is wise to realize that this would not solve his problem . <p> Eric said , <p> Find something you 're passionate about and find a way to make money doing that . Everything else will follow . Do n't  do lawyering if you do n't  love it . <p> As for investments , sitting in cash has historically been the worst thing you can ever do . If you think that stocks are overvalued , you 're saying you can time the market . You ca n't time the market and nobody else can either . Find some quality stocks that pay sufficient dividends and jump in with both feet . Then reinvest those dividends into more good stocks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I do n't  like guys who are flashy , give me a guy who lives on $30k a year with no debt over someone who gives me jewelry he cant afford any day !

" But , I guess that 's why I like this site . <p> Scott said , <p> IMO you need a perspective reset . <p> Work provides for massive personal development , if you quit focusing on the end result and take the best out of the day to day . Youve got to do something all day after all , and you want to do it with high caliber people . You have that at your job , the money is a nice plus . It keeps the competition high and pushes the posers out . Its not like you 're stuck at the GAP . <p> If you must leave , do n't  just quit . Your job is a major bargaining chip in hand for any change you want to make . <p> When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a decent salary on 50 hour weeks . Responsibility constantly increasing , talk of partner potential , etc . <p> I quit . Just decided I could n't take the BS any more and gave notice , entering into the biggest recession of my lifetime unemployed . <p> Within 5 months , I got bored and took a new job at a different consulting firm , with a 15% pay cut . Same story , less pay . My whole social structure was in my job , it was nice to get that back . <p> This time , though , when things got crummy , I took the time to evaluate other potential ways of working , secured an offer from a place with a good culture , and jumped ship . Having a job made this much easier . <p> The new place aligns with the lifestyle I like , and I 'm very happy . I 've had to grow as a person , learn to enjoy the journey , let others lead , etc . But in the end , my lifestyle is balanced . My pay is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work much less on more enjoyable things . Ive been able to invest time in building my outside of work social structure , which is a nice plus . <p> I sure wish instead of quitting the first time , I had intelligently changed companies instead . I 'd be much further ahead financially and would have avoided two years of unecessary stressful work in the interim . <p> Anne said , <p> Long time lurker , first time poster . <p> I just wanted to comment on a frugal lifestyle with kids . Everyone who thinks they can live a frugal lifestyle with kids assumes perfect kids . No special needs . No special health problems . No accidents . No mental health problems . <p> Believe me when I tell you that these things cost lots of extra money . Especially if it is a chronic problem . Money that you did not plan for in your cost of raising kids . <p> And on a lighter note : have you ever seen an 18 year old boy eat ? It will bust your grocery budget to pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My whole social structure was in my &gt; job , it was nice to get that back . <p> and <p> &gt; But in the end , my lifestyle is balanced . <p> and <p> &gt; I 've been able to invest time in building &gt; my outside of work social structure , which &gt; is a nice plus . <p> Geez , Scott ! I 'm glad you found what works for you , but you 're a poster child for what is wrong with focusing on a career . <p> OP here . Thanks for your additional comments . I thought I would give a bit of an update now that a year and a half have passed since my original post . I 'm still trudging along . I 'm up for non-equity partner next year and have gotten very reassuring feedback that I 'll make it . I 'm pretty good at feigning interest , but its only for the bigger paycheck that will enable me to retire earlier . My savings rate is up to $150K per year . I waded into the markets oh-so-slightly , but am still 90% cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid 800s . <p> Work is bearable , but I 'm dying to go on an extended ( 1 year ) travel adventure as soon as my shackles are removed . <p> Dragline I appreciate your comments . I get along great with most of my colleagues , including the partners and would want to leave on collegial terms . My NW should be north of $1M by 35 . Possibly $2M depending on compensation and investments . Heck , I might just quit when I hit $1M and maybe do some legal consulting on a limited part time basis . <p> Scott thanks for your response too . I think I do need a perspective reset . Not all jobs are like the ones at big firms . I certainly would consider going in house if I could n't take it anymore at my firm . <p> Eric your comment embodies the other little voice in my head . Remember though that I 'm a lawyer , which makes me risk averse by nature . Im worried about being cash too , with the blatant efforts by the govt to devalue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underlying problems are still there . <p> Scott said , <p> Glad to hear the OP is sticking with it and doing well . Success is an unexpectedly heavy burden . <p> George , my biggest mistake was choosing work based on salary , instead of work that was best aligned with my personality . As an introvert , I was working with up to 30 different people in a single 10 hour day . It left me with barely enough energy to see my wife , let alone visiting with other family or investing in friendships . <p> My latest position , in addition to being a shorter day , is much less social . I might have a handful of phone meetings all week . In person meetings are once every week or two . I primarily work with people having similar personalities to me . This all leaves me with the energy to see family and at least some energy for building friendships outside of work . <p> I still think there is something to a career , but am much more of the " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . All week , I play on the computer , exploring technology . Every once in awhile , I talk to people about the cool and interesting parts of the technology . There 's some BS overhead and the demands of business create boundries I do n't  always like , but the mentoring and paycheck is enough to make up for that . <p> What struck home to me when I quit my job , is I did n't  really have anything I want to retire to . Doing " nothing " is only fun as an escape from responsibility . Some amount of structure is needed for me to be a balanced person . When I can get that core from a job , and still pursue my hobbies and non-work relationships , life is awesome . <p> I think the improved balance I have now is allowing for development of a base set of interests I can retire to , when I am ready . I also think it is more likely I will move from interesting job to interesting job than stop working altogether , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it at work , because of the resources required . <p> Financial independance is most interesting to me as a way to increase my risk tolerance , allowing pursuit of whatever work I like the most . <p> I do think if I was in the OPs shoes and put in the years of hard work to reach EP , walking away from the money and power would be nearly impossible . <p> That is an awesome story and plan . Good luck on financial independence . My goal is not to quit work , but to know that I always can if I need to . To get there I am doing the same thing as you . Spend less and save more . I am also trying to build diverse income streams just in case . <p> skeptic said , <p> @Alex and others re : frugal spouses <p> I am blessed to have found a spouse with amazing qualities including frugality , and having a baby earlier this year did n't  diminish that at all . For me to bring in $30k/year net would be *plenty* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally she is a lawyer who works in the nonprofit &amp; public sector for causes she cares about . <p> And its not really her frugality that I cherish so much as her focus on our values and what 's important to us , which partly involves not spending money on material excesses and being purposeful in how we spend time and money . And surprisingly although these conflict with the mainstream , we 've found community among others with a similar ethos . <p> So I just wanted to share that such people are around . <p> @anonlawyer , thanks for the post and the 1.5 year follow up . <p> Henk said , <p> I know this is an old ( repeated ) blog entry ( as Jacob automatically rotates blog entries ) , but it remains valid . If I look around me , many people have chosen a profession ( work for monthly salary ) , and not because they really like it , fact is that most people do not really know what they really like ( what gives energy everyday ) . Only a small part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they call their " hobby " ( if you really like something , people seem to call it their hobby , not work ) . The other 99% is just trying to make a living by somehow doing something that matches their skills ( not necessarily their interest ) . If you are lucky , like this lawyer , you earn a lot , and if you are clever enough to embrace ERE ideas , it means , you have a quick way out , and can start exploring other skills and routes in life , and who knows , you might find what you really like , or just have fun trying . My advice , if you earn that much , stick to it till you feel you have enough buffer to start exploring . Like " 35 " is a young age for ERE , so feel happy about that , many others need to work longer for that . I will be 49 when I hit ER , but luckily most of that time I was not " sick " of the job , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am 10 Months away . As a conclusion , you are doing great , and I think , you know , but it is nice to hear , right = <p> If you really dislike your job as a lawyer why do n't  you find something else to do , another way to slice bread . Working for 5 years in a place you hate seems like a recipe for disaster if early retirement is your number one goal . Anyway Good Luck and I really hope everything works out . <p> anonymous said , <p> The thing that struck me most after reading all of this after the fact is the original poster after 1.5 years was talking about the S&amp;P being in the mid 800s .

I probably spent more time contemplating the equipment before I bought it than I did using it later . <p> My name is Jacob and I 'm a gadget-o-holic . <p> My initial solution along with many holics was complete abstinence . From that point on , all hobbies were to be free to avoid the excitement of making big plans just to excuse the later acquisition which was the real driving force behind the plan . <p> Eventually I mellowed out . Instead of insisting that all hobbies must be free , I now try to enforce bootstrapping . This means that I am allowed to purchase equipment only insofar that using it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am going to spend . <p> This means that hobby expenses need not be zero if there is a corresponding revenue in terms of money saved or earned . The hobby must not operate at a net loss on the income statement . <p> This excludes many hobbies which are only intended to burn through money with no valuable return . Yet it leaves some hobbies with the potential to earn money or simply eliminate an existing expense . <h> 8 users responded in " Confession : I used to be a gadget geek " <p> This was my biggest spending problem area too . I love the outdoors and outdoor gear is very expensive and addicting . Once the gear is obtained the hiking , backpacking , other adventures are quite cheap . <p> The problem comes when you spend a cold miserable day somewhere and the need to upgrade arises . It is never ending because with new gear you can go to worse environments , until the need to upgrade is found again . I was looking at down jackets that Everest climbers use ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects . I love to go to the fabric store , mentally design the project and buy everything I need to make it .

I have set myself the mandate that I cant buy for another project until I finish this one . Its the hunt that brings the satisfaction . Maybe we need virtual hobbies . <p> d said , <p> There is a thrill associated with buying and researching a new item . I like to research new DSLR body and lens .

I like tent camping , camping supplies are expensive . A good tent is at least $200 .. for one that last and will keep you dry . And a tent ( even the expensive ones ) only last about 4-years before it leaks and the zippers do n't  work and the sun destroys the fabric . An inexpensive tent is lucky to make one year of moderate use . <p> My solution is to buy them at garage sales , I find a LOT of tents for $10.00 to $25.00 . Last year I bought a North-Face expedition tent that looked new .

They are meant to be fun and enjoyable and they do n't  need to earn their keep . Jobs are to earn money . So while one could decide that they want to think twice ( or more ) about expensive hobbies , requiring them to pay for themselves is I think , unfair . <p> A major influence on my thinking has been " Your Money or Your Life " , and the thinking there basically is n't to not spend money , but rather to spend it consciously and in accord with what is most meaningful to you .

The graph shows linearity going into earlier years . It is interesting how long that relation holds . <p> This somehow contrasts with this study which comes to the opposite conclusion . However , if , as stated in the comments , the study was not corrected for the poorer health of some early retires , e.g. people retire early because they are in poor health , the conclusion that one does n't  live long is obvious , no ? <p> A priori reasoning would suggest that not having any job related stress at the chronic low level that leads to increased blood pressure and bad habits like sugary drinks ( insulin havoc ) , which comes with many jobs , perhaps especially careers , would increase life span . Of course , the lack of a job could also lead to a lack of meaning which would lead to stress . Pointless activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hence , I suspect one should simply take it for what it is worth , that is , lifespan is a very individual matter and that it correlates weakly with group behavior . In my case I am certainly more relaxed and content than I was in my career . Thus I would expect to live longer being retired . Conversely , if I had continued complaining about my career ( many of my complaints agree with this paper ) , specifically balancing the fascinating parts , like research and model building , with the inane parts like proposal writing , doing the same presentation over and over , and building my resume , it just might have cost me a decade of life , not to mention perhaps several decades of living . <h> 21 users responded in " Does retiring early lead to a shorter lifespan ?

And , we might suspect , ones health would be affected accordingly . <p> And I like the distinction you emphasize between life and living , when you write : " it just might have cost me a decade of life , not to mention perhaps several decades of living .

People who spend most of their life working have may have no interests outside of work . I have seen a lot of retirees stand outside of the building where I once worked wanting to talk to anyone who they once worked with . Many times they have no interests and no social structure .

These changes take place within the first 1-2 months which is about the time most are willing to give something a try ( witness my failure to switch to raw food ) . <p> The first change is neuromuscular adaption . The neurological connection to unused muscles is weaker than the connection to active muscles . It goes like this : You want the muscle to move . A signal gets sent that triggers some muscle fibers . Not all of them are activated . The muscle is weak . It can not overcome the force . When a good connection is established , the nerve signal will trigger more muscle fibers and you will automatically be stronger . This is good for about 25% and it takes about a month to establish and so you will see a lot of strength increase in the first month . <p> Triggered muscle fiber will suffer some microscopic tears . This is what causes soreness . The more tears , the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be stronger . It will only get stronger if you let it rebuild . Once it is building , you will start gaining muscle . If you are overweight and not morbidly obese ( BMI in the 25-30 range vs. over 30 ) , this will cancel out fat loss on the weight scale . <p> These two factors thus conspire and so in the first month , you will see no weight loss whereas in the second month , you will see little gain in strength . Another 25% gain in strength will take 6-12 months after the first month . In terms of weight loss , a tipping point will be reached however , where the increased metabolism of the added muscle mass will burn fat while you 're not exercising ( this is the most significant component ; it far outweighs aerobic exercise unless you run 2 hours a day . However , this is countermanded by you being hungry all the time thanks to the exercise . The body really likes to keep a constant weight . <p> Many prefer aerobics for the exercise routine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor means for getting in all around shape , whereas lifting weight only does have some aerobic benefit . The problem with aerobics exercise for beginners is that unless you 're missing a lung or exercise wearing a gasmask , the cardiovascular system adapts much quicker than your joints and tendons .

Hence , a beginner taking up something repetitive , like running or cycling , with great enthusiasm might just end up with knee problems 6 months later because the joint did not have time to adapt as the program was scaled up too quickly . This pretty much ends that program for a long time . <p> I have now covered the simplest types of exercise , namely lifting weights and putting one leg in front of the other about 5000 times . Most other sports require more skill : coordination , balance , etc . Coordination typically requires uploading the " move " into your spine or wherever that knowledge sits . Unless you 're some kind of athletic genius that can copy a movement 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason is a complex movement requires you to check after 25 different parts of your body in about 0.5 seconds . This can not be done by your brain , but it can be done by the lower functions which unfortunately are not as smart as your brain and thus require training rather than just education . This is further complicated by some moves that require strength or physical implements to execute well . For instance , even after 3 years of hockey , I still can not execute a proper slapshot . <p> I think knowing what to expect should at least help to overcome the demotivating hurdles in the beginning and not to get into endurance programs too quickly . It obviously helps a lot if " you have been there before " . Anyone , who has been sedentary all his life faces a greater hurdle ( but that 's no excuse ) than an ex-athlete that is likely to just need to reconnect his brain to his muscles and shed some some pounds . <p> Oh , and if I may . I think joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few exceptions , to get in shape is a really poor proposal . McGyms are all about form over function and follow the thinking of a Ford T assembly line of trying to fix different body parts one at a time using various machines . <p> Join a real sport , damnit ! Do n't  be a spectator . Its fun and you will be doing " useful " things like scoring goals or kicking people rather than pulling levers or running on a treadmill getting nowhere . Gah ! Doing something as an end in itself rather than as a means to an end is always more effective and motivating. <h> 25 users responded in " I just started an exercise program what should I expect ? " <p> Hi , what would you recomend for a 32-year old man , 510 " tall , about 230 pounds , and had his back go out on him about 3 years ago , diagnosed as degenerative disk disease in the lower back ? <p> I was active in sports in high school and quite slim then . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising on the exercise bike , but have hit a floor at 230 . I was at 170 in high school all muscle , virtually no fat . <p> I 'm trying to get back down to 170 or so , but I cant just jump into weight training or areobics because my back complains too much . The pain can keep me inactive for a couple weeks if I am not careful . <p> Any thoughts ? I appreciate it . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @SMF You could fix it by going further . 100 miles a week . 150 miles a week . Serious bikers go more than 10000 miles a year . At 20 mph , that burns around 900kcal/hr on a real bike . Otherwise , I 'm not much of an expert on injuries , but if you tell me what you can do or are allowed to do I can probably tell you what would be most effective . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Add teaching how to take a slapshot to " Things I could teach " = However , I much prefer a good wrist shot since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better surprise the goalie ) . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kevin M I think teaching slapshots is like teaching someone to ride a bike . Its impossible ; or maybe I 'm just an impossible student ; -P . Yes , wrist shots and even snap shots are more effective , but there 's nothing like a slapshot from the point to score a goal well , there 's the Michigan move ( Ive seen it twice at my rink . Its pretty difficult when you 're not on ice ) . <p> PC said , <p> In terms of gaining weight , how does exercise help ? After the 1st month , what happens ? <p> yvie said , <p> " Doing something as an end in itself rather than as a means to an end is always more effective and motivating . " <p> I am pretty athletic and I am not keen on gyms either . I like to exercise for a purpose . For example , I cycle to work . I walk the dog . I do weights in the morning for no purpose , but I 've got in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth . <p> I think it is a big detriment in our society that we do n't  have to move . It is hard to get motivated just because " I think it might be cool to get in shape , " so many people give up after a few weeks when it ceases to be fun or is too complicated to try to fit it in with our lifestyle . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @PC You only gain weight if you eat more than you burn . Exercise will ensure that the food gets put on in the right places ( muscle ) . The weight gain stops as soon as your extra eating is taken up by the resting metabolism of the extra muscle you have put on . So after some time ( a month ? ) you have to eat more to gain further weight . If you do n't  you simply wont no matter how hard you train . <p> If you try to lose weight by eating less , exercise will ensure that the extra energy is lost from the right places ( fat storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus need less energy to maintain your weight and the weight loss will stop . <p> Think of the amount of food supporting a given body size and the type of exercise as determining which form that body has . Eventually , the connection is pretty strong . You become what you eat and do . <p> I agree with yvies comment . Exercise should happen as part of regular life . I find lifting weights at home equally as boring as doing the same exercises in a gym . <p> Chop , split , and stack wood . Build a stone wall . Carry 2 gallons of water along with you on a long hike ( preferably up a mountainon snowshoes if necessary ) . Ride your bicycle to the grocery store and load it up with food for the week , then ride home . Go swimming with your dog . Play Ultimate Frisbee ! Who needs a gym ? 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I cant do the Michigan move , but my brother is good at it . It is impressive to watch . I guess I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked your explanations in point 1 and 2 . I just started doing CrossFit ( check it out ! ) and this offers a lot of insight into what is happening in my body . It is so tough to stick with a new program when the only immediate result you see is that you want to eat all the time ! I 'm in pretty decent shape but CrossFit is a whole new level of fitness . I 've only been doing it for about 6 weeks and am starting to get a little impatient this post really helped and I 'm motivated all over again ! Thanks for the post ! ! <p> BeyondtheWrap said , <p> So , does the S-curve apply to exercise ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @BeyondtheWrap Yes , but you need to know where you are on it .

I had previously gone on rides this long before , but not twice in one day . Adjusting the seat height did n't  seem to do much except shift pain from one knee to the other .

Thanks . <p> Kevin said , <p> I am one of those who enjoys going to the gym and lifting weights . <p> I enjoy it because : 1 ) I can set up a routine and do it without thinking too much . I get up early to go to the gym in my office and be done with it before starting work . 2 ) I can set a goal of how I want to look and work on reaching it . I want to become muscular and lifting weights progressively makes me look and feel better . 3 ) Progressing with weights over time has a psychological effect where I get more confident as I keep reaching my goals .

So it did n't  matter that I could only fill 1 backpack at a time . I tended to buy 1 or 2 things at a time anyway . Bicycling became an end , rather than a means to an end .

@@42287609 @2287609/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> This is a brief summary of my financial life . My net worth is currently 580k and my goal is to hit 800k ( 26 times estimated future expenses ) in the next 16 months . <p> My spouse and I currently save 8k/month which is approximately 60% of our net annual household income of 140k . <p> Critical Point #1A plan was hatched . I found myself on a gorgeous island ( Kay Kauker ) off the coast of Belize with my beautiful wife on our honeymoon , nearly broke and out of money . We had quit our jobs three months before arriving in Belize and traveled through the Rocky Mountains in our VW bus , made our way down the Mexican coastline via local Mexican buses , and eventually landed in Belize after three terrific months of hiking and beach combing . However , we were nearly out of money and quite frustrated . I was frustrated because our plan to head south into South America before returning home was over because we ran out of cash to travel . After arriving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle but that was about it . And we had a small nest egg that would last until we found work . Our net worth was about 3k and we had no income . <p> Back in Seattle , our apartment had been sublet to a friend and the job market was good . I had a BA in social sciences and my spouse had a master 's degree in social work . What we really wanted as a newlywed couple was enough money to travel indefinitely independent of financial worries . <p> On the Island of Kay Kauker , our plan was hatched to return home , get jobs ( including starting a small business of some kind ) , and to build a nest egg that would support our travels . After that goal was reached , presumably we would be free to live life more independently while giving back to our local communities along the way . We agreed to remain child-free and to stay focused on romance and adventure over the course of our lives which would greatly simplify our plan . We worship no deities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much broke yet happy . <p> Critical Point #2The US financial crisis . Fast forward 15 years.Bam ! ! The US financial crisis in 2007 hit most people hard and it certainly did rock our world . In our quest for financial independence and early retirement we 'd made some pretty good investments in rental properties ( our new small business ) and made a lot of stupid purchases . In fact , we were over $500k in debt when the US credit markets locked up and people began to panic . We had implemented our plan , sorta , but somewhere along the way my pursuit of a simple life and self-sufficiency had gotten out of control . I had yet to be introduced to ERE principles . When the crisis hit , we had two good jobs with a total household income of 95k and at the time we owed 250k on our 900 sq ft home in Seattle , we owed 90k on a rental in Eugene , Oregon , and we owed another 65k on a small beach front rental property on the coast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt since I consider real-estate to be a good financial investment . We set a goal back in Belize of becoming financially independent in 10 years which was turning into 20 years due to a number of stupid consumer debt decisions . Had I not spent cash so recklessly during those 10 years on a jacked-up lifestyle , we would have met our 10-year goal of financial independence on schedule . <p> Now the stupid debt : When the financial crisis hit , we had two new cars that we owed a total of $55,000 on and a home equity loan for 70k ( an expensive sailboat , hardwood floors for our home , etc. ) and 3 visa cards with a balance of about 7k each . The only stuff in our position that was paid off was our Eurovan camper , two kayaks , a motorcycle , and our lovely pets . All of a sudden , within a few short months of the debt crisis , our jobs were both highly at risk . <p> The Action Plan : Since our incomes could not support our excessive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our incomes dropped ( due to a potential layoff ) and we were ruined . This was our action plan : <p> Sell the motorcycle ( I do miss that bike ! ) and pay off one visa . Done ! <p> Sell the Eurovan camper and use the proceeds to pay off two visas . Done ! <p> Sell the $30,000 sailboat ( this was an emotional one ! ) and buy an $8,000 sailboat that would make us just as happy and pay off half the home equity loan with proceeds from the boat sale . We love to explore the Puget Sound and are n't willing to give this up . Done ! <p> Now that we had cashflow from items 1-4 above , we could pay off the second half of the $70,000 home equity loan . This took about 2 years . Done ! <p> The last step in our action plan was to fundamentally change how we deal with money and face the fact that we could not budget together successfully . This was the hardest hurdle of all . We needed to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and enjoy hitting our goals . After figuring that out , our expenses started to drop dramatically and our savings rate increased significantly a few years ago . <p> Critical Point #3 Increasing my income.About 5 months ago , I realized that increasing my income was critical if early retirement was going to materialize . So , I gave up a comfortable job after 15 years of working for the state of Washington and landed a one year contract for a private medical company doing IT work in Seattle at a significantly increased rate . I left the state with a pension that I will begin collecting at age 65 . We currently carry three mortgages that total 377k . In 16 months , we will get rid of our biggest expense , housing , of 23k a year . <p> The Exit Plan The plan is to radically simplify our lives in 16 months which is when I turn 50 years old . It 's true that retiring at 50yo may seem spectacularly late to many in the ERE community but I feel ecstatic about the opportunities it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my life back . Our current plan to achieve financial independence looks like this : <p> Continue to save about 8k a month for the next 16 months and do n't blow cash . <p> Sell our rental in Eugene this summer and pay off the mortgage at our rental in Florence which will become our primary residence in 16 months . Our housing costs will be $150.00 a month after moving there . <p> Invest the remaining proceeds from the sale of our Eugene rental of approximately 100k . <p> Sell our home in Seattle the summer of 2015 and Invest the proceeds of approximately 220k . <p> Quit our jobs ! ! ! <p> Move to Florence and live on the beach for the foreseeable future . Be debt free with a net worth of approximately 800k . <p> In the next 16 months , I need to learn more about investing wisely ( I am focusing on index investing ) and better understand our future budget that includes maintaining a small inexpensive camper and sailboat , and developing a better understanding of costs associated with spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guest post : 16 more months to retirement !

I mean at least $2,000. cash if your car break down . I do not use credit cards . I am debt free . I used jars and envelops with accounts on them . If you are retire , still put money in a savings account monthly . It will keep you honest every month without over spending . I give to charity monthly myself . People are still human out there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give food to a food bank or you can pick whatever you want . <p> As for the fiances , buy fiance books . Jacob has mentioned a couple . You can also become a adviser . I like this one . I am to take the courses . You did well . May you have all the happiness in the world and you , and your beautiful wife . Family comes first , before money . It is my opinion . <p> Billy Looks like you 're making all the right moves . Great job on decreasing spending and getting things in order . Its amazing how many people are already where they need to be with a few small changes in where there money sits and how they spend it , they just do n't  realize it until they come across Jacob . <p> Index investing is a good idea , but before you start figuring out what you want to buy I 'd recommend you define your ideal portfolio allocation .

Now , we pay cash for everything which really tempers our impulses . <p> Emilito You describe exactly what we wanta mellow life near the beach in a warm county to avoid our cold winters in the Pacific Northwest . I agree that a good life can be had for about 25k a year in a country like Belize including local travel . thanks for reminding me of that ! Belize is a beautiful country . You are lucky to be Belizean .. : ) <p> Drew I assume that Medicare will still be around but our plan is to do what so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries where the rip-off factor is far lower . International health care policies are reportably pretty good at a fraction of the cost of US policies . <p> Property takes will be about $65/mo , Insurance $25/mo , Maintenance $200/mo , and utilities at about $100 a month . We plan to rent it ( easily done since its one block from the beach ) when not living thereliving abroad or on the boat , for 3-4 months a year at $600/month which should offset most of those costs . And I 'm not planning on sitting around on my tail during retirement but rather staying motivated and probably making some cash here an there to reduce our 4% withdrawal rate . <p> pete said , <p> " My spouse and I currently save 8k/month which is approximately 60% of our net annual household income of 140k . " <p> You are either saving 7k/month or have an annual household income of 160k . But if you are saving 8k/month of an annual income of 140k , that is approximately 69% of income . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

It is best to do it conservatively , buying a one or two properties ( I 'm thinking single family residences here , though ) each year or couple years , slowing building up cash flow and equity .

Isnt that why you saved and saved , to not have a full time job ? <p> Squirrel Most Frugal said , <p> AlexK has made a good point . You probably do n't  want a full time job . Then an RV park , mobile home park , and a multi-plex is probably not for you . <p> What you should probably look into are single family residences . Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow needs are so infintestimal that as few as five houses may do fine for you . Five well-located , well-managed , paid-off homes would probably provide you with good income for the rest of your life . And you can buy more at your leisure if you want more income or greater net worth . <p> Bailer said , <p> As an owner-occupant of a fourplex in Minneapolis , this has been a great way to live inexpensively . It can be tricky to find a small building in a good neighborhood at a fair price no surprise there . If you are working with a housing budget of $500 ( think that 's what you wrote ) for both of you , if anyone can figure out a way to do this in CA , you can . <p> A tiny house park is an excellent idea , if you can capitalize it ! Hey , I JUST blogged on Portland today ! ! ! What the heck is wrong with that ? Or is everyone small/simple minded moving there ? That would be an even better reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for weeks here in Texas , so I 'm all about 4 seasons . <p> tom blum said , <p> Search " very small houses " <p> There is a long history of these in America . <p> Thoreau on walden pond . The temp houses built after the San Francisco earthquake . the log cabin it self , from settler days . <p> I like you idea <p> tom blum said , <p> The problem , in modern america , is zoning requirements . Minimum Square footage is much bigger than " small " . All the other requirements that you challenge ( as do many of your readers ) as unnecessary opulence are written into the law of the land . <p> That will be your biggest hurdle in realizing this part of your dream <p> Alex said , <p> @ Tom Blum : look at Tumbeweed houses , like Jacob mentions . They 're built on utility trailers , and are thus classified as " vehicles " rather than " residences " and are exempt from minimum square foot requirements . <p> frugal apartment renter said , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Maybe 1/3 of your assets , along with bonds , stocks , cash , and possibly bullion . <p> I imagine single family homes would be a tough game right now , as Price/Rent is still way too high . From what I can recall , there is a 1% rule . Where if you buy a $200k house , you should be able to rent that for $2,000. $400k for $4,000 . That 's a tall order in this market . <p> And if single family homes are priced rich , there is a good chance duplex , four-plex , et all are priced rich . <p> You could diversify your RV / mobile home park investment with on-site liquor stores and strip clubs . This would be very compelling to residents , as they would not have to get into their autos and burn gasoline to get entertainment . And no risk of police and DUI . Now that 's frugal ! <p> Lol , my supervisor just chided me about becoming a slumlord when I told her I wanted to invest and live off of real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for mobile homes and RV parks ? If so then at least you wont need to worry about not getting paid by your tenant . Though you might need to worry about them trashing your place <p> Glenn said , <p> There is another aspect to being a landlord that no one has mentioned , laws regarding tenants . I mention this because my parent owned 3 4-plexs in Texas . They got tired of the weather and the small town politics and moved back to Washington state in Spokane . They considered buying property in Spokane for rentals , but decided against it due to the laws on the books heavily favoring tenants . That is , if your tenant does n't  pony up the rent it is a long drawn out process to evict them . In Texas the laws are more favorable for landlords . <p> So I would say n-plexs are a good investment if you are ready to be a landlord . I would strongly recommend against renting out single family homes . Here is why : If you have a 4-plex and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your possible income . If you rent a single family home and it goes empty for a month you lose 1/12th of your income . If you have a mortgage on the property , you just lost all your profit on the single family home . Whereas the 4-plex you have not . <p> As for a trailer park with mini houses . I would seriously doubt there is enough demand for that type of residence and would be fairly risky compared to other options . <p> Good luck to you either way . Being a landlord can be a tough job with a lot of pitfalls , especially if you do all the work yourself . <p> Marcy said , <p> If you do something like that , is there a way to make it for introverts only ? Living close to other people would n't be so bad if it werent for the damn extraverts and their constantly flapping gums . There are days I just want to go outside and scream , " Shut the f*** up ! " <p> I live in Portland , hope to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and have been looking for a place to park it here in town . Its currently illegal ( though probably doable ) to live in an RV in someones yard/driveway in Portland , and few of my friends have the space for it . And the RV parks are , well , RV parks . So Ive been dreaming about a tiny house park like you describe for a long time now . Ideally it would contain a shared laundry facility and an indoor community gathering area , as well as the amenities you mention . Other ideas : wireless network , solar energy , rainwater catchment , composting . You would n't need to do most of the maintenance ; it could be provided by qualified residents in exchange for a discount on rent . <p> The big advantage of Portland is that you 've already got a built-in small group of interested renters . I know of three other soon-to-be tiny home builders here , and there are sure to be more . Yeah , you could get cheaper land elsewhere , but I ca n't think of a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> Hey Jacob would you really prefer to receive your income from your own business or real estate ? That 's kinda thrown me , as I 'd imagined ( from reading lots but not all of the old posts ) you 'd be against that idea <p> You could go into the rental business . You could become a landlord . Quicker , and lots less expensive however , would be to just have someone crack you across the head with a piece of 3/4 ? steel pipe . Results would be the same . <p> Eric said , <p> Your biggest economic advantage may be in attracting like-minded people to you . Responsible , introverted , creative , and looking for a high quality of life . When you attract these type of people , all the concerns about " what if my tenants do n't  pay " or " what about the zoning " go away because you will have an army of supportive people fighting for/with you , not against you . Make a website to collect payments , describe lot sites , amenities , etc. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the web . <p> As for where to locate , I recommend you read Richard Floridas book Whos Your City . It describes the idea of clustering , which in your case would point towards Portland or Northern California . Good luck ! <p> You might want to read the book " trailer cash " for an in depth look at someone who 's already done it . I have the book if you cant find it . <p> Jeeves said , <p> I 've recently looked into this . If you think of it as a part time job then it could be a diverse way to generate very high returns . <p> I 've held off for now because apt buildings have cheaper leverage . Also the profit per tenant with apts is higher and the returns are roughly 20% per year which is good enough for me . Landlord laws vary greatly by state so please choose carefully . Also , you 'll want insurance to protect yourself from catastropihes and lawsuits . <p> Susan said , <p> I know of business owners . How did they rich ? Millionaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set on the real market to go up and then sell them . They went for small towns type of properties . Just a tip , you do n't  need to buy in the city . <p> lauren said , <p> I think this is a fantastic idea so good it prompted me to comment on ERE for the first time = As the tiny house movement becomes more popular , where to park your tiny house is going to become more of an issue . I think you could charge more for rent vs surrounding RV parks by offering services of interest to many tiny house dwellers : gardening , composting , secure/covered bike parking , outdoor dining/grill space , etc . You could also consider providing space for classes/workshops related to tiny house building and maintenance . I imagine you would get several long-term tenants . I 've considered building a tiny house for a couple of years , and right now where to park it is a big issue I would jump at the chance to rent space in a mobile park like this ! 10149 @qwx420149 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll happily consider being a silent investor . We own a small apartment and have been interested in investing in a park . <p> I would want to develop a community cohousing-style ( which , Jacob , you must know about , being from Denmark , where the cohousing movement started though its called something else there ) , with a common house at the center of the community . Funny that you mention Portland I moved here last month from Indiana . And yes , the community would have garden plots and trees and much more . <p> I 'm not sure how well communities like this work when being privately owned by a " slumlord. " = Itd be better if the community could at least own the land in common , or possibly have the land in a land trust . Diana Leaf Christian talks about the various options for these types of communities in her books . <p> P.S. On your website , I 'm unable to click on most of your top level menu items using Chrome ( a couple do work though ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it though . Hopefully I can develop one if 2-4 years . <p> alarswilson said , <p> Another viable and growth option is micro-apartments , whether via renovation or outright development . See lifeedited.com for rather upscale versions of this . If done according to the principles of The Pattern Language , I think it would be a desirable place for renters , short term and long . Sort of ApartHotel that does n't  feel like a hotel . <p> Interesting discussion . I see a reference of turning farmland into an RV Park.I would just do what I did and actually buy farmland and then just cash rent it out to the local farmers . Or you could " Custom Farm " the land meaning you pay a local farmer to do all the planting and harvesting , plus you buy all the crop inputs such as seed and fertilzer.This is what I do . I bought 8 farms all in the state of Iowa in 1989 that have a combined acreage of 1,200 . I only paid $1,000/acre for all 1,200 acres or a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate loan from Farm Credit which is a branch of our goverment for $1.1 Million and I came up with the other $100,000 myself . So our goverment let me borrow $1.1 Million from them with only a $100,000 downpayment to buy all 8 farms . The goverment mortgage/loan was 3% less than what the banks would give , so an excellent deal at the time , this was 1989 . This is a goverment program that gives/loans money to farmers to purchase raw farmland . Now today the farmland is worth $14,500/acre or over $17 Million dollars after owning it for 26 years . Not a bad Return on Investment . I grow only #2 Yellow Field Corn that I sell to the Iowa Ethanol Plants and this produces a profit of $1.4 Million Dollars every year . I think the farmland would be a better way to set up a passive income stream than an RV Park . Also our goverment will lend almost anyone money to buy farmland , but this was high-quality Iowa farmland , but anyone can buy farmland in Iowa . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287612 @2287612/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Disclaimer : I recommend reading the post on " travel , tourism , and living abroad " first to put my critique of " travel " in a bigger perspective . What I really criticize here is tourism : " Going places just to look at them . " I 'm not saying its a total waste , but I do think that from a personal growth ( a frequent selling point for international travel ) perspective that better ways exist . There are certainly bigger challenges in life than moving your physical location by charter . I think living abroad and finding out how other countries and cultures work from the inside is an absolutely commendable thing to do . Conversely , I do n't  see much benefit/cost in jumping on an airplane and visiting faraway places which seem to have turned into some form of one-up-manship in terms of either distance or quantity of places that people can brag about . Staying 1-2 years in a place compared to just 1-2 months is a completely different experience . <p> Yesterday , Baker over at ManVsDebt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " . Now , people often say that travel will create memories that last forever , that traveling broadens your horizons , or increases your understanding , but for some reason that just never worked for me . Here is what I have learned from visiting 14 countries mostly professionally <p> Having to get up at 2am to start the " journey " to avoid having the last flight canceled or missing it because the previous flight was delayed or simply to arrive at the destination before all the local transportation shuts down just plain sucks . There is truly nothing like standing outside the airport in a new country at 11pm when all you had all day was 23 peanuts and 8 oz of water and a single-serving DIY meal consisting of something brown , something yellow , and something orange . <p> In the US you remove your shoes at airport security , but you can keep your belt on . In Europe , you can keep your shoes on , but you have to remove your belt . Go figure ! <p> My middle name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a field for it . I do n't  have two last names . I love filling out forms in triplicate and making sure that all my papers are in order . <p> Flying is like sitting in a closet with a vacuum cleaner on for 10 hours . If you find that exciting , just come on over and I 'll charge you $500 bucks for the experience . Ill even make you wait in the closet for 2 hours before I turn the vacuum cleaner on , because it needs " refueling " . If you want to sit next to the keyhole , you know , the window seat , I 'll upgrade you for a nominal fee . You can also have a life jacket in case the vacuum cleaner explodes and I 'll throw in an MRE for free . <p> The guy in front of you who puts the seat down and douses your laptop is actually not an inconsiderate idiot . If you look ahead , he s probably doing it because the guy in front of him just did it . If not , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where seats are down has at least one inconsiderate idiot . <p> If you fly west , there is little jet lag . If you fly east , expect to spend the next week being wide awake at 3am , sleepwalking at 2pm ( please do n't  operate heavy machinery at 2pm ) , and going to bed early . <p> Hotel beds are never as good as my own regardless of what the hotel charges , or at least anywhere in the $40-$200/night range , they all feel the same . <p> The gorgeous beaches of Hawaii , the mind-blowing dolphins ( what , they can kill you with their brains , eh ? ) , the impressive cathedrals , the tranquil streams running down the majestic mountains ahh do n't  get me started . I 'm not a travel writer , so I am just going to use my limited modern vernacular and say its all awesome and amazing even if it is just a damn beach with some water , some sand , and a bunch of washed up plastic , or a bunch of old bricks stacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Seriously , if I want to see an amazing church or an awesome building , I do n't  really have to travel to another country to do it . In fact , I have pretty much forgotten all the wondrous things I have seen in the world , but I 'm pretty sure they were awesome . <p> I can increase my perspective just as easy by talking to people on the internet , reading foreign newspapers , or listening to foreign radio broadcasts as I can by going to another country and hanging out with the locals for couple of weeks . Of course , not everybody is on the net these days , but that goes for all countries , not just other countries . Sure , I could not get the tribal perspective from the rain forest in South America , but how many people go there on their travels ? What I 'm saying is that if there 's an airport accepting 747s , the natives will be much like you and will probably go on vacations in your country . <p> Travel is not a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can go anywhere in the world by making a few phone calls , why you can probably even make the reservation on the internet without having to endure the excitement of being on hold for half an hour . The travel skills required for intercontinental travel are really not much more advanced than the travel skills required to navigate your local bus system . As long as you have money , you can keep moving forward . You just have to realize that . Its the same . <p> Forsooth , I have come to think of travel as a big racketyou give us your money and we will give you memories , no different than cable TV , reallywhere the affluent try to one-up each other by reciting the places they have been to(*) because obviously the beholding of old bricks increases in value the farther away those bricks are located relative to your point of residence and so going to Turkey is better than going to New Jersey . Accumulating these precious everlasting memories is often put in the category of personal growth just like changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white collar workers buying their first suit . However , it mainly serves to accumulate social currency just like attending rock concerts does it for a teenager or buying " conversation objects " does it for a socialite , The currency can then be used enhance peer status " Oh , I saw the cathedral .. I felt I was part of historic moment awesome " . And everybody else goes " Oh , wow ! I must also go there , so I can be awesome too " . And so we travel so we can impress each other . Just like we buy stuff and go to concerts . <p> ( * ) And I think this is a really important point , because for some reason people always go back ; well , if you prefer your home , stay there ; alternatively , if you prefer to live somewhere else , go there and stay there . <p> Another popular reason for travel is related . Here travel is done because normal life is boring or it is purchased as a reward to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy stuff or travel to entertain yourself you probably have bigger problems than the social climbing mentioned above . ) What normally happens then , is that people start to accumulate experiences in the same way that they accumulate stuff . Perhaps they have a spiritual epiphany and decide that accumulating something ethereal like experiences is somehow better than accumulating stuff , but it is the accumulation in itself that is their problem . Their focus has just changed from trinkets to polaroids . <p> Anyway , that is what I have really learned about travel . <p> Some comments : Before going to faraway locations , realize that your mind comes along with you . You will find what you bring . If you find much more at home , outside your doorstep , if you expand your mind instead . Here are some suggestions : 1 ) Do you know all the streets in your city ? Have you been to every one of them . If not , geocaching is a nice way to explore the local area . 2 ) Okay , so you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that live in your area ? What about 5 different grasses ? 3 edible plants ? Do you know where the nearest body of fresh water ? Drinkable water ? Do you know where the stream originates ? 3 ) Do you know your neighbor ? What about the other people on the street ? Have you gained their perspective ? 4 ) As you wander the streets of ( 1 ) , consider the buildings . How old are they ? Who owns them ? How long have people lived here ? Has any was been fought over this area ? Why ? What happened to the losers ? ( You can consider yourself a winner since you are currently occupying the area. ) <h> 73 users responded in " Travel is not worth it " <p> @Kate , and recent commenters The kind of travel I believe is not worth it is the 1 week here , 2 months there , seeing ( and touching ) various things , " swimming with the dolphins " , talking to the locals , eating their food , good my passport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is done with a backpack to remote areas , etc . <p> I believe this backpacking tourism , travel , airport hopping , etc. to be very overhyped , especially amongst in the 20-something crowd . I 'm not saying you cant learn anything or challenge yourself but the way that most people go about it , the skills are not that great . Finding a place to stay , a place to eat ( and eating something strange ) , and transportation to the next spot is not difficult . ( Getting a job there is and I do n't  see many travelers doing that . They just keep moving until they run out of money . ) It is a very expensive way to gain those thinking-on-your-feet skills and knowledge . Why not learn these things by getting paid for it ? <p> By the tenets of this blog , the money saved by not buzzing around to different places around the world as a nonproductive traveller can be used to buy financial independence at a very young age . I know people that spent their 20s travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in only the middle of their studies or early in their careers and they will probably be " living " in their offices for the next few decades until they are 60 . <p> I do n't  really see them as being more mature or worldly compared to someone who went on business trips , say . I mean , anyone like moving around , get a job as a stewardess , or sign onto a ship . Those who want to relocate to another country and work there , its slightly trickier . If you have the brains , you can go the academic route like a researcher ( which I did ) . If you have the ambition , get hired by a transnational company . They will start sending you around the world once you reach the management level in your early 30s . <p> this is my opinion about traveling too- it is expensive and just something to brag about . still there are things for which I would pay more : big cities atmosphere and oceans . I love cluttered cities I do n't  travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 years : ) I live in a bigger city than 10 years ago and I 'm loving it ! as about oceans , I could go to a pool in my town but I never trusted them as being truly clean and the air is not the same- still i do not travel to the seaside each year to be able to afford to live in a city near the ocean sooner : ) except my country , I traveled abroad just one : to Paris and that got me more determined to emigrate because the city was so clean and people were so polite ! Not too many cars neither and very diverse people- I only see white people 90% where I live now . I am white too but I love a melting pot city : ) <p> jinushaun said , <p> I feel like a lot of these points could also be used to discourage marriage . : p <p> I 'm an avid traveler , and if you travel as much as me , you quickly realise that traveling to sight-see is a waste of money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous old buildings are nothing more than brick and wood . In 30 years , when you look back at all your travels , you wont be remembering the details of that ancient cathedral or how white that beach was . No , you 'll probably remember the person you spent it with and the local people you met that taught you something about how the other side lives . You 'll remember the experiences and emotions . Memories , IMO , are pretty invaluable . <p> For me , I travel for the escape and the experiences . It breaks up the monotony and keeps my sanity in the daily slog we call the working adult life . Traveling does not necessarily mean flying somewhere either . You can have just as much fun for low cost driving somewhere . You do n't  have to fly half way around the world to experience different culture or ways of living . <p> One of the biggest benefits of quality slow travel , is that it forces one to live in the now &amp; Bryson says it best : <p> " To my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to experience everyday things as if for the first time , to be in a position in which almost nothing is so familiar it is taken for granted " . <p> That openhearted wonder &amp; awe of the open road , being close to nature , experiencing people and life with more vulnerability and gratitude is priceless ! <p> We have been on an open ended world tour as a family since 2006 with no plans to stop as we have found it to be the best way to educate our child &amp; a VERY enriching way to live . <p> We 've traveled over 175,000 miles so far ( most overland ) to 4 continents , 32 countries and almost never take planes . We have used every mode of transportation from cargo ship to camel , but mostly we walk , bike , use mass transit &amp; a small RV . <p> Pretty similar to a slow sail around the world ( which we may switch to at some point ) , I have never met anyone who has done THIS kind of deep immersion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain where my child goes to local school in her second language ) &amp; slow travel that has n't  loved it . <p> We travel the world &amp; live large on MUCH less than we could or did at home . We spend less than 700 dollars a month each &amp; could do it on much less ( &amp; we have n't even gotten to the far east yet or South America yet ) . <p> For us , travel is worth it &amp; perhaps the most free way to live &amp; experience life . <p> belle said , <p> " I can increase my perspective just as easy by talking to people on the internet , reading foreign newspapers , or listening to foreign radio broadcasts as I can by going to another country and hanging out with the locals " this is laughable . Do you also have a digital girlfriend ? Yes , the internet and foreign media are interesting modes of learning but they do n't  replace actual human experience . I 'm not saying that they are n't  valuable , but let 's not act like they 're transferrable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blog I am gaining as much in perspective about you as I would upon meeting you ?

I actually used my traveling to ( interestingly enough ) decide to move to the same bay area where you live . <p> Ive been to a couple of countries and they have loaded me ( who lived mostly ignorant ) with guild .

No , but using the frugal manifesto as a beacon , its about the only option I can truly live with . <p> Lastly , the comment about the sub orbital flight is a classic example of the frugal manifesto as well , trading DAY TO DAY overall happiness for the 5min AMAZING , yet FLEETING space travel . <p> @Mark : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a lot of traveling , and arrived at his opinion through long experience . A better comparison would be a longtime player finally concluding that one-night stands are just degrading and sad , even though most people glibly insist they 're awesome . <p> @Jacob : Thank you for having the moxie to voice this hugely nonconformist opinion . People will of course have different values , but the observation that collecting hyped-up travel experiences is often just another form of consumerism ( you cant buy happiness , but you can always fly there ! ) is a natural and insightful extension of your philosophy . Travel was a rarefied luxury until quite recently , yet people still managed to lead meaningful and interesting lives without it ( and even learned quite a bit about foreign cultures , if so inclined ) . Varied experiences are definitely important to living the good life , but those arise from doing lots of different things ( which will inevitably bring you in contact with lots of different people ) , not from just going lots of places . <p> the world and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several experienced travelers that travel is not worth it . Am I afraid of reaching my goal only to be disappointed by it ? - Not in the least. - It sounds <p> I personally do not empathise with .

Im retired and people always want to know why I do n't  travel . Linking to this and saving myself all the hassle of explaining is worth the nickel I 'm gon na tip you on this . = <p> Mason said , <p> If you can travel for less than you can live , say by slow traveling through cities or countries which have a lower cost of living than where you would live in the US , what is the downside ? Assuming you are n't  attached to your roots , and enjoy moving as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you believe people and places are the same or different , down the road . <p> Traveling for a few weeks at a time to very far-away " exotic " locations is probably the most expensive way to travel . At the same time , if you are in accumulation mode and saving for an early retirement that is one way to keep the fire going until you are financially ( and location-ally ) independent even if it ultimately sets you back a couple months or even a year . <p> uux89 said , <p> You can say all this because you traveled ! Just like a millionarie can write about why having millions is not that nice , and his private swimming pool is not worth it . <p> Regarding travel , I feel that I can easily realize after a conversation of less than 2 minutes with a stranger how much traveling he/she has done .

I think this post is right on the money ! <p> I do n't  usually post just to say I agree with someone ( I do n't  usually post comments at all = ) but yeah , I definitely feel that tourism is a scam . The best part is encountering travellers who are environmentalists who have been jetting around the world without realizing that flying in a commercial aircraft is incredibly harmful to the environment ! <p> Also , the 1-weekers/2-weekers are usually staying on a resort that is basically an all you can eat pig trough . <p> To the idea of a vacation I am of the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from then there 's something seriously wrong .

@@42287622 @2287622/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> So you have joined the ranks of enlightened people , who want to retire early , move to another country , or redesign their lifestyle , and now you want your spouse or partner to go along with it ? <p> Not so fast ! While winning friends is easy , influencing people is a lot harder , but it can be done . I am a little dense when it comes to interpersonal understanding , but I have still learned a thing or two . <p> The first and most important thing is that a person sounds a whole lot smarter and more intelligent when you agree with what the person is saying(*) . Most people listen to other people mainly to confirm what they already know and and be reaffirmed in their beliefs . This is not a very rational thing to do , but most people are like that probably due to humans being social animals . This means that if you suggest something , which is radically different from what they already know , they will think that you are ignorant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are stupid , a stupid person being an ignorant person who refuses to change his ways . <p> Therefore only make it known that you posses this information by talking about it once . Let them come to you when they are ready . <p> ( * ) If you do n't  believe me , try to tune into a election debate . Candidates are very likely equally intelligent , but do they sound that way to you ? <p> Most people ( and especially children ) will follow your example rather than your suggestions ( if they follow at all ) . Children will follow practically any example ( and believe anything you tell them , so be careful there ) , but adults are calcified already and usually want to follow their own example rather than your example unless it becomes manifestatively clear that your way is better . In other words you must be able to demonstrate a clear difference between your way and their way . <p> This means you have to build up a visible difference to show that there is an alternative ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he/she will generally come around very quickly . For instance , you may build up a savings account or what people with bills , job-dependence and other liabilities call an emergency fund . If your spouse is already familiar with the concept , start talking about how your " emergency fund " will support you for 5 years , say , and that you are thinking about switching careers or taking a long hiatus . A 5 year fund is simply in another category altogether . It is qualitatively different because it gives you many more opportunities . A normal 6-month fund is only designed to pay your bills while you go and look for another job because you just got fired or carry you over while on an extended sick-leave Those , who focus solely on those problems will have a hard time wrapping their head around the larger time frame and the additional possibilities . However , if your spouses E-fund is only the standard 6 months , but she is beginning to think that her current life path sucks , she will most likely start saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <p> If your accounts are joint , you say you would prefer to save the money whenever she proposes an expenses . Just suggest that you split some money into his and hers and if she wants to buy something , fine , but you reserve the same amount of money for savings . After a while , you can start talking about the interest you are earning . One thing that tend to get people going is when I talk about how the money my savings generate on average correspond to a fulltime job in Walmart and how that essentially means that the person is working for me . I can put this in really snarky terms too using terms like mortgage and credit and it seems to get people thinking . <p> If you want your spouse to adopt some change , another thing to try is to find something they are familiar with . For instance , DW could not see herself living in a Tumbleweed House ( my original plan ) , so I started talking about boats . Then someone suggested RVs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RV and lived in a mobile home park at some point so she was familiar with those and was much less resistant to this idea . Had she not been , I guess one way would have been to start camping and make the trips longer and longer after which I would combine this with the suggestion that if we started camping full time we could cut our budget in half . <p> In summary , the sneaky way to go about things if you want to persuade someone is to change your environment to make your ideas seem more sensical e.g. try acquiring a majority of your stuff through swapping or freecycling . This might make your spouse reconsider the idea of paying for things especially when he/she sees the envelopes arriving by mail or you pick up a leather jacket while you proudly announce that you did not pay for this ( BTW guys , I have not bought anything for me personally for several months now , but I have bartered(*) more than 10 things away , probably closer to 20 ) . Get furniture used and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this month your expenses were completely covered by income from your investment accounts . Cook meals that only cost $1 but taste the same as $10 meals . Later you can start talking about how you do n't  need to work anymore because you have enough savings to retire . <p> ( * ) I 'm not sure bartering is the right term . Sometimes I swap 1-1 . Other times , I give to person A and receive from person B making sure that I give as much as I receive to maintain a " fair " trade-balance . I m working on this karma theory = <p> None of this guarantees success , but maybe , just maybe , someday your spouse will have a problem that is best solved with one of your solutions and then you will be right there . <h> 27 users responded in " How do I get my spouse to go along with my frugal plans ? " <p> By the way wrt your passive income , its been awhile since you 've written anything about recent investments . I 've always wondered what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially discovering a company to the actual purchase . I know you 've talked about this generically in the past ( your basic process for choosing stocks ) , but how about a detailed analysis of a recent venture ? <p> Great post . My husband and I do n't  always agree on the importance of putting savings before spending , in part because his job is perfect for him and he does n't  see the point of privation for the sake of retiring early . <p> I think how upset my job makes , combined with following by example , has made him come around some , however . He was very resistant to putting money in an emergency fund at first , for example . He argued that paying down our mortgage was a better investmentand it is , percentage-wise , but when having a major car repair throws our whole life askew , having even a few thousand dollars cushion is incredibly valuable . When I got a raise I starting putting $150/month into savings nonetheless and when hubby saw that we could get through a major car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Rosie said , <p> This is so helpful , and I 'd love to hear more about how DW fits in to all of thisdoes she work out like you too ? Have there been specific areas that she 's been more resistant to over the years ( I know , the car , the boat ) ? Has it been easier to come around over the concrete immediate decisions rather than the big picture ? <p> My DH is n't bad on the big picture , and he likes to see the savings accumulate , but the day to day spending decisions are not where I would like them to bealthough , that said , when I look back , there have been major changes over the years ! <p> My DW thinks I 'm crazy about simple living . While I 'm far more conservative than you are , she says nobody thinks the way I do and that I 'm too far out in left field . Her family reinforces her opinion by talking bad about me . For instance , I have shown her the Tumbleweed website , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camping suggestion , but she would never agree to go camping . Its too " rustic " for her . Do you have any other suggestions for how to get a wife to downsize ( even a little ) ? <p> One other thing , I often get in trouble with DW when I suggest getting rid of any of our stuff . Even when I sell my own things , she says Im trying to manipulate her into getting rid of her stuff . Any suggestions ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Rosie I think the long-term changes are what is important . Some areas have moved far . Others have stagnated . The current problem areas in this household are in the working out department . Like many other Americans , DW is slowly on her way to type II diabetes and similar lifestyle problems . Now I am heavily invested in companies that are going to benefit from these problems , but I 'd still like that such preventable problems stay outside the family . Maybe one needs to have lived in another country to see that what is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere . The way I have dealt with this in the past is to get more and more annoyed until we have one of those long and boring conversations . This results in an exercise program that lasts are couple of weeks . What I 'm currently doing is in supplying all the discipline ( and nagging ) to maintain the exercise program and cut off all damaging food sources from the shopping list . I basically set down an ultimatum . In terms of the financial stuff , the problems is in the implementation . She does n't  buy much , but when she does she typically pays retail rather than scouting for used , recycled , freecycled or clearance . The right attitude is definitely there now . <p> @Eric Well , I would suggest finding some simple living friends and start doing things with them . Maybe the wife can be invited on occasion to get a better idea of the left field . If she 's a normal consumer she probably thinks simple living is about living in squalor . In terms of the house , maybe claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " I decorate that room " . Then make your room the way you want . I think the kitchen is the command center of the house . If you can claim that ( just offer to do all the cooking ) , its easy to get rid of the electric can opener , the ice cream maker , and the three different kinds of blenders . Just say they take up space so you put them in the closet and what does she care anyway since you 're the one doing the cooking . In terms of selling stuff .. wow ! Well , one thing you could do is to stop buying new stuff and trade your old stuff away for whatever you need . <p> yvie said , <p> Jacob says , " The way I have dealt with this in the past is to get more and more annoyed until we have one of those long and boring conversations . This results in an exercise program that lasts are couple of weeks . What I 'm currently doing is in supplying all the discipline ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all damaging food sources from the shopping list . I basically set down an ultimatum . " <p> I hope you do n't  mind me saying this Jacob , but the way you address your wife does not sound like an equal partnership . You sound more like a disciplinarian parent than an equal spouse . I assume she is a grown adult and that she can make decisions regarding her own health . It may not be what you want but it is her choice to make . The only way you can maybe get away with this is if her weight is impinging on some joint activities : maybe she 's lost interest in doing activities with you because she 's too out of shape . <p> I know that as a wife , if my husband nagged me to do certain things , I would probably end up doing the opposite , as I do n't  like to be bossed around like a child . Immature on my part perhaps , but I do n't  think I 'm alone in reacting this way . <p> My 2 cents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit of everything doing whatever works in whatever area is required . Whether carrots or whips or something in between . People may be mature in one area and immature in another . For instance , can adults that run up consumer debt and then declare bankruptcy be considered mature ? There are typically two ways to handle this : adult-adult , which works when both are rational , or parent-child interactions , which is the default when adult-adult does not work . <p> I think once two people are married , they have a responsibility to each other . One of those responsibilities is not to let themselves go and also consider how their actions might affect their partner whether that comes down to health , finances , breaking the law , not sleeping with other people , leaving the toilet seat up , or whatever . After all most actions impinge on the other in some way . Some of these ( like the toilet seat are ridiculous ) but some of them are potential deal breakers . For instance , I am just not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners spending behavior while accepting my partners choice as that of a mature person . If that was the case , I 'd eventually seek a divorce . Same with the health . In my book , love in not unconditional , and sometimes it needs to be tough . <p> yvie said , <p> " The way I have dealt with this in the past is to get more and more annoyed until we have one of those long and boring conversations . This results in an exercise program that lasts are couple of weeks . " <p> While your approach may sound noble , does n't  look like its working . Lots of spouses have tried to get their significant others to lose weight , and the results have been the opposite . <p> Someone being a bit overweight and someone who is wrecking the family finances are two different issues in my opinion . Wrecking the family finances , infidelity , breaking the law , etc. severely impinges on the other spouse , and that is where a partner has a right to try and put a stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shape does not qualify to me as a deal breaker . If it did , the divorce rate might reach about 75% in the US ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @yvie This is why I 'm changing the strategy and instead of just demonstrating the problem , I 'm following through and helping to fix it . Finances are ultimately secondary to happiness . We have money so we can enjoy life and create opportunities . We have health for the same reason . A bit overweight turns into quite overweight which turns into obese and eventually morbid . It is simply a symptom of the wrong attitude towards physical health just like paying minimum on credit card balances is the wrong attitude towards financial health . <p> Of course it ultimately comes down to which values are very important to you . The main problem is asymmetry . If one person in the couple has saved while the other has spent , can the former reasonably choose to upgrade their lifestyle if the other is still struggling to pay credit card bills ? Or for a vacation , suppose the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedentary would prefer a " sedentary vacation " . Should the former be forced to always pick the latter because the latter is simply incapable of the former ? <p> yvie said , <p> @Jacob : <p> You got me on that one . I 'm lucky so far because my husband likes to be active on vacation like me , even though he could lose a few pounds . I would be frustrated with a spouse who could n't be active . I 'm not sure I would want to divorce him over it , but it would reduce marital harmony . But then again , few marriages are super compatible . <p> On the other hand , I do a lot of active things with other people besides my spouse because he cant keep up with the level physical activity I like to take part in on a regular basis . Lucky for me I have a couple of very fit sisters who live nearby , as well as me enjoying doing activities solo . <p> You are right ; it does boil down to personal values . Have a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my hubby having that attitudeHOWEVER , one of my best friends writes an awesome blog about weight loss/eating healthfully not as self-control , but as self-caremaybe if you could get your wife to follow that shift in thinking , it would be easier for her and you . Just offering some thoughts . If you 're interested the blog is http : **32;577;TOOLONG <p> Amanda <p> Theevildrsin said , <p> Its definitely about communication and " being the change " . Its worth letting a few dollars go in the name of relationship harmony . Lecturing definitely does n't  work as well as encouraging saving or exercising through positive reinforcement and example . And no matter what , do n't  secretly turn down the water heater or thermostat incrementally . That last turn down will get you caught and then all hell is going to break loose ! <p> IngaG said , <p> Jacob , <p> Weight gain is not necessarily a sign of immaturity . There could be a number of other subtle mechanisms at play . <p> For example , I was bordering on overweight when I lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cope emotionally . And extra weight acted as an excuse to avoid taking opportunities and putting myself into situations I felt uncomfortable with due to insecurity . <p> When I gained confidence and feeling of security I lost weight and became more active . But to do that , I had to accept myself and have people close to me who accepted me as I was . <p> If I had a spouse whod be paying attention to it all the time ? I would have NEVER gotten to the place of security in my head that I needed to actually make change . And I know it because my mother , whom I am very close with , acted the same way as you from pointing out the problem to moving to helping to fix it . Did not work at all ! She also did not believe in unconditional love but she had to learn the hard way to stop pointing that out . <p> I second the above comment . I am lucky in having a frugal spouse . We have many shared goals . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I should add frugality to my list of requirements : intelligence , good sense of humor . <p> After many years , I have to say that my husband tells terrible jokes , so all has not worked out as planned . <p> firefighter jeff said , <p> Eric , Your wife sounds exactly like mine . Doing without her creature comforts is not an option for her . I could live in a treehouse and be perfectly content , whereas she would cringe at the thought . We do agree on major money issues though , however she is n't nearly as " extreme " as I would like her to be . I gave up trying to change her mindset many years ago ; no amount of persuasion will ever make her want to go camping or hiking or work in our garden . Not going to happen . So that left me with coming up with creative ways to accomplish my goals while taking care of her needs at the same time . What you lose in one area you gain in another . You can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even pure luxuries such as smart phones and eating out a lot . Children do n't  preclude early retirement either . I 've always liked the challenge of having my cake and eating it too . Of having what I wanted without debt while still young enough to enjoy it . Its all doable ; you just may have to adjust some of your timetables . <p> " one way would have been to start camping and make the trips longer and longer after which I would combine this with the suggestion that if we started camping full time " Had to laugh at that one ! I definately have camping on my list of things I do n't  like to do . It would not escape my notice that I did n't  have my bed . <p> Enjoyed the post and all the follow-up discussions . <p> Mirwen said , <p> @Eric @firefighter jeff <p> I think one way to have better success with a non-frugal spouse is to highlight efficency/waste rather than deprivation . <p> For example , let 's say your wife wants a designer item . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Maybe buy a gently used item on ebay . I get $125 shoes I love for $25 this way . Once your spouse sees that its not about giving up what they want , but not being wasteful so they can have *more* of what they want , I think they may come around . Then , once frugal habits are established it is difficult to go back to being a spendthrift . <p> Myakka said , <p> There is a path in between letting someone do whatever they are inclined to do ( that you find unsatisfactory ) AND becoming dictatorial and trying to compel them into doing what you want them to . <p> I have talked about this elsewhere , but it is of most relevance here . NonViolent Communication ( NVC ) teaches that it is possible to have a dialog with the other person that seeks to meet both peoples needs . <p> For each need there is a multitude of strategies to meet them with . <p> Taking the example of your DW , Jacob , and doing a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go something like this : <p> After a greeting and catching up on the days news , and otherwise connecting , you express something like this , " I have expressed to you before that I am troubled by your lack of exercising because I really care about you and my need to have you be healthy is n't met by that . Would you tell me what you have just heard me say ? " ( NVC says that OFNR Observations Feelings Needs and Requests are the key to establishing good communication with another person . ) <p> You so check and confirm that she has heard your concern and that she has n't  projected in to the communication that you are intending to violate her need for autonomy which will be helped if you can go into the conversation with the conviction that you only want her to exercise if she is willing to do that . Often attitudes are more important than words in this in my experience . <p> Next you try and determine what needs she is meeting by not exercising . ( According to NVC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need even though some of those actions are not very good ways of doing that . ) She expresses the notion that exercise is boring her need for doing things she finds interesting is n't met . She expresses the idea that it is n't acceptably feminine to get all sweaty and be good at athletic pursuits her need for social acceptance is n't met by exercising . <p> Then you propose alternatives that seek to meet these needs while exercising . Hopefully you find at least one that is acceptable and in time implement it . <p> Maybe this will help someone . Interpersonal conflict between people is an area in which NonViolent Communication has lots of useful ideas and techniques for . <p> kat said , <p> At first my DH was reluctant to go along with the whole money saving idea . So , we started small . Eventually the savings started to snowball and the amount we needed every month was getting less and less . One day when he came home heart broken and absolutely miserable at a job that crushed his soul . I looked him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been talking about , saving money so that we can live our lives on our own terms and not anyone else 's . Quit . We do n't  need the money . Well figure something else out . " That was a year ago . Even though we are on one salary we have still managed to save 25% of my take home pay . He just finished a six week training program for a skill that should land him a higher paying job doing something that he considers valuable . But , most importantly , he gets it now . We are on the same page , we are working toward getting the mortgage paid off in the next 2-4 years and then we will focus on saving for early retirement . It 's not impossible to convince a spouse . You just have to show them how it benefits them . <p> Henk said , <p> @Jacob , does your wife read these comments on her as well = My wife would kill me if I would write about her in that way , because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mature relationship indeed allows that you can help each other in life , but a lot depends how you bring it , but may be there is a cultural difference between USA and Europe on how to approach this . <p> I have a little advice about the lovely wife . Being a wife myself and never having had my husband really put too much stock in my weight ( I 've always been in the low end of my BMI ) I was recently before my first child I think 15lbs overweight . He never mentioned it , but I saw a photo of myself and saw my mid section looking a bit big . I decided for myself I wanted to change it . He was supportive , if not worried at times that I was n't eating enough , but I healthily took 6 months plus to lose 15lbs . I felt so much better about myself , healthier , and then promptly gained 35lbs in my 9 months with my son = I again lost it all and then some nursing my son , now am up 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing to me about weight ( yes he shouldnt because Im pregnant but let me continue ) and I am still feeling wonderfully about my body . What may help you , is to NEVER ever mention her weight , ever . Women are strange creatures , if you mention our weight , we believe we are unattractive to you , physically and mentally . We will self destruct more . I 'm not saying your not attracted to her , I 'm saying she will feel this way . Yet , I have a compromise . Plan dates and activities that are active ( even just walking a few miles holding her hand talking about past present and future ) if she asks , its about health , never weight . Its not about size , but the future . If she presses you ( " You just want to walk because you think Im FAT ! " ) take her hands and tell her . " I did not marry you for today , I married you for every day after . No matter what size or shape you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Its not an option . I can not plan a future without you . I want us to take care of each other , like you 'll have to keep my healthy emotionally , physically and spiritually , I have to do the same for you or I fail you as a husband . I cant fail if I want to see us grow old . " Also get to the root of the problem . People are n't  over weight just because they eat to much , they over eat or under eat or stress out to the point the body clings to every bit it can due to self preservation . Is she stressed ? Have you ever said the words love is not unconditional ? That only sounds like abandonment to a woman . Is she eating enough healthy fat ? Without healthy fat ( butter , cheese , milk , fish , nuts etc ) the body will not let go . Plus a womans diet should not look the same as a mans . Not in calorie , quantity or even style . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a big reader here and have used a lot of your advice in my own life and its helped . I hope this helps even a little . <p> Tom said , <p> I can be frugal for my things as much as I want but I cant force my wife to be frugal for her things . For the things we share we have to agree together , means I have to give up on my frugality if she does n't  agree to my ideas and to go her way . Sure I understand that it means both of us should work more long years but we do it together . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

You should definitely subscribe to his blog . <p> A few months ago , I had an inexplicable need to start writing about personal finance . Why ? Because the people of the United States just need some serious schooling , and I could n't hold back the urge to add my voice to the still-small chorus of people dishing out these lessons . <p> Every time I walk past a Starbucks drive-through lineup of Idling Cadillac Escalades and then return home to read about record levels of foreclosures , bankruptcies and complaints about our **33;639;TOOLONG gasoline , I become fired up again . Every time people complain about not having enough money to raise their kids while continuing to buy new products on credit , it forces me to write even more . <p> The reason I must write is because I am somewhat of a alternate version of Jacob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but to try to optimize my money earning and spending in the same way that software engineers compulsively optimize their code to be as simple and efficient and self-evident to future software engineers as possible . In the industry , they call it " elegant " . To me , money feels just like software . If your earning and spending is not elegant , then its crappy , and you are causing suffering to you and your species and planet by not optimizing it . Its an emergency ! <p> Because of this optimization , my software engineering career was short-lived . I had put aside enough money to support a middle-class lifestyle with a wife and young son shortly after the age of 30 , so it was no longer efficient to keep trading free time for more money . <p> And it turned out that not having a real job was a LOT OF FUN ! I took on all the challenges and hobbies I never had time for . I got to read , write , exercise , learn , camp , hike , bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep the driveway on Thursday morning in my pajamas , AND my wife and I get to be double stay-at-home parents . Our 5-year-old boy is completely flourishing with this unlimited attention as we read through hundreds of books together and keep advancing to new levels of learning in all sorts of fields just from getting to spend time together . I 'd recommend it to any parent ! <p> But the rest of the world was not getting any more efficient . I saw the gullibility of the poor and middle-class citizens of the rich world , and the way in which the more advanced corporations are able to take advantage of this gullibility to keep everyone forking over most of their income in debt payments . And it just seemed more ridiculous with each passing year . At first , I just spent my creative energy on making fun of people . It is after all kind of funny to watch people causing their own financial destruction and then angrily blaming the president for their fate . <p> But then I realized it would be even more fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point I discovered the Early Retirement Extreme blog , as well as assorted other ones on the web , many with quite a large following . The following is large , but the number of people who know nothing about personal finance is still much larger . And despite their ignorance , most of this larger group would actually LIKE to be in control of their money , and become rich , and be able to quit their jobs like the personal finance bloggers have . <p> So a new superhero was born . His name is Mr. Money Mustache , and he is basically the persona that is constantly talking INSIDE my head when I see the rest of the world making stupid financial decisions . Mr. Money Mustache is bossy , and he has strong opinions . But he is also quite knowledgeable and a good listener .

@@42287631 @2287631/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> On labor day I went sailing on Ds 21 foot two masted sailboat on the local reservoir . Having been reading cruising and sailing books for a couple of years by now , this was the first time ever I have actually stepped onto a boat that is bigger than a rowboat but smaller than a ferry . It was nice to connect some of the words from the books to reality and I think I got the hang of it pretty quicklyits much like flying or glidingand I even got to be the skipper for a while . <p> Based on one four hour sail where we were beating against the wind for three hours or so and then running with the wind wing-on-wing going back for an hour over a distance that would take 5-6 hours to run by foot in total , I think I could absolutely get used to this form of travel if the activity translates well into a 30 foot cruiser . Also , if I could mount some ships cannons ? <p> First , there 's a level of skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a driver . Second , there is ultimate responsibility : No time-outs . Third , and much more importantly , unlike flying or even driving , which I find much like riding an elevator or using a transporter ( what , you do n't  have a transporter ? ) , there is an actual feeling of moving than I can relate to my human size and human sense of speed . I think driving and particularly flying is so fast that it is impossible to get a feeling of true distance . Hence places become merely a network of connected airports and the world becomes a large place not due to its actual size but due to the large number of different destinations one can punch into expedia or orbitz . <p> To compare , the nearest next city is about a 7 hours march away . <p> It is said that out of every ten thousand that want to go cruising , only one do so . This sounds like reasonable odds to me = It certainly holds a sense of wonder to me to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than sitting in a tin can like tuna fish 40,000 feet up , not like tuna fish . Imagine the freedom . <p> Having just passed an investment milestone , Im now richer than ever ( not very rich compared to some of you , I know ) , but on an absolute scale I would have the money to complete this : $50,000 for the boat , and the rest to draw $500 a month for supplies for two people . Maybe $50,000 will not be enough for a true blue water cruiser , but let 's start with the Caribbean , eh ? After all , it should take 5-10 years , at least , to get the required experience . <p> I think this also solves the problem of not having long term goals . How about this ( each project taking about 10 years ) <p> Get PhD and publish a paper in an international journal ( actually , I went to 25 ) . Done ! <h> 28 users responded in " Traveling by sail " <p> As much as i share your dream about having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Especially one with two masts and the size you 're describing will be far more expensive unless , which i 'm sure you 're planning on doing , you buy it used . But even then i do n't  know for sure . <p> However , also take into account that ships have a higher chance of getting damaged due to its usage and weather influences . This will increase your average repair and maintenance costs compared to your current RV . Also , if you 're planning on doing any serious sailing , healthcare will be very far away when you or DW might need it . <p> And then there 's the limited possibility of moving around like biking , hiking etcthose could only be done once docked . <p> I guess in my opinion it would be great to have a sailboat because its awesome ! But to live on it permanently ? I 'd have to say no <p> Mo said , <p> There are several good options for boats in that price range , Pacific Seacraft Orion model ( or possibly a Dana model ) , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to circumnavigate in one of those , but you could reasonably expect to get around the caribbean in one . I 'm not saying you could n't circumnavigate in one , but you may not want to . I crossed the Atlantic in a much larger boat I never wished for a smaller boat , that 's for sure . <p> Back when EBay was just becoming popular , a friend of mine and I kicked around the idea of buying a boat at auction , with a price limit of $10k , then refurbing and outfitting it , and seeing how much we could reasonably do with the boat mostly coastal cruising , and perhaps to the Dry Tortugas . We never did though we got jobs and families , and the standard lifestyle you can imagine <p> In a shameless plug for the florida and the keys its a great place to sail and pick up some of the experience you may be looking for . <p> Maus said , <p> $50K for the boat is not the problem , nor is $500/mo. for supplies . Its the lack of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some type of payment to anchor , take on water ( and electricity , if desired ) and jettison sewage . In nice places ( my only experience is with California marinas ) this can add up to several hundred dollars a month . <p> Nevertheless , cruising is a great way to practice a minimalist lifestyle . You really cant have a lot of excess crap if you want to live comfortably . Read the novel " Lila " by Ronald Persig for a great take on life aboard a boat . <p> I love sailing ! Ive been looking for a blogger who was saving up to cruise around the world so I would be excited if you choose to go cruising . My advice is to plan for a smaller trip on someone elses boat first so you get the hang of it . Cruising long distances is nothing like a day sail . But it is amazing . Good luck ! <p> fubek said , <p> Great idea , go for it ! I plan to cycle the world , and get a boat later when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free time , you might consider a home built boat . There are several companies that sell suitable plans . <p> The amount of time required is substantial . Many home-builts never get finished , but you seem to be good at beating the odds . <p> I have been lurking on your blog for sometime but this drew me to comment since it is what I plan for my ERE , at least the beginning of it . I wonder which books you 've been reading about cruising . One I 'd recommend is , " Voyaging On A Small Income " by Annie Hill . Its the story and how-to of her and her husband and how they live on a sailboat and travel the world for $3,000/year . This was in the late 1980s , so perhaps the figures a bit higher , but it ca n't be by much . Theyve crossed the Atlantic over 16 times . <p> After reading that I think you 'll find your $50k figure for a boat to be 4 or 5 times higher than it need be . Just troll around the craigslist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will see the bargains to be had . Perhaps buying a solid older boat and updating it and redoing the cabin with your ample free time would be a better prospect than blowing $50k on something you think you need . <p> You have to buck convention a bit . Which should n't be a problem for you . Annie Hill discusses how each time her husband and she got a new boat , they would move into a smaller one . At first nothing smaller than 40 ' seemed reasonable , then 32 ' was better , then I believe they settled on something smaller than 26 ' . It was just easier/cheaper to maintain so they spent more time sailing and less time maintaining a sailboat . They discuss alternative rigging and sail setups to minimize cost and maintenance , and how they almost never pay dock/mooring fees . <p> Do n't  let people discourage you from this dream . Like a lot of other things , most peoples idea of the minimum needed for comfortable cruising winds up soaring the costs of the activity so high that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land discouraging other non-millionaires from even trying . <p> Hopefully well bump into each other in a calm , remote bay sometime . Just give me a few more years . <p> wonderlake653 said , <p> Not farfetched in the least . Go for it . I am sure there are plenty of people these days who are selling very nice boats in your price range <p> You probably have all the info and links you want about the sailing life but I just happened to come across this link while trolling ha ha.http : //sailingsimplicity.com/ <p> ron said , <p> I would buy a small sailboat and sail locally.Do more reading , i had similar thoughts as yours , the pleasent thoughts of sailing off into the sunset are not as realisitic as hurricanes ( man the storys ive read about storms hitting the islands off florida , scary stuff ! ) while ive sailed for years , when you study the true costs of cruising with a sailboat , i decided if i would do it , i would use a motor sailer , small diesel , steadying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your story is so amazing I hope you still publish your book ( e or print ) as one of those long-term goals : ) You could also start a sailing-around-the-world blog . I 'd love to try a short sailing trip , but to go around the world , that 's a bit frightening . Maybe not if you just hover near the coastlines , though . <p> I 'd like to get your opinion on these so-called " microbusinesses " that some bloggers promote as a means to financial freedom . That is , having one or several products ( information or physical ) that you sell via a website , keeping business expenses to a minimum , and generating passive income for all your financial needs . <p> I 'd like to hear your thoughts on this approach , as opposed to one such as you took that is , working a relatively high-paying job , practicing extreme frugality , and becoming a very knowledgeable and competent independent investor . <p> Cheers , congratulations on all your success , and keep up the great work . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Derek My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . You can match or exceed my income with the following jobs : Tollbooth attendant , long haul trucker , UPS delivery truck driver . Anyway , I think it depends on how passive that income truly is .

How long would it take before the online drop-shipping business model reaches market efficiency starts paying what it is really worth ( probably not much ) ? I think to put it generally , if you depend on a micro-business , you are not very diversified , and the question is also how " passive " the income is .

I do not consider sailing to be easy and I 'm not really looking for comfort as much as I am looking for a challenge ( without killing myself in the process ) . <p> I am shocked to read this here , is this April 1st ? I sailed for 35 years and owned sailboats for 22 years . As much as I love sailing , owning a boat is the opposite of frugal in my experience , and I finally went boat-less last year and reducing my expenses considerably . The quotes all boaters know : The two happiest days for a boatowner are the day he/she buys the boat and the day he/she sells the boat. Better than owning a boat , having a friend who owns a boat. BOAT is an acronym for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainstream travel more as a form of " destination shopping " . If you flew to some airport in some countries and staid in some hotel for three days , did you really travel ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Midpack The idea is to only own the boat and thus save all the money otherwise spent on housing . There are a number of world cruisers professing budgets around $11-15k/year/boat . This is actually quite crazy considering that chartering a boat in the BVI for 10 days can easily cost $5k and that 's before adding plane tickets . <p> Windfeld said , <p> Recommended reading : " Dangerous Waters " by John Burnett . You can pick it up if you happen by Aalborg any time soon . : o ) <p> This is more than doable and from what Ive seen circumnavigate it usually is more of the captains ability than the boats . 50k is more than enough money and as most people including myself buy more boat than they need the first time set your sights on smaller rather than larger than move up when your list gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of boat is 30 ' +/- 2 feet . There are some really nice 28 footers and there are some really nice 32 footers. $500 a month is a little on the skinny side for expenses as you 'll need to haul out on occasion for regular maintenance which in an of itself will be 500 dollars or more . Throw in paint regular replacement of zincs oil , oil filters , fuel filters , diesel and the occasional marina slip fee just to be able to do laundry and take a real shower and the budget will be stretched a bit thin . Each island in the Caribbean will require you to purchase a cruising permit , you will need current charts for all regions should your GPS crap out God forbid . Do n't  shun technology it is your friend , you 'll need to understand regional weather , best time of year to travel and best time of year to be out of there and somewhere safe .

@@42287632 @2287632/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> You have probably heard the expression that " the first million is the hardest " . This has nothing to do with learning how to make money and somehow mastering it after the first million . In fact , it is equally hard to save the first 1 million as it is to save the first 100000 USD ; or more counterintuitively , the first 1 million or 100000 GBP , respectively . On the other hand , we never say that the first $100 or the first $1000 is the hardest . Why is this ? <p> It has to do with Benfords law . The simplest explanation I can think of is that the increase from 1 to 2 million represents an increase of 100% . Conversely , the increase from 2 million to 3 million is 50% , 3 to 4 is 33% , . and 9 to 10 is 11.1% . Hence , if wealth grows exponentially by compound interest , the first million is indeed the hardest , because imagine starting from 100000 , then 1000000 means increasing it by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a factor 2 . <p> Conversely , if money is accumulated linearly by working and stuffing money in the mattress rather than exponentially growing it by investing , the second million is as hard as the first million , much like the second $1000 is as hard as the first $1000 . <p> Let 's get technical ( see how much you remember from high school ) . If you start at 100000 and compound at 5% and plot a graph make a dot for each compounding period ( each year ) until you reach 1000000 , and then count up how many periods start with the number 1 , how many start with the number 2 , you will see that there are more numbers starting with 1 than 2 , more of 2 than 3 . <p> Interestingly this will be true no matter what currency you use ( ! ) . Hence , if you find yourself being unmotivated because your networth is one hundred and something convert it into a currency where it is sixty something thousand or seven hundred something thousand and you 're flying again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1 than 2 can be found from plotting the curve on a logarithmic scale . This will make an exponential curve linear . Since the dots are uniformly ( equidistantly ) distributed on the time axis and the line is straight they will be equidistantly distributed on the line . Now count how many dots fall on the logarithmic y-axis ( the money axis ) . You will find that the fraction of dots starting with 1 is log(2)-log(1) = 30.1% which is also the fraction of space that range takes up on the paper . The number of dots starting with 2 is log(3)-log(2) = 17.6% . Thus for almost half the time your net worth will start with either a 1 or a 2 whether that is 100000USD or 200000USD or 1000000GDP or 2000000GDP . <p> Once you leave the doldrums of ones and twos , it will go up quickly . Three-something will take up only 12% of the time and nine-something will only take up 4.5% of the time . <h> 12 users responded in " Benfords law and why the first million is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20% . I feel like 20% is the sweet spot , or the point where diminishing returns are evident . I think this law may help to elegantly summarize it , yet I 'm not confident that I am phrasing it right . <p> Is it correct to say that a 20% down payment leaves the lender with 100% ( 30.1% + 17.6% ) = 52.3% , a majority , of the compounding potential ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @pete I think these two issues are entirely unrelated . Downpayments are intended to eliminate risk of decreasing housing prices for the banks in case of a default . If you put 20% down and the market drops 20% , the banks can still recover all of their money by foreclosing the house . With 0% down , the bank would take the full risk and the full reward . Thus if banks become convinced that housing prices can only go up they would want to lend 100% ( or more ) on the price of the house . <p> Today , I learned about Benfords law from Jacob. - If you read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you apply Benfords law to an 10151 @qwx420151 <p> Also , banks like the sorts of people who can save 20% of a house price .

I 've used my bike instead of a car for 5 years now and just the other day learned to true my wheels . The feeling of satisfaction was amazing . I 've also experimented with bringing my rpm up to the 90-100 range ( up from about 65-75 ) as suggested in the previous " Effective Cycling " review post . So far Ive noticed it works the hamstrings and the upper quads more , that it makes riding much more aerobic ( I was rare before , but am now commonly breathing hard ) , that I can maintain high speeds for entire rides now instead of just short legs , and that hill climbing speed increased dramatically . So thanks again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike , glad that I do n't  have to worry about gears as my bike have none . 10158 @qwx420158 <p> Its also helpful to have the clearest conceptual idea of what you are trying to do . <p> The inherent spring tension in the derailleur makes the derailleur mechanism move towards ( under lack of counteracting tension on its cable ) to the high gear ( smallest cog ) of the bike . <p> so you release all cable tension ( or put the shifting lever in the position with the most relaxed cable position ) and then adjust the high gear range limiting screw ( so the derailleur is centered over the smallest cog with no cable tension ) . <p> Then you adjust the low range setting by limiting how far the derailleur can be adjusted to the low side ( largest cog ) using the range limiting screw on the low side of the derailleur mechanism . <p> You also want to make sure there is no loose cable once the derailleur is at this low setting . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

I know grilled foods taste good , but rational eating tastes even better . <p> Mo said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to waste money . It seems very few people figure out how much a car really costs . When I talk with friends about this they only remember the monthly payment on the vehicle . The down payment , insurance , gas , and maintenance are strangely acknowledged as expenses , but exact details of the numbers are rarely known offhand . <p> I convinced one of my friends that he should look into his automobile costs . We ran the numbers the difference between us was nearly $900 per month . Even worse , relative to those who post on this site , I suspect I have pretty high transportation expenses . <p> We constantly hear about the incredible cost of health care yet the average American consumer spends far more on transportation . <p> I completely agree with your post . I have made so many changes to the way I spend money these days . I refuse to buy more furniture or household stuff because I have enough to literally last through my lifetime . I never use the clothes dryer , the furnace or the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie or two but that 's it because we do n't  have cable any more . After two years of attempting to find a method of grocery budgeting that works for me , I am on the cusp of success and by that I mean I 'm not spending more than $100 a week on food for five adults . That 's a challenge in itself but I think I 'm getting there . It has been difficult for me personally to change my bad financial habits and it has definitely taken me longer than most to effect change but I am succeeding incrementally . <p> Glad to see you 're not anti-money/anti-stocks congrats on making those calls , that 's something I still need to learn !

Let me introduce you to my sister , turning age 57 this month : <p> 1 ) Returned to college in fall of 2007 for the first time since she graduated from junior college when she was 26 . She has recently been fired from a telephone solicitation job for being late too many times and telling off a contact . Reasons for returning ? Get a student loan and financial aid so that she can ostensibly " make a good wage " would have liked 87 yr-old mom to supply the money , but since mom is in deficit spending due to necessary elder care , she could only co-sign the student loan in winter 2008 after boyfriends green card is discovered " missing " and he cant support her . He believes his green card will be reissued in June 2008 . <p> 2 ) Agreement with family is that student loan of $30,000 is to pay for living expenses for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and possibly slightly more ) . Apartment she is renting costs about $800/mo , though there are cheaper ones of similar size . <p> 3 ) Upon getting the money , sister buys new furniture and two computers for her 2 bedroom apartment ( boyfriend who has no money and no job is living with her , so ostensibly she " needs " 2 bedrooms ) . Never mind that she was getting along without the furniture for 6 months and they could have shared one computer . <p> 4 ) The boyfriends $500 car continues to break down . They ignore my suggestions to ditch the car ( bus is available ) as she 's a student with no income . They also ignore my next suggestion to get another $500 car and ditch this junker . Instead , they spend $3,000 in multiple repairs to make it " dependable " and thus worth about $800 . Did I mention that they had to rip the carpet out of the car when someone spilled milk on the floor and did n't  clean it up ? <p> 5 ) She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead of finding a summer job , she decides she will take the summer as vacation and help her boyfriend with his green card status since there 's another hangup . <p> 6 ) The friend she left her two toy poodles with in fall 2007 can not take them on the next journey of his life , so she takes them back in late June 2008 . Her lease ( yes , like all poor people , she signed a lease ) allows 2 pets total , but only in the form of 1 cat &amp; 1 dog . Landlord let 's her know she is in violation of her lease and fines her $500 . Rather than find a home for the dogs , she instead breaks her lease ( $2,000 ! ! ! ) and finds another apartment on the other side of town from the college . First month , last month , and deposit on the new apartment are another $2,500 ( ? ) . Plus she paid movers to haul all that new furniture ( $200 ? ) . <p> 7 ) The student loan year-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of the financial future for my sister . Knowing that my sister hates figuring out math and finances , I relay what the costs of this student loan will be and how much inheiritance she can expect if she 's anticipating using that for loan repayment . Sister thanks me and says all is well . <p> 8 ) No bad news comes out of my sister until earlier this week . While my retired 65-yr-old brother is visiting from out-of-state , she calls and says she needs money for the electric bill . No , its not just the regular monthly bill because they 're going to shut it off which tells me she has n't  paid her bill in a couple months . Brother is here to visit family , so we drive 2 hours to visit her . While were there , the landlord serves a 72-hour eviction notice , thus confirming that she 's totally out of money already , 14 months after getting a $30,000 student loan for living expenses . <p> 9 ) Mom bailed her out this month , just to take the pressure off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know what she 's going to do next month . She had asked for $3,000 to get her through the summer and " then shell have a part time job teaching Hebrew because she can finish the class this summer and her boyfriend will have his green card " , but she 's burned all her financial goodwill from the family , so I do n't  know what shell do . Ironically , when she spurned my emailed short list of cheaper apartments from craigslist , she 's worried about breaking her lease ! 10156 @qwx420156 <p> George I have a relative that also likes to be a " professional student " and " earn " money via student loans rather than work a full time job . I shudder to think how in debt they are . I think they are counting on earning a better wage like your sister .

He was constantly quitting a string of jobs because he did n't  think he was getting paid what he was worth .

The problem is that you have to have the responsiblity and maturity to manage your money . I only make $10/hr at home and while some things were a stretch I was able to support myself and a child .

School clothes had to be kept clean and play clothes was something one changed into after school . The washing machine is sometimes said to be the factor of the 20th century that liberated women .

Yea , I know , I have a lot of clothes , but most of them are items I 've had for more than a decade or so .

I do n't  know a single person who owns a dryer . Everone line dry their lundry , despite the fact that we have cold winters and many people live in the appartments .

I 'm really stunned when I sometimes see a comment saying that your advice is so great . I have impression that some people just do n't  think or are too lazy to make an effort to think . I still think your blog is great since it helps so many people to realise that life can be less complicated and much cheaper , but I cant stop to be amazed at times = 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @mm Haha , indeed . Sometimes I 'm surprised to be informed that some of my advise is illegal . For example , some home owners associations forbid people from line drying the clothes . Maybe this is the one good reason to travel . <p> Im amazed too by the fact that its illegal , in some places , to line dry clothes ; how can less energy usage not be encouraged everywhere ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @laura Superfluous consumption can be seen as a sign of powerI must be rich since I can afford to waste so much .

Ill have to test it out . I normally hang my work clothes on hangers in doorways . <p> I never really thought about this statement , but I think it is absolutely correct : " Thus once laundry got faster we simply started doing more of it . " <p> My schedule I wear my office clothes 2-3 times before washing and change into my play clothes ( shorts/t-shirt ) when I come home from work . I usually do one load of laundry each week t-shirts/socks/underwear and another every other week or so work clothes , etc . <p> I definitely have a lot of friends who change their clothes three times a day , but then they wash all of those clothes after only having worn them for the first half of the day . Such a waste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their clothes have mysteriously become dirty . <p> Oh yes , I definitely agree with you that people do laundry way too often ! I cloth diaper my kids and have lots of extra laundry to do because of that , but even so , I find myself washing far fewer loads than some . Some people I know put things in the wash after an hour of wearing them . Forget the wear and tear on the clothes- why are you paying the electric and water bill for that ? <p> Anyhow , I 'm new to your blog and really glad I discovered it ! <p> jd said , <p> Clotheslines are n't  allowed where I live ( we tried , but were told to take it down ) , but drying racks seem to be permissible . I guess the racks are n't  so " unsightly " , and probably seen as less " permanent " . It cost more to buy a sturdy drying rack than string up a line , but it has already paid for itself . <p> Line drying became coded as " poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenements from the early 20th century . Breast feeding has been similarly coded as poor . Interesting , I thinkin how public displays of either are treated in communities . <p> Another woman said , <p> I 'm too lazy to line-dry outside ; using a drying rack indoors right next to the washing machine works great in all weather . And we wash everything in cold water , which saves energy and money and still gets everything clean . Every once in a while a towel will start to smell like mildew ; then a few hours in the sun is needed . <p> Its funny how germ-phobic Americans are these days . As long as I smell nice , who cares how many times Ive worn a piece of clothing before ? <p> Jenn said : " I think we can all agree on fresh under garments and socks daily , " <p> Not me . I agree with underwear daily ( although in a pinch I have turned a pair inside out and worn them a second time ) , but I wear my socks more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing my shoes . As soon as I get home from work , the shoes and socks come off . I have a different pair of socks that I wear with my running shoes , and I wear them more than once b/c I only where them when I 'm running . <p> I do n't  agree with Jacobs idea of having the number of clothes to match the laundry cycle . I 've had occasions when my clothes werent dry by the next day ( on a drying rack inside during a damp , cold Oregon winter ) . So , I will wash when I still have a couple of days of stuff left . But I do n't  use a machine . I wash by hand in the sink or in a five-gallon bucket . So , when I have two pairs of underwear left , I 'll wash some underwear so that if they take more than a day to dry , I should be OK . <p> Britz said , <p> Line-drying and breast-feeding illegal ? ! <p> Damn , that blew my mind that 's all I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DW will get served another rant , I 'm afraid = <p> USA , Land of the Free indeed . I lived there for one year , and it was the most restrictive and oppressive place Ive ever lived ( OK , it was mainly in fun-hating Boston but my sense of freedom was strongly inhibited everywhere else too . ) . <p> When I read the comment about line drying being illegal I had a very hard time to believe that <p> But then , I hear a lot of hard-to-believe-things from the US . If I already feel Germany to be way over-regulated and partly oppressive , what would I do in the US ? Better not go there , latin america seems to be a lot more relaxed . = Actually , my little brother has chosen " simple life " , with assignments in Siberia , Ecuador ( 2years ) and now Guatemala , and although standard of living is fairly low water ?

When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked about europe : that you could rely on everything to be working as intended . The next sentence , that he would never trade his freedom for that . <p> Back to topic : I too have the impression you can not get decent clothing any more . If I buy jeans , they wear out in less than a year , regardless of their price 10G oder 90G , there is no difference . On the other hand , I seem to walk a lot more than most people , and seem to do so at a much higher pace ( that is , I walk ! Others creep . There should be a minimum speed on sidewalks ) The same with shoes : I used to buy high quality , all leather ( usually 100G+ ) , but soles continued ti wear out after a couple of months . Fitting a new sole every three moths or so is a. ) inconvenient ( shoe-makers tend to have opening hours that are incompatible with my duty hours ) and b. ) more expensive than buing a cheap pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them when worn out and buying new . Its a pity . <p> bigato said , <p> Guys , hand washing and line drying is so easy that I barely believe you talk this much about this . Only think about how much electricity you pay just to have a washing machine at home ! Is it worth ? I prefer to hand wash than work to pay the electricity bill . A washing machine and a dryer wont make you spend less time . Do the math ! <p> You mentioned that some advise is illegal . Recently talked to a person living in the Texas drought .

That 's why I always thought that a drying machine gets clothes the cleanest . <p> and then she said said , <p> one way to rarely wash socks ( or at least get multiple wears out of them ) is to wear merino wool socks . Icebreaker and Smartwool make great ( even lightweight sport ) ones . I rarely wash my socks and they do n't  smell . <p> CapnSensible said , <p> Wool clothes can be worn repeatedly , even socks ; I wear wool dress socks 3 or 4 times before they start to smell ! I dry clean my wool trousers maybe once per season . Woolen clothes do cost more , but they last long and look nice and do n't  need much washing . <p> Dave said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaying rags . <p> Really though I follow a similar routine , a set of play cloths for doing yard work and a normal set which gets worn multiple times between washing . <p> Lauren said , <p> I grew up feeling weird about wearing jeans two or three times before washing them , and now I wear them straight through and only wash when laundry day rolls around ( approx. every two weeks , like Jacob ) . Of course , I 'm only wearing them in the evenings and weekends , since I cant wear them to work . I do n't  wash anything unless its visibly dirty or smells , so work **30;708;TOOLONG get probably 7 or 8 wears , and even work tops get a couple . I will re-wear socks sometimes , because I 'm apparently the opposite of veganprimate and will only wear them around the house ( in the winter , to keep my feet warm ) ; most of my shoes are worn without socks . I even re-wear workout clothes once or twice , because they 're just going to get smelly and gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way to start . <p> Jessica said , <p> So interesting to read the differing levels of comfort with rewearing clothing ! I got ta be honest , I wear my socks 2-3 xs between washes ( unless its summer , in which case I do n't  wear socks ) , same for stockings and leggings and t-shirts . Caveat : I go shoeless at home , its how I was raised . Usually wear a thin cotton layer between wool and the body , which means I often go all winter without washing my woolens , and then do 1 big load right before stowing them away for the summer months . Exercise clothes usually get used twice before I wash them . <p> As a woman , I find it helps to stick to specific color palettes and to strategically invest in classically cut , neutral garments . For example , I have one black wool cardigan Ive worn 1-3xs/week , for 6 years now ; I also like to mix grays and browns and whites with pops of autumn colors . And Jacobs right , handmade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my destresser , so I 've just vowed to buy no new supplies until I work my way through my current stash : - ) . I figure thatll take me 5 years , ha . <p> jgordo said , <p> What do you guys do when the pollen is bad ? I 'd love to dry clothes outside but we have allergies and I 'm not sure how to make this work . <p> Eric said , <p> Since I 've gone to manual laundry washing my entire understanding of laundry has changed . I found out I only need a couple each pair of shorts and trousers about 3 to 4 T-shirts , and about 5 to 6 pairs of socks and underwear . I still have a lot more than that simply because I used to use laundry machines all the time . And I will keep most of them simply because I do n't  want people thinking I 'm poverty-stricken by wearing the same sets of clothes every week . Plus there 's a small collection of suits for rare formal affairs . But thanks to doing manual laundry , unless fashions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy any more clothes for another decade or more . <p> Jeff said , <p> I like to avoid driers wherever possible and to line dry in my back garden . However the drier is handy in the middle of the winter . I always put a new t-shirt on every day , that 's the layer that gets sweaty . <p> Back in the 1950s when I grew up Mum would only wash our woollen clothes at the end of winter and I was amazed when friends mothers washed theirs once a fortnight . It seemed so extravagant and unnecessary . But we were talking about proper wool , not synthetic garments which tend to smell and absorb dirt faster . We did spot clean whenever it was needed , daily if necessary . <p> And after a lifetime of hanging clothes outside to dry I am still doing so and do n't  even own a drier . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

Now imagine like inside a drum when it rains on it . Fortunately , it only rains a couple of weeks a year , that is , fortunately for us ; it is not so fortunate for the agriculture of California . <p> The second problem is that our roof is old . It should probably be replaced . However , this would cost several thousand dollars . This is a steep price to pay , when we are parked in a place with so little rain . Still , I do n't  want to repeat lasts years routine of climbing around on the roof with a tube of dicor sealant at every opportunity . Hence , I have been looking for other solutions . <p> Obviously the first solution would be to send the RV for a roof replacement .

Now , I do not think I am qualified to do a roof repair , that is , if I had all the time in the world , I could probably get it done .

Were talking about covering something that is 8x34 . This would cost $2000-2500 and it would be a semi-permanent installation . <p> A tarp canopy similar to that of a car . This would cost $500 or so . My concern would be that this would need to be huge . We would have problems anchoring on the concrete patio side of the RV . <p> A normal tarp ( $150 ) strapped down with bungee cords and sandbags . <p> Which one did I pick ? <p> None of the above . I bought a discarded billboard ad on eBay . This is a tarp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarps and it is water proof and mild dew resistant , 10x36 ' . It cost me $30 plus $40 in shipping . I then got a grommet kit and extra grommets costing about $15 . I got some tarp bungee cords at $8 or so . And I got nylon and diamond braided rope , 200 ' total , $20 . <p> I spent the afternoon hammering the grommets in . I then rolled up the tarp and with a little help from DW I got it dragged onto the roof where I unrolled it . It was relatively painless but it took a few hours in total . However , now that I know how to do it , the next time I can probably do it on my own in less than a hournow that I 'm getting better at tying bowlines = . <p> So now our RV is covered by a big orange former billboard advertising AT&amp;T advanced TV(*) or something like that .

Rather than overwhelming the microscopic gutters , the water is running off of the tarp overhang about 6 ? from the walls .

That takes a lot of time . <p> tlblack said , <p> Jacob , I 'm just wondering , did you lay the tarp on the roof or did you raise it slightly ? I ask because I 'm wondering how much the tarp will actually muffle the rain sound if it is just sitting on the roof . Also , if you find a way to make it peak in the middle or have it sloped sideways like an A-frame , more rain will slide off the sides instead of making a swimming pool on your roof . . . . unless you WANT a swimming pool to save up the water . . . but it makes more sense to funnel the water off the side to store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you found cheap materials ! !

@@42287641 @2287641/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> It is important to realize that world views between different generations are different . This is a cause for endless confusion when discussing something like retirement or how a career would take shape . <p> I was born in 1975 and so I fall somewhere between Generation X and Generation Y. For example , I have a blog and I 'm on facebook , but I wont be first in line to get a cell phone permanently grafted into my skull and phrases like " were r u ? ! ! 1 " raises my blood pressure . In fact I never had a cell phone . I would n't know how to send an SMS without consulting the manual . The way I see the world is different from the Boomer generation and it is different from the GI Joes and the Silents . <p> If we start with work-life , different generations WILL see things differently . This is why you should take career advice from your parents generation with a grain of salt . It is why your values , which likely came from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality YOU live in . Because the world is ever changing . It is a dynamic system . <p> For Generation X there has n't  been a single traditional career track like there was for our parents and grandparents . Most of us will not stay with one company all our life but jump around for more than a dozen different positions and maybe even hold several different careers . Sure , there has been a " career track " but not so much in the sense that working hard would automatically be promoted as the company was expanding . If we wanted a career track we need to create it ourselves without getting creamed in the process . We 've generally found that 1 ) there is a huge oversupply of highly educated people meaning that wed have 10 qualified people to fill 6 positions ; and 2 ) company outsourcing and downsizing ( I call it fun-sizing , hahaha , hmm ) which turned the 6 positions in 5 , then 4 , then 3 , and then the company division moved to India . <p> How often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for applying .

Does n't  that tell you something , specifically , that we have the man power to build something enormous but for some other reason we either ca n't or wont . <p> As a consequence . generation X career strategy has not been about working hard but about being career smart . It became less about skills and putting the company mission first and more about degrees , certificates , networking and using every edge you could find to stay alive in a system which others had constructed and which from the managements perspective sees you as a disposable part that must be hired and fired to run as efficiently as possible . This is creates a very different perspective of the job/system compared to the perspective of the older generations who made and/or now control the system . <p> Keep in mind that I 'm not talking specifics , I 'm talking in general . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular situation does n't  match this pattern . You 're the exception . What matters is that the pattern holds for the majority .

Schools did n't  have fences . Now they do . Many parents would just love to have a GPS tracking their kids whereabouts , and if a kid brings something resembling a weapon to school , you 're likely to meet with child services . Also family dinner time is practically gone . This is the kind of generational difference in sentiments I 'm talking about . ) <p> If you ask the GI Joe or the Silent generation , retirement is thought of as being put out to pasture . It is what you do when you are too physically and mentally worn out from building and managing the brave new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in a home waiting to die . Conversely , if you ask the Boomer generation , retirement is turning into a second childhood . After having spent your 20-60s working a job implementing the ideas of your parents generation , now is finally the time to go and play and have fun . So you have 60 year olds buying Harleys and jumping on charter flights to bungee jump in New Zealand or playing cowboys and cowgirls on some dude ranch and so on . <p> I 'm generation X/Y . I retired from my career at 33 and I no longer work for a living ( by which I mean I do n't  do any kind of activities because I need the money ) . My retirement is different . I do none of the things so valued by the older generations ! I do n't  sit at home staring at the walls and I 'm not out there playing Disneyland and making up for 40 years of delayed fun . Rather than seeing retirement or more accurately my " pension " as something that lay at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the world which is more characteristic of my generation to make a decision to not work for a living . Everybody can make this decision . You can decide whether to sell your time for a living or you can decide to be an investor . To do the former , you learn a sellable trade and you get a job . To do the latter , you acquire assets and you use those to make money with . <p> So I picked the latter . That 's what I ultimately preferred . I 'm a lot better at managing resources ( like money ) efficiently than I am at showing up day after day and doing the same work over and over . I get bored . So I did what I needed to do . I saved most of the money I earned by becoming more self-reliant and less dependent on consumerism . I started investing my savings and at 30 I had enough of it to be financially independent of work . <p> To put things in perspective , I demonstrated a very typical Generation X attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pension plan , getting vested , putting in my time , and making monthly installments on my defined contribution plan , I looked at the " rules " of the game . How does the money system work ? Should I work to earn and earn to consume ? Or should I work to earn and earn to save and save to invest so I can stop working ? The financial system is there for you to " play " much like people " play " the career-game in the work-system . Two different systemssame attitude . You could say that in Marxist terms , I chose to go with " Capital " rather than " Labor " . Of course this " Ill pick whatever works for me and ignore the rest " jars with the older generations who say things like " You have a duty to work " and " What if everybody did what you did ? " " You must not disturb the social order , " " Stick to your class , worker " , " You were trained to fill a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must do . " I say " phooey ! " . That 's what you get for making a system which treats people like free agents to be hired and fired according to what 's profitable for the owners of the system . Sooner or later some of them will decide to take advantage of it and become owners themselves just like you . <p> Let me digress and explain what I mean by financial independence . It means having enough investments to support your lifestyle 100% . If you are financially independent , you do not need a job , you do not need " passive " income ( like from a blog ) , you do not need any handouts , you do not need a spouse to support you , you do not rely on the government . In practical terms you have a broker account and every month dividends from various companies are deposited into that account and you use it just like bank account . Its like having someone working for you . And in reality this is just what it is . People working for companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the generated profit . Alternatively , you could own real estate and having a management company run your properties . If you want to get really exotic , you could even own a bunch of patents and copyrights and live off the royalties . <p> Its very much like having a business . An investment business . You 're a private money manager . The main difference is that you answer to no-one but yourself . Thus you do not having to spend hours " managing " your investments which is another way of saying writing accountability reports to your employer/shareholders and scrambling for new clients . If you only answer to yourself , investing requires very little actual activity . What it mostly requires is " patience and understanding " , in short " wisdom " . <p> ( As a side-note , it is interesting how little " wisdom " is appreciated these days . ) <p> It takes some time getting used to " making money without working " . The hardest part is probably the fact that money comes from patience rather than effort . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 're continuously looking to " work " as the answer to your problems . How do I get more income ? More work ! How do I get a promotion ? More work ! With investments it gets weird . How do I get more investment income ? Well , you wait for a good buying opportunity . <p> Wait ! ? ? ! <p> How do I do that ? <p> That , my friend , is one of the things you have to find out . And you better get good at it too if you want to be a good investor . <p> Think of it as deer hunting with a rifle or a bow . The best way is to get a deer is to set up from a good position , be very still , and then wait for the deer to come along . You wo n't get very good results if you think work-effort will be rewarded and proceed to trample through the forest in search of deer . <p> ( Returning to the comments on wisdom . Who would you rather bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual hunting experience or someone young and full of energy ? Conversely , who would you rather bring to dig a trench ? Did I make my point well ? ) <p> It is yet to be determined what " retirement " will mean for Generation X and Y. Some people are deadset on trying to prove that " I 'm not retired " because I make money from my blog ( which incidentally is mostly on autopilotI write very few new posts ) and from sales of my book ( which also does not require any effort as it is already written ) . <p> I retired from my one career in physics . Depending on how you count , it lasted almost two decades if you include my all encompassing interest in physics which started at age 16 when I started reading all the college level text books I could get my hands on to the end of it at age 33 when I was publishing papers and giving talks and seminars at ( inter ) national labs and big universities ( you can look this up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years , four of which were in grad school . I worked for about three years after becoming financially independent until I finally grew uninspired ( relative to my other pursuits ) and decided to leave room for someone else . I 'd rather like to think that if you 're no longer inspired by your work , you have a duty to leave your job and make room for someone who is rather than hang around just to collect paychecks . Well , actually , you can do what you want . I 'm not the one to tell you what your duty is . <p> You could call me retired or you could call me a private money manager . Whatever . Its 11:40 am on a Friday as I write this . When Im done , I 'll go out and water my container-garden and then I 'll walk the dog . <p> I would only say " I 'm retired from physics ( my career ) " . I do n't  do any physics any more . I do n't  think about it anymore , like ever . <p> Who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant really tell you what I 'll be doing 15 years or even 5 years from now . I wont promise you that I 'll never earn money from a job ever again . It might be interesting to get a job . I would n't be the first one to become financially independent and stop working only to go back to work a decade later ; not because I needed to but because it would be fun . <p> The important point is not whether I work or not , but that I do n't  have to . In particular I 'm not nearly as tied down to space ( " I must stay in this region to get interviews or make money " ) and time ( " I can not afford/are not allowed more than 2-3 weeks of freedom every year " ) as people are when they work for a living and need to consider how their job-behavior might influence their resumes . I can go wherever and whenever if I want to . This creates a tremendous amount of freedom . Of course , the flip-side is that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most people are n't  used to being free and so would n't know what to do if they did n't  have someone telling them . This takes some time figuring out . Everybody has to figure out what they want to do . This can be extremely challenging if you have spent a lifetime doing what someone else wanted you to do . <p> Going from " working " to " retired " definitely requires a change of mindset . This can be difficult and some cant handle it . <p> I 'm not so sure that the term " retired " iswill be so fitting anymore . Many in my generation expect to get nothing from the social security were paying into . We fully expect the boomers to leave just about nada for us . Many people in generation X effectively save nothing . That is , they save money in a 401k alright , but then they get laid off and proceed to raid the 401k while scrambling for a new job . <p> I think going forward , we will no longer be dividing people into " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones who are retired " . We will be dividing people into " those who are financially independent and who choose whether to work " and " those who are not financially independent and who must work " . <h> 22 users responded in " What retirement is and means to me " <p> a couple of suit cases . If you want to achieve- early financial independence , then you will need to be a bit more extreme about it . This approach has its merits , but I am not willing to be that <p> on this topic of what " retirement " actually is ( he disagreed that retirement is about sitting on your butt and/or playing golf all day until you die ) and he also ended up taking up a job because he wanted to and not because he needed <p> Out of curiosity though have you ever tried using the term " independently wealthy " ? = <p> As for what retirement will be in a generation or two I do n't  think matters . It is looking more and more like well just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resources to deal with climate change and thus perish or the wealthy who continue to ruin the planet through greed . <p> D.T. said , <p> Long time reader and follower , and I think its my first time commenting <p> One question that I 've been meaning to ask you for awhile and that Ive been trying to figure out : During your time at work , did you invest heavily in 401K/403B options , or did you forgo all that to put money aside for your active management of investments ? <p> Great posts , very inspirational as my wife and I try to balance our way into retirement . <p> @D.T . I did not invest heavily in such plans until they were available to me which was only for a brief period of my working career . In general , people max out their tax-deferred plansbecause the money can ultimately be recovered prior to age 59.5 through rule 72(t)and then add further to taxable accounts . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @MM Independently wealthy , while technically correct , gives an image of being far richer than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever I tell someone I plan to retire around age 40 ( 11 years from now ) they almost always say something to the effect of " wont you get bored from not working ? " . The other common comment is " Yeah right , you 're being a bit optimistic . " 10 years of investing will be more than enough time . <p> At the risk of sounding to subjective or exclusive , I 'll say that Its my belief this is the correct mindset everyone should strive for . <p> Its definitely my goal , but I 'm nowhere near being there yet . In fact , I 'm still struggling with getting my priorities straight and sorting out existing financial issues ( debt due to education , etc . ) . <p> In any case , I 'm looking forward to the day I 'll be in your situation . Thanks for writing . <p> @Nikola I do n't  agree that it is the way for everyone and THE correct way to live . Its very appealing to me , but do n't  people have to work for the companies you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are content to work for 50 years saving 15 percent so they can spend 85% and live like kings instead of Spending 7 years saving 75% percent and living free. <p> " Should I work to earn and earn to consume ? Or should I work to earn and earn to save and save to invest so I can stop working ? " <p> This is what it all boils down to . The vast majority of the U.S. makes the choice to do the former , we 've chosen the latter . <p> One of my finance professors in college once told me , " Poor people work for their money , rich people have their money work for them . " While not necessarily a poor vs. rich thing , its the idea there are plenty of middle class folks that save and invest living below their means and eventually come to the crossover point where their investments can cover the expense of living . <p> This quote really stirred some thoughts for me , " Does n't that tell you something , specifically , that we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason we either ca n't or wo n't . " <p> What potential we have as a society , and we waste in on bureaucracy . <p> Ajay said , <p> " Many in my generation expect to get nothing from the social security we 're paying into . We fully expect the boomers to leave just about nada for us . " <p> This boomer was taught to never expect anything from social security and I 've been doing paid work since I was ten ! ( Warnings that the system was " running out " of money began at about the same time 1970 or so . ) Not quite sure who boomers were supposed to blame for that ; ) <p> Bottom line ? Generational wars are nothing newgive some thought to who benefits from defining " us " and " them " and pitting people against one another . <p> Interesting post . I really enjoyed your book , and I 'm working towards becoming financially independent . I think it is probably realistic , but another question is always " should one quit working full time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought in the back of my mind that I need to work and be productive Its a tough mindset to break , assuming that would be healthy . <p> I have held the belief that I can not count on any social safety net or any employer . That has lead me to save more than necessary all my working career . My savings also put me in a position to realize the following : <p> I do n't  want anyone to tell me what to do and always want to have a choice regarding whether I work or not and who I choose to work for ( with a great preference for working for myself ; ) . <p> Its the philosophy and the fundamental shift that the S household is struggling with . Its not choosing between coke / pepsi / ownbrand its choosing not to drink the sugar water . I 'm a bit further on the journey than my partner and it feels like the more I read , the further I am away but that 's probably because I have n't correctly reached the point where I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ribbonfarm I started with his Gervais principle and read all around the others . A clever chappy ! <p> Money is such a complex thing it can become really abstract really quickly . I picked a 1p coin up as I was riding up the escalator on the tube ( it was there in easy reach ) but I 'm also in the process of buying a new apartment that I suspect Im overpaying for to the tune of 5-10k . However , as I 'm moving out of my apartment , I do need somewhere to live <p> Its fluid , but its neutral . <p> Is man merely a mistake of Money ? Or is Money a mistake of man ? <p> gayathri said , <p> Well written Jacob . When you look at the ancient wisdom of India , there are 4 stages to human life- the first were you are a student and study for whatever time you feel like , the second is working , getting married and begetting children and doing your duty by your family , community and country for a set period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wordly desires and the so called drama . The last stage is retiring into the forest ( could be any place really ) and leading a life of contemplation and meditation . <p> Your thoughts resonate well with this concept , it does not matter what stage in life you are or whether you want to skip some of the stages.What matters is having the financial freedom to do anything or nothing at all in life and in the process discovering ourselves.I do n't  understand humans attachment to having fun and a distaste for doing nothing and getting bored . No wonder this insecurity makes them work more and for longer period of time <p> As you rightly said elsewhere , if you are needs are few and basic , you can live well with little or more money . <p> greenie said , <p> When I first graduated from college at 19 , I had no idea what I wanted to " do " career-wise anymore . I went to see the college career counselor and there I was introduced to the concept of " serial careers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career " ; a single stretch of 40 years or more of work , but rather many careers . She explained that maybe I 'd do " X " for 10 years and then change and do Y " . Well that I have to say was a novel idea to me at the time and I embraced it fully ! But that concept would have been odd to my parents , who stayed at one thing their entire working life . <p> So yes , I 'd say there are generational differences in how we approach careers , but even though I 'm a younger boomer , I 've been rather Gen X in my approach to many things . Its funny though because I have friends my own age who stayed at one job for 20 years or more and they are proud of that . They look with horror at my resume but it works for me . <p> I really get the idea of wanting to be FI . I 'm definitely not there yet , and too old to retire " early " . I spent a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , financially it was a disaster . I do want to be able to stop working because I need the money and still have time and energy to do what I want to do . The problem with work is that mostly I find it boring , doing the same thing every day . I hate being bored , but have yet to find work that challenges me . <p> I 'm good at saving money but not at investing it . I find the stock market scary so tend towards keeping my savings in low paying CDs and Money Market type accounts . I know this is " wrong " but since I ca n't handle losing any of what I 've been able to save , Im loathe to put it at risk . So saving this way means that I need to save even more money as the " returns " on my savings are almost nonexistent. 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287642 @2287642/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> With the price of milk going up up and away just like anything else that nominated in declining dollars , you might be thinking about what to do about it . Short of buying a cow , here 's my answer : <p> Stop drinking milk ! <p> Let 's face it sucking on the teat of a cow is simply unnatural unless you are a calf . Since you are reading this , I 'm willing to bet that you walk upright on two legs at the very least . Thus you are not a calf . <p> Doing some due diligence will reveal many counter arguments to drinking milk . Many people are lactose intolerant for starters . If humans were evolutionary conditioned to drink milk that would not make sense . In fact the few lactose tolerant people in the world are those who genetically/culturally have been drinking milk for many many generations e.g. Northern Europeans and a few others . <p> Actually , I did not give up milk many years ago in order to save money . I gave it up because I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk fresh . This was before hormones and preservatives became a natural ingredient . Back then milk turned sour in 5 days ! Who knows had I not been lazy and had I been unaware of the chemistry of modern cow fodder , I would probably still be drinking milk " to keep my bones strong " . ( Food for thought what do cows drink to keep THEIR bones strong ? ) . <p> Anyway , lazy won , and I got used to doing without milk . Admittedly DW buys it anyway from time to time it makes her happy so I get off the wagon and use some on my cereal . I never drink it though . <p> However , water works fine with cereal . I usually mix some oatmeal in with the rest , corn flakes , raisins , nuts , seeds , sometimes a dab of honey . This gives the water a nice taste . When it comes to bread , I use water . This will change the taste slightly I actually like water-based bread ( bread classic ! ) better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer revolution ) . Try it out . Just use the same amount of water instead of milk . In fact you can substitute milk for water in almost any recipe except maybe ice cream . <p> I read somewhere that cows milk is difficult to digest for humans ( too much protein ) , and that were the only animal on the planet to drink another animals milk . Not to mention all the lactose-intolerant people running around these days . <p> Ill all for giving it up as well , more so now that milk is becoming an ever-larger part of my weekly budget ! 10157 @qwx420157 <p> I was advised ( by someone who read it somewhere ) that the cows milk is easier for Blood Type A to drink . Blood Type O has trouble with cows milk , at least after a certain age . I believe this information comes from Dr. DAdamos blood type diet book(s) . <p> I drink rice milk , and noticed today that its not very much more expensive than cows milk : I saw a QT of store brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store brand organic/enriched rice milk for US$1.39 . ( Mid-Atlantic East Coast United States . ) <p> Great post . My wife and I had been pondering this very thing recently . <p> So do you extend this to all dairy products or just milk ? Why or why not ? 10158 @qwx420158 <p> I still like milk a lot , but I have started diluting it 50/50 with water when making such things as hot chocolate in the winter time . It tastes almost the same , costs half as much and lasts twice as long . I use it full strength for teawhich is my biggest addiction by far , irish breakfast tea with a tsp of sugar and a dollop of whole milk . <p> Almond milk is also a great substitute . And , of course , you can make " milk " from just about anything . For example , if you want to make almond milk just mix a cup of almonds with 3 cups of ( you guessed it ) water and desired sweetner if desired to taste ( we prefer agave ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . There you have it . I 've also made cashew milk . I have n't done a price comparision on the store-bought almond milk to my home-made kind . That 's my homework : to see if its actually cost effective . And , in response to Jacobs claim that water subs well in cerealWell , my wife and I have mostly cut out cold cereal ( we keep some around for when there 's no time to prepare oatmeal ) . But since I use just water in our oatmeal ( plus one bananathats all the sweetner needed ) , I see no reason why we could n't use water in our cereal . <p> Derek said , <p> Jacob , read the book the china study , overall great book and lead me to quit milk . I just changed to soy milk , but great idea i 'm going to try water . <p> Mneiae said , <p> Seriously lactose intolerant . Love milk , cheese , and dairy products in general . Will never give it up . So what if it makes me stay in the bathroom and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wow , I just gave up milk a few months ago . I did it because of the caloric load per glass . I used to drink 12oz of chocolate milk for breakfast every morning but then I realized that I had gained 20 pounds over 18 months . I took a serious look at my diet and decided to start changing it by cutting out the morning milk and substituting two scrambled eggs . Suddenly I was consuming something like 400 to 500 fewer calories per day and doing just fine . <p> I too would like to know what about cheese ? ! ? And have n't milk based products been around since the middle ages ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Q Cheese is worse than milk , yoghurt is better than milk ( according to memory ) . And yes , its true in Northern Europe . Most of the worlds population is lactose intolerant to some degree once they become adults ( because , frankly , its just unusual to drink what is supposed to be babyfood for another species ) . " Vikings " did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Robert Muir said , <p> The same argument against milk can , ( and is ) , used against grain products . Until 10,000 years ago , the blink of an eye evolutionarily , humans could not consume grains and subsisted purely from hunting and gathering . <p> The paleo-diet is based on what humans been bred to eat by evolution . Of course , if you believe that humans were created here 6,000 years ago <p> By the way , I 've been going without using shampoo since December . No problems whatsoever ! <p> Q said , <p> I have long hair how do I un-tangle it ? Then I could switch off shampoo/conditioner . <p> And how about all the advances in food , medicine etc . I often try to make food the way it was made long ago , but how far back can we go ? <p> We do n't  do or use half the things they did back in the 1600 , 1700 or even 1800s , let alone the stone age or say , Apocalypto age . <p> Hunter/gatherer-ers also worked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat worked perfect restored muscle mass , even though now we have beans and broccoli , etc . They also did n't  live as long , and I bet had heart disease or some sort of ailment that we would never really know . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Q Uh uh uh hunter gatherers only work about 15 hours a week . While this is more than me , its less than most people . Hunting is mostly about waiting ; its not so strenuous except in short bursts . <p> H-G lifespan is similar to ours ( and that 's WITHOUT the medicine we have available ) . Degenerative diseases ( heart , cancer ) are rare . They mostly die from infections ( modern medicine has to a large degree fixed this ) . <p> I have no background in this area , but it seems to me that that not being lactose intolerant and able to drink milk is a good thing . It adds an extra source of protein , calories , and variety in our diet . <p> I read ( I would link but cant remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special enzyme in their digestive system that helps break down and process milk . We however lose this enzyme around puberty . Once this enzyme is lost its actually pretty hard on our bodies to digest dairy . <p> S.Miller said , <p> Photoguy , most of us in the western world do not need an extra source of protein or calories in our diet . I think about 2 ounces of protein a day covers whatever it is that you need . Most of us are taking in more calories than we need as well . In addition to all this , I believe that cows in the US are treated with some of the same antibiotics that are used to treat humans in order to make them grow faster and not spread bad bacteria . However , when you do this , you may be giving the people drinking the milk antibiotics that they do not necessarily need leading to more antibiotic resistant strains of particular bacteria . <p> That said , I went from being a person who only drank soy milk to a person who drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more susceptible to things like osteoporosis , and you can get calcium from milk and other sources of dairy . I plan to go back to consuming much less milk in the future . <p> Interesting article . I am lactose intolerant so I do n't  drink milk as much milk . I do drink soy milk though and we usually buy them at Costco . <p> Chris L. said , <p> Do babys require cows milk ? I 've heard that babys need milk until about the age of 2 . Is this true or is it possible to raise a healthy child without cows milk and without breast milk after age 1 ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Chris L There may be some allergy issues if human babies get breastfed indirectly by cows rather than humans . <p> Lady Copper said , <p> I love almost everything about your blog Jacob except some of your diet advice . Like this about milk true , it is very popular right now for people to give up milk , say it is terrible for you , unnatural , etc. etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only " natural " drink for an adult human could be said to be water . If cows milk is unnatural , then give up all juices , coffees , teas , etc ( and soda obviously , but I doubt most of us drink that ) . <p> The milk you buy in a store nowadays is about as far removed from natural cows milk as it is possible to be . Hyper inbred for larger pituitary glands and fed incredibly unhealthy diets for the sake of volume of milk production , modern cows are very unhealthy and usually only live 3 or 4 years max , vs , 10 to 15 year " natural " productive life . ( BTW , dairy farmers are in a hard place prices they get per 100 lb of milk are still about the same as 60 YEARS ago ! ) Most cows have chronic illnesses and there is a great deal of pus and infections that make it into the milk -the USDA has certain " acceptable levels . " Killing the bacteria by pasteurization does not remove the impurities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , store-bought milk from sad and diseased cattle is a terrible and poisonous substance . I do avoid it whenever possible , especially since learning about the Johnes disease in cattle/Crohns disease in humans connection . <p> HOWEVER , grassfed raw milk is AWESOME ! First , it naturally contains lactase , the enzyme needed to digest lactose . ( Calves do n't  produce enough lactase either all on their own , interestingly ) So , the majority of " lactose intolerant " people CAN tolerate raw grassfed milk just fine ! Also , pasteurization kills phosphatase in milk , which is what is necessary to absorb the calcium effectively . Raw milk enables you to get all the benefit of the calcium in what truly is one of the most bioavailable forms out there . Grassfed raw milk is at least as healthy for you as wild salmon research the CLA and other benefits found in it . Cattle are designed to eat grass and they are happy , healthy , and long lived when they are able to get all of their nutrition from grass and NOT grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such that experiments have been done infecting raw milk with pathogens and the antibodies killed all the germs ! The milk also has properties that help irritated stomachs and intestines . <p> Finally , in personal experience , I started drinking grassfed raw milk 4 or 5 years ago . I was worried it might taste weird . It has subtle flavor differences in each swallow , like a good wine , but it tastes great . I am lucky to live in CA where I can buy it in stores and even though it is super expensive it is the only milk I buy now . For a few months last year I stopped buying milk because I was trying to save $ . I did not miss it much at the time but my health did go down you could say that I was just not balancing my diet well enough , but I will say that my body really , really craved the milk . As soon as I bought some and took the first sip , my body was like " phew ! " Obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have gotten several friends and family members started on it too . They have all noticed a difference for the better . Please do not say that all milk is bad and unnatural for humans we humans constantly do " unnatural " things , and many of them are good , like reading . The way the milk is produced is what makes a difference . Oh , and grassfed cattle can not only use land that is unsuitable for farming , but properly managed they vastly increase soil health and fertility . <p> Water with cereal should be outlawed ! If you have kids milk is pretty much a necessity .

Naturally , there 's this popular idea that TV feeds the masses with certain values , but I believe this is exaggerated .

We ditched the cable and have been with out reception ever since . <p> People are shocked when we tell them we have no tv . Its strange how we have gotten to a place where people think that going without tv is impossible . I agree with all that you say above . It robs you of your time . Its a form of consumerism .

In this mode it can be a source of food for thought especially if one chooses shows which tend to be thought provoking . But those thoughts happen in the time AFTER it goes off when I mull over what I have just seen and think about it . <p> Internet usage is IMO best used on this same premise . Not one video or site viewed on and on one after another ; but stopping and taking time to ponder and consider what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life rather than just becoming another addiction . <p> It takes control and mindfulnesssomething I admit I have sometimes lacked .

Commercials are termites in the structure of our mental well-being . Of course , we can spend too much time reading blogs and such , too , but the mental stimulation of the Internet is much , much greater than TV , even " educational " TV . As for video games they can be immersive to the point of addiction , but mostly they 're so inane that I can easily avoid them .

How do ere folks justify replacing a free want with a fixed recurring cost or series thereof ? Is this merely a way of drawing a cultural distinction between voluntarily low income and involuntarily low income folks ? <p> When I was young I LOVED TV . And I still do ! But I noticed the type of shows I preferred were sci fi , fantasy , or supernatural type shows . These werent popular back in the 70s and 80s when I grew up . For a while ther were none that I liked at all . So when my TV broke I did n't  replace it and so fell back on my other recreational vice : books . I went without for four years . Friends and family were extremely sympathetic but I turned down numerous free TV offers . Ironically my favorite types of shows enjoyed a Renaissance : X-Files , Buffy the Vampire Slayer , etc and were better than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my tactic is different . I do n't  have cable . I wait until a show I might like comes out and I rent the first season . If I like it Ill wait three seasons then buy all the DVDs and any season that follows ( or download them from iTunes ) . While there 's more of the type of TV I like now , only a little is still worthwhile and even that has to survive audiences that prefer reality shows . So in the end I save on cable bills , am not prey to silly advertising , and save time . After all , a one hour TV show is actually 40 minutes or so without commercials and no cable means no zoning out watching stupid stuff just because its on . In the end when the TV dies I intend to take up the same philosophy the Native Americans took toward camp fires : they made em small and sat really close . Likewise I 'll sit really close to the iPad or laptop . <p> Vicki said , <p> About 10 years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cable TV .

So in our first year in San Diego ( we arrived with nothing but bikes and panniers ) , we lived in an apartment with furniture hauled in from the alley behind us or no furniture . Also , I have a knack for finding apartment that have the narrowest of entry doors and even tinier windows , so most furniture does n't  even fit in the darn place . So my choice has been crappy build-it-yerself IKEA stuff or custom made furniture that is quality which is the route we 've taken . <p> Although let me make this comment useful letting everyone you know that you 're looking for a good quality desk for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are upgrading , downgrading or whatever .

@@42287659 @2287659/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I am increasingly appreciating the concept of appropriate technology . The story begins with us being unable to switch the rear furnace ( our RV has two 12V/LPG driven furnaces . The front furnace heats front half + bathroom and the rear furnace heats the bedroom . <p> From my perspective , the furnace is a black box . Once it is triggered by the thermostat , a 12V fan switches on . After the furnace verifies that the fan is running it automatically ignites the gas . Your LPG heater in your stick house probably works much the same ( except it runs on 110V ) . <p> In general I can fix many things once I understand how they operate . Luckily we have an old coach , so it is equipped with fixable $25 mechanical thermostats rather than unfixable $125 electronic thermostats . If an electronic thermostat stops working , there is little you can do to fix it . Simply throw it away and pay $125 ( they are pretty easy to install ) . <p> Conversely , with a manual thermostat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switching off the current at the circuit breaker panel ) and see what is going on . <p> The idea is very simple . There is a coil of bimetal ( two metals fused together ) that bends according to the temperature . The reason is that different metals expand to different lengths depending on the temperature . Those of you living in countries where utility cables still run overhead might have noticed how they are strung tighter in the winter than in the summer . <p> When the temperature increases , the tip of the coil extends towards a magnet . Once it gets close enough the magnet pulls it tight making the connection . <p> The first problem is if the contact is not good . Use a soft brush or my favorite , a can of compressed air ( in retrospect I am realizing what a boring life I led before discovering canned air ) , and blow the dust away . If that does not fix the problem , it is time to clean the contact . Use some coarse paper from e.g. a brown paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the on/off switch . You will note how it is very simple ( I love this ! ) . This can also be cleaned with the coarse paper method . <p> Luckily I did not have to go any further . The furnace switches on and off again . <p> The next step would be to take out the thermostat and hot wire the furnace to an on/off switch . This would probably save money in our case given that it takes about two minutes to heat a room . Try beating that stick house dwellers ! = <p> Maybe its time to take my old electronics stuff out of storage . I have grand plans , such as wiring an actuator to the black water ( human waste ) tank valve and connecting it to the right turn signal for easy dumping . Or maybe not = <h> 17 users responded in " How to fix a broken thermostat " <p> @Kevin M Maybe I can take a house thermostat and use a relay to convert it to 12V .

Memorize that list = You have to deduce which is missing . If its cranking then you can rule out battery problems .

Without any other information my best guess would be a dead coil or fuel pump . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Sorry , I drive a Cherokee . Try banging on the starter with a broomstick . <p> I like tinkering with stuff a lot , but the newer things are the more complicated they seem to be .

I bought one for $2 that did n't  want to start heating . I took the case off the side , and it had similar to what you described ( 2 metal strips , one bends toward the other ) . After bending one strip closer to the other it worked fine . Used it for 5 years , then resold it for $7 . It pays to not be afraid of technology . <p> My electronic thermostat came with the new $3,000 A/C and heating unit that was installed 5 years ago .

I am surprised that you have LPG for heat , we removed ours ( and sold them ) to buy electric heaters , because our RV site comes with electric hookup . <p> @CT We no longer live in the RV . We moved to an apartment in Chicago and later bought a house ( total running costs for this are actually less than the RV , but I believe I already said as much , anyhow ) . The RV site did have electric , but it was n't free and so heating with LPG was cheaper .

I 've never had to use any heating elements in my life . <p> Unless you 're an old person or a child , or live in a country with severe weather ( ie. colder than 10 degrees or hotter than 35 ) , it just seems a waste of money . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287661 @2287661/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I 'm constantly surprised that people can spend $250+ per person per month . Over time this adds up to tremendous amounts of money . Most likely , such huge food bills are due to eating out or eating preprocessed foods , so this is likely to be followed by substantial sick care costs down the road . <p> The simple answer is to learn how to cook . You might say you ca n't cook , but I say you can always start by following recipes . Anyone can follow a recipe . Well , maybe with one possible exception . Looking into yacht crewing , I read a story about how a ships chef on a maxi yacht got a visit from one of the guests . Apparently the guest felt she had to at least say hello to the crew and make some small talk , so she walks into the galley and after a few uncomfortable moments points and asks " so what is this ? " " Well , uh its a kettle " , says the chef . " And what 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. for boiling water for tea " . Ahh , the complicated lives of the rich and famous . <p> However , if you 're insufficiently rich to still know what a kettle is , you should be fine . <p> Now , you can follow recipes for the rest of your life , but if you really want to save money , you got to learn how to cook . Start experimenting with ingredients . First try adding too much of one thing or too little of another and see what happens . I recommend doing your first experiments with bread . Substitute milk for water . Substitute some of the flour for out meal . Try different kinds of flour . Try honey instead of sugar . Butter instead of eggs . See what happens . Soon you 'll know what the difference between a muffin and a loaf of bread is . <p> Move on to other areas . It is easiest to learn within a subfield . So for instance , do different kinds of stir frys for a month until you understand what makes a good stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work together ( apple and carrot ) and which do n't  ( carrot and tomato ) . <p> Try to reach a point where recipes are no longer needed . At that point all you need to do is to look into the cupboard and make something up . Alternative , when you go shopping , you 'll only buy what 's on sale and build your cooking around that rather than hunting for expensive ingredients from a recipe . <h> 16 users responded in " Learning to cook saves at least $5000 a year " <p> I agree with your article . I much prefer dining in more than eating out these days , and its a good way to save money . <p> But , dining out can make you money in certain situations . For example , the time saved by eating out can allow one to spend more time working and earning more money . Of course , this depends on having a specialized job . And if this is the case , one is a workaholic and not early retired . = 10151 @qwx420151 <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't " learn " to cook by reading a recipe . ( Even smart people with no reading disabilities . ) There is a lot of assumed knowledge in recipes which you may or may not have picked up watching someone else cooking . If you were not allowed in the kitchen or you did n't  pay attention at all , its not easy . <p> But there 's hope . Watch someone , preferably someone whose cooking you know you like , like a relative . ( If your relative with the best cooking is no longer available , think who that person might have taught , and ask them . ) <p> If you have a roommate , that 's ideal . Or ask your friends what they most like cooking and ask if you can watch/help them cook that . Most people have a specialty or at least one thing they can cook and most would love to share their knowledge . <p> Yes , you can learn from cooking shows , but its very difficult to learn frugal cooking from a cooking show . I have never used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can cook without measuring everything into its own tiny bowl first . I can even do without a cheese grater if necessary . Perhaps a combination of cooking shows and beginner cookbooks from the library , and maybe there are good YouTube resources by now , would be good for someone shy or whose friends do n't  cook . <p> I would also like to mention that there is a stage between cooking with and without a recipe that 's handy for frugality , and that 's cooking with a recipe but making substitutions . This is also handy if you 're picky or have allergies or other health issues . <p> And now that you can look up recipes online based on what ingredients you have on hand , you probably do n't  even have to know how to substitute . <p> Another point I 'd like to make is that some kinds of cooking are easier to do without a recipe than others . Stir fry , casseroles , meatloaf , and even quick bread are very forgiving . Cake and other baked goods , certain kinds of candy , cream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not so much . <p> The key to saving money is getting closer to original ingredients than where you are now . If you eat out , frozen meals will be cheaper . Mixes are cheaper than frozen meals . Making things mostly from scratch is cheaper still . Making everything from scratch ( like pasta and bread and tomato sauce ) is cheaper still . And in some cases , growing your own food ( at least the kinds of food that are easy to grow in your part of the world ) can be cheaper than buying it in the store . <p> There are some exceptions , such as when mixes go on sale , but that 's a good general rule . <p> Jason said , <p> To Debbie Ms good comments I would add check YOUTUBE ! There are a fair number of videos ( Of widely ranging quality ) showing how to cook diferent items . This allows you to actually SEE how the items are supposed to look at different stages . It is no substitute for someone showing you how but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago . My husband up to that point had done ALL the cooking . Weve been able to cut our grocery budget in half by cooking everything from scratch . Its time consuming but with both of us doing the cooking its does n't  feel like a chore . My husband is a good teacher and when he s not around to give me advice I go to the internet to get my questions answered . <p> With my son , I 'm working on an ecookbook for dorm dwelling students . We are featuring the rice cooker , which is permitted in dorms and enables you to make one pot meals . We have been making very good and very easy recipes for little more than $1/person . Clean up is a cinch too . <p> As for comment above on timeit is quicker to cook and eat at home than it is to go out and wait for the meal . That includes clean up . <p> firefighter jeff said , <p> The trick is to stay away from all those recipes that call for exotic ingredients that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be honest , unless you have a refined sense of taste , its hard to tell what difference they make versus normal ingredients that cost a fraction of the expensive stuff . There 's a lot of really good food out there that is n't hard to prepare . For the minimalist : a cutting board , a good knife , ( think Japanese ) , and a crock pot will take care of most of your needs . Perhaps a frying pan as well . Think of your clean-up time when that is all you have to worry about . <p> George ( the other one ) said , <p> Amen Jacob . <p> Here are the three most important things I ever learned about cooking . <p> ( 1 ) cook meat until brown . ( 2 ) boil chicken before baking or grilling ( 3 ) plants can almost always be eaten cooked or uncooked . <p> Following those guidelines I just through stuff together based on what I have and how I feel .

I have five full bookshelvesplus everything in the boxes . ) <p> I just wanted to chime in that you can substitute a Japanese or Chinese rice cooker for the crock pot and you 'll be just fine , as long as it has a timer-set function .

@@42287662 @2287662/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I 'm the type that sees life itself as an adventure . I left my home country almost 10 years to go to grad school in another country . When I finished , I left for country number three ( this country ) . I live with the presumption that I live with a sense of purpose or that my life has meaning or that I make a difference in some way . I mean this in a very individualistic sense . For instance , a voter in a democracy makes a difference , but it is a difference as part of a crowd or as part of a system and not as an individual . This is not what I am talking about . It is probably apparent that my thoughts are not entirely crystalized on this subject . Perhaps a better way of explain it is an attempt to live an examined life , that is , why do I do what I do . Another important point is that I do to some extent create my circumstances . The contrast would be in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging oneself , reacting to circumstances , and just trying to fit in . I hope these random thoughts made at least a little sense . <p> The original retirement plan was to move to some cheap place to live that did n't  suck too much . Preferably it would be within walking distance of many things but it certainly did not have to be big . In fact smaller would be better as it would leave more time for more interesting things than cleaning and housekeeping . One potential problem is that I am not comfortable with stagnation at all . There has to be a learning curve , and for a house this learning curve would naturally have to be found elsewhere . Therefore I was never quite satisfied with the idea . Being the home-owner of a generic cookie-cutter seems like a non-scary nightmare . I am NOT a homemaker . <p> The second idea was to get an RV , specifically to build an RV . I quickly found out that unless one drives a $100,000 RV bus , one is just a few steps removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wrong but all the sites I read about stealth camping suggested as much . <p> The third idea was a combination of the former two . Get a tumbleweedhouse and park it in an RV or trailer park . This could even be done as a snowbird . If people did n't  understand ( I 'm so used to this that I have come expect it ) , the house could simply be driven away . Of course this came with its own problems . Aside from building the house , there is no learning curve . <p> Now I do n't  know how I came across the idea , but how about living aboard a yacht in a marina , anchored of a tropical island , or just cruising on blue water . Sounds unreal , but apparently many people do this and they 're not all full of money . Boat living can cost as much as you want but frugal estimates rank at $600-$1000 per month which are very familiar numbers to me . While some people never leave the slip ( harbor ) , others spend time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am quite taken by the fact that one can take a $30,000 boat and sail it across the Pacific or the Atlantic , just like one would take a car and drive it across the US ( only somewhat harder ) . Skippering a boat also has some aspects that I have been missing from modern life , namely , accountability and self-reliance . If something goes wrong , it is plain clear where the buck stops . In " real " life , the buck is often passed along . As I read in some boating forum , sailing is actually closer to reality , because unlike this world , there are immediate consequences for mistakes , and one can not talk or pay ones way out of mistakes . It also fits a lot of my other values . On a boat there is no clutter and so consumerism becomes so irrelevant that it would be considered crazy . The focus is on functionally , personal ingenuity , and skills rather than appearance . Sailing is physically demanding . If one cant hoist a main sail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ones body actually becomes more than just a sloppy vessel for carrying ones expert brain around between the job , the car , and the couch/bed like on our present ( degenerate ) world . <p> The only problem . I have no clue as to how one sails ! <p> Update : I wrote this over two years ago . In the mean time , we have actually moved into an RV , and we have been living here for about 1.5 years . Living in the RV has become very routine . Sometimes I find myself getting bored ; I need to move into something else . I think its becoming clear that settling in one spot forever will not work for me . While I occasionally state my dislike of travel , I do enjoy moving from place to place . <p> I have also learned how to sail . In that regard , I have learned that I am perhaps not as adventurous as I thought I was . Facing 10+ foot waves in a 30 feet boat in near gale conditions teaches one things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing around the world is out of the picture ( maybe until I become vastly more experienced ) , I am longer wary of buying a boat afraid that it might sink if I do n't  operate the marine toilet properly . <h> 38 users responded in " Living aboard " <p> I have been reading your blog a few months now , but I 'm not one to comment often , not just here , but any of the many PF blogs I read .

It was a terrific experience . <p> I bought the boat for $2500 . Spent 3 weeks fixing it up . I used to sail to Catalina . Took it out fishing and sightseeing at least once or twice per week . In fact one time we went shark fishing ( to the laughter of all the stink potters ) , and caught a 5 ' shark . <p> The boat was some cheap living and loads of fun .

Maybe thatll be the next step in your adventure ? <p> Mo said , <p> I find it interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have lived on boats . <p> I grew up in a less developed part of coastal Florida . I have n't lived on a boat for more than a week , but I know many people who have . I have generally thought of it as a pretty hard life . <p> Perhaps the difference is that some people live aboard in a marina , at a dock . This is somewhat like floating an oddly shaped RV in 4-6 feet of water . There is running water and reliable electricity for all modern conveniences . If you need to run to the store you simply step on to the dock and walk to your bike or car . <p> The cheap way to live aboard is to anchor a boat in an appropriate area . You pay no slip fees , or rent , and thus your cost of living is very low . On the other hand , it is pretty primitive living : minimal electric , often no running water , and an ice-chest instead of a fridge . Even the smallest errand requires rowing or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot , and you 're almost always damp ( sweat , humidity , rain , and dinghys are almost always wet ) . Also , you have very minimal security its very easy for others to determine when you are n't  on the boat , and if your gear gets stolen the police might not be very useful to you . Thus , the hard life . <p> I 'd love to live abroad where the cost of living is a fraction of what it is in the UK especially in London . I now make most of my income on the internet and moving somewhere cheaper would help me to save even more than I am already , living on a boat would be fantastic . As a single person you 're open to more options , once you get married and tied down with kids it becomes a joint decision . Great post , keep them coming Jacob . <p> I love the sea so living on a boat would come naturally to me , my cashflow would go through the roof if I could rent my property out . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the readers of ERE . Nice Post Mr Fisker ! <p> Frankr said , <p> If you like new things all the time , I suspect you 'll soon tire of the sailboat . I think a better idea is for you to take some 3 month or less trips by yourself , either by foot , bicycle or canoe , starting/stopping from where you are currently living ( chicago ? ) . By the time dw retires , you 'll be an expert in these various types of self-propelled travel plus the camping that goes along with them , so as to ease the transition for her , since there 's a steep learning curve . Then alternate between self-propelled travel and an ultra-cheap home base somewhere . Canoe touring in the lake areas of canada is a lot easier than sailing in the ocean , but you 're still in the water . <p> Also , your view of travel reminds me of a eight year old boy explaining why grown-ups have sex . " its just this thing where they try to impress each other with who has the highest score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like us eight year olds would rather be around people of the same sex who share our interests . " The purpose of travel is to go somewhere , anywhere is okay as long as it means being in motion . The tourist attractions are just an excuse to justify such pointless motion , since from an efficiency point of view ( your natural pov ) staying in place is clearly better . In todays post , its evident your realizing some of the downsides of staying in place . Smarter long-term travelers also soon realize the downside of motor-propelled travel and so switch to self-propelled . You can save money by making the switch in advance , before buying a bunch of equipment . That is , ditch the idea of full-time Rving in favor of 3 to 6 month hiking , biking , canoeing trips , with a return to the home base in between to prepare for the next trip . Self-propelled travel can be very cheap , depending how often you stop at motels to clean-up . Lots of ideas in the forums on how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Denise said , <p> This is cool . I do n't  like routine . I made a bucket list 5 yrs ago at a friends behest and just realized a couple months ago that all of that is within reach during the next 10 yrs ( maybe I was not very imaginative ) . One was to live in every region of the U.S. another was to sail up and down the east coast . <p> More and more Ive been thinking about living on a boat . To test it , after I become financially independent , I 'm going to try and become a deckhand on a boat , sail around the world , and figure out if I like it . <p> After Ive done that a bit , I 'll try living in different places around the world . Maybe . Who knows ? <p> If you 're interested in a documentary about an ordinary guy that got the urge to sail around the world , check " Deep Water . " That anxiety you express is captured well . Powerful movie . My library had it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard a powerboat when younger and my brother currently lives on a wooden boat in Alaska . Couple of comments . <p> 1 . Boat maintenance , especially in salt water is endless . Be prepared to learn everything about mechanics , wiring , paint , varnish , caulking , etc. or be prepared to pay a LOT to have work done . <p> 2 . Living on a boat quickly tends to make it incompatible with sailing . It is incredibly easy to pile up too much junk that takes too much time to move and stow away when you want to take the boat out so you tend to stop using your boat as a boat . <p> 3 . Lots of desirable cities on the water are cracking down on liveaboards , as are marinas . I know this is a big issue in Seattle and most cities in California . Unless you are grandfathered into a slip it can be difficult or impossible to find moorage for a liveaboard in some cities . This is especially the case in larger expensive cities where people contemplate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  commuting to work and do n't  mind living in some beaten down fishing town with plenty of moorage it will be easier to make it work . But if you think it is difficult to find inexpensive parking for an RV in this country you have no idea how much more difficult it will be for a boat . <p> 5 . Even big boats are smaller than you think and boat prices go up exponentially with length . A 40 ' boat is not twice as expensive as a 20 ' boat , it might be 10x more expensive . <p> 6 . Powerboats suck down an ENORMOUS quantity of fuel . Until you have driven a large powerboat around you do not know the meaning of fuel consumption . That is why most serious sailors who take long voyages on private boats use sailboats . The fuel cost of powerboating long distances is eye-opening . <p> cappy.c said , <p> I just wanted to comment on the topic and say it really does take a certain type of person to do the live aboard sailing experience if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floating buoy ! Some people actually do just do that though ! Never move except for an occasional upgrade to keep it from falling apart whilst others will let their vessel degrade to horrible ruble ! And yes to the having its moments of heart throbbing clenching your hind end moments in weather ! My reason for sharing is the fact this is what my wife and I are presently embarking on ! Though I in my middle 40s now I had planned this thought out several years ago as I wanted to do it a certain way , And that being the affordable end of it . We had actually bought a small house on a lake almost 16yrs ago and the price was ridiculously low for water front ! I knew certain things in the area were going to change at some point ( Like the relocation of a major road out towards the front of the house ) And that was accomplished 10yrs ago now ! With that and around $10,000 dollars in upgrades to the home ( Me doing most of the work myself ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost $250,000 now 16yrs latter ! And we had paid it off in 15yrs which was 2013 . I knew we would be ahead , But not as much as it has turned out ! Anyway the whole point was to use the money from our investment on purchasing a used sailboat ( after paying the house off and selling it ) and living aboard as a cheaper means of life and also with the capabilities of going where we wished ! As you had said about the rough weather those are things that can usually be avoided on doing little hops to locations as most people will only go anywhere when they have a good weather window ! But there is always the unforeseen events that do arise and make it a little more challenging ! To some that may not be the type to get a rush out of mother nature and the big blue This probably would n't be for them ! As for us these are the things we expect as we will be eventually circumnavigating ! I have said to people in the past that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on the sea ! And as for myself I have always been drawn to the sea and love everything about it ! Although I could live without those clenching moments I see them as a challenge ! And as a person that has overcome some incredible situations and odds I look at it as just another moment of living and of doing so cheaply if one sets out in the right mindset ! The keeping up with a vessel and not letting it rot out from underneath oneself can be a little costly without much in the way of financial return , but something that needs to be done nonetheless if you wish to keep it safe and afloat ! Although depending on how much one can save over a period of time they might be able to unload the boat and afford to buy one better with the money saved ? Or choose another one of lifes choices after they might of had enough of the big blue with the money one could possibly save under the right conditions ! One can go through a pile of cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be frugal depending on their desires ! But the important part is to be safe and enjoy moments some could , and will only dream of !

With a retirement account of $1,000,000 you can therefore spend $40,000 a year . <p> As for how well you can live on $40,000 a year that is another question entirely . <p> If you live in New York City or San Francisco , $40,000 a year will likely not even cover the rent of a small apartment . On the other hand , many states offer 3 bedroom houses that wont kill a $40,000 budget . Alternatively , you can live in a small apartment or an RV and reduce your housing costs a lot . Then you will have plenty of money for other things . <p> If you like to go out and eat and otherwise buy most of your food preprocessed , food can easily run $600 or more monthly .

If you are overweight and out of shape and have put off your future health for tomorrow for most of your life , expect to pay more and have less opportunities . The good news is that your expected life span will be shorter , so quite possibly you will have more than $40,000 a year if that 's the case . <p> If you like to go to the movies , you can go to a lot more movies , if you go to the dollar theatre or independent films at universities than if you go to premieres . The difference can easily be a factor 5 or more . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than if you like to dress conservatively in quality clothes . The latter will cost less than a couple of hundreds per year . I am not sure what dressing fashionably costs , but I hear it can be quite expensive . Following fashion from cheaper outfits is generally also more expensive than a more conservative dress code . <p> If you know how to fix things around the house , you often save a lot of money compared to people who have to pay for reparations . This money can be used elsewhere . <p> If you like to give people gifts , you can get more valuable gifts , if you budget and plan ahead compared to a person who shops at the last minute . <p> If you like to travel in luxury , you will obviously have to budget the same way as working families do . This means one trip to Disneyland or a trip on a cruise ship every few years . On the other hand , if you have an RV or a van , you could travel pretty much all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to drive you can have a used luxury car or a new large car for the same price .

Basically DW takes care of the tactical aspects of expenses . I 'm the one doing the taxes and the investments , so all I know is how much DW spent out of our total budget . <p> You mention RVing . Full-time RVing can be much less expensive than living in a stick house , particularly if you can purchase your RV outright . You have a lot of control over expenses . For example , you can boondock ( without hookups ) for free on many public lands . Some RVers join a membership park system or half-price camping club to reduce their camping costs . <p> Another option is to work or volunteer on the road .

Please tell us , how do you do it ? I 'd love to see your itemized list of annual expenses ! <p> Multifinance said , <p> The rule of thumb retiring 4% per annum is nonsense . 1. use a reasonable life time expectancy . 2. assume you do not leave anything for your heirs . 3. ask yourself first what your annual spending needs would be . 4. calculate your annual annuity . 5. the outcome should tell you wether or not you could satisfy your retirement needs . <p> Example : You have one million dollars . Assume you are 65 years of age . Assume you will live another 30 years Assume your conservative annual return will be 3,25% only . Your annual annuity which you can pay to yourself is $ 52.681,72 Of course the value of this annuity decreases because of inflation . However as you get older and older , your needs will likely decrease as well ( except for medical. ) 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic inflations , the solution to the annuity equation is about 4% . The reason I do n't  use an annuity calculation is because unless you specifically buy one , the parameters entering the calculation are too uncertain to trust the calculation . <p> Its pretty sad to say that $1,000,000 might not be enough for us to live on , but I really think we would need more , especially since my wife and I are only in our mid-20s . If the stock market went down at all , we would be in a world of trouble . <p> deegee said , <p> The cost and availability of HI varies a lot depending on the state ( New York , USA ) you live in . Even using ehealthinsurance.com the best I could do was to find a plan which in 2009 cost me $470 a month , which is now nearly $700 a month , for just one person . <p> That being said , I retired 2 years ago at age 45 with less than $1M , about 1/3 of it in an IRA I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are worth just over $1M while my expenses are about $22k a year , so I am still living just fine off the taxable account only which generate about $32k in dividends .

My thought of retirement is to enjoy life . I expect my needs and wants will be equal to what I have now . Therefore , I know I will need to have enough set aside for retirement for minimum 25 ( presuming retiring at 70 yrs old ) years . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Dreamer I do n't  think 4% is safe in the very long run . The 4% studies was for a typical 30 year retirement , not a 70 year retirement . I think 3% is much safer . The safest of all would be to " keep one hand on the steering wheel " and be able to either adjust expenses or earn just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inflation adjusted amount year after year expecting total returns to eventually make up for it because some simulation said it worked in the past . <p> Yep thanks Jacob , that 's pretty much along the lines of what I thought . The problem as I see it with only taking 3% as a withdrawl rate is that you either have to have a larger nest egg , or invest more aggresively or and/or do some work . I stay out of the stock market cos I 'm risk adverse , this means my returns are less , finding some part time work is easier said than done these days IMHO . Perhaps I will have to get into dividend income from shares to earn a bigger income . <p> I expect I could probably live comfortably with $1m of retirement savings , as I own my own home and will ( probably ) inherit a hobby farm by the time I reach retirement age ( so I could probably sell or rent out my house ) . But just to be safe Im maxing out my contributions into my superannuation account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should make for a comfortable retirement and probably leave a sizeable estate for my sons and future generations . <p> @FreeUrChains yes , except that a ) my job is reasonably enjoyable and quite well paid , b ) it gives me plenty of time to do my hobby PhD on the side , and c ) my parents and grandparents lived , on average , into their 90s , so expecting to die suddenly seems a bit pessimistic .

Our portfolio is slightly over $1 million , after taking out $50k to cover mortgage payments for the next 3 years until it is paid off . <p> Ignoring housing ( I can pay off the 1.99% mortgage any time ) , we have been spending in the $22-23k range for the last few years .

We drive older cars and live in an 1800 sf house with our 3 kids .

I do n't  mind spending $6-7000 per year on groceries because I get value out of it , but only spend $1000 or less on eating out since the food is often so-so and not great value . <p> Others might spend $10000 per year dining out and little on groceries at home because they hate cooking or suck at it . Or love the social aspects of dining out .

Consider that houses around here are still $300000+ coming down from $500000+ ( most of which is land-value , since the houses are generally made out of wood and plastic ) , at 6% monthly interest payments alone would be $1500 . This is much more than our RV rent , hence it has tremendous opportunity costs to buy a house here . <p> That is the monetary reason we got the RV . The present alternative was to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could sink if you do n't  flush the toilet correctly ( at least in an RV that only builds up a stink everybody has strict instructions on how to go on the can I 'll be posting a sign for guests ) .

I thought I had a great idea with buring a shipping container but the county permit department put an end to that . What dream-squashers they are . My next idea is to build a tiny house out of a shed and have another shed next to it for storage . Anything below 200sqft can sneak by the permit department in my county ( although that probably does n't  count for residences ) . <p> Good choice with the RV , I heartily approve .

Couldnt you have bought some land and built a cheaper option or gone to have lived in a cheaper state other than california ? You say you have to move around for the job a lot but have n't you been in california for some time now ? I agree that houses are over inflated but at the end of the day eventually you will have a free place to live as opposed to paying rent fees to park the RV , such rent fees will only increase over time with inflation . <p> I 'm not saying i 'm right or your wrong just trying to discuss some of the issues . BTW are we going to see photos of the RV ? <p> My big concern with full-time RVing is structural stability .

He has n't  done that since we moved to a somewhat bigger place that we own . <p> @Claire There are still property taxes to pay whether or not there is a mortgage on the house . In California , that equates to 1.25% of the price you paid for the house . In a good neighborhood right now , you 'd be looking at paying at least $350K to buy that 's $365 a month just in property taxes . And , in a good neighborhood in California that 's close to everything , the prices just go up from there . If you own the house outright you would , of course , still need insurance too .

SoCal , for example , is extremely expensive in the metropolitan area . Not so expensive out in the far reaches of the deserts but you still have to drive miles to get anywhere . The insurance issue I mentioned was in regards to a house . if you owned a house outright you would be smart to insure it especially against an earthquake . You would n't want an earthquake to come along and level your structure , taking its value with it . At least with insurance , you can rebuild . Same with fire . In essence , youd want to insure against earthquake , fire and flood .

When I was putting TP down the tank I just emptied the tank and then closed it , refilled the tank with water by stepping on the toilet lever for a while , and emptied it again . Now that I do n't  have an excess of water , I just do n't  put TP down the tank . Do n't  expect your sensors to stay clean . They get covered in crud and are worthless . Everyone knows when the tank gets full anyway . <p> Why do n't  you leave your grey tank open ? I used to shut it but got tired of taking a shower and then the tub starts to fill .

@@42287675 @2287675/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Dealing with heat is far worse than dealing with cold because you can not just put more clothes on . Now , one could just switch on the A/C , but there are also ways to avoid this by taking advantage of the environment rather than ignoring it or working against it . <p> In general the nights get tolerably low or even nice and cool , so if you are not tied to specific working hours like 9-5 , consider working very early in the morning or in the evening . This is a good time to to garden work ( when the full moon is out ) . Then reserve the mid day for a siesta . Also , remember , the less you use A/C the more used you get to high temperatures . You simply start sweating better . If you do n't  have A/C and the nights get very warm , consider sleeping outside on the balcony . Failing that , keep the window wide open and sleep right under it . Another thing you can do is to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now were talking dessert conditions . <p> here 's how I cool the RV . I believe this would work on a house as well . The difference is that an RV has far less thermal mass than a house , so I see wider swings , and that insulation , at least in our model , is non-existent ( kinda like the surrounding houses in CA ) . <p> First , at night , I open all the windows , since it is cooler outside , and arrange the blinds for some draft . This brings the inside morning temperature down to the lower 60s ; it is always good to start cold if it is going to get hot . In the morning I then close all the blinds on the sun side to stop the radiative heat . The air is still cool outside , but the radiation on the roof and the sides will start heating up the RV like a car . As the sun moves around ( Were oriented on a N-S axis ) , I open the blinds on what is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside temperature goes significantly above the inside temperature ( I have a car thermometer , so I get both ) , I close the windows and the back compartment and run the front A/C only ( since this is a big rig , we have two A/Cs , front and back ) . Around 5 the wind starts blowing , so I open all windows for the draft shutting off the A/C . Depending on how hot it got , I may or may not close the windows later to preserve heat . If it gets really hot , I also use the mattress trick on the roof of the RV ( you can do this to your house and surrounding trees .. its good for 5-10F depending on how windy it is ) . <p> In other words , I continuously try to gauge whether I can balance convective cooling against radiative heating or whether I should just give up and run the A/C. <h> 34 users responded in " How to deal with heat " <p> One other tip I do to help reduce cooling cost and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit . Some people typically recommend using some plants around outdoor AC unit that ubsorb heat or direct light . The key is to make sure they do n't  interfere with the ACs ability to run or pull in air . The jist is that the air being pulled in will be cooler , because direct sunlight wont be on the unit . <p> When I lived in Southern Louisiana , it was hot and muggy even at three in the morning . Where I live now is much more agreeable to what you suggest . I have n't run the AC yet this year . In late afternoon when the house gets hot , I generally go outside to catch a breeze or do some yard work . Later in the year , I will give in , but hopefully not until at least June . <p> I would say that the cold is worse than heat because its more likely to kill you . That attitude is why I live someplace with lows in the mid 70s all summer instead of in a Jack London story . <p> First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into shorts and bare feet or sandals . If you wait too long , you get all sticky and its harder to get out of your long pants , plus you have less energy to do so . <p> Ceiling fans . Or at least box fans . Take a wet washcloth and rub it over your exposed skin and stand in front of a fan and you will feel very good . Do not stand in front of the open freezer or refrigerator ! <p> I 'm not sure how to make a mattress wetIm afraid of mildew . But if you have a ceiling fan and only a light sheet ( if any cover ) , it helps . When I worked at a summer camp , I found it felt coolest to sleep flat on my back even though I would have expected that with a higher surface area exposed when I 'm on my side , that would be better . <p> If outside , wear a hat . It is amazing the difference it can make . If there is no shade , you can get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even a small cap with a bill will provide serious protection . <p> Drink plenty of fluids . If your fluids are sweetened iced tea , you will get more cavities , so I recommend water , and unsweetened iced coffee or tea . <p> Cut your hair short or wear it up or tuck it into a hat to get it off your neck . Trim your beard shorter or shave it off ( before you get weird beard tan ) . I know someone who trims his chest and armpit hair in the summer and says it helps . <p> Swimming is a good hobby , and the air flow from bicycling is faster than from jogging or walking . <p> I also bring sweaters and jackets everywhere ( work , restaurants , movie theatres ) because they all have crazy AC . If you do use AC yourself , do n't  fall for the myth that leaving it on all day at some reasonable temperature and then turning it cooler when you get home saves energy . Wait until you get home to turn it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . ( I understand that if you have pets or maybe even computers , you may need to control the temperature somewhat . ) <p> And just as you do outdoor things in the mornings and evenings , time things in other peoples air conditioning during the day ( libraries , grocery shopping ) . <p> I 'm also going to mention sunscreen because you do feel cooler when you do n't  have sunburn . <p> Long-term ideas include the same kinds of insulation and leak-stopping that helps keep the cold air out in winter . White window coverings reflect both heat and light . Reflective window film reflects heat . Covering the windows closest to the equator with tin foil can give you quick relief . ( Use a squirt bottle or sponge to dampen the window . Then spread the tin foil over it and it will stick in place temporarily . Then tape down the edges . ) <p> Plant deciduous trees nearby ( but not too closeno point in risking the foundation ) . The leaves will eventually provide shade in the summer and then fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can install a trellis , even if you do n't  grow any plants on it . Deep eaves , window shutters , and the like can help , too . <p> I 've heard of people in trailers building a whole extra roof , like a carport , over their whole trailer to block some sun and other weather elements . <p> Ruth said , <p> If you have fans or any kind of moving air , using a spray bottle of water to mist your skin periodically cools you right down . I keep one by the bed and if I wake up at night feeling hot , I mist myself ( including the bottom of my feet ! ) and it cools me off immediately . This is without a sheet and with a ceiling fan on low . But it works great ; try it . <p> Also , one summer when I had no a/c on a really brutal day I cooled off enough to do homework by putting my feet in a bucket of ice water under the table . <p> Jacob , I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who mentioned fans . Fantastic Fan ( same people who make the " whole house " fans you find in the roof of RVs ) makes a nicely sized box fan that runs on 12v DC ( in case you are ever away from your hookups ) . We run it up front during the day ( hanging on a hook from the big old over-the-dash TV cabinet ) , then move it to the bedroom at night ( on a counter facing the bed ) . Reasonably quiet . <p> We turn on the rooftop Fantastic Fan as soon as the outdoor temperature drops below the indoor temp at night . <p> We also have solar screens to fit all our front windows for when we cant avoid facing the " wrong " direction on warm/hot days ( we are travelers ) . <p> Also , keep a big glass of iced liquid on hand at all times . Water , iced tea or gin and tonic are favorites around our house . = <p> Your blog is one of a small handful I read daily ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelope ! <p> Safe travels , Laurie <p> mjukr said , <p> Its not the heat that gets you in the midwest , its the humidity ! <p> You can have a fan blowing at you full speed but if the humidity is high its still going to be miserable . <p> We never had any kind of A/C in my house when I grew up . Without it , you definitely get more used to the heat . We also had a similar system set up where we cooled the house at night , then let the houses insulation hold in the coolness . Simply having a bunch of fans can really help . Also , if you have the advantage of living next to a pool , lake , or the ocean , I recommend going to take a dip . Unless you live in the Caribbean , the water is going to be cold enough to help cool you down . <p> hickchick said , <p> My parents have made do without A/C or furnace , in the middle of the midwest , for the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't  bother to replace it ) .

Its the insulation and how much electricity you 're willing to pay for . Unfortunately , most RV brands are not insulated ( because most people just drive to a nice climate ) and I 'm not willing to crank up the power ( yeah , I 'm sitting here preparing for peak oil ( - : ) Otherwise , the total volume is small enough that the characteristic heating/cooling timescale is just 5 minutes . <p> investnoob said , <p> This may sound sillybut another way to deal with heat is to lose weight . A few years ago , I was 40 pounds overweight . The summer humidity was intolerable . <p> Well , I lost the weight and managed to keep it off . Now I find that summers are much more tolerable . Hope this suggestion is not seen as critical or counterproductive as it actually worked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It absolutely makes sense . Being overweight is like wearing an extra layer of clothes ( fat ) that ca n't be taken off . This increases the strain on the circulatory system and requires one to sweat more . In short , its uncomfortable . Of course the opposite holds if its cold . However , it is easy just to put on an extra layer of clothes . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I can remember one July 4th where I was about 17 years old . I had a 1954 Ford coupe with vinyl seats . Tooling around town , my jeans were sweating and sticking to the seat covers ! Today , I could not bear that being so spoiled to the comforts of A/C . In 2009 , I installed in my home , a new Trane heat and air system with even new duct work . I was amazed at the difference in quality of the new and old units and materials . My old ducts were about 8 inches , and the new super insulated ducts are about 12 inches . Cost savings and efficiency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old . The tab for it was just south of $10,000.00 , paid to the contractor on completion of work . This is what FI can do for you . After a while , you just write a check for whatever you need to . No loans , no installments , no interest , no hangovers . Just write the check and your done . Here where I live A/C is a survival thing . It might be 92F but the wet bulb reading with humidity factor would be ( feel like ) 105F . I figure I will live anywhere from another 30 minutes to as much as 25 years , so I intend to be comfortable . My son in law is working hard on peak oil , and he is doing my part as well . = <p> I see Over the Cubicle Wall got here first ! In low-humidity areas , it cools down at night . My husband grew up in LA and his parents had only a tiny window ac , which they seldom used . Does it even get hot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seldom cools down at night . With no power post-Katrina , we would lie in bed with wet cloths on our faces . Pure misery . <p> If I wanted/needed to cut my electric bill , I would go to the library or other public space with great air conditioning . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @frugalscholar Worst conditions around here would be something like 105F at 4pm and 72F at 4am . In this case the humidity would be 3% or so . <p> @Jacob : I also open the window at night , to get the warm air out and the cool air in . But this causes a problem : the mosquitos come in . How do you handle that in the RV ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Andy It has screens behind the windows . <p> DW said , <p> I live in Central Florida ( 6000% humidity , haha ) We used to open our windows at night also , but it seems like whatever we did there were still a few mosquitoes in the house . My husband was diagnosed with cancer this November and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerate the heat because of it , so we run the AC pretty much 24/7 at 79 degrees which is about as high as he can stand it . If you have to turn the air on I do agree with Hspencer about the efficiency of a new unit . We just moved into our current house in 2009 , it was a destroyed 14 year old block foreclosure and everything had to be replaced including the AC . We installed a 23 seer , 2 cycle , 410a system along with extra installation in the attic and double pain tinted windows and strategically placed trees ( still small but help some ) and have seen the cost to cool the house drop by more than 50% . Luckily , we have a friend in the HVAC business and we only paid manufacture cost and he installed for free , so I think we recouped the cost in less than a year with energy savings . Hopefully , when my husband gets better we can go back to our more conservative ways and not run the AC at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans too keep the house cool . We take a large fan that fits a window perfectly and use it to blow air out . We then open a few other windows in the home and the pressure differential draws cool outside air in . This works great at night when the house is still hot from the afternoon but the temperature outside is cooler . <p> Placing the fan in a different room has the advantage that we are n't  disturbed by the noise and it gets the air flowing throughout the home . <p> Some other tricks we do is to open the windows on opposite sides of the attic ( the attic retains a ton of heat from the day and reducing it helps tremendously ) and use small personal fans or ceiling fans . <p> The only time we feel like we need air conditioning is when the temperature hits a high of 100 or so ( maybe once a year ) . In this case we have the option of retreating to our finished garage which is much cooler . <p> Love this post . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am a big proponent of just learning how to be a little hot . We live in Las Vegas , so people have the tendency to keep their homes and businesses as cold as meat lockers . I personally hate sitting in a freezing indoor environment in the summer . We keep the AC around 85-87 , keep the lights off , and run the ceiling fans . Its amazing how well it works , and our power bill has never been over $100 . I know people who spend $300-$400 monthly in the summer to cool their homes . I personally find that laughable ! <p> My wife and I do our very best to beat the heat . We live in Utah and summer days hit the high 90s on a regular basis . However the nights drop well into the 50s providing a great cooling opportunity . We open all of the windows and doors a few hours before we go to bed which cools the house off pretty well . We then leave just the windows open all night . Leaves the house cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small fan to keep us cool . <p> Deb said , <p> I think this is one situation in which your RV let 's you down Jacob . It might be small but it is not designed well for the CA climate . Look at native older housing around the world and you will find some beautiful and practical answers to your heat issue . <p> Have a look for instance at the riads of Morocco .

The incremental cost of going a few degrees cooler is small , so why sweat it out ? <p> I think there are certain areas where people suffer needlessly , because it makes them feel frugal . Cooling the home is one of them . <p> I live in the desert in a house that was not designed with the climate in mind . The house is a high ceilinged , zero crawl spaced design with zero ability to insulate against the extremes of hot and cold . In other words , there is no attic space . As a result , the house is either extremely hot or cold . Right now , its extremely cold and so I have begun to run the furnace 10pm-6am only to take the edge off . The temps dip into the freezing zone at night and the house becomes unbearably cold . I have n't run the AC in three years . We sit under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AC to cool this house is extortionate .

I put the pool uphill from the garden and drained it into the garden to avoid wasting any water other than evaporation . Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the cool water did the trick . After cooling off I could work for half an hour before it started to get uncomfortable .

Alternatively , you can make your own truing stand out of an old bicycle fork . <p> However , you can also just fix it yourself in about 10 minutes for free . <p> You need <p> A sharpee or similar ( something that will paint a mark on metal ) <p> A spoke wrench ( an adjustable wrench will do in a pinch ) <p> Put the bicycle upside down and spin the wheel . Move the sharpee closer and closer until it starts hitting the wobbly parts of the rim as it spins . Do this on both sides . <p> If you did it correctly you will eventually have drawn a line on parts of one side and the exact negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went too close with the sharpee . Most likely one line will span only a few spokes . This is the part of the rim which extends too far out . To move this part in , you have to tighten the spokes , which are over the line , on the other side by doing a quarter turn counter-clockwise so they pull the rim towards them . Similarly , you must loosen the spokes on this side by a quarter turn clockwise . If you tighten both of them , you will make the wheel less round . If that is you problem and your wheel is out of round , this method will not work in this case , you need to take the tube and the tire off and use the sharpee on the top edge of the rim and either tighten or loosen both sides where applicable . <p> Try to see if it worked by holding you nail ( do n't  worry , you have twenty of them ) closer and closer to the rim to see if that straightened the wheel . If not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 users responded in " How to true a bicycle wheel " <p> Between this post and the one at http : **32;887;TOOLONG , I just trued-ish a severely bashed rim on my bike . I 've never messed with spokes before , and I used to race BMX for years , even . <p> Thanks for this , Jacob ! I had to take off the brakes on the front wheel of both my bikes because they were out of true . This less than ideal situation will hopefully get fixed tonight , now that I know how ! ! ! <p> Thanks for the practical advice , I really like this blog because it attempts self sufficiency in practically everything . Many people would just pay for this service however if we learn how to do all these small things in life we can save an absolute bundle . Great post , glad you shared . <p> bmschrad said , <p> @James NomadRip link definitely goes into more detail . If you really want to true your wheel and make sure it stays true you have to address radial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rocket science but it takes a while to learn how each adjustment affects the other . Spoke tension is especially important if you want your wheel to stay true and the bike to ride well . <p> I race mtbs so I get to do my fair share of wheel truing . Using a stand is much easier and faster ( especially when you have to make all four adjustments ) . I 've done it with a fork but its pretty frustrating and slow . If you commit to actually truing your wheels and a some friends wheels a few times a year its worth every penny to get a stand . <p> Great article and if you 're a serious bike rider learning to true your wheels is a great skill to have . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

This means that we will be living on somewhat less than half of DWs pay checks , or a little over a quarter of mine . I would almost be able to support both of us out of my retirement " fund " . <p> How ? Well we bought an RV and have found a place to park it . Only about two miles from where I work too and within biking distance of the mainstay supermarket . <p> Rent is reduced to 1/3 . Incidentally this is less than either of us has ever paid in rent . <p> There are no more water bills and no more trash bills . <p> Once I get the solar panel project going there will be no electricity bill either . <p> Obviously , I should have thought about this before . However , there were several circumstances preventing it or at least making it fairly difficult including being an expatriate with no permanent residency ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did n't  fit in a suitcase ) . <p> However , for those who desire to " retire " quickly and escape the drone-zone and career rat race , I think RV living is something that should seriously be considered . Of course there are some compromises . You cant have a media room . You cant have a home gym . Also you have to say goodbye to the bowling alley in the basement you just financed with a second mortgage . You can have everything else though . Just expect rooms and furniture to be a bit more multifunctional . For instance , our RV slepts 5-6 whereas our current home sleeps 4 ( if we get the air mattress out ) . Our RV has two TVs . Our present home has 1 . We actually have more seating in the RV than in our home as well . And seriously , exercising is best done outdoors . However , children , if any , and adults have to forego the relatively modern fashion of each having their own room . During my RV research I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a 5th wheeler . Another thing that people think is hard to do is to let go of the possessions they have not seen or used for the past year , because they might " need " it some day . However , this actually turns out to be surprisingly easy . <p> So give it some thought . There is no rule that says you have to have a 30 year mortgage , two cars , and spend all your life energy on a job to fill your house with stuff even though everybody else does it . Just because its popular does n't  mean everyone should do it . <p> I 've got to be honest I really wish you and DW were planning on having kids , since that adds a difficult variable to the equation ( one that I must deal with = ) and I 'd LOVE to see your approach to it ! <p> Maybe someday ? = <p> mjukr said , <p> btw , re : water bill .

Just work together with your family and do what you can . <p> Contrary to popular belief , kids are not necessarily that expensive . <p> here 's a real life example in case it helps- my brother made 65k last year gross as an engineer . He has two kids , 1 and 3 . He did not have to pay anything in fed or state taxes aside from Social Security . <p> here 's how it laid out for him 65k gross- 15k to 401k ( the max ) 5k principal on mortgage 10k mortgage interest/r.e. tax + insurance ( I know Jacob is not a big fan of home ownership , and neither am I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my brother and his family ) 10k to Roth IRA for he and his wife 5k to taxable savings/stock account <p> That left 20k/yr for his family to live on . In true Jacobian fashion ( although I cant see Jacob in a 3br/2.5 bath townhouse ) , practically everything in my brother and his wifes townhouse is either a gift or borrowed . For vacation , they go to see relatives . They almost never eat out , but grill out at home often . Just about all their food is Costco food that had coupons applicable . All the kids clothes and toys are hand me downs from friends and neighbors , but the kids really do n't  know any better . The little one wears cloth diapers . My brother and sister in law have lots of friends and a set of grandparents close by , so babysitting is not hard to come by . Their cars are 10 years old , but run fine . They asked the grandparents to ease up somewhat on Christmas/bday gifts and put part of the money into a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 54% of their GROSS income + 6% contribution from his employer to his ret. plan. = 60% of his gross income . <p> With each kid getting him a 1k tax credit plus a 3400$ deduction , that actually puts him as saving the equivalent of 65-70% of after tax income when compared to a single person or married with no kids . <p> I realize 65k jobs ( with incl. health insurance ) are not everywhere , but it is actually at the low end for experienced engineers in his area . <p> Can you and your family live on less ?

We are selling our home/contents in the home buying a 5th Wheel RV and parking it in a real nice park where we live in Florida that is close to both our jobs . We currently make $7000 month between both of us incs health insurance and we will reduce our cost from $5300 month to $2500 month ( includes RV payment ) . This will allow us to live very well , max our IRA accounts and put close to $4000 per month in savings . In 7 yrs we will have over $340K in savings . Why did n't  we do this 5 yrs ago ?

@@42287682 @2287682/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> DW and I were talking about how personal finance can be easy in theory and hard in practice . I think the reason is that theory , like language , occurs in two steps . Passive and active . Understanding and speaking . Passively , yes , sure we understand that we should spend less than we earn , that we should save money . Actively , it is harder to translate thought into action . <p> One problem is that many people are more focused on method than on motivation . Give us 10 easy baby steps to riches , a list 200 sure fire ways to save money , or the easy way of dollar cost averaging an index fund , but lo and behold . People will pick the few items on a list that seems convenient to them but which considered as single items do not make much of a difference . For example , they may start using CFLs or turn the lights off , but this is unlikely to cause a huge change in the budget . <p> The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A very simple way to think about personal finance , and this is really all you need to learn , is to think of yourself as driving a car towards a destination . Let 's assume the car is an automatic . Then it will have an accelerator and a brake . For every action , you take , you have to stop and consider this : If I do this ; if I engage in this activity am I pressing the accelerator or the brake ? <p> Sadly most consumers are pressing the accelerator and the brake equally hard . Some even think that the point of earning money is to spend it . No wonder they 're not going anywhere . <p> To get ahead , you must either press the accelerator harder or ease on the brake . Apparently lots of people are not fully aware of just how hard they 're flooring the brake . Therefore try this exercise . Every time you touch something , ask yourself whether this item has accelerated your income or whether it has decreased your savings . <p> If it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself whether you could have gotten something with more oomph in it ? Similarly , if it has decreased your savings , ask yourself whether you could have done without it or used something you already had ? <p> Again , this means , for every decision , you must verify whether this is an accelerator decision or a brake decision . Once you start thinking in those lines it becomes much easier to avoid sitting on the brake . <h> 15 users responded in " The real reason it is so easy/hard to get ahead " <p> I like how you framed the issue . Equally holding the brake and the accelerator is the exactly how most people live . Earn money and then spend until it is gone ( and sometimes a little more ) . I recognized that I do have a tendency to push the brake so I tied the accelerator halfway down ( automatic savings ) and most of the time that is enough to overcome the occasional braking . I have started to see all of my possessions and purchases in the same light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that regard . The trappings of " the good life " are certainly holding me back financially but they are also adding to my enjoyment of life so that battle is always ongoing . <p> I love the fact that you pointed out that you can either brake more or accelerate less . I think that 's an important point to make because not everyone is going to be interested in approaching their debt one way but they may be willing to deal with it the opposite way . Taking a look at how these things balance out in the big scheme of getting where you 're going can really put things into perspective for you . Thanks ! <p> I also touch on this subject on my blog . Most people do not have a reason to get ahead , there are in a comfort zone . <p> I think it all boils down to your income and lifestyle <p> Hannah said , <p> A great analogy . FI is the destination we all desire , for various and personal reasons , but the journey there can seem excruciating at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surreal concept for many . And just like with a diet , it is easy to lose sight of your principles and " slip up " during moments of apathy , i.e. " one purchase wont diminish my goal , etc . " But I like how you reframe the issue as a linear path , with us in control of when we break and when we accelerate . We are fully in control , for better or worse . After all , FI is just a numbers game ( or mileage game ) and this analogy keeps the issue conceptually simple . <p> Our oprahfied culture is obsessed with the minutiae of details , planning , steps , and " feel good " psycho-babble esque validations . This keeps you in a state of what I call preparation suspension .

The analogy is priceless . I will certainly be quoting it in conversation ! <p> Early Retirement Extreme is not a saving plan , its not a frugality plan . Its a mindset , and few seem to be able to break the ingrained training public schools , and the media have taught them .

With less people motivated to do productive work , who would do the activity necessary to sustain our standard of living ? " <p> I think there are several things to be considered here . First of all , it is generally agreed that extreme early retirement although simple in design is hard to follow ( much like a diet is simple in design but hard to follow for most people ) and thus not many would take this path , at least not as long as it is not popular . It is certainly my hope , though , that more people will pick up on it . <p> More important here , is the decline of the objective standard of living . What exactly is the " objective standard of living " ? My guess is that it has something to do with how much money is spent , that is , a similar motivation to the idea of using GDP , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proxy for economy growth . <p> I think this is a great fallacy though . What I think has happened and is happening is akin to the broken window fallacy on a grand scale . According to the broken window fallacy , if I break a window , I need to hire a guy to come and fix it and he in turn can spend his income on a loaf of bread , etc. and so by breaking a window , the economy is stimulated and that is a good thing . It is the same fallacy that underlies the idea that war is great for the economy . Of course the fallacy is that if I had not broken the window , then I would have had the money AND a functional window . The problem from the point of view of using the GDP proxy is that I might not have spent it and thus would would not have seen this burst of activity had my window not been broken . <p> ( Keynesian economics is essentially a forced redistribution using work to somehow make it " fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to take money from those who have produced it and giving it to those who have wasted it . This in fact is very close to what one does when economic stimulus is financed through debt which will be inflated away . ) <p> This is not to say that whole purpose of the economy is to break windows and fix them again , but I submit that a growing portion of it is indeed that . After all , if people already had their needs satisfied a hundred years ago and we meanwhile have increased productivity substantially through the use of fossil fuels , what else could we possible do other than generating waste ? Were not exactly building pyramids , right . There are , therefore , a tremendous amount of " windows " being " broken " in our economy and I am not just talking stimulus packages or wars . You only need to take a look at the biggest companies of the United States . To wit , in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , we have a couple of companies engaged in producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making cholesterol lowering drugs and insulin .

I eat the occasional junk food meal , once a week , but I do n't  go overboard and eat it every day . Thus I am not on any drugs and I consider my standard of living high . <p> But maybe not so productive = <p> Another example is planned obsolescence . I have a pair of boots , which I mention quite often because they are simply a great example of this point . They are made of full grain leather with a Norwegian welt . I have used them extensively over the past 12 years by which I mean walking thousands of miles . Now , lately DW and I have tried to find a similar pair for DW . However , it is impossible to walk into a retail store and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are prepared to pay north of $250 . What we do find are snazzy looking glued technicolored boots that last about a season , two if you are lucky , and cost around $100 . These would need to be replaced every season and thus , I guess , they would enhance productivity and create jobs for shoemakers in Vietnam , etc . However , this in no way increases my standard of living just as the broken window did not enhance it . Why pay $100 each year , when you can pay $250 and be done with it for the next decade or two ? <p> So to answer the question . Some people would still work . Perhaps this would be working full time for a handful of years like I did or by working for a few hours a week like I also do . Either way . It is enough to enjoy the same standard of living as " productive " people once all the counterproductivity is removed from the system . <p> Hence , I think the real question is not " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if everybody started valuing money as much as I and others like me do " . This is the solution to the paradox of thrift . <h> 31 users responded in " What if everybody decided to work much less " <p> @shawn Some caveats : You pay shipping , which for a pair of boots is $10+ and then there 's a $25 administration fee on top of that . Resoling is generally cheaper than that and this will be the most common issue ; so something to consider . Anyone know how hard wearing the soles are ? They look soft to me ? Are they good for 2000 miles like skywalks ? <p> On a personal finance discussion board , the topic of savings rate came up . If the U.S. saved 40% like China , it would be a disaster economically or so it was claimed . And yet when I thought about it , it would only be a problem from our existing point of reference . We need 10% returns on our portfolios because we expect to constantly upgrade our gadgets and living abodes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40% , our minds would be adjusted to the different reality of durable goods and 0% real return could satisfy our retirement needs . <p> I love this statement and this post . When I think of the money that was spent by individuals and the US government in just the past decade it gets me so mad . <p> What other kinds of things could we have done with the money , resources , research , hours etc ? Our current standard of living involves being fatter , more sickly , decreasing our life expectancy , increasing mood disorders and alienation . <p> In fact , I think its a good exercise to be more creative in terms of the opportunity costs involved in our economic decisions of late ! Perhaps its a good topic for another post . . . <p> I agree . We ( Americans ) do n't  seem to be accomplishing much of anything important lately . <p> If all this spending has made us so much better off , why are Americans so unhappy and unhealthy ? Outside of homes with functional climate control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really that much better off today ? <p> Why do I read a book like Walden and find myself thinking how much better *that* life sounds ? Obviously living like that would be quite a shock to the system of someone like me today , but I think the essence of that simpler life is what is missing now and I think we 've given up far too much to get this so-called modern standard of living . <p> Oh , and to answer the title of the post : we should all try working less and see . I suppose that reducing incomes is one way to reduce consumption . We have to break this consumerism cycle somehow . It may be painful for a bit , but it could give us hope for the future . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> @Jacob Here is a little example of lasting quality vs planned obsolescense . Back in the early 80s I was going to Germany often for exercises in the US Army . We encountered winter weather a lot and so we ordered Insulated Leather Boots for our unit . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firmness of them at first . However , the materials in them proved , once broken in , to be excellent in every way , in particular the insulating qualities . 30 years later , I still have mine in excellent condition . After we became so impressed and pleased with them , we decided to get another pair ( for later in life if/when we wore the first pair out ) but they were " no longer available " . This did not satisfy me , as I was a supply guy , and I followed them all the way to the source . I eventually , through persistence at the maximum level , got a company rep to tell me that production of that boot was dropped , and another style had replaced it . The rep offered to send me a pair and he did . The difference in quality was " night and day " . So to make a short story long , the company could simply not live with the quality of boot they were selling for that price due to the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " more " boots , so they cheapened the quality . ( Not the reps words , but my own conclusion ) . So that 's the way it is . <p> Jacob , I 'm not sure if you just have enough money and just do n't  want any more , but . <p> I must tell you . I absolutely love your blog and your ideas . Why not have a " Donate " button ? Itd be a way to get some dollars and my way of saying " Thank you " . <p> Again , thanks Jacob , your blog is my favorite . <p> Maus said , <p> Perhaps the economy will return to an ethic of quality when the margins on quantity become unprofitable . Apparently , many Burger King franchisees were outraged when the corporate headquarters forced them to retail a double cheeseburger for $1 ( essentially as a loss leader ) . YoY same-store sales revenue has been decreasing . Would Americans be willing to pay more for a healthy fast food alternative ? Is such a thing even possible ? Very few people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is just a concrete example of Jacobs observation that the vast majority of consumer-oriented folks would not be willing to adopt the discipline required to be ERE . <p> The sad fact is that quality , as in the example of good boots , becomes apparent to most after the fact by realizing how rare it is . When originally purchased , did either Jacob or HSpencer know how good those boots would turn out to be relative to what the market would offer years later ? <p> Perhaps some of the focus of an ERE workshop/e-book should be on recognizing good quality and cultivating a proper sense of discrimination . <p> patrick said , <p> Hey , I 'm patrick . I wrote the comment this article was based on . <p> My point was not meant to be about the GDP or level of economic activity . That would surely decline , but as Jacob pointed out , this is not necessarily a bad thing . <p> That would not be how I would measure objective quality of life . Maybe a more appropriate term for what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a large enough group of people adopted the early retirement lifestyle , then the options available for what you can do in this world would decline proportionately . <p> Currently , people who overconsume both subsidize those who wisely consume and subsidize more options for them . The best way to demonstrate this is through an example . I think everybody can relate to a gym . <p> If we look at an average gyms income statement and its usage log , we would notice something curious . There would be a minority of people who use the gym fairly regularly , and then a majority of people who hardly use it at all . But , all of them pay the same membership fee ( at least , that 's how were going to assume our gym operates ) . <p> Now , let 's say this gym currently has 100 members . <p> And let 's say all of them decide to become early retirees <p> Maybe 30 of them used the gym regularly , and 70 did n't  . <p> So , in keeping with good financial advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership . <p> 25 of the 30 who use it regularly decide that they can get their exercise elsewhere for cheaper . So they buy kettle balls and bikes and cancel their gym membership as well . <p> Now there are five members left , all of whom are passionately training for various sports like bodybuilding etc . These guys are now in a tough spot . <p> The same costs that used to be carried by 100 members would now have to be carried by these 5 members in order to keep the gym functioning at the same level as before . <p> In this example , the gym will be forced to make some changes . They could raise fees 20x to maintain their current revenue and level of service . They could cut costs ( some of which will now be redundant , and some of which will actually affect the members quality of service ) . They could do a combination of these . <p> however , as the fees increase , the services are cut , and the quality of the gym declines , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is highly likely that this gym is now an unsustainable business which will close . <p> This means that those 5 people who used the gym well now have less options . There might be another gym around if they live in a big city . If they live in a less densely populated area , they might be out of luck , or have a long travel time to get to the gym . <p> If there is another gym in the area , it will probably have a lower level of service . There will probably be more people using the machines , as only the frequent users will still use gyms . This means longer wait times for machines and longer workouts . This gym might have higher fees . It will probably be farther away than the old gym was . There might be fewer machines , fewer classes , more crowded classes , etc . Point is , itll be a worse gym than before . <p> What about those other 95 people ? Well , their quality of life has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is worse . We do n't  know what they do after the gym closes , but we do know that they no longer have the option of going to that gym . Their options have shrunk too and although what effect that would have is unknown what is known is that they can no longer go to that gym . <p> Perhaps subjectively to them this is not a big deal , but objectively it means that they have less options , and I would argue , a lower quality of life . <p> The same thing would play out in most industries , as a lower consumption level would lead to lower production . Lower production would lead to consolidation . Consolidation would lead to higher prices and fewer options . This would negatively impact people who are passionately pursuing things in those fields , as they will have to invest more time , energy , and money in the pursuit of their goals than they have to now . <p> Now , as an individual , it could be beneficial to adopt an early retirement lifestyle . Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as society continues consuming and producing . If everybody adopted such a lifestyle , then society as a whole would be poorer for it . There would be less contribution , less consumption , less options , less opportunities , etc . <p> This was what I meant by a lower objective quality of life. Now , some people might be happier . Some people might be sadder . That is subjective quality of life . But objectively , it would get harder for everybody to pursue their passions , because fewer people are subsidizing them in doing so . <p> Conversely , using the gym analogy , might the truly passionate build their own gym equipment and share it , whether for profit or not ? After all , they now have the time to pursue gym-life beyond their wildest dreams because they 've made themselves financially secure . <p> patrick said , <p> @george <p> The same pressures would apply to food , shelter , and clothing . Higher prices , less choices , but that 's not necessarily a huge deal if you 're content with less . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the best there is , the most choices for the lowest cost . This only happens with the best economies of scale . <p> What more do you really need ? Well , psychologists have a hierarchy of needs called Maslows Hierarchy of needs . I do n't  want to go into it in depth here , and I think you might have heard of it before anyway . The gist of it for those who have n't seen this before is that materially , humans only really need food , clothing , shelter , water etc . Beyond that , our needs are mostly emotional , mental and spiritual . <p> On a note about that , a lot of people try and satisfy those emotional , mental , and spiritual needs with material things . Part of what the ERE lifestyle entails is meeting those needs with non material things , which is both cheaper and , ideally , more effective . <p> Those who are truly passionate might build their own gym equipment . But their lives are harder for it . It is harder to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gym . For most people it is also not economically feasible to have the same selection of machines that they can get in an average gym . Are those machines really necessary ? Well , that depends on your exercise goals and workout regimen . <p> That person used to only put forth 1/100th or less of the economic value/money necessary to maintain a gym . Now they must carry all that burden , or suffer a reduction in quality of gym . It makes more economic sense for that person to join some kind of collective exercise facility . <p> Now , if they passionately want to run a gym , well , their dreams just came true . But if they just want to work out as best they can , it might be better for them economically to work however many hours it takes for them to pay someone else to maintain the gym then for them than to do that themselves . <p> KevinW said , <p> here 's the thing . In the gym example , we have a gym that is equipped to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasted capacity is a " broken window . " All the resources that go into that the steel for the machines , the real estate , the electricity for the lights , the labor of the staff could be redirected to some new enterprise that serves the 95 couch potatoes better . <p> The decline of paper office work looked pretty bad if you only considered secretaries and mimeograph factories , except that the entire IT industry was growing to take its place . We got a lot of great technologies along the way the Internet , iPods , etc . In hindsight , which would you rather have : thousands of clerical workers transcribing letters , or computers and everything based on them ? <p> If a lot of people went ERE then , yes , a lot of capital would be redirected away from producing consumer products , health problems , and quick fixes for health problems . However that capital has to go somewhere , and it would go into new projects to satisfy the whims of ERErs . We can only imagine what that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the economy . However , some where in that chain of spending .. the broken window , to the person fixing it , to the breadsomeone is holding some of the money .. this differentiates between the rich and the poorsomewhere , someone is making a larger amount and saving a portion of it . It really is a pyramid .. its just the people at the bottom do n't  realize it . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> @Jacob I love Dr. Martens , I just bought a new pair of brown shoes after using my original pair for close to 10 years . I paid about $100 for those , and they werent even the guaranteed for life variety , although they look very similar to the 3 eye . The sole was not the issue ( although I did n't  walk much in them just wear to work mostly ) , they were just getting too beat up looking to wear to work . <p> This is a very thought-provoking issue . I never even thought of the " need " for GDP to continue increasing to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically just a way to show were still addicted to buying crap . <p> George Carlson said , <p> @patrick The problem with your gym argument is that your assumptions are wrong . You start off by assuming that we need gyms and then asking " How we can fund our gyms ? " when the real question is " Do we need gyms ? Why ? " <p> The same can be said about health insurance . Mr. Obama started off with the premises that we all need health insurance and then asked congress to figure out how to fund it for everyone . However , the real question is " Do we need health insurance ? " <p> Same questions can be extrapolated to most everything . <p> patrick said , <p> @ george <p> The question of do we need gyms boils down to societal goals and values . If we as a society ( however you define that we and that society ) do n't  value health and fitness , then a gym becomes superfluous . If we do value health and fitness , then a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that valuation . It is not the only one of course . <p> The real question , though , is not do we need a gym because then any one person can change the answer , if they are included in your we . A better question would be do I need a gym to achieve my goals ? The more people that think about this question , the more the economics of a gym changes . <p> As more people accurately answer that question , the dynamics in my first post start to emerge , with the truly passionate who need a gym still supporting it , and those who do n't  need it abandoning it . Currently , those who do n't  need a gym but support it anyway subsidize those who do need a gym to achieve their goals . <p> Obviously , this is somewhat economically inefficient . However , I would n't complain about people overspending on a gym if I needed a gym to achieve my goals . I would let them subsidize me because of my better understanding of what I truly need etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they do n't  particularly want to change . If they did want to change , I would help them . <p> As Jacob points out in the original post , most people do n't  want to take the question of do I really need this ? why ? to its extreme , as he has . So what ? They 're subsidizing you in what you are doing , rather its gyms or sailing or whatever your passion is . Why try to change them , especially if they do n't  want to ? <p> Can you say certainly that what they are doing is harming you ? I 'm not sure I see the logic of how they are harming you by being economically inefficient . It would seem like they are helping you , by increasing the options for how you can achieve your goals , and decreasing the costs of those things need to achieve your goals . <p> Chad said , <p> The gym membership example is a great example , but I think it actually works against your point Patrick . <p> If those 5 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one ( their own , spend the extra cash on the higher memberhsip , etc . ) . In turn , these people would demand better and more efficietn gyms ( most gyms have tons of stuff that is rarely used , but kept around so they can say they have it ) . Because the cost of quality would be so high you would only purchase what you really needed . <p> If the same level of quality was adhered to across the entire economy the people who had " gym memberships " , but never used them , would take their cash and spend it on what they really want . In turn , what they really want would be of higher quality , but more expensive . <p> patrick said , <p> @chad <p> Are n't  the few passionate members the same group of members who are most likely to use that rarely used stuff , and therefore be most affected by cutting it ? To my knowledge , most people who use gyms infrequently do n't  actually bother to figure out how to use most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bikes , basic free weights , and other common machines . This is why , at least at the gyms Ive seen , there are more treadmills than fancy machines . <p> I generally agree with buying top-quality stuff in order to save money in the long run and to enjoy the stuff while it lasts . In practice , I 'm often too stingy to actually fork out the money , but I 'm getting better . Luckily , the freshest vegetables , fruit , and meat here in Sydney are also the cheapest = ( found in poor suburbs where , predominantly , Asians live and actually cook and care about ingredient quality , as opposed to people in richer neighborhoods ) . Also , buying bulk allows you the best quality for half the cost of supermarket-quality . Sometimes , though , bad quality is the way to go : eg. , I 've found a brand of cheap and flimsy flip-flops ( Omni ) that cost about $10 and wear out in a 1/2-1 year but are the most comfortable things I 've ever worn on my feet . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case they stop producing them = <p> BentTooner said , <p> One of the problems I have with Patricks argument is the implicit idea that those who over-consume are doing so with no negative ramifications . Patrick writes : <p> " Currently , people who overconsume both subsidize those who wisely consume and subsidize more options for them . " <p> This comment seems to ignore how over-consumption is achieved . In most cases , over-consumption ( by individual people and countries ) goes hand in hand with debt and abuse of the resources available . <p> The negative , long-term effects of the massive over-consumption and debt at all levels is being felt now by everyone and is not truly a beneficial subsidy to others . The options available to us are quickly disappearing as the world-wide economy stumbles . Its possible those options will almost completely disappear if people do n't  start using the resources more wisely . Gym memberships seem pretty trivial if you cant afford food . <p> The negative effects of over-consumption will continue to drag down economies for a VERY long time . Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwed by over-consumption and the debt behind it . <p> Something akin to ERE will be forced on people if they do n't  adopt it willingly now . Its just a question of timing and degree . Many people are already there today . <p> Patrick is on to something , but I do n't  think that the gym example addresses what I deem to be a bigger flaw with ERE , one which Jacob points to with his " it is generally agreed that extreme early retirement although simple in design is hard to follow " comment . I , on the other hand , do n't  think quality of life ( standard of living ) is the bigger issue here as that is entirely subjective . We can all adopt and change our perception about what quality is even if our options shrink . Why has quality of life shrunk over the years as our economy and options available to us have grown ? <p> The bigger issue to me is that the ERE possibility only exists if a small percentage of the population actually live it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is dependent on economic or GDP growth . <p> If , say 50% of the population decided to pursue ERE and our GDP drastically shrank as a result , this would eat into the capital base that those investment returns were coming from . With less returns to live off of , one would be forced to drop ERE and go back to work ( that is , of course , if doomsday panic did n't  set in first as those without capital to draw from walked around the streets like zombies looking for food ) . <p> As such , ERE is a strategy that only works if a small % of the population actually adopt it . In my opinion , being dependent on the same kind of consumer waste activity which we strive to rid ourselves from is the great and only flaw of ERE . We want people to live like us , just not everybody , b/c then we 'd all have to find another way to afford our basic expenses . I 'm really struggling with this . <p> BentTooner said , <p> GEM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on MUCH less than most people do because I have no debt and I have learned to do so many things myself . <p> The question of where one gets even the much-reduced income I need is the hard one to answer for me , especially today with ridiculously low interest rates on savings . <p> ERE apparently suggests buying certain stocks and living off dividends . Instead , I buy CDs and buy food and energy from the interest income . So , I 'm not technically an EREer , I guess . <p> Even my interest income is somewhat dependent on the profligacy of our society , I suppose . <p> I have acquired skills in making and repairing things that allow me to barter , trade , etc. with people for the few extra things I want . <p> I will not ignore or deny the fact that we generally vastly over-consume simply because a reduction in the consumption rate might make my life more challenging . <p> Again , I fear if we do n't  start slowing down the consumption , we will be FORCED to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious the masses will NOT even begin to make a dent in the over-consumption . So , its sadly a moot point for now All you can do is hope for the best and prepare for the worst . <p> The last two points are excellent and do point to a problem with the ERE concept ( I am halfway through the book ) . To the extent that ERE is based on replacing work with investment income , its killed at least in the US by ZIRP ( the current 0% interest rate policy of the federal reserve ) . <p> Essentially , if interest rates are set at zero , you do n't  get any income from your savings . You either deplete the savings or keep them intact and do n't  use them . Depleting the savings is actually a better strategy if there is inflation , which ZIRP is designed to induce , but either way savings become useless for any sort of long term strategy . <p> Likewise , stagnant wages and high unemployment gets rid of the " work long hours in a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of the savings " strategy . These jobs are harder to get . Though even back in the day hiring managers were effective in screening out people psychologically prone to doing htis . <p> However the valuable parts of the book and the site focus on reducing consumption , being more satisfied with lower consumption , and thinking more strategically about money in general ( for example , the point about a lower consumption strategy translating into increased spending at certain times , to get higher quality or to take advantage of bargains ) . This is good stuff because the way the world economy is headed we will all wind up with a lower consumption lifestyle whether we want to or not . <p> The way the world economy is headed , we will all need another war to rejuvinate spending and consumption of resources , at the price of hundreds of millions of lives lost . <p> I rather have more people on earth consuming only what they needed , working only when they had to , and living a semi-retired Mexican/Scientific fisher/fun-researcher life , then having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What if everybody decided to work much less ? : This is an interesting exploration of work , the value of money , and standard of living from Early Retirement Extreme .

@@42287689 @2287689/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Disclaimer : I have been a prosper lender since July 2006 . I have had close to $10000 invested in prosper and at one point I was in the top 1000 lenders in terms of portfolio sizes . However , I have stopped lending money on prosper . If there was a way to sell loans , I would do so but there is n't so currently I am just pulling my money out as it becomes available . The rest of this blog entry details my personal opinions and experiences with peer to peer-lending . I advice you to do your own due diligence ! <p> I got caught by the bug of lending money to people a little less than one and a half years ago . On the top of my head I could think of several reasons of why peer to peer-lending seemed superior to other passive income generating investments . <p> First of course was the higher interest rates . I figured that if I could get an interest rate of 10% plus the experian default rate and choose my borrowers wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus if I sold off some stock positions , I could throw $40000 into prosper , which would result in monthly income of 40000*0.12/12 = $400/month . Sweet ! <p> I would get to help borrowers directly . <p> Borrowers in turn would be more responsible about paying back my money . I figured borrowers would be less apt cheat regular folks out of their money compared to credit card companies . <p> By cutting out the middle man , administration costs would go down . <p> It turned out later that these assumptions are not entirely justified . <p> Still I retained a bit of skepticism . Basically my strategy was not to lend more than $50 except under exceptional circumstances and then no more than $100 . Not lend to anyone with current delinquencies . To stay away from high risk and no credit borrowers and people with crazy loan requests . And finally always to get 10% above the experian default rate . <p> I thus entered slowly building up my position over about half a year . At the time I also read articles about people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taking out hundreds of dollars of interest a day . Greed is good ? <p> Everything went great for the first several months as I was building up to over 200 loans . Then I got a few late payments . Then a few more and soon I had my first 3+ month late loan . Things still looked pretty bright though . At that point I expected that the loan would be sold off . Of course however , this is not the case if there are no buyers . Some of these late prosper loans can linger for many months and until they are charged off , you cant even claim them as capital loss on your tax return . Meanwhile , interest income keeps accruing . I hope this will change someday . <p> About a year after I started , late loans became a way of life and the merciless consequences of statistics began to factor in . I also began to notice patterns . People would get a loan , make one payment , and then stop . Others would make 3-5 payments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to sucker the lenders and made one payment to have a plausible excuse of good intentions . The second kind would probably default in the time it took them to burn through their loan ignoring their stated intent to get out of debt . <p> I should say that maybe about " only " 10% of my portfolio has or is expected to default so far . Most borrowers are good people . It is the remaining 10% that ruins it for everyone else and causes the high interest rates . It is not uncommon for someone to borrow the maximum amount of $25000 and then declare bankruptcy a couple of months later . Words describing my opinion of these people are not fit for print ! <p> For me prosper has been a valuable and not too expensive learning experience on the financial habits of my fellow human beings . Some of the things people want to borrow money for are just outright crazy . I also found it interesting that it is very difficult to predict who will break or keep their promises . I now understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high interest rates . It is not to screw people over . It is to cover their default rates and the high interest rate should basically be thought of as an insurance premium rather than a profit . If there was a better way to weed out the bad borrowers , the rest of us could enjoy loans at the prime rate . <p> However , as far as I know the credit card companies have not come up with anything better than credit scores . The question then becomes whether a peer to peer-lender can come up with something better . Some group leaders have personally vetted all their loans rather than just relying on stated income , etc . I believe this work is worth something and will be rewarded . For those of us that just go by the numbers e.g. set up " screens " like we would screen stocks for P/B , P/E or PEG values , we should probably expect to come in just under the bank return of investment rate . The reason is that we as peer to peer lenders are dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are not adding much value to the process by merely running a few screens . <p> Still some lenders are obviously doing great and counting no defaults . Now they may be exceptionally good at judging borrowers , but I suspect that a bigger reason is because they have few loans ( maybe 50 or less ) , a shorter lending history , and that they have simply been lucky so far . Small concentrated portfolios come with higher volatilities , so for those who have only invested a couple of thousand on prosper and is seeing 15% returns , it may be a question of luck rather than genius . peer to peer lending is no different here than a concentrated stock portfolio . In particular those who invested in high risk loans AND were lucky would see very high returns or whereas those who have been unlucky see very negative returns . <p> Peer to per lending adds to diversification . The question is how much diversification it adds compared owning shares in the financial sector that does consumer lending already . Clearly diversification within a sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as we saw the the CDOs ) . Of course with prosper one gets the entire human factor and bidding on loans can be addictive like eBay auctions which of course is fun for all the wrong reasons and thus should be discouraged . I note however that the human factor does not seem to be much different for peer to peer loans . Stranger to stranger loans seems to be more descriptive of the arrangement . <p> Personally I am getting returns from lendingstats around 8-8.5% . This is no better than the return on closed-end high yield income funds . The latter comes with the added benefit of being easily sold or bought whereas prosper loans are locked in for three years with little control . Since I mainly invest for returns rather than the charitable aspects , I prefer tradable and preferably senior issues for my fixed income needs unless the returns outweigh the risk of uncollateralized loans . This has not been the case for my prosper venture and since I do not know how to fix it , I am liquidating my position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Prosper " <p> Jacob , can you tell me how you were able to gain financial freedom at 32 . <p> What extreme savings did you do ? 20% , 30 , 40% of your income <p> Please share 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I have been saving somewhere in the neighborhood of 70% of my disposable ( i.e. after tax ) wage income on a consistent basis . <p> When I reached FI , I dropped it down to 50ish and allowed myself some discretionary spending . I plan to write about it in more detail soon . Hopefully one of these days . Incidentally , suggestions for topics are very welcome ! <p> Actually I hit the investment income &gt; expense threshold last year possibly even in 2005 depending on how you count it ( 2005 was a good year for me ) . <p> Very nice article . Thanks for putting this together and thanks for LazyMan for linking to it . <p> This is the part that struck me that most and I 'd say Ive also learned from my experience with Prosper . I do n't  view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also found it interesting that it is very difficult to predict who will break or keep their promises . I now understand why credit card companies and payday loan companies charge exorbitantly high interest rates . It is not to screw people over . It is to cover their default rates and the high interest rate should basically be thought of as an insurance premium rather than a profit . " <p> Like you have clarified , it is more of a stranger to stranger borrowing . <p> In our part of the world , we get a group together ( real peers ) , each contributes a sum monthly or weekly and we all each take turns taking the money . <p> So all of us have forced savings . And the earlier ones get sort of a loan from the later receivers . <p> But only amongst known people and completely informal . No websites , adverts etc <p> RG said , <p> Jacob Great article . When you view Prospers Exec list and understanding sqft in downtown San Fran is utterly expensive . The spread they gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in somewhere it just has to be . There is obviously something that drew you into peer to peer lending . The overall concept is appealing and you can see where with enough attention paid to credit decisions keeping defaults low may prove to be a more viable business model . Personally I enjoy the antibanking/corporitism concept and know from experience in banking there is a TON of waste and overkill . There has to be a way to leverage technology , make very high quality loan decisions ( maybe requiring proof of income ) to help curve the default percentages . I personally am very interested in the peer to peer concept and having been in lending for 17 years there is a way to do this business profitably for investor , borrower AND firm . <p> Thanks for this article ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ RG What is needed in my mind is a better way of evaluating borrowers . Prosper seems to demonstrate that Experian scores are not useful since people seem to default at a greater rate than predicted at least for my 200 loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effective interest rate either . Maybe if there was a better way to hold people accountable to their promises . Another idea might be to have people put 20% of the money down that they wished to borrow . <p> I only have one loan on Prosper for the $50 because 1 . I just do n't  have money to lend like that and 2 . I decided to use Lending Club instead . <p> The reason I went with Lending Club is that I did not get funding on Prosper . Now I have an average credit score but I have never been late on a payment or missed a payment on anything . Part of the reason for the low score is my short credit history ( I was a cash only person for a long time ) and I have low limits on some cards . I ended up doing balance transfers to take advantage of the lower interest rates so I have a high utilization rate . This threw off some Prosper lenders but on Lending Club people were more open . My loan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of my own money and be a lender on Lending Club . <p> I have six loans for $25 each , one is current on payments and the other 5 just got funded so they are in review . I am sorry that you lost money , but just remember that there are still good people out there who will pay back their loans . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @lulugal11 I know .. I even know that 9 out of 10 ( per year ) are good borrowers . It is the bad kind of borrowers that throw me off on a tangent . I think it depends on how one enters the deal . For instance , if I invest in a portfolio of junk bonds , I expect some of the included companies to go down . OTOH if I personally lend money to another person I implicitly expect that person to pay it back . Wrong expectations , I know . At least now I know why payday lenders charge such huge interest rates . <p> nc broker said , <p> The elephant in the room is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you count the amount of time the money was sitting in Prosper account not earing anything like while bidding , waiting for background check etc . Prosper should pay some nominal rate while they are sitting on our money . This must be their way of earning more money . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ nc broker I minimized my float by only bidding on in loans that already were 90% funded and of course ( argh ) by having lots of money invested compared to the float . Still , its kinda annoying not to be earning any interest while its just sitting there . One could say the same about many broker accounts too though = <p> Utah Tom said , <p> What type of portfolio methodology did you use ? Was it systematic or " haphazard " ? The new prosper portfolio plans allow for different criteria to be used to increase/decrease risk and returns . They are too new to have a decent track record . What are your thoughts about the changes made in collection companies ? I agree there is room for improvement in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your comments , but I am still intrigued by P2P lending and think that it ( like all new things ) will evolve to become a reasonable investing vehicle . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @utah tom I used a cutoff rate based on the experian default rate + 10% . I allowed 0 current delinquencies . Debt/income &lt; 20% . Generally 0 public records ( with some exceptions in the beginning ) . Only $50 per loan with few exceptions . Most loans were manually screened against the most outrageous requests . You can find my stats here . You can find the stats of another blogger who is still quite enthusiastic about prosper here . <p> When I loaned to AA homeowners with &lt;15% dti on Prosper , they paid . When I loaned to a D who I thought would pay , she paid . When I listened to group leaders for their C , B , A people , these loans have defaulted , or are 1,2 3 , or 4 months late . The person that got the best cheerleading is going bankrupt . I am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bankrupting person who was well-cheerleaded and posted a beautiful picture ( which did n't  affect me but perhaps affected the cheerleaders . <p> The bad thing for me is that Prosper did n't  yet respond to inquiries to them on the bad accounts . <p> I 'd theft screwed my credit score and it is hard to fix it , emotionally , time-wise , etc . It is finally getting better , however . I greatly appreciate the Prosper lenders that helped me re-establish my credit rating by loaning to me when my score was HR ( because of the I 'd theft ) . These people helped me so much . I am grateful . My loan is ahead of schedule in payments . <p> It is very difficult to out perform professional lender . However , I heard of the micro bank in developing country Africa ? doing not bad to lend out seed money to start home base business buy sewing machine , chicken to lay eggs , cattle for mill and etc . <p> lending club lender said , <p> Looks like Prosper is very close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal after all is said and done . Will see how its bankruptcy affects other P2Ps , like Lending Club . <p> DaveP said , <p> I found that a couple of people defaulted right away , a couple paid it all back , and most paid back the principle , but then stopped paying when it got to paying the interest . <p> In short , I got hosed ( mostly ) . <p> Its a shame , because with credit crunches and banking crises this could have been a good way for communities to raise capital . <p> Perhaps if the lending had been more localized people would not have defaulted on their neighbors as much ? Who knows . <p> The problem with peer to peer lending is the same with most investments : people have no idea how to measure risk . Just because people are paying back today does not mean that they will pay back in the future . <p> People make the decision to loan based on todays default rates . But that is silly . What happens if the economy goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default rates will remain the same ? Probably not . They could double , triple or increase even more . They could exceed 50% or 90% . I do n't  know . <p> Nobody knows , nor can accurately measure that sort of thing . So that 's why I think it is too risky to invest a significant portion of your portfolio in such a way . <p> Macs said , <p> I recently decided to give this P2P lending a whirl ( using Zopa &amp; I 'm in the UK , so there may be some fundamental differences to Prosper ) <p> Quite agree with George , though , it is too risky for a significant part of the portfolio . It is by far the riskiest thing I will ever do with money , so its not going to see more than a few percent of my funds . I 'll keep it at about 1% til I 've built a track record . <p> I am willing to take some risk because I like the model of cutting out the bankers . If it pans out then I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it totally crashes , then I 've not lost more than 1% . Time will tell 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287690 @2287690/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I think this could be done . Obviously I am too old to prove it , but I have some ideas of what it would take . <p> First of all , prospects would have to be fiscally wise already . This is a fairly rare quality at that age level . I remember having no idea of what a mortgage or what bond duration was and retirement accounts where really far from my mind at the time . The main obstacle was and potentially still is that these topics were not even brought up at the time . Even if they were they would likely drown in a sea of well-intended advice about going to college , interning , writing resumes , and getting started on a 30 year long career in middle-class suburbia . <p> Second , and this is probably much more difficult to achieve in practice . You would have to be smart enough to go to college AND smart enough to not do it ( ! ) Most people including myself only managed to get to the first step . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the education you need from the public library ( I know some of you will disagree and say one can not get all the keggers , stimulating conversation with professors , and connections etc . ) . What you can not get is a degree , but you do not need a degree unless you want to work in a cubicle , that is , pushing papers for your employer/boss . <p> Now , having exited high school , the objective is to get paid as soon as possible . Highly skilled labor pays as much or more than college degree requiring office jobs . For instance , I know that the average starting salary of a watchmaker ( a 2 year education ) is 40k+ . The average salary of a trucker is similar and the education is even shorter . <p> After two years of study and five years of hard work , you should have arrived at age 24-26 . At this point , you would be a journeyman and able to either work on projects as you please , because you are financially independent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Not only will this avoid student debt ( which can also be largely avoided by going to school in your own state , paying rent to your own parents instead of someone elses parents , and working a part time job ) , but it will also avoid a couple of years of opportunity costs of taking college classes . College graduates do n't  get to earn money until they are 21-23 and then they would still have to work off their debt . <p> Beyond this , just follow the standard tenets of early retirement : Do n't  get stuck with large house and transportation costs , cut down recurring costs , learn to do your own service jobs , etc . <p> However , to do this you need to have an immensely strong character . You need to be convinced you are right in the face of much more opposition than you would face even if you were 10 years older . My suggestion would be to " hide " your aspirations and simply pick a skilled trade rather than the college education because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much in calculus and movie appreciation or whatever they teach in college these days = There should be plenty of ammunition , especially now , that often a college degree leads to being unemployed while being overqualified to flip burgers , while a trade might just be the ticket . <p> This does not mean that anyone with a skilled trade can just avoid education . You would need to learn to think , but if you got accepted for a good college , you should be able to teach yourself all this stuff anyway . <p> The general conclusion though is <p> Learn a useful ( employable ) skill <p> Do n't  get saddled up with debt <p> There are a few college degrees that fit into this criteria . However , there is a tendency to a ) rush headlong into stuff that is interesting , fun , and easy , due to the belief that a college degree per se is the magical key that opens doors . This was once the case , but today a college degree has been so watered out exactly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to what used to be HS level . You only need to find some 50 year old HS tests and see if you can answer the questions to see this . And b ) college educations are usually packaged with student loans . <p> On a personal level I do not regret the choices I made of spending 10 years in the educational system and exiting with a moderately employable and a barely " employerable " ( anyone want to purchase physics services ? ( * ) ) degree because it and the following work was fun at the time . I am happy that I was on a grant and stingy with my money ( did not have a debt mentality ) . However , from a strictly financial point of view I could have done much better . In fact the only thing I did right was not to make any mistakes on the negative side of the balance sheet . <p> ( * ) Yeah , I could tutor other people in how to become a physicist , but that would be like writing a blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ourselves a business model ! ! = <p> Jacob comments : For completeness I must also mention that you could start your own company . However , most start-ups fail and thus I would not consider this method as robust as the above . For every entrepreneur that cashed out at a young age , there are 10 or 20 that did not because they were not in the right place at the right time doing the right thing . <h> 24 users responded in " To become financially independent at 25 " <p> Great post for any young readers . Looking back I also view my college years as lost time ( except the social experience ) , but my economics classes were bread crumbs leading toward the path of ERE , so it was n't all a waste . They were a few extra years of innocence and complacency when I should have already been out making my own . A big part of taking the leap is believing its possible . All the requisite info is here on ERE , so if you already believe , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiction books per year , and you will have the equivalent of a college education . Instead of " investing in your human capital " you can invest in real capital . <p> Dan said , <p> Alternatively , if you are very smart and willing to work 80+ hours weeks for a few years , you could go to a top college , graduate at 21 or 22 work for 4 to 5 years at a bulge bracket investment bank ( 3 years as an analyst 1-2 years as an associate ) . Total pretax comp can exceed 700 in 4 years and 1 million in 5 ( I 'm operating on old numbers , I do n't  know what they are now ) . Many of the top colleges have replaced loans with grants , so out of pocket costs ends up being pretty low if your parents are not extremely high income . If you live frugally you could bank quite a bit more with this approach . <p> Alex Oliver said , <p> This is the path I 'm leaning toward taking ( I 'm 17 ) . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my early to mid-20s . Good post . <p> David said , <p> I 'm sort of on that path , at least planning/hoping to arrive at that goal . I am going to college , graduating this year ( my fourth year ) from a six year degree ( BS+MS ) , at 21 , which included 1 year of actual work experience . Have 50k saved from working 20hrs a week during school , and that year of work experience , and 20k in student loans . After graduation , start at 55-65k a year ( average for the field ) , living out of a van/truck , saving everything until FI , then sit back and enjoy the world <p> I actually think I would have enjoyed learning a trade and educating myself on my ownand I agree , you can become an educated person in a library or with other resources . <p> Financially , I am absolutely certain that college did me no favorsa friend of mine who dropped out of high school and cuts hair was making more than I was as a teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in school . I also knew several people who , out of college , made more money than I did as waiters and strippersso much for the financial need for a college degree ! <p> BUT ( hah , here it comes ) I think that for some people , the opportunity to go to college and study/research with great professors is worthwhile . I literally had professors who held special classes just for a few of us so we could carry out our own research ( and so that the professors could have an intelligent discussion ) . Its not the same just reading in the library , ok ! I like *discussing* ideas with *people* . Good luck finding someone to chat with you about vague French feminist authors or finding someone who had actually BEEN there when the Soviet Union took over Hungary to discuss communism with you in the public library . So there = <p> PSmy tuition was paid for by those people that were out having keggers in their khaki pants from Gap , so let 's not insult them , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ) <p> This all sounds good but you 're presuming that you can get a 21 yr old to buy into this way of thinking . Many of them are not mature enough to do so . Living on way less than they make would be critical . Neat idea but hard to implement . <p> cato said , <p> I am a 36 year old Database Administrator with a BS in Chemistry and Geology . If I told you the road Ive taken to get to this point in my " career " you would plant your face in your hands and either laugh or cry . At the age of 18 I wanted nothing more than to be an over the road truck driver . I had a plan to start off by getting my CDL , working for a well established company and then going independant after I had established my own contacts in the field . My father ( who had driven truck for nearly 30 years ) talked me out of this " plan " . " You 'll never be home . " Youll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help in site " ( this is before cell phones were common ) . " You 'll grow old and have all sort of aches and pains and then you 'll want a cushy office job , but wont be able to find one , because who wants to hire a truck driver for office work . " etc , etc . I now wish I had not listened to my old man , as well intentioned as he was <p> Financially , most college degrees probably are n't  worth it . The opportunity costs and do n't  really outweigh the earning potential except for the high value degrees . Though for those who did go to college , some companies will basically pay for you to go to grad school , so if that 's something you want to do you can look into that instead of paying for it yourself . <p> Having gone through college the reward for me was more than financial . I graduated from an engineering college . I 'm now in a field that I do find engaging , so its not 40+ hours a week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still with me . I have several good friends I can talk to , and not to mention I met my fiance there . But of course at 24 I 'm no where near retiring , buying this house and planning to have some kids probably is going to put that off even more . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Definitely something to consider Im going to put this in the " To Read " file for my son . ( Basically a compilation of stuff you wo n't find in textbooks/learn in school that I wish I would have read in my late teens/early 20s . ) <p> However , I think college is important to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills ( at least it was for me ) . Even though those are n't  specific classes on a students schedule they are important skills to learn . <p> Mo said , <p> I think one could probably achieve this as a dental hygienist . Supposedly the training can be accomplished in about 2 years . A bright individual could potentially earn above $60k/year by age 20 . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day long , in a subservient role to a dentist . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Not going to college typically means not finding mentors for your learning experience , something that I would have missed . No , I was n't a stellar student in college ( took me 6 years to finish a 4 year degree ) , but , once I figured out the game of college , it was a school that gave me what the education I was wanting . <p> On the other hand , no one sat me down and explained an FI plan to me . I 'm not sure it would have worked out since these were the Reagan years and employment was tough to come by fresh out of high school . <p> If I 'd gone the trades route , it would have been as an electrician or machinist . The plan could have started my junior year in high school , where we selected a major at the polytechnic high school and I would have been fairly advanced by age 18 , possibly with work experience in the trades already . 10151 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me well-organized information on a platter . ( Auditing classes is a lot cheaper , though , and most professors will let you . ) <p> I met all my smart friends in college or grad school or through people I had met there . As you implied in your last post , its not that easy to find smart people to be friends . It might be even harder as a watchmaker , trucker , hair-cutter , waiters , dental hygienist , electrician , or machinist . Its definitely harder as a stripper ( she says , mysteriously ) . <p> So , your plan needs to include a way to meet people you 'll like . <p> Finally , I 'd like to add that its hard to learn maturity from a book . I admit that college is an expensive half-way house , but an early retirement plan might need to include ways to safely practice at adulthood before being thrown in headlong . <p> stephanie said , <p> My entire career path ( which led to self employment ) stemmed from the connections I made while in college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I love doing while still in school , then took it on full time once I graduated . The road would have been 10x harder if I had n't  been to college and I did not even socialize that much at school just worked hard . Those 4 years were WELL worth it . <p> fandd said , <p> My old school system had a joint enrollment program with the technical college . You could graduate with a high school diploma and a trade . College prep students were not encouraged to go that route . I only know of one college prep student who graduated with the credentials to be an auto mechanic . And we were all in awe of him . <p> I briefly attended EMT school and noticed that tech students were a different animal . Most of the students I saw actually had skills before entering school . They had been doing hair and nails for years or already knew how to build an engine . They just needed the credentials . Walking into school knowing nothing would put you far , far behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to have specialized knowledge on day one of college . <p> I worked 4 years towards a humanities degree . Had a great time and all that , but at the end of it ended up learning a trade and making just over $100k/annually working side by side with a bunch of high school grads . <p> Then got laid off , but that sours the story a little <p> Another option for people who value the college experience would be to save up , retire at 25 , THEN go to school and study whatever you like . Not yet too old at that point to hang out with the wiser of the upper-classmen and still have a good time . <p> I started a business when I graduated high school . It is still running , I do it full time now . I wont say I make a TON of money , but it pays the bills and gives me the chance ( and time ! ) to do other things at the same time , and I never planned on retiring at 25 ( since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in 05 , college in 07 ( with a degree in anthropolgy ) , certificate of paralegal studies in 08 . No debt , no loans . Since I did n't  have to pay for college I thought it was better to do it now versus the potential savings I could gain by working , especially since I completed my BA in 2 years instead of 4 . <p> I think programming , especially web-oriented is an excellent trade for a young person to learn without going to school . Its common to get into this field being self taught anyway , so lacking a degree is n't a big deal , and you can prove your ability quite easily by creating quality applications . <p> I did n't  finish college until my later 20s and learned all my programming skills on my own while in between colleges . <p> patrick said , <p> I 'm 18 . I 'm considering doing this . My interest has always been personal finance , amongst other things , but I want to work in finance . That basically necessitates a degree . Does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to get a college degree for under 20,000 dollars ( check out LONG ... ) After that , the difference in earnings that a degree theoretically gives you should make up for that shortly . <p> However , I do n't  necessasrily want to retire right away . I see that as an option , but not one I want to pursue . I could see being financially independent , but still working in finance and as a speaker . But that 's just me . Anyway , I hope that link is useful to somebody . <p> Very inspiring post for us 20somethings ! University ( I assume especially in the States ) can be very pricey ( I went down to Washington to check out a doctorate program in my field and it was $45,000 a year- here in Canada , we pay $8800 for two years ) . I think that a general degree ( liberal arts , general science ) is n't very helfpul in securing a good job . Almost everyone I know who went that route ended up having to go to a Technical College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and get their jobs . That 's potentially 6 years of school . I would just skip the general degree and go straight into technical college . <p> cyberyank said , <p> Ive been a career student until around 30 . I did n't  know what to do .

That did not work out for me . <p> If I had to do it all over again , I would have dropped out of undergrad after the second year and either gone to a trade school or tried to start a business . Even as an attorney I am considered very young and clients have been surprised at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prodigy which helps a little I guess , but it has probably also hurt . So you ca n't be too young . <p> Everyone complaining about college not being worth it got terrible degrees . Do n't  go to college to become a teacher and then complain that it was n't worth it because your friend waiting tables makes as much as you . I went to college and got a practical degree in accounting which has set me on a career path making pretty decent money . I could n't have gotten this job without a college degree . Yes , mechanics or electricians or other tradesman can possibly make as much or more then I , but I enjoy my job and would not want to be in those professions . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

Getting out of the consumer mindset is also key to reducing expenses in the " needs " department . Lacking competence or willingness its easy to just add a few more years of work to the equation . Some even add 30 years or more , but in a productive and affluent country , anyone can choose the number of years they want to work . <h> 36 users responded in " The budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been feeling a little lost and down the last few weeksand this post sums up so much in so little words . <p> Probably one of your best posts ever , and now one of my personal favorites <p> schaefer said , <p> Very nice post ! But how am I supposed to get my savings grow by 6% per year ? In Germany , you get about 2% with a risk-free fixed deposit which is about the inflation rate 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @schaefer Personally , I prefer dividend paying stocks for the practical implementation of this . Naturally , this means that the numbers will fluctuate more than give above . <p> Jeff said , <p> Hey Jacob . No more blogging for me . Keeping my social class mobility to myself . I do n't  even talk about it much with other people either since everybody I know is a worker for life . Still reading here every day though and very glad to have happened upon the site so long ago . <p> Been at it for about 2 years now , and I do n't  quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . $50k savings currently on a couple percentage points of returns for the year after 70% last year . GEs taking their sweet time coming around . Was glad to see WAG pop right back the other day since I picked up a couple more blocks of them during their dip . Anyway , at least total savings is on track for the 2 year mark . <p> This year is on pace for spending $9200 out of $24500 after tax earnings . I will have splurged an extra $1k this year compared to last , mostly on food and transport . Housing/heating/internet is still $5k with one roommate . I do n't  think I 'd ever go down to $6k a year unless times got really hard . Looks like itll be 10 years for me instead of 5 . Boss says raises are on the way as our little company gets bigger . So maybe closer to 5 years after all . Hope alls well , looking forward to the book . <p> Jeff from obadobadope <p> Maus said , <p> The exercise is fine as an exemplar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaky assumptions ; 1 . The 6% ROI would be difficult for anyone to earn without accepting significant volatility over the five-year period ; 2 . The draw down of $6,995 in YR5 exceeds the SWR of 4% ; 3 . In the current economy , YoY 3% raises are way too optimistic . I 've actually had a 10% salary reduction through mandatory furloughs ; and 4. $500 per month for total living expenses is certainly possible , but not probably for the majority of those hoping to ERE . I seem to recall from the forum that most adherents to the ERE philopophy are actually saving 40-70% of gross . <p> akratic said , <p> Are you assuming returns on savings of 9% , so you can spend 6% of it freely , and reinvest 3% to offset inflation ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Maus Compounding does n't  do a whole lot here compared to the savings . Compounding works better if you only save 15% and wait for 30 years . SWR is based on withdrawal from a total return portfolio . I bet income oriented portfolios can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work another year . <p> @akratic 6% nominal , 3% inflation , 3% real . It does n't  matter what I assume though . I think the numbers are realistic and not even optimistic compared to the 10% annualized returns seen in very many other places . Anyone is free to insert their own numbers . <p> Suppose we ran the numbers for 30,000 income , 6,000 expenses , 33% inflation , 36% savings ( I do n't  think this is realistic , its just to prove a point ) <p> After 1 year : You have $24000 , your expenses increased to $7,980 , and your income increased to $39,900 . Next year , you will get $8,640 in investment income . <p> Crossover after just 1 year ? With 3% real return ? <p> ( My 9% comment above was because the only way I could reproduce your results was with a 6% real return . ) <p> VLKN said , <p> For me the timetable is possible , I can earn more money faster , spend a little bit more . For me ERE is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future . <p> But the bottleneck is the return on savings . You can not take the average , because you will depend on your yearly investment income . I can only figure out two solutions , You are a super smart investor with almost zero volatility and steady returns ( of an amazing 6% ) or you need more savings , so you can cushion declines in returns on savings . I think this part of the ERE philosophy needs some more clarity . <p> But of course the ERE philosophy is not only about certainty and making the numbers work . Nothing is certain , your monetarily capital neither . ERE is as well about skills and your personal outlook , can you survive in different situations , or are you dependent on our consumer society . <p> I thank Jacob ( I 'm following this blog for almost a year ) for making me aware of the ERE concept , sharing his concepts ( which enriches my thinking ) at my young age . <p> VLKN said , <p> Because i still have plenty of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Everybody should keep in mind that its impossible to use math on the real world and expect exact resultsmainly because the real world is not exact . And yet Wall Street does it and have to be shown dramatically from time to why it does n't  work that way . <p> In your extreme example , you cant discretize that coarsely ( a grid with 1 year resolution ) . If you discretized it to monthly values , youd probably come out alright . Another way would be use 3 or 5 point equations instead of the very simple 2 point equations I used . <p> I am walking a fine line between using math that is slightly inaccurate which yet everybody should be able to understand and heavy stuff which will cause peoples heads to explode and gain 6-18 months in accuracy . ( For heavy math users I got semi-analytic derivations in the book , still I hope nobody will take the output of any equation at face value . ) <p> Finally , there 's no use of SWR in this post . SWR are intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply wanted to demonstrate how quickly one could enter " the ball park " . <p> Another thing to look at is the possibility of starting a small business outside of what you normally do for a living . Think what an extra $500 dollars a month would mean for your budget . There are so many ideas out there for making some money on the side , they just require some hard work to set them up . <p> jc said , <p> " Everybody should keep in mind that it 's impossible to use math on the real world and expect exact results " mainly because the real world is not exact . " <p> yep . that why my approach was/is simpler : a+b=c where " a " is what you save " b " is what you spend and " c " is your total after tax income . <p> Clearly the larger a and the smaller b the sooner you reach FI . <p> Not only because the smaller your needs ( b ) the larger and faster your savings/investments ( a ) will grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b <p> I understand your point about not applying the SWR . But even a well-chosen dividend strategy , which might obviate the market volatility since we only care about the associated dividend stream , is going to have difficulty reaching 6% YoY yield in the short time frame you 've established . Realistically , you can not lard your porfolio soley with T or MLPs to begin with that kind of return and expect preservation of capital for the long haul . <p> Anna said , <p> I 'm a bit confused , do n't  you have to pay tax on your investment income too ? <p> Ralphy said , <p> @ Jeff from obadobadope <p> Count me among those that miss your blog it was one I liked to check frequently . <p> One of the underrated aspects of Jacobs site ( for me , at least ) has always been the blogroll . Seems like I browse it a lot less now since I just read the top article before heading to the forum . <p> So is it correct to assume you are using a 6% risk free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,000 assuming you are doing so by yourself , or off/with ones wife ? <p> Cheers <p> Ralphy said , <p> How much of that 24,000 would you want to put into retirement accounts ? Assuming they 're all available , you could fit almost all of it into your 401k , HSA and IRA , but then you lose the current investment income . Or is the post-tax 24,000 what 's left after using those accounts ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Financial Samurai Well , its correct to assume that I just used 6% nominal . I would n't base my retirement on the simplistic calculation I just presented . This was simply to show how quickly one can rack up savings and how much they will yield . For actual viability , I 'd invest it in something that provides 3% real returns . Whatever strikes your fancy . I like stocks , but I 'd love to own timber land instead . <p> I can do $6000 on one person pretty much in any state in the US. $6000 for two persons would be a serious challenge . However , for two persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @Ralphy That depends on how you can swing it . If you can 72t it , I 'd put a lot in it . If you cant , I 'd create two portfolios ; one to last from present age to 59.5 ( assuming its US ) and one from 59.5 until death and make sure you hit the right amounts as the same time . Similar calculation . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Anna That depends on the country . In the past few years , dividends in the US have not been taxed . If you pull it out of a Roth account , the answer is no as well . <p> " I can do $6000 on one person pretty much in any state in the US. $6000 for two persons would be a serious challenge . However , for two persons , you have twice the income . " <p> This is the issue with many pf blogs , and most frugal pf blogs : it assumes single people or DINKS ( dual income , no kids ) . <p> In the real world , you have one spouse working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or , you have both spouses working and home help , etc . In both cases you have children to clothe , educate , feed , and provide childcare for . <p> Sure , you do n't  need my $250k a year budget , but the other bookend is the $6k ( or , $12k a year ) budget they are equally absurd IMHO . <p> The annuity idea is pretty good . After all , if you 're living on $6000/yr , there should be no thoughts of leaving a lumpsum for heirs . Looking at some internet SPIA quote engines , $6000/yr inflation indexed would require about $187K to buy which comes out to 3.2% real distribution . 50% annuity , 50% stocks/bonds and you have a pretty stable retirement income stream . <p> In general , the drawback of an annuity is that you can never tap the equity that is backing the annuity if you needed to , thus I find things like laddered CDs to be a better option . Of course todays CD rates stink , but if there 's ever a need for the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'm trying to find my old links again to get the inflation-indexed quotes but cant seem to google them up again . ( ImmediateAnnuities.com does not give inflation-indexed quotes . ) I was sure Vanguards site used to when their annuities were backed by AIG . <p> OK , Vanguard does still have quotes for inflation-indexed SPIAs . However , now it requires a regular Vanguard login that then redirects you to an external website . The external site then requires you to register for access to get a quote . I just entered some sample numbers for a 45-year old male ( youngest the quote engine will allow ) and I get : <p> AIG ( A1 ) , $60K -&gt; $150/mo Principal ( Aa3 ) , $60K -&gt; $136/mo <p> So to get the $6000 annual payout , the deposit numbers would be $200K and $220K respectively . <p> For me , this example shows the very real costs of todays consumption . Looking at it in terms of the amount of years it will take to offset your current spending is pretty scary ! <p> bigato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my situation . I should say that I discovered the blog less than two months ago and have been reading posts almost every day . Had managed to reduce expenses to 30% of income already , but working to reduce much more . <p> While saving tons of money can be great , it can all severely diminish the quality of your life . There comes a point where you cant really reduce your expenses anymore , so the only alternative is to increase your income . <p> That by itself is not a difficult thing to do . Getting a second job may not be your ideal scenario , but if it allows you to live in a lifestyle where you are happy then why not ? <p> I 'm 21 and live completely independent . Own my own home , car , everything . Plus I have a beautiful baby on the way . It did n't  take 5 years . Just a few months to find the right job and prove my worthiness to my superiors and be promoted . People just need to be willing to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 years . It may be difficult to save 80 percent of your income , but Early Retirement Extreme believes its possible to become financially independent in 5 years on a $30,000 per year salary . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287704 @2287704/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Dear normal people , <p> I know you love talking to people about people , their kids , sports , their kids sports , the weather , how someone or something " is doing " , who got promoted and who did n't  , and all the supposedly exciting drama of " he said she said " that entails . I know that your idea of fun usually involves people , parties , celebrations , outings , and that the only way you can interact with others is over breakfast , lunch , or dinner . <p> ( Did it ever occur to you that you use your mouth too much ? ) <p> I know that you like to entertain and that you prefer your " stage " to be as large as possible . I know that you also like to watch other people on stage and that you like surprises , especially surprise parties . I also know that you like to shop and buy beautiful things and that you like to decorate your house with conversation objects which can be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you idea of new experiences involves meeting new people or going to new places and that those places are shops , restaurants , clubs , and bars , whichever country they may be in . I know that you genuinely care that other people are having fun in the same way as you do , that is , talking about kids , sports , kids sports , , I get that ! And I know that you think that other people who do not enjoy your preferred activities of going out to eat or shop must be shy or socially retarded or loners , who are not living an exciting and fulfilled life , like you do . I get that too ! <p> The fact is , however , that there are few things that I and others like me find more boring and less enriching than " socializing " . The level of stimulation I get from normal social conversation with normal people , firing off brief sound bites in restaurants can best be illustrated by spending 30 minutes looking at the following diagram . Just try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I occasionally partake in social events is to make you happy . <p> I like complexity pondering how economics , market theory , ecology , physics , history , sociology , etc. interact on a grand scale . This requires a strong imagination and lot of information to process to appreciate . I have realized that in most cases , normal people are not a source of information or interesting ideas , and giving them the benefit of the doubt tends to have a bad return on investment . Hence , I prefer to hang out with a select few friends and associates . <p> I also realize that peoples writing tend to be better composed than their spoken word with less redundancy and repetitions . I can read and think approximately 10 times faster than I can listen to someone talk , so listening is an idling experience . I have noticed , though , that if I get drunk , my brain functions slow down and I become normal or even slightly retarded which makes it less frustrating to socially interact with normal people . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martial arts , fix bikes , play hockey , read several books a week , volunteer for a nonprofit organization , write a blog , and write a book , and have previously been interested in biology , electronics , astronomy , programming , brewing , cooking , fitness , strength training , cycling , jet planes , and many other things . I can participate in most any sport you can think of or at least give it the old college try . Regretfully , most normal people are typically not in any shape to do this . I can also discuss most topics . Regretfully , again , normal people usually do not know anything because they rarely open a book and only talk about their kids , sports , their kids sports , etc . Hence , interacting with normal people degenerates to the lowest common denominator which is eating out ( many normal people can not cook either ) and talking about the mundane details of our lives . I do not enjoy that and so I prefer to hang out with people who are interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and initiative go somewhat beyond watching TV and playing computer games , so I do not need someone else to structure my day to have a sense of purpose or avoid getting bored . I can entertain myself all day for years on end . I also understand that with few interests and a lack of imagination , jobs or organized activities are helpful to provide the structure for those who can not create it themselves . <p> Now I am willing to entertain the idea that somehow I got this all backwards , but I am not willing to discuss it over dinner at a stupid restaurant . If you want to convince me , I 'd need a 1000 words essay on why exactly my life is not fulfilling and yours somehow is . <p> Sincerely , Yours . <p> Jacob comments : I do not mind that people enjoy socializing and I do not think it is an inferior activity ; it is just not for me . ( As I alluded to I think of it as a information gathering activity something which it is quite worthless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is almost a lost art how to have a conversation if there are more than 2-3 people involved . The more the worse . Try bringing 10 people to a restaurant and see what happens . ) <p> Now , what I do not like , nay , what I almost resent is the cultural perception that socializing as described above , that is , going to an eatery and small talking , is THE activity to strive for and that if you do not enjoy it you are judged to be inferior and that you live an miserable life . <p> I know that this judging covers the entire range of " well-intentioned " , but it is quite arrogant nonetheless . Outings is just one activity out of many , yet it is so utterly dominant as an activity that suggesting that people live a boring life if they do n't  play soccer , say , whenever they get together would be extremely weird . Come to think of it , I liked doing activities with many people when I was a kid because it usually involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social activities turned to " going out " , things just became less interesting . <p> ( There is a similar perception that travel is awesome ( if you do n't  go anywhere , you never experience anything ) , that children are awesome ( if you do n't  have them you are not fulfilled ) and that accumulating possessions is awesome ( if you do n't  have a lot of stuff you are not successful . However , none of these are as strong as the " going out " expectation . ) <p> I am very well aware that many people enjoy socializing because their " interface " is not one of information gathering and processing , nor is it one of mastering the physical world or contemplating the spiritual world , but of connecting with people . However , due to the above it is as if they in particular can not , will not , or simply habitually ignore that many people are simply going along with the cultural ideal simply because it is so normal . <p> Sometimes I would really wish to drag your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person that now were just going to wander around here for 4 hours and enjoy ourself , not talking , and in the end well both spend $70 on the most interesting textbook we found . And yo was n't that fun ? ! ! ! ! ! ! But I 'm too considerate to do that . <h> 60 users responded in " Letter to normal people " <p> Jacob , oh , yeah . Now I understand . I hate when people can not detect ( and/or respect ) a difference in values , when its very obvious to me . That compounded with nagging just gets annoying . <p> Why not expose the people in your life to what you find funbookstore or not ? If they like it , then you 're setno more dinners with lame conversation . If they hate it and decide not to hang out with you because you 're no fun , then your setno more dinners and lame conversation . <p> And you 're right , it could be fun for you . ( although I tried this at home recently and , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a serious brouhaha ! ) . <p> You are so entertaining in your extreme-ness . It is possible to have the best of both worlds ! <p> I avoid eating with my co-workers because I cant stand their chat about reality tv , stupid boyfriends , etc . <p> But , I love talking with my friends who are smart and have interesting hobbies , and refreshing philosophies about life . Even if we are n't  having a particularly intellectual discussion , I care about them and want to know what 's going on in their lives . <p> I also can entertain myself for long periods of time without the aid of tv or tabloids , and like to read about subjects most others would consider dry . <p> For me , going out to eat is a waste of money and health since the food is almost never as quality as can be prepared at home , but going to the bar for a drink ( even non-alcoholic ) can be quite stimulating you never know what interesting people you will meet , although your conversation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not everyone falls into the either the " Im stupid and make small talk " or the " Im not and my name is Jacob " categories ; - ) . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I got a dose of this from a " friend " in high school . A different group of guys used to play roller hockey on Friday nights . This friend asked me if I wanted to " go out " ( get drunk ) one Friday night and I said no , I 'm playing hockey tonight . He got upset and said " you know , playing hockey is killing your social life " . <p> Quite the opposite , I gained lifelong friends from those marathon hockey playing nights . And I quickly let this other friend drift away . <p> I am fine talking ( about real subjects , not smalltalk ) with 1 or 2 people but I despise trying to have a conversation within a group , especially in a bar or restaurant where I have to shout my 2 cents . Usually if I find myself in that situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage them . <p> Loved this ! I was invited to join a " sisterhood " at my place of worship . They play games , do crafts , go on field trips , ergh . The first activity was a group bra fitting ! ! ! ! ! <p> One person asked me what I like to do : uh , read , listen to music , go on walks , cook . She looked at me in pity . I am a loser . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Holy cow , I just read through a good portion of that forum thread on living on $1M dollars . It astounds me the lack of imagination and closed mindedness of some of those folks . <p> The guy who ca n't fathom " only " spending $100 a week on entertainment was especially hilarious . Poster boy for the consumerist culture . <p> Britz said , <p> Haha = That was a fine rant , and one that resonates well with me ! That pretty well describes my stance to socialising , except that I 'd mention the terror of it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some point , or just spending a whole evening without knowing what to say , conspicuously . That was at least how I was about five years ago ; since then , Ive gotten a lot better at small talk and easy socialising ( moved from Denmark/UK to Canada/Australia , where it almost impossible not to learn these skills ) , and I do n't  give a f*ck about things as much anymore . Its not something that I 'd volunteer to do , but its a useful set of skills and makes heaps of things easier . <p> Where I disagree with you ( as I must , hehe : ) , is in your assessment of various skills . Like you , I 'm IQ-smarter and more analytical and independent than most , but I would n't say that this is any better by any objective measure than for instance being " girl " -smart , like being good at socializing , empathizing , learning languages , using fine-motor skills , etc . I 'm crap at several things , and I assume that I 'll never be world-champion at anything , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated with stupidity but mostly when people who should know better do n't  . I 'm sure that my wife gets frustrated with my own stupidities ( she does n't  have many herself = <p> All in all , you ( and I ) have a small set of excellent skills , and some of these set us apart from most , but that 's not so abnormal = <p> I could go on about this but will just , as an example among many , refer to a nicely-researched book that describes just a tiny bit of what I 'm talking about better than I could : " The Essential Difference " by Simon Baron-Cohen LONG ... <p> PS : Kids cost a lot of your life and lifestyle , and parents even regret having gotten kids . However , kids are necessary if you want to become a whole and fully-developed human being , and I mean that in a brain-physiological sense , not just waffle ( it could well be that more things are needed too , after kids like that death of parents , say ) . Whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exo-directed child-burdened adulthood is up to you ; there might not be necessarily be any definite advantage either way . My strong feeling , though , is that kids are generally a very good ( possibly long-term ) investment . <p> Wow , That was very well written ! I used to be very introvert but changed as I grew older and , while I can still relate to a lot of this , I would consider myself quite social today . You particularly hit the nail on the part about not learning much from " eating out " and similar social interactions . It IS very shallow and kinda dumb but that 's why I occasionally like this kind of stuff . Its simple , its easy and it gets your mind off whatever you may be pondering on at the moment . 10158 @qwx420158 <p> Bravo !

" <p> More thoughtful : <p> " A man or woman alone will almost certainly go mad within a relatively short time . It may be a benign madness , even an exemplary madness " taking the form of an obsessive writing of romantic poetry , for example " but no form of madness is encouraging to spacecraft insurors . Experience shows that a crew of one man and one woman will experience a crisis within days . Their relative ages do not matter . If the text of their conversation is power , the subtext will be sex . And vice versa . <p> On the other hand , two men alone together or two women alone together , provided their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual subtext and will get down to the nitty-gritty of power every time : who 's in charge here ? . . .

When people hit this blog the first time , odds are they will stick around to read those posts(*) and thus be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blog a day where I was discussing pancakes . <p> LinkWithinLinkWithin is a plugin that shows similar posts to your current post . Most " similar post " plugins compares tags , but if you , like me , are not very good at keeping your tags consistent , the suggested posts wont be very similar . Conversely , LinkWithin is eerily good at picking them out . The probably that someone clicks on a post is substantial . <p> Old Post Promoter The Old Post Promoter promotes old posts ( makes sense , right ? ) by sending them to the front page . This is useful to bring some of the old posts back to life . It seems to be a fact of life that readers do n't  really care to comment on posts which are much older than a few days even if the content is evergreen/timeless . Since I hate repeating myself , why not let a plugin repeat it . This is also a way to recycle posts to new readers from a time when there were fewer readers . This solves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the OPP . My old wish for the OPP is that there would be a limit for 730 days instead of the current 365 days . The plugin is somewhat delicate . I would n't abuse it to repost midly aged stuff . Hence , unless your blog is at least one year old , I would n't use it . I was and am concerned that readers would be turned off by old stuff , but so far I have only heard positive comments . Also , it takes some pressure off from having to come up with new stuff day in and day out . <p> For new bloggers I also recommend installing a stat system like google analytics or sitemeter to see where people are coming from . You should also comment a lot . Old bloggers tend to be swamped in requests , etc. and do n't  have the time ( or energy ) to follow every new blog in town . The way to get their attention is to write posts about their posts . A ping/trackback definitely gets mine . The second best way is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a specific blog per month , readers of that blog will notice you and click through to your blog . If they land of one of your great posts ( that 's why you use the WWSGD plugin ! ! ) , they 're likely to stick around . Do n't  constrain your commenting to one blog or a clique of blogs . Expand your horizons . <p> In general , it holds that the best networking is done by other bloggers who are about " your size " . Unless you 're a rock star , bigger blogs will not gain from collaborating with you , and conversely , you wont gain from collaborating with small blogs . This is simply due to everyone having limited time and a desire to maximize the return on effort seeing that there are more than 500 personal finance blogs out there and you probably not having time to work with all of them . <p> So WWSGD is the plugin you use ? Ive been meaning to ask you about that sometime = <p> The old post promoter is interesting ; I do certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front every now and then . I 'm not sure if I 'd want to actually want to mess with the dates though , nor would I want to do this for every post maybe I need to find a " random posts " plugin , or a theme that would give me a spot to highlight . <p> Thanks for the mention ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kevin Yes WWSGD it is . Note that I used it before Jan/10 . However , I had a useless " welcome to my blog , hope you enjoy it " message to first time visitors rather than the posts I mentioned . Its much better to use it as a sticky landing page . <p> The OPP can exclude certain categories of your choosing . You could make a special category of posts you want to repromote and exclude everything else . I have categories I call Timely and Personal and I exclude those to avoid promoting a post that discusses , say , the recent crash of 2009 . <p> john said , <p> I have a question that comes straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Might Also Like : " suggestions , I clicked on the " What 's in your wallet ? " posting you did back in February 08 . It said you 're legally authorized to drive in any country but the US . So I was wondering , is it DW that drives the RV on the occasions that you guys move it ? <p> I 'm only asking because you usually have creative solutions and I thought your solution to this might be interesting . <p> -John 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @john Yes it is . I hate driving speaking tongue-in-cheek , " I was born to be driven " = 10157 @qwx420157 <p> Re : the OPP ( I keep wanting to expand that acronym as Other Peoples Posts ) , is there a mechanism that you could use to illuminate which comments are old and which are from the most recent posting ? <p> I often find myself trying to figure out whether the latest commentators have something exceptionally reflective to add , above that which had already been added by the original group of commentators . <p> Have you had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certainly , but I deliberately took out the comment date to encourage ongoing discussion . <p> Thanks for the recommendations , as an aspiring blogger and entrepreneur increasing traffic by 50% is a big deal . At the moment I 've started a forum and everything is progressing slowly , its sites like these that inspire me to continue . Thanks Jacob ! <p> Wow , great info . I love to read your blog . You are truly motivating , and I stumbled onto blogging quite recently and will install these plug ins . I have a low number of posts at the moment , and expect to increase quite quickly . <p> Jen said , <p> Really would love Old Post Promoter for my blog . The problem is I use Weebly platform , not WordPress . Does anybody know if there are similar plug ins for Weebly ? 10152 @qwx420152 <p> I would add to this list the Social Share Motivator , a free plugin that urges your visitors to share a post in Facebook , Twitter or Google Plus in order to enjoy unhindered access . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287707 @2287707/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Being poor or unable to get credit 100% of the expenses must be covered with wage income . Schematically the cash flow looks like this <p> Thus you put your time into your work which gives you a wage income that is used to pay for stuff that goes back to you.People with a credit score can go into debt . Today almost anyone can do this . In this case debt can be use to pay for stuff and the wage can be used to pay for debt such as credit cards , car loans , mortgages , student loans , etc . This is the way most people handle their personal finance . Very few people pay cash anymore and financial success depends on being good at handling debt . Many websites will tell you how to do that . You will notice that the debt box has a small leak of money that goes to other people . This is the price you pay for debt . Investors do n't  pay other people to use money . They are the other people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build income generating assets . Investing is mainly about escaping the need for a wage income . Initially though other people will not be paying you enough money to cover all your stuff , so your cash flow will look something like this . <p> What can I say , I love making diagrams . Note that as soon as you have assets , you start getting an additional cash flow . If you want a larger cash flow , you need more assets . Personally I was so bent on accumulating assets that I reduced the amount of stuff I bought so I could save 75% of my wages.Once you have accumulated a sufficient amount of assets , the cash flow cycle will look like this . <p> At this point you will be financially independent . This is the stage I am in . My assets pay all my expenses in the form of dividends and interest . In other words , other people pay for my stuff . As I keep adding to my assets , my asset based income grows larger . Since this income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound exponentially and aid in growing my income.Note that you are only financially independent if your assets can provide you with sufficient cash to cover your " stuff " . It does you no good , if your assets are your house or if they are sitting in a retirement account where they cant provide income . Of course I could retire in which case my cash flow would look like this . <p> Notice the absence of a wage income . It is not needed because there will not be any creditors knocking at the door like a few steps above nor will there be any problem in putting food on the table . <p> And Section 7.1 in the book which contains a much expanded discussion of these diagrams + additional diagrams . Note that amazon let 's you read chapter 1 and a bit of chapter 2 for free in case you 're interested . <h> 46 users responded in " Cash flow diagrams for the poor , the middle class , and the investor class " <p> " Investors do n't pay other people to use money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds of people in this world those who pay interest and those who make interest . <p> ilanbpp said , <p> Can you give please few examples for ASSETS ? great site.thx 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Thanks = Assets that provide an income can include savings accounts , CDs , mutual funds , stocks , bonds , REITs , real estate ( that you do n't  live in ) , oil trusts , royalties , I would generally not include things like art , cars , baseball cards , jewelry , the house I live in , and other doodads unless traded for a living . <p> ilanbpp said , <p> Will those be able to provide you sufficient income ? the interest rates on savings , cds and etc are very low today , index mutual fund not doing well since 1-1-08 , not to mention stocksreit diving as well , RE losing value , rental income not changes . overall , a little scarey , no ? not familiare with oil trusts and royalties , but heard they are pain during tax time . thx for the quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scary loss of principal is a genuine concern , actually a greater concern than market returns , so I have to design my portfolio to reflect that . As long as my stocks do n't  start cutting dividends ( which I seriously doubt they will ) I should be alright . They do provide enough income as long as you have enough of them . Generally one should aim for 25 times annual expenses in assets and then some . The easiest way to achieve this is to cut down expenses and learn to spend money very efficiently . <p> Somewhere here , we need to add that you also need a goal : frugalists can live by ( or close to ) the **26;921;TOOLONG model simply by living cheap . Hobos , do it by abstaining , altogether supplanted by a bit of scrounging , stealing , and/or begging as fits their personality .

This however puts workers into the asset class ( slavery ) and capitalists as slave owners . Your blog name is quite appropo as these ideas are not mainstream but certainly enable readers to see the information in a new way . Mainstream media has nothing new to say and no real insight so they use other tactics ( film at 11 , 10 best blah , etc ) to get eyeballs on the same information in the same format . <p> It has been a great day today reading " The top 10 distinctions between millionaires and the middle class " , and then coming over here to see your simple and effective explanation of cash flow for different types of people .

That is , price of food and gasoline will rise X%/year , investments+dividends will rise Y%/year , and perhaps X = ( 1.2 ) xY , for example . It depends on what you invest in , of course . I think it would be prudent to invest in some inflation-protected assets , esp those linked to commodities as opposed to real estate . TIPS might be ok . Gold and silver wo n't pay dividends but could be slowly sold , an ounce a year or something . Food inflation especially worries me . Food is historically cheap right now . What happens if it doubles or quadruples in price ? ( Due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / peak water / bad weather , etc ) <p> so I saved my money instead . At some point I realized that I could invest my savings and use the cash flow to cover my living expenses . It seemed like a fairly robust method : Work at an average paying job <p> JL said , <p> The PWTB in this country figured this out a long time ago , and thus have pushed consumerism onto the general public . <p> But even that is n't enough to prevent smarter , young individuals from entering this plan . <p> So the government in tandem with higher education and the student loan cartel conspired to put an entire generation into debt . <p> They have succeeded . It is extremely difficult to become financially independent when one has student loan debt taking a hefty chunk out of your wages . The government further went on to make student loans non-dischargeable in bankruptcy . <p> You can eliminate stuff to the bare minimum and still not make progress until your 30s or 40s if your debt load is high . The jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was all designed intentionally . The tax system is in place also to further punish those that want to escape the wage cycle . <p> Hence why I suggest people avoid paying for higher education or make sure the debt is very low . This means skipping graduate school , especially law school , but to a lesser extent medical school . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @JL I pretty much agree . I think consumerism and the " buy all the house you can " mentality is a contributing factor . After all , even if someone stepped in and got up to their neck in student loans , the loans can still be paid off if a nonconsumer lifestyle is adopted . Admittedly , though , its pretty much a lost ( semi ) decade and if the major is chosen unwisely , there 's really no increased earnings potential . <p> What I like about these flow diagrams is the elimination of interst payments . In Canada , the banking system is an oligopoly . This may give it the financial strength to survive fianncial crises , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> jc said , <p> this remains my favorite entry on this blog . The diagrams pretty much tell you all you need to know . <p> deegee said , <p> I like your diagrams , too . <p> But I would have added one which is a hybrid of the second and third diagrams because it is possible for someone to have debt yet have investments at the same time , just not enough of them to cover ones expenses . This was my situation for about 9 years until I became debt-free but was still working . <p> Of course , my favorite diagram is the last one which I have been for the last 2 years . <p> Loved this post and loved the diagrams , I love charts and diagrams myself , it is an easy way to gage how your doing or explain points in simple terms where as a homeschooling parent I use things like these simple diagrams to teach my kids about financial management .

I cant wait until my assets are large enough to cover my expenses . Right now I 'm still paying off my student loans from college . I wish I could go back and tell my 18 year old self to not take those on ! As soon as those are done , the 50-75% saving of income begins . Ca n't wait ! <p> I think I 've read this post about 10 times ! I love the diagrams which made me think about money and everything I spend on it . I found this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of credit card debt . 12 months later Ive now paid a significant portion of my debt , increased my savings and am always looking for ways to lower expenses and increase income . This is a great blog and thanks for sharing everything . <p> The retirement cash flow diagram reminds me of Thomas Pickettys new book , Capitalism in the 21st Century , where he argues that the people with this kind of cash flow are going to continue to grow wealthier as time goes on because wage-related economic growth will be slower than asset-related capital growth . Get your assets now ! <p> This is much needed retirement advice that is definitely hard to come across . Anyone can achieve an early retirement if they simply get out of debt , stay out of debt , and focus on acquiring cash flow producing assets . Unfortunately , all we ever hear is that you must work for 40 years and dump money into a 401k until were 59.5 years old . Great post ! 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287709 @2287709/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I have used the same pair of boots almost every day since my early 20s . Ill be 35 in a few months . Like with most " extreme " stats , a pair of boots which are 13+ years old blow the normal expectation values out of the water ; much like being able to retire in five years or having more than 2 page views per blog visit = <p> I do n't  know how many reheelings ( resoling the heel only ) I have had done on them . I lost count around 8 . I know the full sole has been replaced once because I found an excellent cobbler in the city I live in . Vibram Skywalk . Do n't  get anything less . <p> The boots are Hanwags Grunten . They come in mens and womens . If you live in Europe , you are in luck . You can get them over most of Europe . I paid 1299 kroner for mine when I bought them in the mid-late 1990s . Today they cost 1799 kroner . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIPS ! Better than the stock market , it seems depending on which month you ask = <p> I am seriously considering buying another 2 pairs . That should cover me for life . Hanwag sells these boots as the only pair of hiking boots you 'll ever need . I figure that since I use them every day , I 'll probably need more than one pair during my lifetime , but otherwise , pretty close . <p> I have taken these to many places . From the top of Mt . Fuji to Nevadas desert to the train stations of Europe . They are light enough to hike in but tough enough for light rock " climbing " . Right in the sweet spot in terms of walking . I only wish theyd make them in black . This would make it possible to " pass " for dress shoes in a ( very ) tight spot . It would also make it easier to find shoe polish in the right color . Matching the current color is near impossible ! <p> I have also lost track of how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that . Normally a pair of running shoes would be expected to last 1000 km . Modern hiking boots are good for about 1500 km before the liner will begin to crack . These have gone at least 10,000 km . <p> They are double stitched full grain leather boots with a Norwegian welt . This means that if get a good coat of shoe polish and leather fat on them , they are as waterproof as modern boots with a tex-liner . The sole is actually sewn on so in theory , the entire sole could be replaced . Furthermore , unlike glued soles or modern boots , where the upper are a stitched mish-mash of nubuck and nylon , good boots have few seams , where water can get in , when the work apart . <p> Actually , a few years ago I had used them so much that I had worn down some of the liner at the heel . No problem , I had a cobbler stitch some leather on which rescued them from an early gravehey , they were only about 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have been keeping my eye on Hanwag . Around the turn of the millennium it looked like they were scaling back on the Norwegian welts . However , it seems to have made somewhat of a comeback . <p> I do n't  think you can get Hanwag in the US . However , you can get a pair which look equivalent : Merrell Wilderness . They cost somewhere north of $250 but they 're probably worth it . They also solve the color problem . Given a choice , I 'd still take the Hanwags given their slightly more versatile usage . The Merrells accept crampons which should mean they are slightly stiffer . The Hanwags do not . If anyone owns some Merrells I 'd like to hear your take on how they are on asphalt . Were thinking of getting some for DW . <p> A note on buying boots : Sizing boots is slightly different than sizing shoes . What you should do is to wear your hiking socks . I vastly prefer the two sock system over the technical brouhaha that has become popular over the past 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat transporting sock . The outer sock is an absorbing wool sock with no seams . Now , get your socks ( or sock ) on and lace the boot halfway up . Push the foot forward in the boot . Now you should be able to shove an index finger down behind your heel and the heel of the boot . It should fit snugly without wiggle-room . If you cant get a finger in , the boot is too small and you 'll get blisters on your toes . If you can wiggle , its too large and youll get blisters on your heel.The reason is that when you walk far , your foot flattens/swell , etc. and you want to leave room for that . The socks will swell too . <h> 39 users responded in " The last pair of boots I 'll ever buy " <p> How much would you say you typically spend in a year keeping these boots in good repair ?

Here are some thoughts . I hiked the full Appalachian Trail quite a number of years back with a pair of Danner Mountain Lights http : //www.danner.com . They needed to be resoled during the trip but were an awesome pair of boots . A fellow hiker had a custom pair of Peter Limmer boots rock solid and very well made http : //www.limmerboot.com/ and another fellow hiker had the Merrell Wilderness which was also a rock solid boot , but it too needed to be resoled during the trip if I remember . I would buy any of these again and agree that if you take good care of these boots you could use them for many , many years . <p> S said , <p> My husband does the same thing , but he prefers black military boots . His current pair is 12 years old . He s never replaced the sole ( its almost smooth now ) , but has gone through a few shoe laces . Sadly , the brand has been discontinued . He wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass decently as dress shoes . He even wore them with his tuxedo at our wedding !

Though you do point out a trend that I notice , they tend to break at the seams , and there usually are a bunch of them to create interesting patterns across the shoe .

I can think of a lot of instances where a good hiking boot would be preferable to a running shoe . <p> That being said , I think that you are low-balling how durable running shoes are . For me the only shoe that I wear when running is the adidas response trail . Typically on a pair of shoes I average about 2500 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in my running log book ) . Then when I retire them from running I typically wear them around for another year or so and end up with about 4000 miles per pair of shoes . That is 4000 miles of foot travel for an $80 pair of shoes . <p> Now I do n't  go hiking up mountains or through woods with them but for the type of foot travel that most people do on a daily basis I would expect them to get at least this much out of them ( since they are not straining them with running for the first 3k miles ) . <p> Britz said , <p> Great boots ; I wore a similar pair for years as a student , though I did n't  treat mine well and they died much sooner than they should have . Here in Sydney , I wear thongs ( flip-flops ) I found a cheap brand ( $15-20 ) that wear out after 1-2 years but which is super-comfortable and which I use for everyday use , walking longish distances , bush-walking , and running ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite tough and bouncy ) . Unfortunately , it looks as if these thongs are not being sold anymore ; I had plans to buy 10-20 pairs , to last me decades <p> NiceDrum said , <p> I have a pair of Limmers that are similar , but I find to be less than optimal . They are too stiff ( they are meant for climbing over New Hampshire boulders , which I do n't  do ) , and there is not enough vertical room in the boot to add cushioning . They are also hard to run or climb stairs fast in not flexible enough . I may look into these Gruntens and perhaps sell the Limmers on eBay ( not too much of a loss ) . Any word on how flexible they are ? The website touts them as a " Suprisingly light and flexible double stitched boot " . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @NiceDrum I would n't mind terribly much having to run a 5k in the Gruntens . They 're not stiff enough to accept crampons . I think the Limmers are . <p> I did some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell to these to the US . HanWag also makes some boots for the military that are sold through military surplus shops , but not necessarily the Gr++nten model . <p> If leather boots ever develop a funk , soak em in lysol . Seriously . Scrub it out with a mild soap , let it dry , lysol , let it dry , bam like new . I was afraid of it drying out the leather but it did n't  on my Corcoran jump boots . <p> MaxS said , <p> If you are still looking for shoes , french Paraboot are resoleable and made of high standard .

If you prefer a good pair of walking or dress shoes I recommend Mephisto . I purchased a pair of Mephisto walking shoes in 95 , wore them on 3 continents working , hiking , etc and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theyll probably last another decade or more as " beaters " .

( At least on the German hanwag.de site ) Just wanted to let you know = Also , quick question : did the stitched-on leather not result in any blisters ? I have a different pair of Hanwag and also ran down the liner but was afraid of creating a blister spot and looking for different solutions ( not really finding any , though ) . Anyway . Thanks for your blog , its a lot of fun and enlightening ! <p> I clicked the link &amp; they have a black pair on their website , so you may be able to get away with one pair going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ordered another pair . Although spending that much money was painful , they should last me until I 'm 60 or so . The other ones are still going strong except the lining is beginning to break down after 17 years of almost every day service . <p> e*marine said , <p> Honestly , I have had my Bates USMC ( cold weather ) boot for closing on 10 years . I think they were around $85 when I picked them up in 2005 and I have worn them near daily since . This includes rain , snow , 6+ months in the afghanistan desert , and they have held up fairly well with no maintenance . Only problem I am running into now is that the sole is almost worn down to the boot and is getting near to the end and I do n't  believe they are resoleable . <p> Anne said , <p> Hi there , I 'm a new-ish reader to this blog , which I like very much .

Pretty much every single post you write , there is some crucial bit of information that you write about , and which I can not figure out , because you think you are writing in English , but unfortunately , the idiom is just not on your side ! In this post , for example , the very last clause , " when the work apart " makes no sense : <p> " The sole is actually sewn on so in theory , the entire sole could be replaced . Furthermore , unlike glued soles or modern boots , where the upper are a stitched mish-mash of nubuck and nylon , good boots have few seams , where water can get in , *when the work apart* . <p> I have no idea what you are talking about , and I have spent many an hour listening to non-native speakers and figuring things out just fine . This happens at least once per post of yours . I like your ideas , I enjoy your blog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that blog posts are not serious articles , nor are they published books , but if you are looking to gain a large audience , you might want to find a literary nerd to check your idioms .

It needs to be " simple " , that is , not require a $500 welding machine to fix what is probably a $50 frame . Solder and blowtorch ? <p> As you can see from the fuzzy picture , the thin wire has broken off of the frame . There are at least 10 such instances . <p> Jacob comments : I 'm " fixing " it for the Dojo . This may either mean getting a new used frame , which I know I can do for $20 ( although that would be a resource waste ) or fixing it for less in terms of material or service costs . I do not mind ending up with some welding equipment ( only I ca n't afford $500 right nowwell , technically I can , but you know ) as long as the material costs are less than $20welding is number 3 on my list . <h> 22 users responded in " Fixing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weld .

Maybe you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> Allow me to " go meta " on you here : why would you ( or anyone ) possibly need a futon frame , and thus need to fix it ?

Replied too fast. ) 10149 @qwx420149 <p> Not sure what exactly is wrong , but you could try clamps , screws , metal straps , etc . Welding might be your only solution , depending on the damage , but maybe not . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> Why do n't  you post a photo of the problem and maybe we can give a better idea of the solution ? 10156 @qwx420156 <p> If the break is mid-pipe , buy a slightly larger pipe and slide both sides in , then drill a hole through both sides and secure with a screw/bolt . May not look " pretty " but its a metal futon after all . <p> ddan7 said , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JB Weld does n't  have any load bearing stregnth . <p> Heres what I 'd do if you do n't  have a welder , still assuming a round or square tubing frame : <p> 1 . If you have a break at a joint , I would buy two L-Brackets at the hardware store , drill holes through the frame and use bolts to connect the L-Brackets <p> 2 . If you have a break along tubing , say it kinked along a straight run , I would find a slightly larger piece of tubing and slide it over the kink/break . This could be found cheap at a welding shop and possibly free for the asking . <p> jakio said , <p> Ill second the JB weld comment . There are stories from the Automotive world about people using this stuff to fix cracks in engine blocks , so as long as the metal is prepped thoroughly I 'd bet JB weld will suffice . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Do not use JB Weld for holding a frame together . <p> JB Weld is great for filling cracks , but its not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifold and " glued " the halves back together with JB Weld .

I would use two 1+2s ( even though they will be much wider than the bar because theu will support weight better ) . Then take a threaded rod and some nuts , drill four holes ( two on each side of the break ) all the way through the board/metal/board sandwhich and then hacksaw off the correct amount of threaded rod and bolt it all together . <p> for a break mid tube , insert a round piece of wood that fits snugly ( maybe a piece of broomstick ) midway to each side of the break .

Like these hooks : <p> If you could get the materials freecycle , it would be cost effective . If not , by all means , just ask a welding shop to do you a favor . Community college auto shops might do it for free . <p> ron said , <p> I first thought JB weld , but even if you use a regular welder i think the problem well return.So i say lay it on the floor . <p> Glenn said , <p> The solution that seems to make the most sense is to weld the breaks back together . You do n't  have to spend $500 on a welder . I got a pretty decent setup for about $200 , including the safety equipment . I have only used a MIG welder , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of welder to use . You should be able to get the hang of it after a couple hours of practice . <p> Have a welding shop remove those wires and replace them with several lengths of steel that is stronger . <p> It wont be as pretty but will be more structurally sound . <p> Probably cost $50 . <p> I would not suggest borrowing a welder just to do the job . Learning to weld is a whole other thing , and to be safe you need to be sure that you ventilate the work away from you so you do n't  breath in all kinds of nasty stuff ( gases ) created during the welding process . <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> Another possibility is to use Mapp gas and a non-welding kit requiring welding fluxed rod that works at Mapp gas temperature . You just heat it up with a torch and it welds the stuff together . They exist . I do n't  have the link handy but you can find them on the web . <p> Steve in W MA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider angle photo so we could see what those wires actually do/are on the frame . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> The little wires are attached to the frame in a square grid and support the futon . The little wires are not attached to each other , just the big wire/frame. 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Looking at your picture , it would seem that if multiple wires have broken , then they were not sufficient for the load . <p> If I understand the layout , it would seem that a piece of 1/2 ? plywood ( with holes for lightness ) would be the appropriate repair if you 're not going to weld them back together . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287713 @2287713/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I read once in Luxury Fever that its quite possible to get used to eating the same meal three times a day , day in and day out . As long as a diet is well-balanced , there 's no harm in repetition . I bet the reason that people are told to eat a varied diet is similar to the reasons behind index fund investing : If you 're clueless , eating a random selection which eventually averages out to whatever everybody else is eating is the most generic recommendation that 's likely not to harm you more than the average . <p> Can you say corn syrup ? <p> The cheapest " base food " I can think of is rice pilaf . Here are the ingredients : <p> Lots of onions , sliced and sauteed . <p> Lentils . <p> Rice . <p> 1.5 times a much water by volume as the lentils + rice volume . <p> You can make this in a pressure cooker by first sauteing the onions , then adding the lentils , rice , and water , and putting the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow cooker . Here you need an extra pan to saute the onions . <p> Fun fact : I do n't  recall using the word " saute " in a sentence ever before . <p> To complete the nutritional balance , add fruit and vegetables as side dishes . If you go with this cooking will be very fast and your grocery budget will be almost solely composed of the cost of fruit and vegetables . Rice , onions(*) , and lentils are ridiculously cheap . <p> ( * ) Onions store very well in a cool place like a cellar . <p> You may think this sounds like a boring diet but truth to be told , are you currently excited about what you 're going to eat for your next meal , even if you 're going out ? I bet notIm sure there will be couple of dissenters in the comments though . The psychological benefits of this diet is that eating something different when you go out or visit others will be fun ( again ) whereas the pilaf will be a comfortable baseline which is otherwise given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " Pilaf : To really slash your grocery budget " <p> I eat almost the exact same thing every day , and after a couple years , still savor every bight . It is my belief that the desire for variety in the diet is the bodys way of saying , " hey , you 're not giving us what we need down here , so mix it up ! " <p> Actually I think this dish is called a " khichdi " .. lots of Indians eat this as an almost staple . <p> To be even more frugal , you coudl add 2x the amount of water ( just put the cooker off after the first whistle and let it cool down before taking the lid off ) .. but sometimes the consistency can become like oatmeal . <p> Long grain Basmati rice if made in a microwave rice cooker can absorb upto 3x volume of water .. but for ERE I am guessing we are n't  eating Basmati = <p> Unfortunately , thanks to Diabetes in the family and the tendency to gain weight I get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another idea is to make your own yogurt bring a gallon of milk well short of a boil , let cool some and add yogurt with Live Cultures ( first time you might have to buy .. Fage , Pavel etc .. just make sure has live cultures ) .. will go well with the rice dish . <p> 10YearsBefore said , <p> Love your site , unfortunately I do n't  have enough time to read as fast as you are writing Your cooking tips are top on my list for the moment . Theyre about to save me a lot of money . The past week Ive eaten your lentil soup the whole week , saved me a lot of work as well . Not boring at all . A lot of variations are possible ( cheese , fresh vegetables , pastas , bacon , all go very well with it ) . Ill certainly try your rice/onion/lentil dish next week .

Volatility or uncertainty ? I 'm sure I have more volatility that the benchmarks .

Just two more staples . <p> I always thought pilaf was rice with broken up pieces of vermicelli or angel hair pasta . I make this and just call it lentils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cumin . Its so yummy . Rice is great . Its cheap and I do n't  think it causes any problems or allergic reactions like other grains can . I 'm currently living in a motel for a temporary job , and I 'm thinking of purchasing a rice cooker , so that I can have something resembling a decent meal . <p> Also , to add to what you said about eating the same thing . That 's a technique for weight loss as well . If you only eat one or two things at a meal , you eat less , but when you have several tastes , it encourages over eating . <p> Britz said , <p> When I 'm on my own , then I eating the same set of things , keeping it simple , healthy and cheap , just like you advocate here . However , I think one actually needs a fair bit of variation in ones diet if one is wants it to be properly healthy ; unless you use a very large number of ingredients , then eating the same thing the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of biochemicals and even more complexes of these that our bodies thrive off ; its not just about ticking off the daily dose of vitamins , minerals , protein , and so on , although you certainly do need these , and need them in un-decayed complexes ( which is why vitamine pills on average are fairly useless and why thoroughly-processed food is not as nearly as useful as less-processed food for our body ) . If you just stick to one reasonably varied and balanced thing to eat , then your diet is almost certainly more healthy than that of the average citizen , but you could still improve things by varying the meals or by using huge loads of varied ingredients in that single type of meal . <p> dmitryvm said , <p> Ill side with Britz I 'm also in favor of varying meals , eating the same thing all the time does not work for me and likely wo n't work for many . <p> I do not advocate extravagant options , but what 's wrong with using other grains ( besides rice ) , other beans/legumes , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10150 @qwx420150 <p> People , give the idea of eating the same thing repeatedly a chance ! I 'm the kind of guy who refuses to eat the same thing twice in a row . Yet I 've had the same thing for dinner for the last 2+ months , and during that time I 've grown hooked instead of tired . I find it so delicioius I could eat it for the rest of my life . <p> Basically its cooked white rice sprinkled with olive oil ( extra virgin , for flavour ) and a few canned red kidney beans . Add a salad and some meat/fish on the side . ( Ive been trying to cook the beans from scratch , but I have n't figured out yet how to reproduce their exact taste , which is a must for this dish ) . 10150 @qwx420150 <p> Addition : I also agree with Britz that we need variation . Jacob , whether you like it or not , we know very little about nutrition . A century ago scientists also thought they had nutrition all figured out , in hindsight not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not eating wheat/corn a thousand times a day in different flavours and products ( like most of us do ) . Variation is alternatives to wheat : rye , rice , potatoes , quinoa , all sorts of vegetables , various animal products , <p> Dave said , <p> I eat the same thing everyday I bought a cow and filled up my freezer , pretty good stuff ! <p> This would be ok if I lived on my own , however I 'm not sure my family would be too happy . <p> I 'm trying to reduce the cost of meals I do make by bulking out with beans , lentils etc . <p> Ruth said , <p> One of my staples now is kale pesto . Its a great way to eat kale , which is super nutritional , and it freezes well too . I eat vegan so I make it with raw kale , olive oil , nutritional yeast , nuts , garlic , and salt and pepper . A little can make any meal more tasty and good for you . I do this with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , <p> We found out last year that my son has allergies ( technically sensitivities ) to wheat , eggs , dairy , and beef . Simplicity and frugality has dictated a shift in our entire familys diet towards staples such as the recipe you describe as pilaf . I have to say it has been a very difficult transition , and one I would n't have chosen . I have felt hungry for most of this year and only for the past few months have I felt like I 'm getting enough to eat . ( to complete the picture a little , I work on an organic vegetable farm , so we have all the vegetables we need . We also eat chicken every 10 days or so ) . It seems like it has taken us a full year to begin to adjust . That said , I agree with your conclusions about health and money . Now that I 'm used to it I do enjoy a simple diet and I do feel better than before ( at which time we ate a much wider variety ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change are real , the cost is not simply overcoming boredom . It is actually a shift in what is , for most people , the most deeply-rooted and part of life . This is one of the reasons weight-loss diets fail so often . I see a change like this as one of the " advanced-level " life changes . Change a few other things first for practice , and then take on a beast like diet . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Certainly a different plan than the meat &amp; potatoes we are brought up eating . Ill have to try this one a couple nights a week and see how the family likes it . We are always looking for ways to cut down cooking time so we have more playtime . <p> Yesterday I cooked my first Pilaf . Its easy to cook ( for a whole week in one go ! ) , dirt cheap , is OK to eat and digests well . My body is happy with it , and anything you eat aside tastes twice as good . Super ! <p> A Washingtonian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished his health numbers were better than before . And it does seem that many foods actually provide all the protein , fat and carbohydrates , along with the viatamins and minerals necessary . Such as potatoes .

Also proven that indexing beats over time most money managers . <p> Nice recipe ! We always spend a lot of money on dishes that taste crap . Well give this a try and see how it goes . Would be nice to slash the grocery bill . Thanks for sharing <p> CT said , <p> I think some people have skimmed over the fact that Jacob says to pair the pilaf with different fruit &amp; vegetable sides to insure a balanced diet . I can eat beans &amp; rice everyday , I grow my own vegetables and the different seasons automatically give me a varied diet . Growing up we were poor and my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soup and that 's what we ate all week . To this day I love any kind of soup . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

Follow them on Twitter at @GoBankingRates and on Facebook at /GoBRates . <p> The average consumer is familiar with savings accounts . They safely store your money until you need it . If you 're lucky , they even offer a little interest on deposits . However , for those looking to retire early , savings account interest rates are just not going to cut it . <p> Sometimes , you have to be a little more resourceful if you really want to make your money work for you . The following are a few investment ideas you may never have considered , ranging from the lesser-known to truly unique . <p> Certificates of Deposit The key to earning high interest rates on savings is to deposit your funds and not touch them for a while . Banks reward customers who commit to longer-term investment periods with attractive annual percentage yields . <p> A CD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Terms can vary from a few months to several years and the longer you choose , the higher the rate . There is virtually no risk involved and the only downside is you cant make any withdrawals until the account matures , or else face early withdrawal penalties . <p> Savvy investors can address this issue by employing a strategy known as " laddering " to maintain a level of liquidity in their portfolio while taking advantage of the high rates associated with longer-term CDs . <p> Gold The great thing about gold as an investment is that the world supply is limited and therefore , it holds value . Gold prices tend to rise when the value of the dollar drops . So , considering economic conditions as of present , adding gold to your portfolio can be especially lucrative . <p> If you want more tangible assurance of your investment , it is possible to buy actual , physical gold bars or any of the popular bullion coins from a reputable seller and stockpile them away somewhere . <p> The easier and safer way to invest is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds that invest in gold mining companies . Keep in mind , gold funds help you avoid the markup associated with buying gold but are also subject to special tax rules . <p> Trees Yes , trees . The larger they grow , the more valuable they become . <p> You probably had no idea that investment opportunities exist in trees , but timber and hardwood investments actually offer a high return while eliminating the unpredictability of todays markets . In fact , investments in trees have continuously outperformed the stock market over time . <p> Granted , trees are a long-term investment . The upside is there will always be a demand for wood , especially when you consider that the current rate of tropical deforestation means that our rain forests will eventually disappear . The economic and ecological need for , and corresponding price , of trees is rising and making buying and planting them increasingly profitable . <p> BE AWARE OF INVESTING IN TREES . Before anyone invests in trees , please read the history of Great Southern Group collapse ( only in 2009 ) and Timbercorp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia-s largest agricultural business collapses . <p> Several billion dollars has been lost in tree investments by more than 40 000 investors in Australia . <p> Know the risks . I didn-t invest in trees , but have been affected by the bombardment of news in Australia related to the billions of dollars lost in forestry . <p> Macs said , <p> Hmmm , I find the section on gold a little bullish . Do n't  get me wrong , I am bit of a goldbug , I admit it , but I see it as insurance not investment . Sure it holds value and its an excellent form of emergency fund to lay up against all sorts of emergencies ( such as fiat collapse = ) , but its not an income generator either . <p> In Canada , CDs are now GICs ( Guaranteed Investment Certificates ) for up to five year terms . They can be used as security for a line of credit ( if you 're lucky the interest you earn is higher than the interest you have to pay on the line of credit ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure the gold thing out , I really do n't  get it . What would you really do in a case of " fiat collapse " ? Who buys your gold , and what do they buy it with , and why would they buy it ? Also , are n't  profits on gold investing typically taxed as income ? Lastly , how much do you typically pay in transaction , storage , and insurance costs ? 10156 @qwx420156 <p> No offense , but they 're going to have to write better posts than this to get people to click over . <p> Trees ? I should be rich someday I have 17 in my backyard alone ! Maybe I should look into selling the thousands of acorns that fall from my mighty oak every year ! <p> Seth Miller said , <p> A friend of mine planted black walnuts as part of his retirement portfolio on family land . I thought he was a little crazy until reading this . <p> It wouldve been nice if the writer of this piece had provided some definitive info and research on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of just writing buy CDs.buy gold.buy trees . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> Ha ! We planted walnut instead of pecan because it has better wood . So long as the walnut lives , we get nuts . When it dies ( or limbs fall off ) , then we get wood . <p> We also have a peach tree , and I think its going to pay dividends ( peaches ) this year . The peaches are already bigger than golf balls . <p> Josh said , <p> I would be interested in hearing more about what type(s) of trees provide the best return , and even a few different methods ( timber , fruit , nuts , etc ) . <p> I know black walnut is supposed to have some of the best resale value ( for timber ) but they also take forever to grow , and can make your soil to acidic if you ever want to replace with other plants . Would faster growing trees that might not be worth as much , but can be grown and resold multiple times over the life of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit orchard that provides annual income be better ? Lots of options , and something I think I would thoroughly enjoy . <p> alex said , <p> CDs ( even long run CDs ) have horrendous interest rates that do n't  cover the likely rate of inflation . <p> Gold is near all-time highs and has exactly one place to go : down . Historically , gold has not been a good long term investment . <p> Wood : I have no idea about , but given that its the third option after two awful ones , I would be skeptical. 10152 @qwx420152 <p> CDs are for protecting near-term capital . <p> I 'm with Alex on gold . <p> Trees are an investment for the young unless you 're trying to leave a legacy . Walnut trees take 50 years to grow to harvestable size , though an annual nut crop provides some cash flow ( it will be about 50% smaller harvest than if the trees were managed for nut production rather than timber ) . Fast growing hybrid poplar trees are popular in Oregon &amp; Washington , only 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve a decent return . Personally , like Jacob , I go with RYN as an entry-level tree investment . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Danger of trees as an investment is that they burn . You can easily lose the entire investment in a fire ! <p> Robert Muir said , <p> @RMom +1 <p> I 'm also agreeing with alex , this is about as general and vanilla a blog post as you can get . CDs , especially currently , have very limited applications ; Gold , while also having very limited applications , is currently in a bubble ; and " wood " is the wild card . Perhaps the author is planning on three follow-up articles on each of these ? If so , they should have mentioned that in the post . <p> A quick look at the two Jacob mentioned , RYN and PCL , shows a couple of pretty decent income stocks . Both are paying well north of 4% annually and definitely worth considering adding to my income stock percentage . I obviously have a lot to learn about REITs and income stocks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any commodity should be considered for inclusion in an income portion of a portfolio . <p> ghandy said , <p> For what its worth I 'd much rather see the google ads you tried a while ago than read posts like this . <p> On the topic of trees , I recall reading that David Swensen included standing timber as part of Yales asset allocation . <p> Maus said , <p> Gold is awful for ERE . Whether you hold it as bullion or through at ETF , gains are taxed as the sale of a collectible at 28% . <p> Make sure that any timber company you invest in has an approved timber harvesting plan because the days of clear cutting are over . You do n't  want to be exposed to the risk that a fully mature timber stand is the subject of environmental litigation to prevent or delay its harvest . This is not a risk-free investment . <p> Jacob , I 'd be wary of this Go Banking Rates outfit . Their first foray has not been impressive . <p> In the ( admittedly extreme but not unthinkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *selling* my gold , I 'd be *buying* with it those things that fiat no longer could buy , ie I would be reverting to historical usage of gold as a medium of exchange . For all the various crises we 've had throughout history , there 's never been one yet where gold did n't  maintain that role . <p> Regarding the tax issue , I should point out Im in the UK and our tax regime is different to the USA ( I realise I 'm making an assumption that 's where you are , apologies if I 'm wrong ) . Also , reference to my first post should tell you I have no intention to trade in gold except in extreme circumstances it is backstop insurance , and not an investment . <p> If its needed in an emergency that is personal and not systemic then I can cash in within 24 hours for cash . I hold in a form not subject to capital gains tax , and not enough of it to trigger CGT anyway ( but there 's a regulatory risk as tax laws and thresholds may change , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to about 1% over spot , storage costs are nil , and insurance is rolled into policies I would have anyway , so nil marginal cost there , too . I would n't touch an ETF with a bargepole , because they do not fulfill the function I require of gold . <p> ( For clarity , you can read gold as also including silver , in case you are thinking But what about low-denomination use ? ) <p> What about privilege shares ? Does it fit along side Certificate of Deposits ? Some privilege shares from banks guarantee the value of the share at the end of the term with a decent rate of return . <p> Note that if you have a relationship at a bank , there are often people who want to get the money from their Certificate of Deposits and you could buy it from them and retain a higher rate without the time . <p> Cheers . <p> CindyT said , <p> wow , are u serious ? Trees ? 10151 @qwx420151 <p> I agree that these are not actually three unusual investments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual , plus they 're not even as cool as they used to be now that higher-interest online savings accounts and rewards checking accounts exist . * Gold may or may not be an " investment , " but investing in it NOW seems quite unlikely to help you retire early . * And can you really start harvesting lumber after , say , 5 years ? <p> So what ARE some unusual investment options that could help you retire early ? * skills cooking , mending , repair , food growing , etc. * tools again , to help you do things easily instead of hiring out * a trailer as Jacob is demonstrating * DRiPs ? ( Well , they 're more unusual than CDs anyway. ) * remodeling fix up your house to suit your needs instead of moving up <p> What about taxes ? CDs are taxed as ordinary income tax ( your highest tax bracket ) between that and inflation the real return for CDs is usually minimal if even positive . It will usually be negative if you are in a high tax bracket . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your almost 2 months late for April fools . <p> Joe said , <p> I also thought this post was a joke , sorry <p> This is WAY below the usual quality of posts for this site I 'm confused ? <p> Gold is n't an income producing asset , but at least governments cant PRINT it ! <p> Ill take silver over gold for a store of value and to encumber governments feckless printing presses . The key with silver is that its in high use whether you 're in a good economic climate , or poor economic climate . You can sell silver to some businesses ( during good times ) for a decent profit , or individuals ( during bad times ) for a stout cut . <p> Otherwise , I will concede that trees were a VERY unusual investment choice . I 've never once thought of that . <p> Two other investment choices my dad has : thirty chickens , two cows , and a few goats . He has free milk , eggs , and on occasion , some goat meat . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government confiscation of gold in a collapse scenario . History shows this can happen , and I think there is an executive order ( among many others that screw us ) on that . There is no guarantee from the gubbermint that they would pay you par value even if they bought it up rather than confiscated it . If I were doing hard planning for retirement and had not already retired , I would take a hard look at all executive orders since 9/11 . Even going back to Clinton , I would look at those as well . There are E Os that allow the President to invoke many things such as : <p> Confiscate precious metals . " " all public transportation . " " Homes and Land . Take over : All MSM ( mainstream media ) " " All food distribution . I could go on , but it would be better would you check these on your own . <p> SHTF scenario and all currency is worthless . <p> Robert Muir said , <p> Acronym def : SHTF = Sh*t hits the fan <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in some hypothetical future hyper-inflation event , I would research what actually happened in historical hyper-inflation circumstances . <p> I am the writer of the article and just wanted to mention that it was meant to be a fun piece that would generate a lot of interesting comments and investment experiences ( and it has thanks to comments from readers like Bob , Macs , DLM , Mo and Kevin ! ) . I never meant to do a complete analysis of each investment , hence why no comprehensive data . <p> This site has a wonderful community of readers with a lot of financial expertise , and I look forward to asking questions and learning more from everyone here . <p> @Alex My bias for gold showed through a little did n't  it ? I just have my arguments for why it would be good to have in your portfolio especially with the events surrounding our dollar . <p> @Kevin I absolutely appreciate the criticism and will try harder to research and put together a more thoughtful article next time . Again , I only meant to generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone for the constructive feedback and to Jacob for giving us the opportunity to guest post on his blog . <p> P.S. In case anyone is curious about where I got the idea about investing in trees , you can find more information here : <p> I like the idea of having trees on your own lawn that literally provide you with nuts and fruit . But yes , the problem is how long they take to grow <p> I would n't advise CDs or GICs yet interest rates are too low . Buy gold in the interim until rates get back to something respectable like 4% at least . ( we all know inflation is already implicitly at that amount anyway just wait until it officially gets out of the bag ! ) . <p> Trees ? I 'm pretty interested about that . How do you invest in trees ? How have they performed better than the stock market ? Any numbers or graphs ? = <p> I greatly appreciate the linkbacks , btw ! <p> Robert Muir said , <p> Kevin , my understanding is that you 're no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing in gold if you bought stock in a gold mine . If you invest in a company that harvests timber , then you reap the dividends from the income of the company . <p> Of course , as with any individual stock purchases , there are great risks . The lumber on the land the company owns or leases could burn up or it could end up being sub-grade , the company could violate regulations and be sued into the ground , and sector-wide , changes in government regulations ( NAFTA anyone ? ) could screw up the supply curve . <p> Forty2 said , <p> Take it from an ex-gold bug , gold is a horrible investment . It pays no interest , no dividends , and is only a " store of value " because touts/spruikers say it is . Tell me , was the gold you bought at the early 80s peak a store of value at its bottom ? Did n't  think so . This story has been written before . <p> You cant eat it , plant it , grow it . It sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit on gold a few years ago and sold too early , but anyone buying it now is a sucker especially when urged by professional hysterics/morons like Glenn Beck . Anyone who buys gold from a TV advertiser is an idiot . Never buy fancy coins ; if you do n't  want bars buy sad old Krugerrands that nobody wants . They have the smallest bid/ask spread and distance from spot of coins . Only buy certified bars from the 3-4 big producers . If you still want the damn stuff , buy it from apmex.com who after much research offer the best service and spreads . ( I am wholly unaffiliated with apmex and only mention them to potential fools based on fair pricing and excellent customer service ) . <p> The other thing about gold is that the bid/ask spread is titanic and this never benefits anyone but the broker . It is extremely expensive to acquire and sell . Gold ETFs are cheaper but present risk that they do not have the actual metal backing it up . The same thing applies to silver . Silver bugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . Ive been in this world and so glad I got out of it . <p> Gold is money , until the other party says its not , and it is no less fiat than paper dollars/euros/shekels ; the difference is in who declares it to be fiat , and in the end it does n't  matter ; if the poop truly hits the fan like the metal bugs yelp about , and it wo n't , nobody will want your gold in exchange for rabbits or chickens ; they want something immediately useful like clean water , fruit , milk , blacksmithing , etc . <p> That said , no more than 5-10% of precious metal in yer portfolio is n't a bad idea but all-in is just plain nuts . <p> In case anyone gives a shit , all of my long-term money has been in GNMAs or other US bonds since oh 2007 when I smelled something bad coming . I 'm the only person I know who 's made gains since then I tried telling people but they were all " DOW 36,000 ! " -addled and though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold then and sold today I 'd have made an enormous profit , but that was a once-in-a-generation trade and its v v unlikely to happen again for a long time . <p> Also : timber as an investment sucks . I 'm in the declining printing industry , and we use less paper every year . Most of it is shipped over as raw logs to China for processing , we get paper and lumber back . Whee . Paper consumption is falling drastically . I do n't  know how its feasible to put logs on a ship to China , mill it into paper then put pallets of finished paper on a ship back to the US , but I guess oil prices will finally put a stop to that . Oh noes ! We demolished all the US paper mills ! Ooops . <p> Actual ink-on-paper printing is also disappearing as an honorable profession in this country , esp . when Chinese printers can buy the assets of bankrupt US printers for nothing then fill their shops with top-end machinery from Heidelberg , KBA , MAN Roland , Komori @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from freight . <p> Well let 's seetrees huh ? I am gon na need some help with the math maybe ? <p> I live in the Pacific Northwest where trees grow pretty well . <p> We own 2 acres where we have planted about 500 fir and western red cedar seedlings ( 2 years Old ) . They cost us about $1 ea . <p> We spent about 60 hours clearing brush to get a 6 ' area free of vegitation around ea. tree and then planted them . ( We use the cd laddering tech of planting about 150 trees a year for a total of 500 so far ) I water them the first year for about another 60 or so hours total . So that 's about 120 hours sweat equity . <p> You lose about 1/3 to death from competition . <p> It would take about 50 years to get them to be ready to harvest . Each tree of mature size is worth about $500 today less one third to the logger for harvest and transportation to the mill . <p> How much wood is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wont increase by more then 1-2% a year . <p> I am not going to figure anything for taxes or land because it is our home . <p> What am I forgeting ? <p> NOne of this works for ERE but its fun to think it thru . <p> SO you math guys .. what will be my ROI ? <p> AJ said , <p> @ Forty2 : <p> You could say the same things about non-dividend paying stocks . <p> I think gold has its place in a diversified portfolio . Obv no one should put all their eggs in one basket . <p> I have a 40-acre tree farm growing timber ( not Christmas trees ) . That is how you invest in trees . My tree farm is in the Pacific Northwest so I grow the trees most common here : Douglas Fir , Western Red Cedar , Red Alder , and Western Hemlock . Douglas Fir can be harvested in 30+ years . The 10,000 Douglas Firs planted when I was 33 should be ready to harvest when I 'm around 67 . The Red Alder will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another plus of growing trees on rural property is that I have place to escape from the metro crowds . I get lots of exercise clearing brush . Taxes are only $150 per year and I was able to write off the mortgage interest and all expenses . <p> Macs said , <p> @Luca the best I 've found so far is Monevator ( http : //monevator.com/ ) which I discovered after Jacob linked a guest post ( or three ) he did there . Monevator has a great series of articles on high-yield dividend investing from a UK perspective . Worth a check out , I enjoy his blogs . <p> Gold is not at all unusual if you ask me . Being a dragon , you could safely assume Im fascinated with this sort of thing . That and silver !

@@42287716 @2287716/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Not made of money had a post on how to jump start your savings with a financial fast . This was a really good idea and I am still wondering why I did n't  think of doing a post like that given my stunning good looks and nice teeth = Ron ( The Wisdom Journal ) referred to it as the " crowbar maneuver " ( I took the liberty of stealing Rons term for the title ) whereas I take every chance I get to quote Yodas- " Do or do not . There is no try " . Of course this goes against the popular method of setting small goals . <p> Setting small goals is nice and apparently psychologically proven to be effective . <p> However , the way that many people go about it is completely wrong . Yet in the real world , trying is never good enough . Upon realizing that change is needed , one should set a large goal . Often this goal is very much beyond ones current line of thinking . People who are deeply in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands in savings . People who are used to receiving a paycheck can not imagine what its like not to have to work to pay the bills . People who are overweight and think of taking the stairs as a form of exercise can not imagine what its like to think of a marathon as a piece of cake . <p> In terms of financial goals , the article suggests not spending any money . Antishay is contemplating the same thing . It sounds outrageous , but if one is trying to jump across a chasm , it makes no sense to focus on first jumping half way across and then on jumping the rest of the way . Aim to jump all the way or do n't  jump at all . <p> But are n't  you setting yourself up for failure one might ask ? Remember Yoda . There is no trying . Therefore if you are committed , there is no failure . You will eventually prevail . Do you want to not having to work for money within the next five years ? If so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 bedroom ( per adult ) apartment , cancel the cable , turn down the thermostat , and stop buying anything that is not food . Youll be amazed at how much money you actually have . Even slipping a little bit cuts the amount of money in your hands , so have a go . How long can you last without spending anything at all ? <p> If you merely want to get out of debt or if you are fine with working for another 20 years , less drastic measures are required . But if you want financial independence , starting slowly will merely delay the target date . <p> Do you want to get in shape ? Same thing . Revamp your diet completely . Do n't  start with the idea of eating healthy once a week or adding a salad to the meal plan . If you do , please do n't  wonder why youre not seeing any results . Start exercising every day . Obviously one can not be expected to perform like a trained athlete right away but one can expect a daily effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 11 pushups a day and then 12 . Not from going from exercising once a week to exercising twice a week and then having a pizza to celebrate . <p> If you decide to do something , go full force or not at all . I do ( I do n't  try = ) This is the origin of the " extreme " part of the blog name . A half-assed effort is simply inefficient due to the way that progress can be measured on a S-curve ( Pareto Law ) . In other words a well-executed average plan beats a poorly executed great plan any day . Now one can get great plans from blogs , books , magazines , trainers , coaches , advisors , etc . One can get average plans as well or even poor plans . The most important thing , the execution of the plan , is always up to the individual . It is the execution that shows what one is made off . <h> 22 users responded in " Using the Crowbar Maneuver to get cash fast " <p> Maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually strikes me as missing the point and not as exciting .

I quickly realized I make enough $ I just was spending unconsciously Great lesson #1 . Could painlessly save $500 month the second month and now three months later I can see where it is possible to save 75% of my salary ( I am working on getting my expenses to $1,000 a month ) even last month I thought $300 a month for food was inexpensive but as I great deeper in this I see where the fat can be trimmed will I be able to buy mostly organic ?

I 've taken various forms of that test before , but I do n't  remember what the results have been in the past . <p> Tried one just now and it has deemed me an ISTJ .

Reading the comments I see that some missed the point .

Having a half-assed approach to savings is more hazardous than being a master Mustachian , but it is NOT more hazardous than living paycheck to paycheck with a mountain of credit card debt ! <p> For me its always important to have a really big goal and never lose focus of it . I then break that large goal into smaller goals so I can achieve something every few days that contribute to the bigger picture . This sort of mind set has really helped me to progress my finances .

Great post , thanks for sharing . <p> leeholsen said , <p> imram has it right imo , you got to break those big goals up into achievable steps that you can do daily or weekly . rick petino has a book that preaches this . <p> since most people usually live in the present , i think its best that way . <p> NiXa said , <p> " INTJ magnet " hehe the truth it seems = I have been extreme all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong goals for you . <p> greenie said , <p> I 'm not in debt but I do want to be able to leave my job and do some traveling and then relocate .

I 've also put up a list of the allowable expenses right over my computer desk so I can view it whenever I 'm online and subject to temptation . Essentially Ive eliminated all but necessary expenses for the house , car etc . I 'm also selling off what I no longer need or use and banking that money as well . <p> This does work and yes , going full bore really does help I think . The problem with the way many people approach savings or getting out of debt is that they try to do it too gradually I think . Its got to be purposeful and demonstrate good enough progress so that you get excited by it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decluttering ; the books that advocate removing one item a day- that could take forever . Tackle a closet or room and get it done ; when you see the gratifying results it will spur you on to do more . <p> And I 'm definitely NOT an INTJ ; forgot what I ended up being but almost the polar opposite . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287720 @2287720/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Warning : Controversial statements here . Also note , that there will be a Kindle version , which is a kind of e-book . <p> In the forums , I 've been asked why I do n't  sell the ERE book as an e-book . This is a longer response to that thread . <p> Well , it may simply come down to me putting the same stigma on e-books as book publishers do to self-publishers . I have never bought an e-book . For those Ive seen , in 95% of the cases I have been pretty glad I had n't  had to spend anything on them . <p> Of course there 's the standard problem of expectations . Suppose there was a book out there which upon reading it would save you $10,000 dollars . Certainly such books exists . Would you pay , say , $1,000 for such a book ? It would indeed by a very rational thing to do , since you just netted $9,000 . Odds are high , though , that since books usually cost $10-50 , you would not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : They typically cost 24 times as much as regular books and if we scale by content , they may be 1020 times as expensive . <p> For me an e-book is something one spends 3 months writing 20000 words to sell for $50+ in an affiliate marketing launch having all ones blogging friends hype it ( maybe because they get a 30% cut of the sales price ) . Its a beautiful business model , but I wonder how long people will keep buying into it . Indeed do most affiliates buy from each other with only a few being able to sell to the masses ? Let 's see some sales numbers , eh ? <p> Conversely , this ERE book is 100000 words ( 150000 cut down to 100000 ) which took 2 years to write and close to 6 months to edit and it will sell for less than half of the price of your typical e-book . If you buy it and hate it or do n't  want to keep it , you can sell it again and recover most of your cost . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get cold , you can burn it for fuel . ) <p> To profit , I therefore need to be able to keep selling it . I think if I released a pdf , this would not happen . It is not just about profit of course . I also have to consider the strategy I operate with . To me e-books is like earned income . You earn as you write : 3 months writing , launch , get money , write again , launch , get money again , <p> A good book is more like an asset . It will keep selling . Of course there may be good e-books as well that share similar qualities . <p> Now , equally important , I do n't  work well on the hype cycle which colors my perception of it and neither do you guys ( my intended audience ) at least that 's my strong impression . Hence , splitting the book out in 5 fifty dollar e-books and selling them off as a $250 " system " I think it would n't work . If I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about " matching the product to the consumer " , right = <h> 30 users responded in " On why I decided not to sell my book as an e-book " <p> Also e-books ( pdf type ) I think have a weird way of being pirated and then being all over the internet where people can download them for freeor one person downloads and forwards to all his friends at no cost . <p> And there is something to be said about reading a good old paper book that one can hold in ones hands , underline , mark , dogear etc 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Mike I fear that too . I 'm giving kindle a shot since they seem to offer some protection . Of course , paper books can be pirated by ripping them apart and scanning the pages . There 's no stopping that .

I have no desire to read a book on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Kindle or iPad is not the same thing at all ) <p> Yes , the hype cycle would turn me off .

One such hype loving " lifestyle design " blogger did a series of mini-launches , where he had a 24 hr. window of " buy or its gone !

John T Reed wrote a book on self publishing LONG ... his content is quite good ( books on real estate and succeeding ) . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Mike I suspect that information , like blogging stats , is a closely held secret . Particular by those who make money blogging ( or writing e-books ) about how to make money by blogging ( or writing e-books ) . I am self-publishing . I wrote a bit more about my reason why in this thread . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I too always wondered why e-books were more expensive ? Does n't  seem to make sense to me . I 've only read free e-books , which most were actually more like marketing materials or brochures and just barely worth the price : ) . <p> Maus said , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate travel . He is trying to go to every country in the world just to say he did it . <p> You refuse the e-book , affiliate &amp; hype model . He is the poster child for this . <p> He seems like a pretty inoffesive guy . I 'd have a beer with him , but I 'd never buy one of his e-books . " World Domination " through e-book marketing strikes me as a 21st century , web 2.0 version of the old ad in magazines that solicited $10 for a booklet on how to make money . Those foolish enough to send off the money received a single sheet of paper that basically said to take out an ad in the back of magazine and solicit $10 . If not a scam , then too close to quibble . All such models rely on the greater fool theory and rarely deliver information of any lasting value even if it is merely for the sake of entertainment . <p> A pox on e-books. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Maus I think its more accurate to say that were targeting people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of each other : INTJ and ESTP respectively if that 's too accurate , then definitely NT and SP . <p> Were simply doing things which works for us . I find that I have a few things in common with Tim Ferris , whom I suspect to be an ENTJ , like an appreciation for Roman philosophers , writing late , using TV as the wallpaper , and that whole do different things to an extreme level like learning to dance in 3 months or whatever that was . Note the difference in presentation though . <p> Its not going to change your mind , but here are the positives of e-books for me . ( Yes , I have purchased several quite good e-books . ) <p> Its always available as opposed to dead tree versions that go out of print . <p> Its instantaneously available as opposed to having to wait for the dead tree version to be shipped . <p> No shipping fees . <p> If the e-book sells for $19.95 , the author gets to keep ( wait a sec while I calculate it ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author collects something less than $19.95 . <p> Can be sold via Amazon as well as your own website . <p> Instantly modification capable . Subsequent or modified chapters can be included and offered as a free bonus to previous purchasers . <p> Of course there are negatives : <p> Probability of piracy . Although all it takes is one motivated individual to type or scan in the book and even a paper version can be pirated . I believe that most pirated works would not have been purchased ( although music is a long , involved discussion ) . <p> Not as likely to catch casual audience who have n't tripped over the website . How many folks are going to trip over the book in Borders ? <p> Always an interesting discussion . I 'm glad there will be a Kindle version . That is becoming my favorite way to read and I do n't  even own a Kindle anymore . The desktop apps are quite nice and keeping a book always synced between two computers and an iPhone is a wonderful thingassuming of course you like reading on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the computer , suits me well . <p> As for the other formats , a PDF can be okay . 37Signals sold Getting Real as a PDF ebook and made lots of money , theyve mentioned sales being more than a million dollars . Of course , they have a large audience and sell products to small businesses and freelancers . <p> The $50 e-books are obviously a scam , but I would guess it must be a profitable one based on the number of these available for sale . Surely there are enough people on the Internet to sell to the greater ( or latest ) fool many times before being found out . Then its on to the next oneclearly the ERE audience is n't a fan of this approach . = <p> Cheers ! <p> Marius said , <p> Some more advantages of ebooks : <p> Searchable <p> I have them at hand , wherever I am , on a USB stick or laptop . Try that with dead trees ! <p> When I want to quote a paragraph , I can just copy-paste from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to see a book at all . = <p> Bravo ! I think that 's the way to go for you too . I have bought a few e-books , but they were ones that I already had paper copies of " How I Found Freedom " , " the book of est " books that I like to have available wherever since I re-read a lot . <p> If its available as a kindle download , does that mean it would n't pull up on another reader though ? ie. I just got a kobo e-book reader ( amazon does n't  work with library books , only sony and kobo ) . Of course , I did n't  buy it , got it through credit card reward points <p> Nice article with some good arguments on why to go just with a hard print instead of a ebook . On the flip side , I see that a lot of clients wants to have their book scanned because they do not have a electronic copy of their older books ( the publisher do not give them a electronic copy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their book(s) or decide later that they want to publish also a ebook . So sometimes perspectives changes when you want to reach more reader . <p> I 'm glad you 're not not going the route of extreme marketing Jacob . Too many online bloggers are trying to give people these " great deals " for only a couple hundred dollars , saying theyll get so much out of it . In reality , people probably buy these books and systems , use them for a couple days , and throw them in a spare room to accumulate dust . A real book , as you mentioned , can be sold back . It could be regifted after you read it . It can be used as a spare piece of paper to write a note to yourself on . Much more useful ! However , as a Nook owner , I was wondering if the Kindle version of your book will convert to my eReader ? <p> skunk1980 said , <p> Yes it would be inconsistent with your ERE message to sell as an ebook . So bravo for consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great discussion . I was especially interested because I 'm just getting read to sell an eBook . One advantage for the reader is that most eBooks come with a money back guarantee . When I buy eBooks I have no problem asking for my money back if I do n't  like the book . I honestly do n't  know can your return most physical books if did n't  like the book ? My book will also have a value guarantee if readers do n't  think it was worth the price of the book I 'll gladly give their money back . <p> Kevin said , <p> I have bought several ebooks in the past but only if I was already familiar with the authors work and trusted that the value would be good . <p> For a couple of the book , the value from them was way more than I spent to get them . One book in particular has just started with a paper edition ( they put an e-book out first ) and I am tempted to buy it even though I already own the book . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combined costs from both editions will still be well under the actual value gained . <p> Its only a matter of time before most ebooks end up on eMule or a torrent site , anyways . I have n't caught on to Kindle , but good old-fashioned paper books still have a read-in-the-bed appeal to them that simply ca n't be matched by an e-book . I might try selling a small e-book for $5 or so , but not something that contains 2 years of my effort <p> Hi Jacob , Interesting thinking- Also , liked the plug ins article . The forum article was thought provoking as well . The idea of " creative energy " is a succinct way of capturing that limited resource . Thanks for the night of interesting reading ! <p> So then why do n't  you just sell the ebook version for the same price as the print version ? Some will prefer print , others will prefer the ebook format . Its easy to do and will cost you very little , if anything , to implement . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kyle I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profit as the paper version . Kindleyes , pdfnever . <p> Ive been spending hours upon hours researching this issue . In fact , I should write a blog about it <p> In any case , here are some of the things Ive discovered . <p> 1 . My personal experience is that some of my favorite bloggers are releasing pdf books and making decent money from low volume , high profit sales . Seems to work as a business model although I doubt it is sustainable . <p> 3 . Fiction is the #1 thing selling on Kindle right now . Although this might change I think for the time being most ebook readers are leisure readers and they are n't  trying to learn something ( i.e. non-fiction ) . Forget about the fact that a lot of non-fiction is entertainment and has nothing to do with learning . = <p> 4 . The market is growing and growing rapidly and Kindle is in a very good position to simply dominate the market . This means at least going with a Kindle version is worth thinking about . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an audience ? Do you want to reach the most people or just a few ? Answering those questions should tell you how you will publish . <p> 6 . Any success in book writing will require you to keep producing . Your original book sales will peak and fall , and unless you have a true classic your sales will fall to a trickle . To do this full time you have to keep producing and I feel like that is easier to do when you are a fiction writer . ( Or possibly are as frugal as Jacob ) . = <p> 7 . This would n't be complete without a 7th No matter what you do , what platform you choose , you still have to be business savvy and know how to market yourself . There is a reason distributors make the lions share of revenue in the book business . They make the sales . <p> Once again , you decide what 's important for you . Is it more important to be a writer or a marketer ? High profit , low volume ebooks or low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily better and its best just to choose what 's important for you . <p> I personally like pdf ebooks as a format because then I can read the pdf on my laptop and phone . ( If I had an iPad then I 'd read them there too . ) <p> As a user , DRM and closed formats annoy me . <p> On the other hand , as a content creator , I am concerned about the ease of copying of ebooks . If its easy for a person to copy from one device to another , its easy to replicate from one person to others , across the entire internet . <p> The " traditional " publishing process provides a useful mark of approval . The fact that a publishing company believes that a book is worth investing in is a useful vote of confidence . <p> Of course , internet publishing is a great thing because it empowers anyone to create an ebook . The downside is that it empowers anyone to create an ebook . <p> oyeesopito said , <p> E-books are awesome man , i 'm an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just taking up space , I did n't  want to get rid of them , but cant afford to finance the rent of a " library " . <p> E-books now go for 25%-50% less than a hard copy book now , and reading them on a kindle or any other " e-ink " type hardware is the same amount of effort for your eyes as normal paper . <p> I have thousands of books ( all older classic type books that are outside of the patent period are free ) I have paid for 90% of my books and there are some of those " 3 dollar e-books " that used to be some ghost written get rich quick scheme or how to lose the belly bulge in 10 days . But now 99% of books that are printed these days are available in e-book form , and new authors can offer their first book for $2 say , and then if it takes off they raise the prices for their subsequent books , making it easier to get in the scene , that is dominated by big companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions in e-format so you can have the full un-adulterated book just as you want it to bed read without the publisher cutting bits out here and there just to lower the cost of printing . <p> There is also the environmental factor of needing less trees to print thousands of books that will get burnt by the publisher if they do n't  sell . <p> For people who do n't  want to adopt and are all like " i 'll never read an electronic book , they just do n't  feel right in the hand or if you ca n't interest a publisher you cant interest me " that attitude is similar to when cars where invented and some people clung to their horse and carts , citing absurd reasons and claiming cars will never take off <p> i get the nostalgia but , i can carry thousands of books with me at all times , with a 2-3 week battery life ( look it up , I 'm not exaggerating ) that alone should give most people a reason to try them , and once you do 99% of the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be electronic . I would/have buy my favorite books of all time in hard copy , just as a token of admiration 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287721 @2287721/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> The American health care system is broken . The reason is not that employer group plans makes insurance more expensive for those who do n't  have an employer . No , the reason that the American health care system is broken is because Americans universally tend to believe that <p> Technology can solve all problems . <p> If you spend enough , you can get the technology needed for step 1 . <p> This is also the reason why so many people believe that they need a lot of money just to get by . Possibly this attitude comes from the country being one of engineers and businessmen ( eggheads and peddlers ? = ) , so let 's use this as a model to explain why this combination of thinking fails to solve complex problems . <p> Technology solves simple problems that usually involve few parts with few degrees of freedom . A pair of scissors has two parts and one degree of freedom . There is roughly one degree of freedom every time on part can move independently of another part . An operating engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , so effectively there are less than a dozen parts and maybe a handful of degrees of freedom for the different pistons and valves . It is an exceedingly complicated machine that has more than a couple of dozen degrees of freedom on the same level . In more complicated scenarios one builds a hierarchy of solutions if possible . For instance , logical circuits are gathered together on a computer chip , circuit boards are designed with chips with little consideration of the internals of the chips and so on . Compartmentalizing knowledge like this is a great tool but also a great source of weakness ( like any great tool is ) . If humans were sufficiently intelligent , the hierarchy could be leveled and substituted for complexity ( like the human brain ) . The fact that we have not invented artificial intelligence speaks to the fact that we have not mastered complexity . <p> Complex problems involve many agents with few degrees of freedom or few agents with many degrees of freedom . Examples of the former includes economic bubbles ( herd mentality ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being healthy and making efficient consumer choices . Assuming the risk of offending 90% of my readers I would say that the American mind(*) is culturally disposed to do worse at these kinds of problems compared to other nations . Conversely other nations do worse at simple problems(**) such as technology and business . <p> ( * ) Here I am talking about predispositions ( stereotypes ) and not the color of ones passport . Not all Americans act like the stereotypical American just like all Germans do not act like the stereotypical German . Yet if one observes a people over a sufficiently long time there are certain tendencies that one can identify as American , German , Japanese , French , Chinese , ( ** ) Make sure to understand the difference between simple problems and complex problems . Simple problems have few parts and few choices or many parts and many choices . Complex problems have few of the one and many of the other . Simple problems can be difficult to solve . Complex problems are often impossible to solve . <p> I think the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves so let 's consider health and consumer choice which is pertinent to this blog . Being a resident alien ( and having lived in a few countries ) gives me somewhat of an amateurish anthropological advantage in observing the natives . I have frequently seen that whenever Americans need to fix a problem they instinctively turn to Walmart . If you cant find your hat go and buy a hat . If that hat is too warm , too big , too red , go buy another one . If the hat example sounds ridiculous just substitute hat for shoes . I bet you have more than 5 pairs of shoes . If you 're hungry , you go and get pizza . And so it goes . Due the innate lack of ability to improvise and find complex solutions , that is , the inability to use fewer things to solve more problems necessitates solving problems by getting many things to solve many problems . Hence the lack of complex skills needs to be compensated by spending a lot of money on a lot of stuff and a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ive been to where it is normal not to do your own taxes . This invisible inability is the main barrier to financial independence for many people . The only solution they know in terms of solving their problems is accumulating a lot of money . <p> This attitude fares no better when it comes to health care . Many Americans believe that the most important thing they can do remain healthy is to get a good health insurance plan . People cry for affordable health insurance rather than affordable health care or affordable health ( clean water , clean air , nontoxic houses , nontoxic food , .. ) . The belief is that once you get sick or decrepit ( and it is widely believed that everybody gets to that point eventually ) then you or rather the insurance company throws their money at the problem and doctors fix you with technology much like cars are fixed in a garage , the economy is fixed with a stimulus package , or political problems are fixed through the use of superior firepower . <p> Yet when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health care is mostly about what and how much you eat and how and how much you move . If you eat more than you move , you are unhealthy . This eventually results in all sorts of complex problems ( diabetes , clogged arteries , ) . If you eat wrongly , the chance of cancer increases . If you are relatively weak ( if you cant do a pull up or a 30 second handstand then you are relatively weak ) , there will be problems with broken bones , joints , etc. down the line . Problems like strain and overuse also arise from moving wrongly . Thus health care starts with eating and moving correctly . This is common sense but people fail to apply it . Many people are much more likely to pop a pill than to prevent getting sick in first place(*) . Forsooth , eating vegetables is widely considered to be more painful than paying several hundred dollars a month in health insurance . <p> As we get old expensive cancer treatments , joint replacements , etc. are required because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This attitude ( coupled with a litigation happy public/justice system ) causes Americans to pay close to twice as much for their health as the nearest country for the same level of health . I was n't surprised when I saw a financial institution predict that Americans needed to save $225,000 to to pay for health care during retirement . <p> ( * ) Do n't  believe me ? What do you do for allergies ? Stop eating the food , petting the pet , or staying indoors when the flowers are blooming ? Or do you pop a pill ? What do people do for bone strength ? Lift weights ? Or pop a pill ? <p> Now " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure " , so for early retirement/financial independence it becomes crucial to learn how to deal with and think about complex problems . Health issues must be prevented before their appear . This means exercising daily at high intensity . It means cutting back on salt , meat , and dairy products while eating more vegetables and fruits . In terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than " buying " whenever there is a problem . <p> ( * ) We used a cardboard box insulated with aluminum foil to store the ashes of our wood stove and a small garden shovel to rake the cold ! ashes out until we got a nice set of fire place tools and a metal bucket via freecycle . Similarly the puppy currently used a set of cardboard boxes ( which actually hold DVD cases and various other crap ) taped together with duct tape and covered with towels for traction as a ramp for the couch . That is , until we find a free or cheap ramp somewhere . <h> 40 users responded in " Why it is so hard for Americans to be healthy and not spend money " <p> No need to worry about alienating your readers ; the only readers worth keeping are those who will appreciate the straight talking . ; - <p> I would like to commend you for identifying these shortcomings of the American . As you are a recent immigrant , it is possible that you have not been studying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists a latent , quiet polar opposite of the American you describe . These two Americans define each other . The fat , entitled , proactive , judgmental American presently dominates the affairs of this nation . The seed of the other American remains in layaway , ready to kick the lardass into the broom closet and take over when sheit hits the fan . They say that we are at war , but we are not . Big , fat American is just attempting to sit on a few contestants . When lean , mean , hungry American gets called up to unscrew the situation , there will be no contests with rules , only total victory or total defeat . Okay , maybe that 's an exaggeration , but let me get back on topic by giving a list of the characteristics of that American you may not have had the opportunity to meet ( yet you perhaps embody yourself ! ) : <p> I 'd like to sum up most of Americans problems in laziness and irresponsibility , and the supplements are lack of integrity and compassion . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take extra step to really learn and solve the fundamental of problems . Hence , the existence of all the " quickfix " and gimmicky scheme ( pills , xxxx-diet to lose weightw/o exercise , " get-rich " in 30 days ! ) <p> Even personal finance people who keep talking about " Debt snowball " and budgets and stuffs . Those are just methods , and despite they are a good place to start to change the most basic idea to control to spending , increase wealth , healthy body , and any kind of self-improvement comes from discipline and self-mastery . By focusing on " methods " too much , they limit themselves and likely create non-lasting change . <p> That 's my 2 cents . Thank you for listening and I appreciate your post a lot . <p> mysticaltyger said , <p> I agree with a lot of what is said here . But I think the fundamental problem with health care in America is that we do NOT have a truly competitive health care system . For a readable and practical book on the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think your analysis is slightly off the mark . Most of the people I know and work with desire health insurance for two reasons : well baby/child/adult visits to monitor their health to make sure there are n't  any red flags that need addressing , and coverage for a catastrophic event , such as a car accident or some other unforeseen hospitalization . <p> Further , many of the diseases that you dismiss as being as simple as riding your bike to work or eating your veggies at dinnertime to avoid are affected far more strongly by genetics than lifestyle ( lifestyle can have some impact , but not as much as most people hope and believe ) . You can run marathons and be a vegetarian and teetotaler your entire life , and still develop cancer and heart diseasethere are no magic bullets for some diseases no matter how optimally you live your life based on current conventional wisdom . <p> Adrienne said , <p> Because of course accidents do n't  happen . Granted people do n't  take the kind of care of themselves that they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broken arm . The system is broken because prices are ridiculously bloated , people who ca n't afford care/insurance do n't  pay those bills , and the prices go up yet again . <p> You know , casting aspersions on people who weigh more than insurance companies say they should isnt going to score you any karma points . There are fat people with entitlement attitudes , sure , but there are lots more thin people with them , in my experience . And I 've been on both ends of the scale . You could say my life has been like the weight equivalent of Black Like Me , only Im not pretending and I cant just switch back to skinny in two weeks . <p> My experience is that , as with you , skinny people think they are skinny because they have done all the right things and believed all the right things and therefore they are entitled to be thin because they are " good " people . <p> Unfortunately , their tendency to take potshots at people heavier than themselves belies the notion that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat on a vegetarian diet . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Dana I 'm not sure I ever drew a connection about being " good " , where " good " implies " being nice to other people " , and being healthy . I also realize that not everybody is born equal . On the other hand , the absolute benefits of being in shape are similar , so anyone who is not " talented " at being healthy simply needs to work harder at it . This is similar to how a person with an IQ of 90 would have to work harder at getting an education than someone with an IQ of 110 . Getting an education does not become less worthwhile because it is harder to obtain for some people . I do n't  think not getting one is excusable either or at least , one should be very aware of the consequences of ones choice not to put in the effort . The problem is the most people want it easy . I would even say that in my experience from training with people on given the choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10% will take a hard one . 10157 @qwx420157 <p> The comments to this post are telling . Seems that more people took offense to the obesity references than did to the reference to Americans throwing money and tech at all problems . <p> Annemarie said , <p> Health care cost less when people died easier . After seven years of being an Alz caregiver ( both parents ; Dads still alive because he had such a healthy lifestyle ) I would bet that much of the increase in costs is due to end-of-life care . <p> Theevildrsin said , <p> @Dana , so you are saying many thin people feel entitled to be thin and there are some fat people that feel entitled to what ? Health insurance ? Seems like an awkward argument . Being good has nothing to do with being healthy . Being responsible for yourself does . Yes there are many genetic diseases : I just have a problem with those who blame genetics whether right or wrong then live an unhealthy lifestyle as well . <p> My ( not-an-expert ) opinion : there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees , big pharma , lawyers , ETCwho make huge money from the system as it is . Not to mention legislators and the lobbyists who are swarming all around . <p> Thee is no one to speak for the consumer , it seems to me . <p> Suzie said , <p> Whilst exercise and diet will improve baseline health , the fact is people have a different baseline . An accident whether automobile or skiing genetic diseases ( my friend WILL be in a wheelchair by the time she is 45-50 because of a progressive genetic disease regardless of how much she exercises ) , even just a nasty infection can send even the healthiest of us to the experts . <p> Health care is always going to cost more for some people than others , and it is our social responsibility to share that financial burden rather than let some people end up financially crippled thanks to being physically crippled . <p> Maus said , <p> As I approach my 49th birthday in less than a month , I have learned a few health-related lessons in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 ) It is a whole lot harder to regain fitness after years of neglect than it would have been to maintain it in my late twenties and thirties ; and 2 ) I can be stoic about a disease like cancer , or even the sequalae of diabetes ; but I want health insurance for the sort of catastrophic injury that happens in an instant ( e.g. auto collision ) . <p> Children , you can not reason with bigotry . Its pointless to try . I should know , I spent my formative years in Klan land with a brown daddy . Cognitive distortions seem perfectly logical to the bigoted mind , so give up the ghost on trying to change that . <p> In other news , me thinks this is an all-or-nothing , simplistic view that absolves the corporate elite of any responsibility : " Yet when it comes to health it is always the responsibility of the individual . " <p> So , the dude who worked for Monsanto who told me , proudly , that he had " dumped toxins in every major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution present in MOs water supply and the resulting domino effect ? Or the countless other corporations that pollute because it is simply cost effective ? So , the individual is responsible for OO-estrogens and endocrine disruptors found throughout the landscape ? Uh , ok . <p> We have control to some extent , but after spending a good 5 years working in an ICU , I can assure you , the individual is not all-powerful . I saw far more " healthy " people die from cancer than " unhealthy . " All disease does not stem from lifestyle choice , despite the fact that its a very profitable ideology to promote . <p> Although I appreciate your whole hearted embrace of the Rugged Individual ideology that is so very American ( way to assimilate ! ) , its important to note that individuals exist within the context of communities and those communites , unfortunately , contain some disturbingly unethical elements that affect the whole . <p> However , I agree with you in that Americans are prone to toss money at problems instead of find alternate solutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of wealth worship and the delusion that the Rugged Individual is wholly responsible for every single aspect of everything that occurs in his or her life . ( I blame " The Secret " and other modes of magical thinking . ) <p> Your take on health in the ERE book was far more holistic and sound , despite the fact that it too neglected larger social issues . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> ConsciouslyFrugal.well said . You placed into print what I was thinking but need not type out now . Thank you ! <p> CB said , <p> I regret that I am seeing far too many people who are acquiring lifestyle-related illnesses because they do not live lives of moderation in terms of what they eat and drink , and do n't  move enough . I looked at photos taken at Disneyland after it opened in the mid-50s . The crowd was noticeably different . Slim in a word . <p> A friend who recently went there reported that she was shocked by all of the adults who had to be in pushed around in wheelchairs because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Type 2 diabetes epidemic are caused by lifestyle in most instances . Type 1 diabetes is an endocrine disorder that shows up when one is young and that can not be prevented . Type 2 is a different story . I spoke with a fellow high-school student ( second in his class , and brilliant in many ways ) . He used to make fun of his brother who was a doctor who became fat as he aged . Now when my friend was diagnosed with pre-diabetes , he did n't  change his diet nor did he exercise . Now he is taking pills to control the disease . <p> I find most doctors more willing to prescribe pills than to strongly demand lifestyle changes . More money in that , I suppose . <p> Americans could stand to have many healthier habits , just as you laid out . But being what our culture defines as thin or a correct weight is not the same as being healthy . A heavy person can be far healthier than a thin one . <p> @ Jacob Wow , did my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to put it all together I am starting to wonder which comes first getting a hold on your finances or getting a hold of your health ? ? ? <p> To all you doubters out there let me quote some numbers <p> " The costs associated with diagnosis and treatment of personally preventable illnesses makes up approximately 70 percent of the total bill . Most of these illnesses are linked to personal lifestyle choices . Sony Corp . of America analyzed claims data and found that 50 percent of its indemnity plan costs were incurred by employees with medical conditions that were lifestyle-related , and could be changed . " <p> I really do n't  want to pay for more inefficiency . I pay enough as it is <p> YES , you can argue that there are a lot of healthcare costs associated with things that are not preventable ( i.e. genetics , accidents , etc. ) but do n't  tell me healthcare costs ca n't be drastically reduced if people change their lifestyles . <p> Please educate yourself ( not with mass media ) and live a better life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post and also great counter-reply by ConsciouslyFrugal . Like most other places , everything in the US is defined by equilibriums of forces going all sorts of directions . For instance , compared to its size and population , US culture is claustrophically homogeneous the mass culture but this is balanced by a rich set of subcultures worshipping individualism , originality , and diversity . There is great poverty but also great wealth , and these are held together by the American Dream . You mostly have a sheep-like population , following the God-tinged Leader and the top-cracy , but there is some of the most dissenting views aired in public debate as well , and as a safety valve , there is the harmless cult of guns , militia , and revolt . There is often great local social cohesion but almost no goodwill or other glue to bind together the nation or even a state in a shared identity . And so forth and so on . <p> Now , you can hardly state any of Americas problems without talking in generalities ; nevertheless , the problems are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is correct in pointing out that American individuals are too prone to relying on technological solutions and on paying for solutions instead of solving them or , even better , preventing them . However , ConsciouslyFrugal is also correct in observing that individual Americans are not to blame ; or rather , the brunt of the blame lies in predatory American systems , like big companies for instance . I would add among the entities a litany of cultural ideals that are far more harmful than beneficial , including the American Dream and that of the Rugged Individual . Some of these ideals have been imposed intentionally by predatory entities like the ideal of blatant consumerism , for instance ( think iThings or Guzzi or big houses ) but others , like the Rugged Individual or Guns Rights , came about through historical reasons . Now , its a lost cause to try to fight strong ideas and cultural settings like these directly , but you can try to influence individuals , and that is what Jacob is doing fairly succesfully , and strong , resourceful , and self-reliant individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this can induce a change in culture . However , you can also fight the predatory powers directly , rather than their cultural weapons , and this sometimes works , for instance like the fight against tobacco companies , or voting Obama over the old set of rulers . If the currently prevailing predators lose their power ( for instance , if oil prices eventually bunkrupt the US , or if US poverty levels get to a tipping point ) , then their idea-weapons might lose potency too , and things will automatically change , in which case , it is good that Jacob and others have already presented new cultural options . On the whole , I would tend to agree more with ConsciouslyFrugal : blame the " System " ( entities like companies , political forces , even culture as an automotive and self-preserving force in itself ) more than the individual . Not all the blame though : as individuals , we are still responsible . <p> PS : An small and incidental but important point although contemporary Americans love the idea of technology , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more prone to emotional thinking than rational , scientific thinking . Which is why you have Oprah , the Secret , the non-Kyoto agreement , and a load of wierd conspiracy theories , to mention just a few consequences . Contrast that to China , where you almost have to have a Masters degree in engineering or science to get up the political ladder which is why China is berserking ahead with technological projects of mindblowing proportions . Gone are the days of bulding the Hoover Dam or the American highways , or within a decade , from scratch , getting men to race moon cars for fun and dominance . The American decline is reflected at all levels , from its global fade , down to its not-too-heroic individual citizens . <p> Wow . I have a much more romantic view of Americans . I see us as a nation of scrappy underdogs who immigrated here because they were risk takers . <p> They would rather venture into the unknown and make something of themselves than wallow in poverty . They are not lazy but ambitious and creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the UK and how a foreigners perception of Americans was usually off base . If you 've never travelled within the states , you may not know that the people are as different as the landscapes they come from . Not everyone is a bible beating conservative , gangsta rapper , cattle rancher , or a fattie collecting welfare or a lap dog carrying socialite . But somehow they lumped all these very odd stereotypes into one term " american " and thought I was somehow all these things . <p> Sorry , but this post does n't  resonate with this American . We are much more than you give us credit for . <p> " I find most doctors more willing to prescribe pills than to strongly demand lifestyle changes . More money in that , I suppose . " <p> That 's a little cynical do n't  you think . There 's actually very little money in doctors prescribing a particular medicine . They 're not allowed to be paid by the pharmaceutical companies anymore . At least , not enough to make it worth their effort ( an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they know their patients will take them . They know that their patients are unlikely to make lifestyle changes . Most doctors I know , will prescribe both . <p> Doctors prescribe pills because research is done to show that if the patient takes the pill , they will have a better outcome . That legally makes it the standard of care in most states . Not prescribing the pills would then be medical malpractice . And in America , if there 's malpractice and a bad outcome occurs , a doctor has to pay . It does n't  matter how the consumers lifestyle caused the problem to begin with . So in a sense , it is about money . But not making money . Its about not losing everything . <p> Where does personal responsibility end and corporate responsibility begin ? <p> Jan said , <p> I 'm beginning to understand .

I picked the US because there are several possible places in the US and only one in each of the other ones . <p> I had already accumulated a substantial amount of money before I came here . There are very few non-market economies . <p> You 're right about the small house and hanging out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply because the default end-point of the well-educated is rich . <p> I think you overgeneralize more than I do . Compared to other nations , Americans ( United States of Americans ) are as a group less healthy ( lifespan , which is a good proxy , is not impressive , see LONG ... and they also , as a group tend to prefer technological solutions ( pills for health problems for instance ) . The US is the only country I know of where its allowed to advertise prescription drugs on TV . <p> Of course the average does not equal specific individuals . In fact , people are much more defined by their socioeconomic level than by their nationality . I have more in common with a scientist from AnyCountry than my electrician and government agency neighbors , respectively , or a random Dane . <p> This actually makes it hard to " back out " cultural trends , especially without having lived in other cultures . here 's a post about Denmark . I could n't have written that without having NOT lived in Denmark for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are more people ( absolutely speaking ) like me in the US than in my home country . That 's why I stay . I 'm also married to an American . A dual nationality marriage is truly a hassle without freedom to move . <p> I 'd expect costs of moving back to be about the same as here .

@@42287724 @2287724/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I bought my pressure cooker in 2001 shortly after I started grad school . Its a 7 liter Kuhn Rikon Duromatic exactly like the one in the link , so I am pleased to note that it has not been necessary to upgrade the design for the past 8 years . Pressure cookers can be expensive ( $200+ ) and paying so much money when I had just adopted an extreme savings program was emotionally painful . Yet while it was n't cheap it definitely was frugal . Over the years , I have had the same pressure cooker for 8 years now , the savings in gas/electricity and time due to the reduced cooking times usually things cook 2-3 times faster , meaning 2-3 less fuel not to mention the convenience as things rarely boil over the top ( they may boil into the pressure valves though which is bad ! ) , has certainly paid it off . If I lost it , I would get a new one right away . In fact I became so enamored with it that I bought pressure cookers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure cookers is really so brilliant that everybody should own one . Cooking under normal pressure is simply wasteful and old-fashioned . <p> Pressure cookers work by increasing the boiling point of water ( the higher the pressure , the higher the boiling point ) and thus the temperature at which the food cooks ( typically at the boiling point ) . This means that food cook faster under pressure . Sometimes a lot faster . This makes steaming a viable option and often you will steam your food rather than cook it . This preserves more of the taste inside the food . In terms of time , potatoes and vegetables only take a couple of minutes , meat takes less than 15 minutes . If you have a big stew , you can precook in the pressure cooker . It will make the meat fall off the bones . <p> The Duromatic has a " clever " pressure release , where you do not have to hold down the valve manually to release steam . Steam should be released gradually to avoid having your potatoes puff up like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emerges too quickly . If you do n't  care about that ( I do n't  since I mainly cook rice and beans ) , then there 's no need to pay $10 for that " feature " . <p> The pressure release also has two levels of pressure indicated . Let 's call them level 1 and 2 . It comes with a long list of various ingredients and whether they should be cooked on level 1 or 2 . I ignore that now having found what works for me . <p> For instance , when I cook rice , use a cup to dump in 2 parts rice to 3 parts water . I then lock the lid and fire up the burner until level 2 is reached at which point I turn the burner off . After the pressure has dropped completely , the rice is cooked . This method never burns the rice . Burning generally happens when you run out of ready moisture , but since all the moisture is contained in the pressure cooker food very rarely burn to the bottom Cooking rice takes about 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial phase ( maybe 5 minutes ) . For beans , I cover the presoaked beans liberally with water ( less water means foam , foam is bad ! ) and heat to level 2 . Then I turn the heat off . If you are really frugal with your heat , you can put the pressure cooker in your sleeping bag at this point . Once the pressure drops to level 1 I heat again , and so on for about 20 minutes . This leaves the beans very well done ( the way I like them ) . <p> After 8 years , the rubber on the emergency release valve ( the UL valve ) has become a bit worn so building pressure is harder . I have found that taking off the lid , wiping it off around the valve so that the hot water softens it , and then putting the lid back on works . Once it stops working , Kuhn Rikon sell replacements , so I 'll get one of those . Surprisingly , the rubber seal/gasket is still working , even after 8 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep in mind that the top third volume is reserved for steam . In other words , the cooker can only be filled the the 2/3 mark . That is why I did not get one of the smaller ones . In particular , the pressure cooking deep pans ( for risotto ) make no sense to me . I might consider a 5L/quart cooker , but I would find a 3L impractical except maybe for camping . <p> Obviously , it also works as a regular very thick bottomed stainless steel pot and often I start by sauteing onions in the cooker before adding the rice on top of it and adding pressure . This saves doing dishes as well as an extra pot . <h> 26 users responded in " A tribute to my pressure cooker " <p> I 've never used a pressure cooker before so that was a really interesting post . Ill have to read a little more about them . <p> My favorite kitchen appliance is my rice cooker . I add three parts water to one part rice , push down the small lever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do its thing . Ive cooked Arborio ( risotto-style ) and wild rice in it and it always cooks the rice to perfection , with basically no supervision . When the rice is done the lever automatically clicks back up , and the machine turns itself off . Its actually my boyfriends rice cooker , and I was skeptical of it at first , but its quickly become one of the kitchen appliances that I use the most . <p> Sam said , <p> I 'm happy with cheep pressure cookers . Maybe I 'd feel different if I had tried a good one first , but I do n't  see the need to get anything fancier that a Hawkins or a GSI . Hawkins comes in many different sizes and can be found on Amazon . GSI cookers are intended for camping , but work great at home . <p> I like to use two cheep cookers at the same time . One for rice and one for beans or squash . <p> A pressure cooker is the only thing that come close to being as useful as a steel wok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blender like a pressure cooker is to a pot ; it works on a whole different level . Its twice as much as the Kuhn-Rikon PC , but does have a 10-year warranty . And my Farberware PC has held up for years anyway . <p> There is nothing from the kitchen better than a freshly blended smoothie of greens , fruit , and seeds . Fast and easy to make . Fast and easy to consume . <p> Ken C. said , <p> Well , one pressure cooker on its way via free shipping <p> Ive been purposefully meandering the internet looking for pressure cooker recipes . I 'm focusing on " single pot " recipes . Ill probably try to convert some recipes from those cookbooks lined up on my bookshelf too . Once I have gathered a fair amount of recipes and tested them , I 'll send them to you so you can post them in your blog . Hopefully that will help people make an easier transition . <p> Thank you Jacob . Although possessing a leaning towards extremes , my family , friends , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me back to moderation . I 'm all for moderation in many things , but one must be wary of a single concept applied universally across the board . <p> Several months ago , I decide to hell with it . I 've trying moderation for 30-plus years and still do n't  feel as if I am heading in the right direction . I felt as I was drifting through life missing many of the important parts . I decided that I needed to follow my extremes for a while . A powerful feeling , but ultimately undirected . A life of moderation nearly drove my imagination away from me . Ive been slowly nursing it back to health . While unrelated , the timing was impeccable when a link led me to your blog this last Saturday . I read a few of your posts and then a few more . The idea that you offer up is so simple and yet mighty . It struck me that this is a way to accomplish the life that I wish to have . Freedom . Freedom with its trusty sidekick responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt a feeling akin to what those explorers starting the California rush must have felt . " Gold ! Theres gold here ! " In the last several days , I 've read all your posts and all the comments ( you have a wonderful and informed group of commenters . ) I realize that I had resigned myself to working until traditional retirement . Thank you very much for lighting the bulb . <p> My transformation may not be as quick as some , but within six months I will have sold my car , got rid of my cell phone ( switching to Skype ) , switched my diet to cut costs , and sold or given away the majority of my possessions . I have many clothes and will not need to buy anything new for several years . Any future clothes I do buy will mostly be along the lines you have suggested . I will not be as extreme as you in cutting costs by choice . I pay $700 in rent , but I love my place , it is a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very close to work and school . I am going to school full-time , but I work full-time also . I know your thoughts on school , but I am set on getting my degree in Computer Science . I currently work in that field and a degree will drastically increase my earnings by opening new doors . Those doors will also increase my network of people which will allow me the opportunity for temporary contract jobs after retiring should I decide that I want to spend a few months in Italy or somewhere else . <p> May I offer a little advice ? I noticed several comments and at least one post expressing a desire to monetize this blog . I would recommended against it ( with the possible exception of tasteful ads as your number of hits rises . ) You may have already decided against it due to the responses that you received asking about paying for a newsletter . This blog as a free resource serves a more important purpose for you : marketing . Marketing for your future book and , more importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized as an expert in a field will bring many benefits . Who knows , perhaps we will see you on Oprah someday . <p> Lisa said , <p> Hi ! Pressure cookers are great , but it amazes me that anyone who considers themselves frugal would pay $200 for one .

I have gotten ones from goodwill &amp; gave some of them away.Hope you are doing good . lisa <p> Jack said , <p> My favorite tool is my sharp knife . I use it every day ! 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Interesting post , I need to look into that since time is always of the essence when were cooking with a hungry 1 1/2 year old around . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Lisa I do not remember what I paid for mine . I bought it in Switzerland ( they 're made in Switzerland ) . I do n't  think I paid that much . Of course the USD is not what it used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , but when I buy new , I tend to buy in the top 80% percentile and pay accordingly . For instance , my boots and favorite jacket were $200+ each as well . If you amortize them ( and the pressure cooker ) , it comes down to $20-30 a year . My redeeming factor is that I buy very few things and I do n't  replace them often . They last more than a decade , so the true figure may be lower than 20-30 bucks , that 's just the current figure . I prefer it that way . Its one of the reasons I can get away with not spending much on stuff . <p> mjukr said , <p> @Lisa I 'd say 8 years of use for a $200 investment is pretty frugal ! <p> Let 's see how long that el cheapo Sears model lasts <p> DNA said , <p> Good knives , of course , and a sharpening stone and oil are number one on my list , followed by rice cooker/steamer , Le Creuset heavy pots and sturdy muffin and bread pans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this list pretty much covers 90% of our needs . <p> The one item I consider not necessary but I like anyway is a toaster . I 've burned too much toast using the broiler setting in the oven . <p> I 've always been tempted to own a pressure cooker , but have n't taken the plunge yet because I tend to cook beans the long way about once a month and then freeze them in individual servings. 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Speaking of food , Jacob , I 've been wondering what your pre-game meal(s) usually are for hockey night ? <p> Lori said , <p> I love to use my slow cooker .

But I definitely would lovelovelove to have a Kuhn Rikon and would n't regard $200 on one of them as wasted money at all . ( This from a guy who refuses to pay for a drying machine and hang dries all his clothes ) Its just money I have n't opted to spend at this point . 10158 @qwx420158 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharpmaker sharpening system instead of a stone and oil . It will give you stunning results very quickly without you having to make an extended study of sharpening technique . <p> Travis said , <p> On a related note , where I live in Colorado pressure cookers are more than just a convenience , they 're practically a necessity . The boiling point of water is reduced to such a degree at 10000 ft that cooking dry beans or pasta is pretty much an all day affair if you do n't  have one . <p> Al said , <p> You can get an excellent , name-brand pressure cooker for 75 cents at a garage sale . I saw one yesterday at this price . <p> sara said , <p> I was introduced to the pressure cooker in 1974 by my french mother in law . They are used all the time and are still used today . I can recommend the Seb brand I have another one and the joint on my cooker is 15 years old and it still works , thogh it can be replaced . They last a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic bits can be replaced but I have never had to so far . I believe they beat the wok in terms of energy efficiency and cooking time- a lot of things can be cooked by getting the pressure up high then turning the gas off and leaving it . I do a lamb stew in 15 minutes flat with couscous cooked in last two minutes . The hay box is also a good way to slow cook but it does take up more room . Try cooking a hock or a ham in the pressure cooker with a handful of fresh hay the taste is wonderful . <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> My advice on sharpening knives ( this from someone who used to worship on the SpirderCo altar ) <p> Do NOT get the spiderco system ! It is ok for touchup work but is unable to remove significant amounts of metal in those cases ( not that uncommon cases ) where that becomes necessary . <p> Get Murray Carters video on sharpening knives ( at least the first onealthough some cool tricks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kershaw combination japanese waterstone or a set of the stones that Murray recommends for general use on his website . By the way , do n't  bother with getting a superfine stone , you wo n't need it . 3000 grit is plenty for just about anyone . And if you want to strop that finer than he shows you how to do that on newsprint ( newsprint , cardboard , and magazine paper have very fine clay particles on the surface , clay particles are harder than steel , and used correctly a sheet of newsprint will bring a well prepared blade to razor sharpness within about a minute ) . <p> I have an 8000 grit stone that I never bother using because I have concluded that I have no need to sharpen anything to a mirror surface . <p> One thing I will say when learning from Murrays videos is that unless you are using a Japanese knife or one of Murrays handmade knives , do not sharpen to the low angel that Murray displays in the video . The steel on your western knife is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stick to like a 22 or 25 degree angle on those knives or the edge will fold over fast on them . To estimate 22.5 degrees , fold a piece of paper so that the corner forms a 45 degree angle , then fold in half again to form a 22.5 degree angle and use that as your reference point . <p> You can trace the angle out onto a piece of plastic to make the angle reference guide more durable . I used an old credit card for this and cut the angle on it with a straightedge and an exacto knife . <p> I do n't  use the guide anymore though because I have pretty much internalized the angle . <p> You will never need anything else to sharpen you knives again . After watching the video you will even be able to sharpen blades on the back of mugs or plates and get reasonable results . More importantly , you will actually understand what you are doing and what is going on , which you will not if you merely rely on the SpiderCo system . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy tomorrow . One of the retailers has a pressure cooker for $59.95 which was ( allegedly ) previously priced at $229.95 . There 's even a rave review giving it five hearts , ( seriously , who really falls in love with their kitchen cookware ? ) , which is probably written by one of the store 's IT employees or someone paid ten cents to do so by an online survey business . But please , forgive my cynicism . I believe it would get a lot of use if I was to purchase it and I guess I 've been sold on a pressure cooker after reading the touching ode to pressure cookers on the Early Retirement Extreme site LONG ... <p> @Jacob : I am surprised to hear a physicist with a PhD say something like this ! Cooking at a higher temperature means a higher rate of heat loss to the environment , which means you will have to use more energy/time to maintain that higher cooking temperature . So while I expect you do save some fuel , its mostly time that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 Another way to save energy while cooking is to put a heat deflector around your cooking pot . You can make a flimsy one out of aluminum foil , or you can make a sturdy one from an angel food cake pan found for a few bucks at a 2nd-hand store . <p> In a standard pot , you apply heat ( set by the burner ) and the temperature of the pot increases until the heat lost by the pot equals the heat supplied by the burner . It takes a lot more heat to evaporate water than it does to heat it . Also , heat is transported much more efficiently by convection than either radiation or conduction ( especially conduction to aircan verify by briefly sticking hand into hot oven ) . Hence , most of the energy in a normal pot goes into making steam which then bubbles up and carries the energy away . <p> In a pressure cooker , the pressure rises as the temperature increases . This increases waters boiling point significantly which means that little energy is wasted evaporating water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is zero . The pot does get hotter but conduction to air is not strong . If you keep applying heat the temperature does n't  stop rising because conduction/radiation to the room equals the burner heat but because the safety valves release . <p> In conclusion , you apply much less heat energy to a pressure cooker . For example , potatoes requires about 4 minutes of heat . Rice about 5-10 . Beans about 20 . This is 3-4 times less energy than a normal pot . <p> ImaginaryNumber said , <p> @Jacob- Many people put a lid on a conventional pot when they cook . Because the lid is relatively cool the steam boiling off the cooking food condenses on the lid and drains back into the pot which is exactly what happens within a pressure-cooker as well . Furthermore , most pressure-cookers have some sort of valve which in fact releases steam . So the method of heat loss by both a conventional pot and a pressure-cooker is quite similar radiation loss from the walls and lid of the pot and a small amount of steam loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I have to set the stove burner higher to maintain boiling in pressure-cooker with the " jiggler " on , than is needed to boil that same amount of fluid in the exact same pot , but with the " jiggler " off . <p> I 've never measured the exact amount of electricity used for both methods , but it sounds like you have n't either . So I feel comfortable maintaining my original position " while I expect you do save some fuel , it 's mostly time that you save . " <p> I again commend for your consideration a heat reflector around your pot ( not a heat deflector as I originally called it ) . Backpackers have long used them to save on the amount of fuel they have to carry . Reflectors reduce the radiation lost from the pot , and better direct the flow of hot gases against the sides of the pot . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ImaginaryNumber The pressure cooker I use ( KuhnRikon ) does not let any steam out while cooking , so there 's zero convective loss . No steam escapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same setting for pressure and standard . Pressure is much faster and it reaches boiling faster as well . <p> I have never compared directly because the fuel use is not even close .

The pot is like getting the car up to 55mph in 2 minutes but then having the keep the foot on the accelerator to maintain speed , arriving in 45 minutes . If you have to floor it to get your pressure cooker going , youd want to upgrade = 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287728 @2287728/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> There are basically three big categories in a normal household budget that need to be severely modified to make retiring extremely early feasible . These are housing , transportation , and food . <p> Whereas I have already dealt with housing , I am still a bit reluctant to deal with transportation . I have this image of readers sitting clutching their steering wheel with a wild look in their eyes muttering " My precious ! = <p> Therefore Ill start with food . <p> People are generally recommended to eat a varied diet . I suspect that the general argument is similar to that of index fund investing : So many people are clueless about nutrition so if experts recommend eating a little bit of everything , chances are that nobody will develop any nutritional deficiencies well other than eating too much . This I believe is a result of insisting on eating three larger meals a day despite NOT doing the hard physical labor that that meal plan was originally designed for . <p> During my first 3 years , I ate mostly lentil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice , carrots ) and tuna sandwiches with lettuce or kale . This accounted for 75% of my cooking and it was certainly healthier than the ramen noodles and cafeteria food my colleagues subsisted on . I would also eat a lot of stir fry ( beans , onions , carrots , apples , broccoli , rice ) . <p> Today we eat somewhat more interestingly . However , some lessons are still worth retaining , namely that by keeping to only a few meals , which together cover all bases , it is possible to learn to cook based on a small set of staples ( rice , beans , onions ) . These staples are then bought in 10lbs bags . <p> Avoid preprocessed food . Personally I draw the line at canned tomatoes and bread . I would never buy sauces , powders , or frozen ready meals . <p> One will get used to eating just a few different kinds of meals surprisingly quickly and be as happy about eating as someone who eats out all the time . The great thing about this is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat . Those who eat a standard diet require much more to be happy about eating something they do n't  usually eat . Of course if gourmet food is your thing , then maybe food is the area where one should spend a little extra effort or time ( and maybe even money ) . Meals can be varied by adding loss leaders as the supermarket offers them up . <p> Many have way too many kitchen gadgets . See this post on how to reduce your kitchen to something more useful without having to dig for everything . <p> Before switching to a staples based dinner plan , I recommend getting rid of all the weird things in your cupboard . The best way is to not buy anything until your last strange ingredient is gone . Just imagine that there was an earth quake and the stores were closed for a week . How would you do ? <p> The alternative is to give it away on freecycle . Yes , they take food . <p> I highly recommend flipping the standard western idea of basing all meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less expensive both in terms of food cost but also in terms of reduced medical costs ( cholesterol and all that ) . Also it is very hard to stay overweight on a vegetarian diet . The emphasis on carbs also results in more energy . Meat and milk is generally not healthy to eat ( but I do admit it does taste good ! ) . In addition , short of not having children , going vegetarian is the most effective way of reducing your impact on the worlds food supply . It takes 17 grams of plant protein to make 1 gram of meat protein ( and a huge amount of water as well ) . The problem is that we , the rich people of the world , can easily afford to price the poor people out of the market , e.g. paying 17 times as much for our protein , and that results in starvation . Incidentally do not throw away leftovers . It is wasteful and in light of the above also morally wrong . <p> I gave up on the whole milk idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking up a milk every six days ( in myCountry the regulation against preservatives is pretty tough , so milk tends to expire within 6 days ) was too inconvenient . <p> One way of not buying too much unneeded food is to strictly adhere to a grocery list . This is not optimal though . Using a list leads people to buy food even when it is not on sale . I only buy food when it is on sale ! In general DW buys our food and she is not as stingy as I am , so we spend more than we have to the joys of already being financially independent is that I can spend surplus money on things like that laziness = Anyway , a much better trick is to shop on foot . That means bringing a backpack and walking over to the supermarket instead of driving . <p> I know that sounds outrageous . My precious ! Probably as outrageous as the idea of just driving out to get something whenever one needs it still sounds to me . But put on a backpack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have always managed to live within a thirty minute walk from the nearest one , and chances are that you do too . You are now limited by the size of your backpack . Also the desire to just head out and get something rather than trying to improvise a recipe without that most likely irrelevant ingredient will be stronger . <p> Incidentally you can bike too depending on what kind of load you can handle on a bike . I was always set up to handle more on foot ( about 40lbs ) than on the bike ( about half that ) . <p> Food limit : Depending on where you live : $50-75/person/month . <p> Jacob comments : This will get you started : Buy a 10lbs sack of rice . Onions , carrots , kale , raisins , soy sauce , olive oil ( large one ) , and black beans ( the big bags are at your ethnic grocer ) . Cook the rice and the beans . Slice up the onions , carrots , and kate . Fry the kale , add the carrots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raisins , beans , rice , and soy sauce . Mix around . Done . If nothing else , try eating this for a few days a week from now on until you perfected the mixing ratios . <h> 56 users responded in " Day 3 : Grocery shopping " <p> I am well below zero for food .

This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas . This is what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by means of the daemons . Nothing is effected by daemons , there are no daemons . Everyone can perform magic , everyone can reach his goals , if he is able to think , if he is able to wait , if he is able to fast . " Siddhartha , Hermann Hesse <p> The short list of required ingredients for reaching your financial goals : <p> Being able to think . <p> Being able to wait . <p> Being able to fast . <p> Not doing anything that opposes the goal . <p> Let 's deal with them in turn . <p> Being able to think means knowing and understanding personal finances . Reading the small print . If those people who got the biggest possible adjustable rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that adjustable rate means that the rate adjusts ( ! ) If those who live paycheck to paycheck and spend everything they earn would stop to think , they would realize that an unforeseen expense or accident could send the whole house of cards tumbling down .

People do n't  get wealthy over night . It takes years of sustained effort . Even as little as $100 saved every month adds up even though initially it seems like trickles . Those who ca n't wait and raid their savings from time to time will fail . It also means sticking with the chosen investments rather than switching them around every time the market turns negative . <p> Being able to fast does not mean starving . It means saying no to instant gratification . It means saying no to easy credit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It means separating present wants from future needs . It also means controlling desires and being more immune to advertising . It means waiting an hour to get tap water for free rather than buying a $2 water bottle . <p> Not opposing the goal means that counterproductive actions should be curbed . It makes little sense to save on pennies if dollars are used on splurges . It means having a spouse with the same values . Frugal efforts are quickly ruined by a spendthrift spouse . Not opposing the goal is making every effort count towards saving more money rather than spending more money . <p> Excellent Post . As a Muslim I fast during Ramadan and it definitely clears the mind the helps to concentrate on your goals which really helps , I find I can do twice as much in the allotted time . I also agree that having a spendthrift partner can slow you down , I guess we all have to try extra hard to find a frugal partner . Thanks for the insights Jacob .

I subsequently read many more of Hesses books and did a fair amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing . <p> As I recall , Hesse felt a pull between the intellectual life and the commercial life .

We are generally intellectual , since we 've thought about the social structures that bind us and the alternatives ; many are most certainly in the commercial stages , since these are the people who can save 80% of their income ; and many of us seek more simplistic , sustainable lives . <p> Until I read your post , I do n't  think I 've connected how reading Siddhartha influenced my desire to " drop out " one day .

Aluminum is key here . <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> God , how I love this blog ! <p> Marcy , your bf is right-you can remove rust through electrolysis . <p> here 's my ( imperfect ) understanding of how it works : <p> Basically you put an iron bar in a vat of water with an electrolyte ( say , baking soda ) and attach either the negative or the positive current to the iron bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rusty part is facing the iron bar . Apply electicity . <p> The rust will give up its oxygen atoms and revert to iron/steel , and the iron/steel bar will sacrifice its Fe ( iron ) atoms to the oxygen that gets released in the water , becoming rusty . <p> While this happens , hydrogen gas is produced which is highly flammable . So this should only be done outside . ( remember the Hindenburg ? You do n't  want hydrogen gas building up in an enclosed environment . <p> If you 're planning on doing this I hold myself blameless . Research it FULLY before trying ! <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> Here is how rust works : <p> Iron oxide ( FeO3 ( the most common form of rust ! ) is larger in volume than a straight molecule of iron . So when an atom of iron combines with oxygen to form FeO3 , the molecule " sticks out " from the surrounding surface , creating space for more oxygen to penetrate to the unrusted metal . As the next atom or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider and deeper into the material . <p> This is why rust is so destructive to iron and steel . It will keep going and going until it eats right through . this is not the case with oxides like aluminum oxide , which is basically the same size as an aluminum atom ( the oxygen atoms " fit in " to the aluminum atom in a way that does n't  increase its volume ) and forms a very thin , one to several atoms thick layer on the surface of the aluminum which actually " seals " the surface of the aluminum and prevents further oxidation . Anodized aluminum is aluminum that is electrolytically treated to make an extra thick layer of aluminum oxide that makes the aluminum extra resistant to further corrosion ( say , from acidic foods in a pan ) and also allows certain colors to be produced for aesthetic effect . <p> Back to normal rust now . <p> If you are going to treat rust , you should get rid of it all because any that remains will create openings in the metal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phosphoric acid ) , which literally dissolves rust , followed by an antirust primer . <p> Jacob , even though you 've scraped the rust off with the aluminum , the underlying metal will be vulnerable . Brush a rust reformer ( a substance that reacts with rust to form a nonreactive , stable compound ) or ( if you 're conifident you 've revmoved all the rust ) RustOleum primer onto the metal surface to protect it a lot more , then paint it ( say , black enamel ) to seal the surface from oxygen and H2O and salt penetration if you want longer lasting protection than merely cleaning the rust off . <p> You want to connect the iron bar to the positive terminal . The positive side gets " crapped up " with rust . Washing soda is better than baking soda , but they both work . I 've used this method to clean intricate parts which I could n't scrub with the method above . Its much slower though . <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> WD40 stands for Water Displacement formula 40 and displaced water from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something causes this ) . <p> If you get something metal wet and you do n't  want it to rust you can spray it with WD40 and that will keep the water off the surface of the metal and prevent rust . <p> Also , Boeshield ( developed by Boeing for their planes ) does a good job and is waxy so lasts longer than WD40. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Okay , I did n't  have the primer parts covered . <p> Cody said , <p> Hey I found a really old rusty revolver .

Unfortunately , very many did n't  and they are still struggling unloading stuff they paid for with money they did n't  have and subsequently never got to earn . Now they find themselves " unwinding " the trade they made , possibly obliviously , on their lifestyle . <p> Actually the time was several months ago , but since the recession has not been officially declared there is time to prepare . You can still make a difference in your life at this point by adopting a few of these measures . <p> Establish a cash position . During a recession cash is king . The reason is that credit is often harder to obtain . Also with uncertain future prospects the certitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an emergency fund . I would not go that far . For instance , you could use the cash in the " emergency " that a stock goes on sale . In general , you should not count on being able to sell some other stock to fund the purchase because the other stock is probably on sale too . Cash can also be used to buy things from people and companies that need money now. - Finally , cash can be used to pay for living expenses without sending you into a spiral of debt that is hard to get out of . The coming years are when the next real estate fortunes will be made . <p> Develop alternative income streams . Having just one albeit impressively large income stream is a very risky position to be in . This means the middle class . Recessions rarely cause pain to the wealthy and the poor . For the middle class losing the job means losing everything while being left with all the liabilities .

If you are laid off you are effectively paying yourself if you are able to boil an egg rather than heading down to the restaurant . Tax free too . <p> Downsize . Convert unwanted stuff into cash before everybody else starts doing it . Get a cheaper place before everybody else starts doing it . If the economy crashes hard you might even be able to buy it back at a discount . Do n't  start selling at the moment you lose your job . Most likely a lot of other people will lose their job at the same time . Equally likely they will all think of selling their stock of jet skies and other garage filler while looking for a cheaper place to live at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest buy now , pay in 2009 deals .

Of course normal retirement plans use savings rates less than 20% and depend on something called the " magic of compound interest " . Now there is nothing magic about compound interest , which is simply exponential growth , but there certainly is a great deal of magic associated with determining the input parameters of investment returns and inflation . These input parameters , particularly when extrapolated over large time intervals ( anything more than 10 years ) , crucially determine the end results . <p> Now this kind of magic is good in theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Capital assets ( aka tools , incidentally , you should really click on that link and read that post if you have not done so already ) will give superior returns if but only if the assets are purchased at a good price and only if the assets actually improve efficiency .

How do you know ? If the P/E of the index is higher than 18 , 1.5 times the generational average , you definitely are ! Currently , the value is around 17 which corresponds to an earnings yield of 5.8% . This means that future returns are not going to be as impressive as historical returns .

Strong post , ERE ! <p> I could n't agree more . The more you save , the more you can invest . And the more you invest for the long term , the greater is your return . Whether it be through tax savings or the magical compound interest . Thrift is very important to building great fortunes , especially for normal middle class people . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> The logic in this post leaves me confused . Most people can not simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points during their career , and still expect to return to their career as if nothing had happened . <p> Yes , people can take sabbaticals here and there , but most employers are n't  willing to tolerate extended leaves of absence in their employees . If you 're self-employed , the problem is compounded , since taking a year " off " from your business is likely to cause your profits to vanish in that year . <p> The only conclusion I have is that the above calculations assume you 're talking about saving for retirement . Assuming a 30-year-long retirement at age 65 , one would have to save 50% of your income for a 30-year-long career just to manage to " retire " . Somehow , the math does n't  seem to add up . <p> That said , I take your point that reducing expenses and increasing savings ( two things that are always under your control ) allow financial freedom at an earlier point in time . <p> I like the model and logic behind the thinking . From my vantage point for every year I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other activity ( utility of working verus enjoyment I will take the later ) and in fact bring back in real terms one year of retirement age from my target if I save 50 percent of my income . Makes total sense to me as well as working on a rate of return that is in the mid single digits over time to be converserative with my math and lifestyle and realistic with my ability to generate a real economic return . <p> So , for me each year I save 50% of my gross income , I can substract one year from 62 years of age as my new retirement point given similiar lifestyle . <p> Very thoughtful post and thank you for sharing . <p> Jason said , <p> Hi , Jacob , what the heck does " ( 1.5 generational average , you definitely are ! Currently , the value is around 17 which corresponds to an earnings yield of 5.8% . This means that future returns are not going to be as impressive as historical returns ) " mean ? ? ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have corrected it in the text now . <p> Were treating our retirement plan as a two phased approach : PHASE 1 the part from 65 onward which will be subsidized by a small pension plus goverment benefits ( a reasonable expectation here in Canada ) . Weve done the calculations of our income requirements from 65 onward and the amount of savings well need in addition to the pension and government funds and that has been saved up . Phase one is done . We know we can retire comfortably at 65 . <p> PHASE 2 how far ahead of 65 can we retire . This is a little trickier . We are madly wacking down the mortgage and socking away retirement funds in various accounts/plans . Similar to your calculations , I see every $X saved for retirement as another month sooner I can stop working . Having a very clear idea of what our expenses are means I know precicely what I need to save for the months/years of retirement before the pension/govt funds kick in . At this point were planning to retire in Dec @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date moves a month closer . <p> The agravating thing for me is our house . Yes were madly paying off the mortgage as quickly as possible to reduce our monthly expenses . On the other hand now I see it as a giant albatross . At the moment there is about $400k of equity in it . My DH has no interest in moving from this house until he s carried out in a pine box . To him the equity is irelevant . I however see it as the key to retiring tomorrow if we wanted . I 'd be prefectly happy renting a small apartment and giving up 3000sqft house on 3acres in the woods . Yes its lovely . I 've enjoyed it for 20+ years but now Ive done a complete 180 on what 's important in my life and its no longer living in our " dream home " . Problem is were married and need to come to some consensus . We built this house with our own 4 hands and planned to live here forever . Back in my early 20s I was all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the house . My change of heart has even caused family and friends to ask if I 'm all right . After years designing , building and decorating I can see how my " sudden " willingness to chuck it all and downsize would seem bizare . <p> Hopefully well figure out a compromise , but in the meantime I see no harm in killing the mortgage as quickly as possible . It either moves up our retirement date by getting us to a much lower level of monthly expenses , or it increases the equity for when we sell . <p> My strategy is to max out my 403B , IRA and Roth IRA . I try to do this on a regular monthly basis through a payroll deduction . That way I am using dollar cost averaging into the market . I recognize that I can not control or forecast inflation or future return . That is one of the reasons I max out my investments savings for retirement . <p> That 's interesting . So to extend it out 90 years and say I start working at 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would need to have a saving rate of ( 70-20 ) /70 = 71% . That 's pretty high . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @retirebyforty The good news is that you only need to acquire around 30 years of savings . Then interest rates will take of the rest . So you only need to extend it to 50 , so ( 50-20 ) /50 = 60% . <p> Carol@inthetrenches said , <p> So simple and basic yet easy to get side tracked with all the things that we probably do n't  need but seem catch our attention . <p> deegee said , <p> Interesting post , Jacob . But how would you factor into a savings rate inflows such as company matching dollars for a 401(k) or additional shares of company stock in a similar savings plan which grow over time ? I had lots of both of these , especially the latter , which did more for me to be able to retire 2 years ago at age 45 than my personal savings rate of after-tax dollars which was around 40% for my working years . <p> shaun said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12x historical PE ? From most sources Ive read ( most recently from Yale prof Shiller ) , its 15x ? <p> I think the formulas presented here are a little simplistic . it is not just the percentage you save . and let 's be realistic- who can save that much anymore ? the cost of health insurance is ridiculous as well as medical bills . more important is the instruments used in saving . i diversify with mutual funds and long term annuinities that give at least a 4 percent return annually . very conservative but it fits my personality . <p> seventhgirl said , <p> This really puts it simply . If anything , it is useful for lighting a fire under me to increase my savings . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @shaun I believe Shiller uses trailing ten years . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @terry Youre in the company of people who actually do save that much . For those working for decades , the instruments do matter . <p> Monkey retired at 56 , and he saved about 25% of his income . This roughly squares with EREs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he also seems to be saving more than he had <p> If you 'd like to see how many years it will take to retire for your savings rate , check out Mr Money Mustaches The Shockingly Simple Math Behind Early Retirement or Jacob of Early Retirement Extremes article on years to retirement vs savings rate . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287739 @2287739/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Modern money is a tool to distribute future resources based on social conventions . Modern money is essentially a promise that one may access resources in the future . In this money acts to distribute resources between humans . It is a social-technological instrument that connects the way we behave socially with the world we have created . It determines who gets the food we grow , it determines who gets the stuff we make , and it determines who gets to live in the homes we build . <p> Consider how special money is in this regard . If a friend of mine promises to help me me out next week , I will trust him to do so because he is my friend . I have faith in him . Money is very different from this . Money allows me to trust anyonestrangersas long as I trust the money ; that I trust that he trusts that he can use the money to trade it in a way I just did . <p> The current recession is simply an emergent decision that perhaps people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to borrow money on their homes ) simply because someone may be able to pay more for their house in the future under " the greater fool " -theory . What happened was that a large group of people ( home owners , especially sub-prime home buyers ) had been trusted with a future ability to provide such resources ( based on their homes ) but then it turned out they could n't . In other words , there 's a loss of trust . <p> What 's important to realize is that the economy is not lost . <p> However , the economy is often confused with its metric . The real economy is the factories . The metric is an accounting scheme measuring the money being used by those factories . Unfortunately , humans are prone to blindness when it comes to forgetting the difference between their " measure " and what they 're actually measuring . It is very easy to make grave mistakes because people are " wearing the wrong glasses " . <p> Of course some factories were built based on speculation of future productivity . Lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . This is obviously not the case , but they did create money . This part of the economy is truly being destroyed in the technologicalnatural way : Rusting machines and empty offices . <p> It is likely that substantial parts of our economy , that is , the factories , not the money flows , actually produce nothing of value . They just exist to extract money , that is , trust , from the rest of the economy . <p> As a corollary , it is also important to realize that since we base our financial independence on peoples trust and more importantly future trust in our money , we are liable to this trust being broken . <p> From that perspective , it is desirable that ones values be as real as possible . In particular , modern money is typically based on " the full faith " of governments , since governments regulate the money supply . Money could however also be based on the trust of rich merchants as was the case in Europe several hundred years ago when governments were weak or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare items like gold , pearls , seashells or round rocks . <p> There are two conclusions from this . You can either accumulate technological wealth , that is , real stuff , such as home , garden , farm land , tools , which will provide you with a good quality of life . Alternatively , you can accumulate social wealth , that is , either a network of people you trust . Or you can accumulate socialtechnological wealth , namely units of whatever money system everybody else will trust in the future . <h> 8 users responded in " Money in the context of social convention " <p> @Britz Thanks , I was beginning to suspect that nobody was reading it = <p> shawn said , <p> I assume you took a social " technological wealth and moving towards a technological wealth ? <p> Robert Muir said , <p> Jacobs all over that tech-wealth !

@@42287742 @2287742/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I am not really a big fan of lists of tips of " small actionable steps " . While fun , at least as long as they 're short , I do n't  find such lists very helpful(*) , mostly because they either list things I 'm already doing ( turn the light off hen you leave the room ) or things that do not apply ( clip coupons ) . The tips I enjoy the most are the " maybe you should look into this " -type of tips . Pointers that would require some research on my part but which I would not otherwise have thought of myself in a million years or maybe two or three years anyway = . <p> ( * ) I am well aware that for people just jumping into the subject of personal finance such lists can be immensely motivating and empowering and so they are very useful at the transition/recruitment stage . However , once one sees the principles behind the lists , they become less useful and almost trivial . <p> With that caveat in mind , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal finance is much too restricted to consider discussing retiring early or gaining any kind of financial freedom ; it will mostly tell you how to gain promotions , set up retirement plans , pay down mortgages and car loans , and get benefits and other things that keep people bound to their jobs . To understand how you fit into the larger scheme , read books on economics ( like McConnell and Brue ) and ecology ( like Richard Brewer ) and try to apply the ideas to your own life . <p> Everything you need to know about functional minimalism can be learned from good boat keeping for passage making and blue ocean cruising . Some of these people cruise the world on their own ship for down to $6000 a year . <p> Become a strategist . It is much more important to do the right things compared to doing things right . Normally the suggestions are to read Sun Tzu or Musashi , but I think you will be way better off with a few textbooks on operations management . Pay particular attention to kaizen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the systems approach ) , and total quality management . <p> Do at least one major thing different from everybody else ( for instance , I do n't  have a drivers license ) . If you are going to retire 20 years before everybody else , you might as well get used to being different . Always leave your comfort zone . Remember : Comfort is nothing compared to freedom ( at least for a small percentile anyway = ) . <p> Find a neutral hobby and become skilled enough at it to make money on it ( you need to put in about 1000 hours before that happens ) . Everything I 've made money on after retiring from my career started as hobbies . It does not matter if you are not earning a lot or nothing at all in the beginning . The important thing is that is has a reasonable chance to make you something whether it is money or connections . For instance , jet skiing is disqualified but knitting is in . <p> PS : Sorry for being a bad blogger lately .

I have a Danish drivers license , good until 2045 ( the test is bloody hard over there so once you got in , you do n't  have to do it again ) , and it works in the rest of the world as long as I 'm not a resident , so technically , the only place I cant drive is California . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a license thus far ( I get rides for long distances , but I do n't  go anywhere very often ) . Living in an RV this makes no rational sense at all other than the fact that even if I got the license , I probably would n't be driving anyway and thus lose whatever routine I may build up . So DW drives the RV and the propane fill up is like 2 miles away .

If regulators hassle me , I can move my home to another state . I can even move it to rent free locations ( for example , national parks ) . I consider a home that is anchored to a fixed location somewhat of a liability . That said , some feel differently and there 's certainly some geoarbitrage going on ; others value a house with a foundation where they can live in the same place for 40 years . I just prefer to live in a place where I speak the language fluently and where I somewhat fit in with the local culture and Silicon Valley works for me ; also I prefer to move around every few years . <p> Diane said , <p> Thanks for giving me an excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually got one person begging me to teach a class .

My only real luck in that was fluking my way into selling it on to the right person at the right time for more than I had put into it which for a boat is a hard thing to do ! <p> I remember my father before when he was in his early 40 ? s , he already planned about his retirement . He had some investments , he looked for an income property that when the time he will retires he will have some passive income .

Actually , if me outsourcing my bookcover can be considered commissioning art , and if blogging is poetry ( ahem ! ) we enjoy exactly the same things .

More accurately , the marginal utility of more money is low . Its been like that for a while . Even while I was working , money quickly developed into simply a way of keeping score . Its a natural consequence of spending far less than the pay . <p> Lately , I have realized that I am getting old . I 'm in my mid thirties . Double that and I 'll be in my seventies . To me 70 is somewhat old . So I have as much time going back to 0 as I do going up to 70 and I do n't  feel like I have lived a particularly long time . The marginal utility of more time is high ! <p> Spending very precious time to make more money than needed is thus uneconomical .

I 'd say 33x although mine is presently higher . It also depends on when you retire relative to market performance . If you retire at a market peak , it needs to be higher than if relying on it at a market low .

As jaqjolie points out , it is more like the antidote book to " You too should be rich " books . It appeals on many many layers The rich on the title is a misnomer .. Felix wants to imply Rich in the sense of " the abundance of valuable resources or material possessions or the control of such assets " . Not JUST from a " net worth " point of view . <p> My suggestion to you .

I told my wife that I believe its because of the internet . <p> Information is no longer stuck in a box . Readers are no longer willing to accept the same " best seller " philosophy , because the perspectives on subjects have opened up so much . Retirement , religion , philosophy , and entrepreneurship are just a few areas Ive noticed a new wave of " different thinking " . <p> The internet has allowed people to find the perspectives ( information ) that fit comfortably with their values ; I believe the book industry is opening up to this idea as well . <p> /just a thought <p> Sim said , <p> The amount an individual feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how and where you would like to live . I was recently looking into retirement overseas and realized what I would need to retire in Malaysia is substantial less than what I need in the US . <p> I just wrote about Can Money Buy Happiness ? .

That would make me ancient this year 38 . LOL . <p> Mike said , <p> I have a question for the Jacob &amp; the wonderful community here I understand the retirement net worth goal of 25-33 times your projected annual expenses . What I need to figure is how to factor in my mortgage payment which will be with me for another 10 years or so , but will then go away . How does one factor in a temporary annual expense like this when determining the net worth goal for retirement . Appreciate the help ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum of money to pay for the mortgage . 10x yearly mortgage payment is overkill if your money is invested one way or another ( ROI ) . For the exact amount , use a spreadsheet . <p> Interesting concept . It all boils down to financial freedom and how much expense you have . Societies places more popularity among people who have greater expenses which is why freedom is becoming so hard for middle class people . Until there is a paradigm shift its going to be hard to change . <p> leeholsen said , <p> i second the how much money do you really need sentiment . although i 'm FI now , i 'm still about 3 yrs away from having the money to retire with a nice house on the lake . however , last monday ; i was on vacation and received over 75 work emails in 6 hours at which point i turned my phone off and drifted between reading a book and sleeping ; which absolutely bliss compared to my normal workday of nonstop putting out fires that follows me home and on vacation sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading and sleeping everyday for a nice lakehouse. i still ca n't come up with one . <p> Andre900 said , <p> I recently reduced my work week from 40 hours per week to 32 hours by taking every Friday off ; a 20% reduction in work hours as well as salary , but I retain full-time benefits .

Do you ever think about this and specifically why successful people often choose to continue to work ? <p> 2 . If you retire in your 30s and there is a severe market downturn , high inflation or other possible unexpected issues , are you not worried that your savings will not be able to support you going forward ? I know you can " always go back to work " , but if you have n't worked for 10-15 yearsthat is n't necessarily attractive to potential employers . My question is , someone retired with " modest " savings in their 30s may be okay today , but how do you not worry about the future ? 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287753 @2287753/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> The two prevalent numbers for the middle class are net worth and credit score . These numbers are , however , not very useful if you wish to retire very early . Credit score measures your ability to take on debt and be obligated to work for others , and net worth says very little about how well your money is actually working for you . For instance , I did not start a credit history until 2006 and I did not start a tax-advantaged retirement plan until 2007 . Both happened after I got financially independent . <p> To properly evaluate an early retirement approach e.g. an approach that does not involve 30 years of working and paying off bills , other numbers must be optimized . <p> The first number is the savings power . Here x is your savings rate . For standardization , it is easiest if x is your after-tax rate . The lower Y is , the better . Numbers below 15 are pretty good . Extreme numbers are single digit . A high savings power eventually establishes a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings power . <p> The second number is current ratio . <p> Current assets are the liquidation value of all your assets . It is the value of your cash + the market value of your securities + the market value of your retirement plans ( minus early withdrawal penalty ) + anything else you will be able to sell within a year . Current liabilities are any kind of expenses you will incur within the next year such as cost of living , debt repayment , interest payments , and so on . <p> If you have a double digit Current Ratio you are on your way to early retirement . If you are still in the single digits , you are still looking to work for at a decade or more . Early retirement becomes a possibility once the current ratio exceeds 25 . <p> The third and last number is cash flow . Cash flow becomes important once the current ratio is satisfied . Fortunately , there are many financial instruments that can easily be used to generate cash . Dividend yielding stocks is my favorite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is REITs or simply owning land directly . <p> It may be wise to start setting up your cash flow some time prior to early retirement , both to get a proof of concept , but also to avoid discontinuously rearranging your assets which would result in capital gains taxes , etc . <p> But you say numbers that are lower than 15 are good ? It seems like as savings rate increases , so does Y. What am I missing ? 10151 @qwx420151 <p> I do n't  think I understand these numbers . Does savings rate equal savings amount divided by earnings ? So if I save $500 out of $2500 ( after taxes ) each month , then my x = .2 ? <p> And if so , my Y would be 5/.8 = 6.25 ? That sounds much more extreme than I expected . Especially since I will be working 30 years before I retire . <p> Second , what if my current liabilities are zero ? Then the second equation means nothing . <p> I liked your net worth divided by expenses ratio better . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading , especially the second equation . Right now my current ratio is 3 , but in 4 years it will likely be " infinity . " It actually will probably go down before it goes up , even though I 'm getting closer to the goal . <p> The 1st equation basically means you should be saving 30-40% of your after tax salary , which I am doing . <p> catfishalex said , <p> I do n't  understand . My savings rate is 70% of my after tax money , yet that yields a y of 58.3 much higher than the above comment , even though she saves 20% . Huh ? ? ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> ARGH I messed up . Its corrected now . <p> This only works for high values of x . For complete formulae , we need to use PV and FV equations . These reduce to the above for an interest rate of 0% . <p> How do you guys get your current liabilities to go to zero ? Do you have zero expenses ? If so I 'd very much like to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think " Current Liabilities " is misleading and implies total debt , and hence could yield infinity . " Yearly Expenses " would be more accurate . Basically you are saying that retirement becomes possible with a 4% and lower withdrawal rate . <p> Savings power is a bit more abstract , but it is the total number of years of savings for retirement required if you earn 0% interest . Increasing your savings rate helps you by reducing the total amount you need to save ( expressed in the numerator ) and by saving in larger chunks ( expressed in the denominator ) . <p> The numbers are scary for a typical savings rate of 10% . Extreme early retirement does n't  rely on compound interest , but by reducing expenses . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @seafire I think you are right wrt eq . 2 . Technically expenses are not liabilities . I have just trained myself to seem them that way . I used 4% just to have some reasonable scaling in the equations . I have seen people base their early retirement on 10+% returns . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do a version 2 of this post , I 'll be sure to implement your suggestions . <p> It is actually scary to see that many people basing their retirement on compound interest ( I find it particularly frightening that they refer to it as magic implying that they do n't  have a natural feel for exponential functions , like at all ) . If we introduce inflation and make the investment period " unlucky " ( but not unusual ) , like say 1963 to 1979 , ( or 1998-2008 ) market returns would be zero . Introducing inflation , there are more periods with essentially zero return . I think people ought to stop assuming that " other people " will do the work for them ( even though it is nice ) . <p> I just found your site and am enjoying reading your posts . One comment about credit score I used to say that it had no value to me , as I do n't  intend to take on any new debt . However , in the past couple of years , Ive seen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calculating insurance premiums . Fortunately , my score is good , but I still thought that was rather sneaky. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @retiredat47 thanks for the heads up ! I started a credit history about two years ago , because I figured why not ! ( And I was getting of documenting my existence with photocopies of SSN cards , etc. for everything ) . <p> According to http : **36;949;TOOLONG my score is currently between 715 and 765 . I have no idea how accurate that is as I am not paying $20 to get a " real " score . If there is anyone reading this who actually know their score , maybe they can double check the accuracy of the link above . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Creditkarma.com also gives you a free score if you subject yourself to some marketing offers ( similar to how Mint.com makes money ) . It is pretty accurate in my experience . <p> I am a little confused how is Savings Power related to the other formula ? <p> And for example if I save 80% I could substitute such Y @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( correct ? ) now what ? <p> How close am I to early retirement with that ? <p> Tom said , <p> This savings power function is nice but it needs a lot of explanation . Where do you get the 25 from ? I might have a savings rate of 50% but I think there 's a lot more to this equation than you are explaining here and you have no references to any justification . <p> Not to be rude , but to the newcomer , this looks like you pulled some numbers our of thin air ( to be polite ) and I have nothing to rely on to understand the validity of your statements . I am not one to go on blind faith . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Tom The 25 is the inverse of the standard 4% withdrawal rate . The equation then gives the number of years it takes ( without interest ) to reach financial independence with a 4% withdrawal rate . <p> tallison said , <p> This is close but I think there 's an additional consideration in your numbers . When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cash flow based on the 4% withdrawal rate you are by-passing the 15-18% net taxable income that needs to be considered for anyone who has an income greater than the taxable minimum . This is a footnote , but if you are checking your assets to liabilities to get a 25 ratio , you have to factor in the taxes or you 'll end up 15-17% off . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287759 @2287759/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I was once interviewed for a thesis project where I had to explain my ideas about ERE , social relevance , general adoption , etc . At one point during the interview after having explained something about price-behavior , the interviewer asked me the following question : <p> " So do you believe that most people are dumb ? " <p> Okay , so I did n't  have a ready answer for this and so my answer was something to the effect of " Let me get back to you on that " , which I subsequently did . <p> First , we need to understand the question though . <p> Dumb essentially means unintelligent . <p> I can answer this easily . No I do n't  believe that people are unintelligentor at least , we can say that people vary widely in their level of intelligence and follow a bell shaped distribution with an average of 100 . <p> The question could also be " Do you believe most people act unintelligently ? " <p> I actually used to believe this until I was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy to me was the result of unintelligent reasoning . Naive as I was , it was the only explanation I could come up with . <p> However , I do n't  believe this anymore either . I actually believe that people act fairly intelligently on what they know . <p> The problem as I see it know is that " most people actually do n't  know that much " . <p> In other words , if the interview question had been : <p> " So do you believe most people are ignorant ? " <p> My answer would be YES ! I do indeed believe that . <p> Let 's for arguments sake ( to prevent stupid arguments in the comments ) define what being ignorant means . It means lacking knowledge . It does n't  mean a lack of intelligence . A person can be very smart ( intelligent ) and yet be very ignorant at the same time . Obviously someone can also be unintelligent ( also called stupid ) and ignorant at the same time . <p> The high level of specialization in an industrialized mass production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance . In its most extreme case , a person only knows how to push a level on a specific post on a conveyer belt . He is ignorant of all other aspects of what the factory does . He does not need to know and so in many cases he does n't  . Conversely , if a person is generally in charge of more things , such as a farmer or a craftsman , he is less ignorant . <p> For the purposes of the this essay I am mostly concerned with the personal level of ignorance . Obviously , one of the reasons that specialization works is that if every person knows everything there is to know about a very tiny part of something and everybody concentrates on a different part , then the combined amount of knowledge is larger than what any one person could understand . <p> ( This leaves out the connections between the parts . This is why most engineering aims to reduce the degrees of freedom . Failing that , it is also why the modern world is continuously surprised by unintended consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing practically everything about practically nothing also means knowing practically nothing about practically everything . This is why on the whole most people today are more ignorant today than they were a few generations ago when everybody with an education knew something about most thingsa happy medium . <p> Many teachers lament the fact that many students restrict their accumulation of knowledge to what will be on the test . Intentionally seeking " test-only information " is not the foundation of knowledge . Knowledge includes an understand of which pieces of information are important and which pieces are not . If whether something " is going to be on the test " is used to qualify a piece of information , a student will gain no knowledge . Just a collection of topical information . In such tragic cases , students do n't  care how results are arrived at , they just want the " result factoid " so they can regurgitate it come test time . <p> Being unable to evaluate information also means that the person is unable to understand the information . Without understanding , information has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a large collection of unconnected factoids . A person without knowledge has no principles with which to organize his information . Such a person will be unable to think about his information(*) . I am taking things to their extreme logical conclusion . Realistically , everybody with such an attitude will still think a little , it just wont be very much . In many cases it will even be compartmentalized , e.g. a person will be able to think critically about their specialization but they will be unable to do so outside their specializationa doctor can think critically about patient diseases , but will not think critically about a mortgage contract . <p> ( * ) A good test to see if you really understand something is if you 're able to explain it in at least 3 different ways . If you can only explain it in one way , you probably do n't  really understand it , especially not if you one-way is the same as that of the text book . <p> This means that students are not taught to think critically . Critical thinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one in ten has the talents to think critically without being taught how . However , of course , the purpose of the school system which serves as an extension of the industrial system is not really interested in critical thinkers . It is mostly interested in conformity . And teaching and testing information rather than knowledge and principles results in conformity . Future critical thinkers get a much different education in very expensive schools and from their parents . The rest of us go through the standard educational system . <p> Now , combining postmodernism with widespread ignorance has some unfortunate consequences . <p> Postmodernism is essentially the philosophical position that there 's more than just one way to see the world . Different cultures will see different things different ways . Perspectives are relative , not absolute , and in particular , a persons perspective depends on what their interests are . In particular , this means that the dominant perspective is not necessarily objective in contrast to what had previously been believed . It can in fact be highly subjective . <p> Of course this resulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " it does n't  matter what 's true as long as I feel its true " . <p> Specifically , while people used to believe that everybody was entitled to their own opinion ( a consequence of democracy , enlightenment , and first amendment stuff ) , thanks to postmodernism , people also now believe that they are entitled to their own facts . <p> That has resulted in a major cluster fuck in the intellectual development of the world . <p> Often all postmodernists are thought to be similar , but there are actually at least four different kinds <p> People who are aware of postmodern theory but unaware of reality . These are often found hidden in the humanities department where they write long reviews and critiques of other peoples reviews and critiques trying to understand what particular " narrative " a given " author " may hold . These people care little for reality ( which you do n't  need to when you got tenure and only leave the building to go wine tasting on some nudity resort ) and thus they think of reality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deep down they probably do realize that objective reality is not some " subjective narrative " but that reality is in fact real . Its just that they are never really challenged in this department because most other people think that their reviews and critiques are irrelevant . We can for arguments sake call these people " humanists " or " college professors " . <p> ( Actually they were challenged to a fight from the science department and suffered a very embarrassing defeat . Google the " Sokal hoax " or the " Sokal affair " . ) <p> People who are aware of postmodern theory and aware of reality . We can call these people scientists . These people understand that if you hit yourself on your head with a hammer it is not the " narrative " that hurts . Its the friggin hammer hitting your head . Scientists understand that " science " is actually a narrative , but unlike the humanists they also understand that " science " is a special narrative , namely the one that describes reality the best . They also understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ones special interest . It may be used to further someones special interest , but the science itself ( usually cast in mathematical equations describing the relations because measurable quantities ) just is . <p> People who are not aware of postmodern theory but is aware of reality . We can call them plumbers , engineers , accountants , etc . These people take the science , say an equation that describes the breaking point of an i-beam and then they use this to build a bridge . They may not care about the particular assumptions that went into the calculation that determined the breaking point . Consequentially their bridges sometimes collapse . And sometimes their financial systems collapse because while they had their equations and used them well , they did not really understand the limitations . <p> People who are not aware of postmodern theory and not aware of reality . We call these ignoramuses or simply ignorant . This group do not understand the point of postmodern theory ( namely realizing that viewpoints are swayed by personal interests ) but have instead used the wrong conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that facts can be selectively chosen . Furthermore they are ignorant . This makes it particular easy to chose facts as not many are known . Ignorance is a bliss . What you do n't  know , you ca n't regret . Arguments proceed unscientifically by first finding a position of their particular interest and then finding the facts that support it while ignoring facts that do n't  support the position . This essentially makes them idiots ( someone who acts in a significantly counterproductive way , e.g. I believe in multiplication , but I do n't  believe that 4*4=16 ) because obviously you ca n't pick and choose between facts according to convenience . Examples include people who do n't  believe in evolution ( even as they believe in biology , because evolution follows from applying the laws of biology ) and people who do n't  believe in climate change ( even as they believe in physics , because climate change follows from applying the laws of physics to climate ) . <p> So I believe that many people are ignorant ( Hey , I 'm ignorant when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the joys of following retirement from physics is realizing just how few real skills I have . There 's so much to learn . ) . <p> Ignorance makes it hard to communicate some of the principles of ERE . <p> Consider how the different groups above would respond . <p> Humanists would understand that someone can retire extremely early though they cant quite see how . Here you get the typical " This may work for you , but I cant see how it would work for me " comment . If they are willing to learn , it is feasible to teach them . However , teaching is work . You cant just say they they " need sufficient assets to reach a safe withdrawal rate of 3% that supports their expenses " because they do n't  now what " assets " , " safe " , " withdrawal rate " , and " 3% " actually means . Theirs is a technical problem . <p> Scientists are easy . They think critically and they know things already . This is also why there are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forums . Not only can the sentence above be used , it would be understood and considered critically . <p> Engineers are tricky . They understand the words and the concepts but they cant see how this is a valid solution . To stay within the personal finance sphere , only career-consumerism is a viable model for society . This group will say " we have a duty to work " , " if everybody did it , society would collapse " , " I want to accomplish something with my life so I 'll keep working " , " I 'd rather work more so I have enough to spend " , and " According to my calculations , nobody can be comfortable on less than $20,000/person/year " . Theirs is not a technical problem but a question of thinking outside their well-established framework . <p> Ignoramuses are the hardest to deal with . Not only do they not understand practical applications of basic finance like " if you put $100 in the bank at 5% interest for a year , you get $5 in interest " ( although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , they are only capable of restating results theyve heard somewhere else such as " You need a million dollars to retire " and " You should spend 30% of your income on your mortgage " . This group is practically beyond reachor at least I do n't  know how to reach them . They do n't  use reason to reach a conclusionand reason is the only way I know . They have a pre-existing opinion and then they google for facts to support that opinion(*) . They do n't  think critically and they lack knowledge . ( Ill leave it as an exercise to consider examples of what constitutes idiotic behavior here . Hint : maxed out credit cards . ) <p> ( * ) And this , I bet , is how 90% of all college level essays are written . <p> So yes , I do n't  believe people are dumb , but I do believe that most are ignorant when it comes to knowledge about the world and the ability to ask critical questions outside their specialization . Not all , but most . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ignorant of something to some degree . What I mean is that most people are too ignorant of the world they inhabit to actually make informed judgments about it . <h> 59 users responded in " Musings on postmodernism , ignorance , and my answer to " Do you really believe people are dumb ?

Eep ! - Actually , its a really interesting read though I would argue that there <p> Cru said , <p> I think you 're partial to group #2 and cut them some slack in your assessment . <p> leeholsen said , <p> i do n't  believe people are stupid , i believe life makes distractions and interruptions that are so constant ; it stops many from getting the most they could out of life . for instance , say you 're a 20 year old guy meeting with a financial counselor and he lays out exactly what you need to do to retire at 50 and youve even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that financial guy still got you out of the rat race and back to being a professional trumpet player , something you always wanted since high school band . well , by the time you get home that day , you 've had a major project go bad and one of the kids has a game you have to make ; you completely forget everything that financial guy told you by friday and never pursue it further . there 's distractions like that throughout life and its why so many barely get more out of life than living it imo . <p> As someone who used to be an ignoramus I would just say keep putting info out . Sooner or later ( later in my case ) the world will give that cold slap in the face and they will look for a alternate way . Maybe not all , but some of us . <p> thanks 10149 @qwx420149 <p> I enjoyed this post . <p> The whole engineer vs scientist argument is annoying and more tribal thinking in my opinion than anything .

I enjoy understanding the problem and solutions more than the execution of them which I would rather hand off to someone else to move on to the next problem that needs understanding . I think many engineers fit Jacobs stereotype just as many scientists do n't  think critically about practical issues . Also I think we typically use the word scientist incorrectly . Science is not a profession or field of study . It is a process of gaining knowledge by making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  match the data . In this sense anyone can be a scientist and not every biologist or physicist is a scientist ( if they do n't  really get the process ) . Even those studying literature can be scientists if they follow the process . <p> Dynamic88 said , <p> If ignorant means lacking knowledge ( and I agree with the definition ) then the problem has been getting worse for a couple thousand years , and will continue to get worse , at a faster rate . As human knowledge grows ( seemingly exponentially ) we are all becoming more ignorant without even trying . There neednt be anything willful about ignorance , its our natural state , and no mater how hard we try , our ignorance is growing at the same time others knowledge is growing . <p> We are all ignorant about a great many things . A person could perhaps master a handful of subjects in a lifetime , if all spare time were devoted to learning that handful of subjects . Even then , one would be ignorant of many things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Issac Newton knew , you could n't get a bachelors degree in physics , much less an advanced degree . Consider further that if you get a degree in physics it does n't  qualify you as an economist , a biologist , or a psychologist , much less an electrician or a plumber . <p> If it took say 2 years to earn each subsequent bachelors degree , how long would one have to live to get a degree ( BA/BS ) in every subject offered by the typical university ? <p> IOWs , the last true renaissance man probably died long before the Renaissance . You cant know everything , you cant know a substantial amount about everything , in fact you cant know a substantial amount about more than a few things . You cant really do much more than be an expert on ( at most ) a handful of things and a dilettante about everything else . Most of us " dumb people " know that being able to spout a little cocktail knowledge about 27 different topics does n't  mean we know anything , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , those from the humanities department , as well as those from the engineering department are never at a loss for opinions on a wide range of subjects ) <p> Meanwhile , the plumbers and electricians quietly go about specializing in their trades so that they really know what they are doing . IMO this is the only rational response to a world of increasing complexity know that you cant know much , and be really expert in what you do . <p> Alas , all these " experts " have little opportunity to coordinate knowledge . Cross-training is necessary , but has built in limitations as mentioned above . <p> As you correctly state , we not only live in a world were people are entitled to their opinions , but increasingly feel entitled to their own facts . Global warming is a socialist conspiracy dreamed up by " gubmint " scientists , so sayeth Rush Limbaugh . An Oxycontin popping college drop out is , for many , as credible a source as a physicist from MIT , if not more so . <p> I do n't  believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is , people feel entitled to their own facts not because we live in a relativistic world of competing interpretations , ( because most people do n't  believe that when it comes to science , engineering etc , though they may accept a postmodern attitude towards art ) but because they actually " feel " that reality has to coincide with their preconceptions , opinions , prejudices , religion , etc . If you have facts that are at odds with another persons " reality " he does n't  consider that you have an alternate world-view , he considers that your facts are wrong , or simply not facts at all . <p> I 'm increasingly troubled by this . I do n't  know the answer . One thing we need is a very basic level of wisdom -e.g. an MIT physicist is more credible than Rush Limbaugh . We are n't  even at that basic level of wisdom right now or rather , a substantial % of our population is not at that level of wisdom . <p> CT said , <p> On ignorance and dumb(ness) .

Group 2 folks do n't  see the big picture but can still do what needs to be done ( the laborer ) . Group 3 folks see the picture but cant do what is needed ( supervisor ) . Group 4 folks cant find picture ergo do n't  see any needs ( dregs of society ) . I have come to look at people ( &amp; myself ) through these lenses .

But then , all engineers are educated in " science " .

@@42287769 @2287769/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Update : The following post was written back in 2008 , but I think its still equally valid . Towards the bottom of the post , I made some suggestions of buying housing , financials , discretionary consumer companies . In retrospect , this turned out to have been the right call ( as long as you bought the strongest companies ) for the first two , which is also where I put my money . Knowing what kind of consumer discretionaries is popular is not really within my field of competence . <p> Economically speaking , the government is a zero-sum game that takes money from one group and distributes it to another group with the intention to somehow improve the world . For instance , when the government engages in war , it gets money from taxpayers ( through the IRS ) and savers ( by issuing and selling bonds ) and gives it to defense companies and soldiers which through a multiplier effect recycles the money back into the economy ( while causing destruction somewhere else ) . In the current case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savers ( by issuing bonds and going further into debt ) and distributes it taxpayers or consumers . Here the intention is to stimulate the economy to prevent the official declaration of a recession which would certainly look bad in a voting year.The thinking behind the stimulus plan comes from the Keynesian idea of economic central planning . Keynensian economics was developed during the world wide depression of the 1930s where people where saving everything they had . The understanding was that people were unemployed and were saving too much . Keynes therefore proposed that the government should dislodge this inconvenient tendency by borrowing money ( from the savers ) and increase spending ( to employ the unemployed ) . This was done by engaging in large scale public projects such as increased military expenses and building highways and autobahns . This project was very successful . An unintended consequence might have been World War II though but it is hard to attach blame with the world being as complicated as the world is . <p> Even though one might get the impression from reading pf blogs that many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not the problem facing the economy now . Rather the problem is that thanks to Greenspan ( and certain other central bankers ) overly cheap credit has fueled a housing boom for several years . This resulted in a massive overproduction of housing . Furthermore it allowed the selling of real estate at increasing prices and leverage to buyers with an ever decreasing understanding of how to handle money ( e.g. people with subprime credit ) . This money ( now in the hands of the sellers ) was spent and used to fuel the economy . <p> Now we have a problem ! <p> The understanding of the government is that borrowing more money from savers and giving it back to tax payers will solve the problem . However , since the problem was one of excess credit , it makes little sense for the government to borrow more money on our behalf and dole it out to every person in the country . This is like drinking tequila to cure a hangover . Most likely the money will not be spent but rather used to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people . However , for other people the money will not even cover one mortgage payment and thus not prevent foreclosure and the resulting drop in housing prices . Overall this will only delay the inevitable a little bit longer ( but perhaps long enough to get past the election ) . <p> The main problem here is that the majority of voters do not seem to understand this and thus they will react accordingly e.g. pay off debt or buy a new TV . So what can investors do to save themselves when nobody wants to listen ? ( In case anyone is listening please stop this folly ! ) In a country where the government has a lot of control with the economy it is wise to get as close to government spending as possible ( both in terms of investments and career wise ) . In terms of investments , note that this time around the government is giving money back specifically to taxpayers . Now what are the taxpayers going to spend it on ? My guess is TVs and credit/mortgage bills . That means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are also exactly the sectors that are currently ailing , so this is a rational yet quite risky bet ( due to the timing issue ) . An alternative strategy is to opt out of this crazy scheme . Convert the refund to foreign currency and invest in other countries that do n't  believe so strongly in free lunches . <p> As always , this is just my personal opinion and none of this should be construed as investment advice . If you are not ready and prepared to take full responsibility for your own investment decisions I urge you to please consult with a certified professional . <h> 15 users responded in " The problem with the economic stimulus package and what to do about it " <p> Jacob , another interesting post . My question is this : Why did Greenspan do what he did ? What was his motivation and why did Bernacke do what he just did ? Do you think that their actions were intended for the good of the real estate market ? Or , even , the general economy ? <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested in the stock market . And whose interests is the government trying to protect with the mortgage bailout ? <p> Your thoughts ? <p> Benjamin said , <p> Other countries that do n't  believe in free lunches as strongly as this oneIm having trouble coming up with some of those countries . Would you be looking at Gini coefficients ? I still do n't  think I 'd want to invest in Brazil . Most of Europe has more welfare in place than the US , yet their currencies are thriving at the moment . <p> I 'm just curious here . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ron I suspect that currently ( and since Volcker ) it is generally agreed that the federal reserve can control the direction of the market . I also suspect that this assumption is wrong . The feds determine or at least implement the monetary policy of the country or given the size of the US economy one might say the entire world . However , by itself monetary policy does not matter as long as it is stable . Monetary policy is all about perceptions of value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be touched . The real determinants are the market ( the irrational exuberance deal ) and the fiscal policy ( lower taxes and run a continuous deficit while financing unproductive projects ) of the government . I think the currently the federal reserve is caught between a rock and a hard place . The problem is that both the market and the government believes that the fed is in control of the economy even though they are n't  almost to the point of worship . So I think the federal reserve is trying to a ) do its real job which is to provide liquidity to the banks a job it does well and b ) try to boost the government statistics like GDP , unemployment numbers , etc. a job it does not do particularly well and should not be doing . As for the government : There are a lot of votes to be had by providing free money . I think they also have to worry about rolling over their massive debt at reasonable rates . This situation seems to be getting worse and worse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this was the best I could do . <p> @benjamin Europe may have more welfare , but I 'm not sure that they have that much more government . A lot of the US government is funded by inflation ( debt ) rather than taxes . This merely hides the size of the government . The ECB seems to be pretty conservative . I generally developed countries that do n't  speak English ( or Icelandic = is a good rule of thumb = <p> Jacob your comment above for Ron is brilliant . ( And since this is the Internet and things do n't  always come out as intended , that was not sarcastic . ) The comment showed a real understanding of economics and the true purpose of the Fed which is so refreshing because I do n't  think very many people understand recent economic movements , on either the monetary or the fiscal side . <p> I have written about this topic myself and I am certain that the current interest rate which our government is borrowing money is well below its justified level , as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in growth of our economy . <p> Just like a private business there is an ideal capital structure for the government . When rates are artificially low it is in our best interest to utilize them to spur economic growth . At some point this trend will reverse and our borrowing rates will increase , at that point we should pay down debt ; this is not that time ! <p> The limit on how much we should borrowed must be judged by the same standards applied to a corporation . I suggest reading this page about Capital Structure . Using 2006 numbers ( most recent I could find ) the federal government spent $406 billion on interest payments and had $2,407 billion in tax revenues . So roughly 1 in 6 dollars in spent on interest payments . Our total debt is roughtly 8 trillion dollars with a GDP of 13 trillion . In 2006 the ratio for the federal government debt to cash flow was about 3.33 . These metrics in the corporate world are no where near the levels where debt is considered risky ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt to equity ratio of great than .5 source ) . <p> Based on the historic return on capital for our domestic economy and our government tax revenue we could maintain solvency with as much as twice our current debt load . Future growth ( and inflation ) will also decrease the amount of our debt over time even without making any effort to pay it down . <p> Again , I 'll say you make some valid points but I think there is more to the analysis that needs to be considered . The fact that the average consumer makes poor money decisions does not change the fact that deficits are not evil and can in fact greatly benefit our economy . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ lily not to worry , I read everything at face value = <p> @ adfecto If government is viewed as some incredible large corporation subject to the same rules as corporation , then maybe you are right . Still such a government should adhere to much more conservative values than a typical corporation since a bankrupt government makes the country a very bad place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much operates its finances like a banana republic . With your numbers a doubling of the interest rate up to 8-10% would lead to delinquency . <p> I see government more as an entity or a set of laws that take money from some people and give it to others . The money can either be taken from earners ( taxes ) or savers ( through inflation ) . If the recipients grow the money better than the contributors , government helps it unsticks the sticky parts . If not , the government is a drag on the economy . Does such central planning actually help ? In other words this is not a question debt-equity ratio for the government but a question of ROE for different parts of the economy . I see that Soviet Union as an example of such planning that was pushed too far . Sweden anno 1990 was an example that was pushed just far enough ( they had to devalue and restructure ) . Maybe the US does not push far enough or maybe they too are pushing too far . <p> Kyeann said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which countries ? = 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kyeann I prefer to stay out of the currency game per se . Instead I buy foreign companies and I prefer to use funds for that in funds that do not hedge the currency exchange rate . Naturally this strategy has been quite good the past few years ( as the dollar has dropped a lot compared to other major countries ) . <p> mysticaltyger said , <p> Jacob , <p> I 'm not sure I agree with your statement that Europe does n't  have that much more government than the US . If you look at the Debt to GDP ratios of some of the larger European countries ( Germany , France , Italy ) , they 're around the same as the US ( or higher , in the case of Italy ) . <p> In hindsight , the stimulus/bailout/fed rate intervention was too focused on the financial sector in hopes of a trickle down jump-start of the economy . Just keep filling the banks up with money and perhaps itll overflow and dribble down on the people ? <p> By comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on my way to Guangzhou to meet up with relatives and I could see concrete pillars start to rise along the high way . 6 months later , I flew into Guangzhou and those pillars were half complete with the new track for high speed rail ( extension to Shenzen/Hong Kong ) . <p> The worlds fastest ( 250mph ) high speed rail line runs from Wuhan to Guangzhou ( about the distance Sacramento to San Diego ) . And here 's the punchline : it was completed in 6 years ! The project started in 2003 but extra stimulus money sped up completion . By comparison , the SF/Oakland Bay Bridge was damaged in 1989 and is on schedule for replacement 24 years later . <p> What China did was put stimulus money into projects that not only directly employed people but is also leaving useful infrastructure ( which private companies can not do ) in place that will act as an economic multiplier in the coming future . It has worked like gangbusters . In late 2008 , friends and relatives we talked to were all worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China in mid-2009 , everything was booming again . <p> Of course , it helped that the China government saved through the good times to have the cash to stimulate the economy during the bad times . That part of Keynesian economics is missing from the U.S. stimulus package . <p> My thoughts : After the trauma of near-hyperinflation in the 1970s , central banks thought all they had to do to ensure stability was keep consumer inflation around 2% a year . They reached that goal in the 1990s and thought monetary and credit expansion was OK in response to all the bumps in the road ( e.g. LTCM , Y2K , stock market corrections , etc ) as long as the CPI stayed near 2% . The fact that the monetary and credit expansions were creating inflation in asset prices ( e.g. dotcom , commodities houses ) was ignored . It was not a problem , according to the central bankers , because they believed they just had to keep the CPI stable . It was , in large part ( in combination with some other factors ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very interested to hear your views on the stimulas and its effectiveness so far . I think the stimulas has fallen short of its potential for two primary reasons : 1 ) The financial institutions who have received the welfare from the American people ( referred to as TARP ) have further showed that they do not have an interest in providing products and services that are in the best interest of their customers . Banks , like the government , have no money except what they receive from their customers . With it they can provide services ( such as loans ) and charge fees . The profits for this should go back to their customers in the form of interest . These concepts do n't  even seem to be remotely evidenced in the major financial institutions over the last 20 years . LONG ... 2 ) There are still too many people who believe in the myth of " free money " and entitlement . There is no such thing . Money is merely an exchange for goods and services . Whatever gets into my pocket comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , welfare is funded by taxpayer money . Although I support assistance programs they should be limited and audited . Anything provided as more than a short term hand up in the stirup is going to drain the resources of those who earned it . I loved Jacobs post about who are the leeches ? The very rich who get all the tax breaks or the very poor who get unlimited assistance ? The answer I think is both because someone is paying for it and it disrupts the normal flow of supply and demand . In the meantime the working person gets squished in the middle . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

I have been concerned about this though , since some that we looked at were quite run down and scary looking . The park we are moving to is very clean , well kept , and quiet seeming ( at least so far the times we 've been over there ) . The one neighbor we 've seen looked like a nice old lady ( she waved : D ) . <p> Think its just a risk you run , there are all those people , in all different areas . Some will be limited income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parks ahead of time , do drive throughs at different times and days , see what its like when people are around on the weekends 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @lisa Theres bound to be areas like that . Apartment buildings are like that too as are residential areas . We checked out a few areas and picked the one that looked cleanest . The nice thing is that if we were wrong , we can easily move . OTOH if you bought a home in a declining area , you 're quite stuck . Even moving out of a rental is harder . Moving out in an RV takes less than an hour . <p> Looking forward to reading about life there . DH and I are still in the clutter removal process to successfully dispose of enough stuff to live in less space . Are you going to share pictures of the RV and park when you get a chance ? ? <p> What type of RV did you get ? Have you looked at resort type RV parks that offer site ownership ? Thats is what I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RV park living as low as popssible from some full-timing friends that are retired and travel from park to park . Thanks for the blog . I enjoy it . Dr. Paul 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @diaryofadink Yeah , there will probably be pictures . <p> @plozano Its a 34 ' class A. The one resort I looked at offered plots from $80-120k ( offering mountain views , lake front , 9/18 hole golf courses , etc ) .. They mandated a 180 day maximum stay though ( did n't  want to turn the places into low-income residential units ) . My guess is that the problem is similar to liveaboards in marinas . Possibly a do n't  ask , do n't  tell . One could imagine that people start piling up their stuff all over their plot and ruining the appearance if it gets too permanent . Ohhh those blanket laws . <p> It was easy to find a nice RV park that allowed year round residents in Arizona . There are so many snowbirds and after a while they get tired of travelling and just stay here . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . Mobile home parks were scary . Too run down . But Jacob is right that it is easy to move out if the place is bad , much easier than owning a house or renting an apartment . I would recommend asking the police to find out how often they have to visit . <p> I considered buying a mobile home in a park once . It looked nice during the day . I did n't  do it and later on some residents got busted for a major theft , drug , and prostitution ring . If I had bought that mobile home I would have had a very hard time getting rid of it . <p> llangolen19 said , <p> I 'm new here , a single mom with an empty nest .

Alternatively , one could walk around to the back of the house and be relatively unobserved . In contrast , although the door on an RV is flimsier , its generally out of reach of the adjacent windows . The windows are generally also higher up than house windows about 6 ' or so . Our RV has an additional tumbler lock on the door . If you are not hooked up to power and water and you have a class A or C ( not a fifth wheel or a trailer ) , you could simply start the engine and drive away if you get hazzled . Also , RVs are closer to the neighbors than houses . <p> CajunPro said , <p> Jacob , I have been living in my RV for about 8 years now . I bought 15 acres and put in my own utilities and dug some ponds and cut some trails for riding and am living the life . I have several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even consider moving there now . I also cut several areas out for friends to park theirs when they come in . Ever in bayou country drop me a line and have a taste of what RVing Life is really about . Oh , and you can never believe the wildlife , how they just adopt you ( with a little food ) CajunPro <p> llangolen19 , I lived in an RV park for 6 years . As a single female I was concerned at first but like Jacob said , my RV had an additional RV deadbolt lock and the windows are higher and the crank-out type . If you live in a park with retired or snowbird type folks they will look out for you ( some have nothing better to do ) . There was also some security that drove a golf cart around the park . Walking in the early morning or late at night was not scary because the park was well lit and many others were out walking their pets . And the RV spaces being so close together fosters a family-type atmosphere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be buying our own land instead . Were more hikers than golfers . Any problems with zoning regulations ? Did you dig your own well/make your own septic system ? <p> Ruthie said , <p> My husband is one of those working and living in rv in trailor park .. very unusual $75.00 per month plus electric opposed to $250.00 a month plus sewer .

This park is family ouned and has downsize entertainmentabove ground pool , Ohio River is less than a mile , cookouts every nite and volley ball .. My cousin sold home and lives in motor home in winter in Fla.Sells pumpkins in Oct and Christmas trees in Dec .. picks up part time jobs . Has smaller Salem camper in the north .

Wondering how overall costs ( from an ERE standpoint ) would compare to living in an apartment at $5,000/yr . I 'm single and basically just need 3 things out of it . Place to sleep , place to cook , internet connection . I do give a small premium to the added freedom of living on wheels and I 'm drooling at the possibility of snowbirding somewhere over winter . Also I would have to take on some debt to pay for the actual RV but would be willing to do that if it beats $5000/year by a significant amount . Currently debt free . $24k in individual stocks . Income $20k . Consumption $9k . Plausible ? <p> Thx . Jeff . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Jeff I think RV ( long term , 1 month+ ) parking fees are lower than renting an apartment for the same area . Of course if you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . If you add RV payments to the picture it may change . This obviously depends on what kind of RV you 're getting e.g. a $10k trailer vs a $70k motorhome , say . Check out http : //cheaprvliving.com/ if you really want to go low budget . There 's certainly more adventure in that than staying at a camp . <p> Swmai Bob ! said , <p> I found an older Class A RV on Crags List here in Spokane , WA. in October and towed it into a storage lot . It has begun to get warm and I just pulled out the old carpet and the dinett seats and table moved the couch from one side to the other had a mechinic help get it started and we will get the breaks bleed this weekend . <p> I was not looking for an RV , but when I saw it I did a Google search and found that this brand of RV A 1969 Travco 270 , a 27 footer with full head , shower , stove-oven , full size refrigerator and a huge 5.500 watt generator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very collectible with a strong cult following . It was built of a dodge truck frame and looks like a classic Airstream trailer but is a fiberglass body on four wheels with a big V-8 , and the truck frame is designed to travel 1 Mill . Miles . <p> A brand new Class A , RV that has the same amenities and " style " as this RV Would cost well over 100 K , and be used up with 150 K miles on it ! <p> After I install new carpet , an ext. ( cheep ) paint job I will park on a lake beach front lot for $250 a month for the summer . I just signed a lease for 6 months at a lake side camping " resort " where I can have a boat slip for $25 extra a month . If I go back to CA for the winter I can store the Motor Home over the winter for free at the resort .. or drive it South and camp in Palm Springs , for around the same per month or stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I paid a few bucks for the RV and will only have maybe $1,500 to $2,000 K in repairs , tires , paint and carpet . I can over time replace anything that needs replacement when I want to and purchase the best parts as I do not have a payment on the RV . I will own it the rest of my life for only the cost of maintenance . At 40 years old now it is built to last , is not like the new junk people pay way too much for . I will post how it goes and how I like living in an RV later . <p> " I 'm new here , a single mom with an empty nest . Leaving my house and considering options for living less expensively . the Rv option seems a viable one , but I have safety/security issues . the doors on an RV may be safe for short trips , but as a woman alone , would they be safe to live in full-time ? " <p> This is my newest pet peeve . I hate all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . <p> Unless someone has been casing your rig for a period of time , how would they know a single woman was living in it ? Take normal precautions , like keeping doors and windows closed and locked , but I do n't  think its a good use of time and energy to pursue special precautions due to your sex . <p> Statistically , women face the most danger from men they know : boyfriends , husbands , fathers , priests . However , our culture emphasizes the danger women face from complete strangers attacking them in the streets , which is statistically a lot less common . Quit watching " Law and Order " and the news . Read " The Gift of Fear " by Gavin DeBecker , and use common sense . <p> Some men think that women are like dogs . If they do n't  have a collar and obviously " belong " to someone , then they are up for grabs ( apparently we are n't  autonomous human beings ) . You could always wear a wedding ring . That might discourage any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price of land in your area ( gathered from the resort plots and other land rent you discuss ) , which is so different than mine , I am awful interested in this question , Jacob , so Ill just ask it . If you lived in an area where you could buy a solid 50-year old , 1800 sq.ft. , detached home for 120K and half an acre , with neighbors you love ( I do , in nowhere PA ) , do you think you would do that as opposed to your RV ? <p> I know there are obviously additional expenses ( time , effort , and money ) that come with the ownership of a detached home over an RV . I 'm also in a bit of a different situation with 3 kids . But just curious , thx . I am in no way asking if you are willing to move to nowhere PA as opposed to where you want to live ( I would never move to a big city if someone paid me to ) , so its not that preference that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a convenient choice based on the overvalued housing market in California . I 'd prefer the house but I 'd like something smaller ( 450sqft ) if possible . My ideal home , I 'd build myself . <p> Were lookin forward to doing this some day when the kids are older . Should be a blast . One of those memorable , yet affordable vacations ! <p> brian said , <p> The Cheap RV Living Website is mind blowing .

My dog is big and black so he looks like my bodyguard but realistically he only rescues boats . I lived very comfortably for 9 months in a 24 foot Class C full time . I have recently upgraded to a 5th wheel with slide outs and life is downright luxurious . Bottom line is I lowered my costs significantly and lowered my carbon footprint . The deer and other wildlife have accepted me and my dog ignores them . Life is good . Check out the membership campgrounds and then look at their annual sites .

This is a great site and I 've heard little pieces of my story in almost every entry . <p> I know an RV is my way out , but I 'm butting my head against the wall right now . I live in a small city in Colorado and would prefer to not have to go too far . I have lots of animals ( a miniature horse and dogs ) so a campground is probably out the question for me , right ? I need to live frugally for at least a year . <p> The problem is that all the land I 've found that is affordable needs well and septic ( which of course makes it no longer affordable after installation ) or has no power , etc .

She is NOT a horse . = <p> How I do blather , huh ? Anyway , are there people with land and hookups that would do a lease-type situation or something if I construct semi-perm fencing ? Is there even a way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal , etc. ? How do I find people that might let me do that ? I 've heard some of you talk about annual sites at membership campgrounds . Do any of these have attached boarding facilities for horses ? Is it just a better bet for me to continue my search for cheap land w/ utilities and septic ? <p> Do I sound like I 'm floundering ? Could be because I 'm foundering . <p> I have to admit that most Realtors have been less than helpful after hearing my needs . One emailed me a list of properties ( none under $250,000 and the most expensive house was 495K ! after talking with me about the little piece of land I sought . ) Really ? ? It may sound a little bitter , but it seems that I do n't  have enough money to matter to most of the agents Ive spoken with . <p> Ive read versions of my story here and then the results saying , " Wow , life is good .

Dusty 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @DustyRose Sounds like boondocking might be a solution . However , I 've never heard of anyone boondocking with anything beyond a cat or dog .

We started out wanting to go to Florida ( where our daughter was ) , but they are not to favorable to Fultimers on their own property . So , We came back to Missouri . We had a lot in Mo in a small village , and as soon as they saw us set-up on our own land on a permanent basis they tried to run us out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up . Next we sold that lot and bought six acres with an unlivable Mobile home , but the property had no restrictions . Mobile Home gone , had everything we needed . Sewer , Water , Elect . service . and peace . We decided that property was hard on a couple of old folks . so we sold that one and bought an acre with a little flatter ground and all the same utilities . I must mention at this point that the six acre parcel was a foreclosure , purchased from the government , ( very cheaply I will add ) . The last parcel we bought from a previous RVer that was moving back to Wisconsin and had not done his due diligence in advertising . He listed it with elect . and water close , when it fact it was on the property . Cost of acre , 1/2 of market value . My point being , you have to do your DUE diligence in searching . Live in areas where restrictions to property are more relaxed . Resort areas are nice , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaten path areas are better , and you are more likely to find a bargain . Old Mobiles , Burnout homes , Foreclosures , places people do n't  want to clean-up .

We live out in the country ( not many restrictions ) on 8 acres &amp; am wondering " what would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could design it ? How wide would you make the lots ? Amenities ? There is already a baseball field near the entrance now.Would you keep that for the families or is it taking up valuable space ? How much is the average monthly rent for an RV lot ? Any awesome websites I can go to for planning/design ideas ? Any info you could share would be greatly appreciated ! I want it to be top-notch and am thinking Long-term . Thank you for your help 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Magpie First you need to get it zoned for RV use . That could be hard . <p> Second , there 's the infrastructure . 50Amp service is common on the big rigs these days . You can get away with 35Amp but expect the fuses to blow when Joe Sixpack pulls in with his 40 ' rig with triple A/Cs . Also water , drainage , ( like are you going to have a dump station or an individual sewer for each site ) . <p> Third , I think , is the decision who your customers are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual ? Tourist campground have a great deal more amenities than long-term residents , e.g. pool , basketball court , small shop , wifi , and sometimes entertainment will be arranged ( think resort style ) . Long-term parks will generally only have a coin laundry facility . I 'd scratch the baseball court anyway . Way too much valuable space for how many are going to use it . Lots , again , depends , long term or short . Long-term residents want/need more space . Tourists just need about a trailer+car wide . Also tourists like pull-troughs for their monster vehicles . Average rent depends on the area ( $250-750 for a minimum facility place ) . You also have to consider the occupation rate . It can vary widely . Are you close to an interstate or out in the sticks ? Close to jobs for the long-term residents ? Or focus on the 55+ crowd ? <p> In general , the monthly rate equals 3x the weekly rate which equals 6x the daily rate . <p> I 'm not aware of any books , but there are several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds . <p> Dairy Dog said , <p> My time is nearing , that is to say my youngest is a senior in HS and is off to college in the fall .

We are buying a used Winnebago Itasca Sunrise 38J .

We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not do this so far . They live in a fairly rural area and there are several RVs parked on many properties .

We are dead set that we will be living in the RV soon . <p> Once all is approved we are selling the house . After that we will have a septic system installed , water/electric run and a car port erected . It will not be shabby or unsightly . We like to do things right the first time and corner cutting will not be part of that . I can only imagine that a fully functional RV dock with all the hook ups will only increase the value of the property .

Of course we would have to stay around a populated area for my childrens sake for schooling I would assume ? Here is my questionshave you ever seen families with children do such a thing ? I do n't  like what society is doing to children these days and I want my children to value the right thingsrather then valuing a ipod or game system . But to value and respect our wildlife and mother earth another question would be is , is it possible to be in an rv in the winter months as we would n't be able to go far due to my husband still having to work of course . I 'm open to thoughtwe do live in a low income of about 1500 a month I have rented homes , but the homes I could afford were in bad areas and I do n't  want to go that path again , we finally have found ourselves a trailor in which we own in a park but the people here disgust me with their habitsand the horror stories from the police is what freaks me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer monthsthat is unacceptableanyhow if anyone has any recommendations I would appreciate it or suggestions.I may live in the city but I am country at heart as is my husbandjust do n't  know if you can live such a life style with childrenI refuse to let them grow up like the punks some of these parents are molding their children into .

@@42287791 @2287791/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Extreme early retirement compared to sports and fitness ? Clearly , I 've been reading this blog too long and have undergone some kind of frugal brainwashing . But learning extreme saving techniques is , in fact , a lot like swimming . <p> I worked for years as a lifeguard ( talk about boring jobs working for the man . ' ) My job was to sit and watch people swim back and forth . Two kinds of visitors frequented our pool . <p> The sleek , speedo-wearing veterans swam for hours and practiced efficiency drills to shave seconds off their race times . The blubbery beginners struggledawkward , gasping and hanging on the lane lines because they could n't make 25 meters in one go . <p> On more than one occasion , the beginners would come to chat with me after a 15-minute swim and gaze on the experienced athletes still in the water improving their style . They 'd express frustration at their comparatively inefficient bodies and embarrassment at being watched by an observer ( me ) as they swam . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really was watching them more because they looked more likely to drown . ) <p> What I often told the new swimmer ( and what holds true for the beginning saver ) is this : The super efficient guy you 're looking at " the one practicing the same stroke over and over again ? You 've got him beat in at least one way . Every time you swim , you 're heart rate shoots sky high and you 're improving your fitness level faster than the expert over here . If you work at it little , you can also make huge gains just by fine-tuning your technique . If you keep this up for a few months , I 'll see real improvement in your swimming " I 've been watching the experts for years and I ca n't detect their improvements without a stopwatch. * <p> The same is true for beginners in the area of savings . I 'm going to be visiting some family in SoCal shortly , and they 've asked me to help them do a few things . We 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . For a household of 4 adults , they currently spend upwards of 1,200 a month in groceries BUT they also eat out several times a week , sometimes more than once a day . They have n't calculated the cost ! I do n't even want to talk about the clutter , but I will say this : the condition of my help is that for any room I reorganize , they agree to get rid of 50% of the stuff ' in there by volume . You get the picture . <p> Now , one might think that this is a lost cause , but I think it 's quite the opposite . I 'm sure I can help them shave $2-300 of their grocery list while I 'm there . My goal is to get them to cut it in half , but we 'll see . It seems easy to me , but I may be underestimating the pain factor as they make radical changes " at least from their perspective . <p> For those of you out there who are a lot more efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the possibility of saving $3-600 in groceries alone ? DH and I would jump at the opportunity . We have nearly nothing easy left to remove ( except for wine " anyone who knows how I can get a Frenchman to stop buying wine without getting a divorce let me know ) . <p> The beginner phenomenon is part of the reason I think that the posts at Early Retirement Extreme are just relevant to the beginner as they are to the experienced saver . In fact , the techniques may be even more relevant . A beginner who does just a few of these things can make significant gains in a short time . <p> *Note this is for swimming and saving , not investing ! <p> Jacob comments : I think this post is useful to answer the question regarding the " hardships " I went through to get to where I am today as discussed in the comments of a recent post . I actually used to be a competitive swimmer and the key to swimming is " efficiency " . Back then I could swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importantly without the feeling that I was doing something that was tremendously tough . Indeed , operating at a given level is usually never that tough . What is tough is moving up to the next level ( The club where I swam had six teams : beginner to elite ) where you are suddenly out of your comfort zone and being challenged and expected to do much better than you have previously been doing . But if you grow as a person/swimmer , you do become better and after that things become easy even though you are now operating at a level that used to be challenging . Eventually it will even be hard to " reach down " and connect with the beginners because you simply do not remember what and why certain things were challenging . ( This is also why I believe graduate students sometimes make better instructors than professors . The former still remember what was difficult and what was n't . ) <p> This blog is extreme . There are blogs out there whose main purpose is to get you off the couch and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you to swim a lane without hanging on the ropes . There are blogs who sets up a fitness programs for those who just want to stay in shape . ( I wo n't mention any names , but I do have specific ones in mind = . ) This blog is for the " elite " ; not that you have to be extreme , but you should at least have the attitude of wanting to become one unless you just read along for entertainment . <p> I do n't  mean to say that " elite " is better ( the problem here being to define " better " ) , but it is intended for a certain kind of people who have certain goals in mind when it comes to personal finance . I strongly believe that the challenge is not so much physical as it is mental . For the longest time it was believe to be impossible to run a mile in less than 4 minutes ( it was also believe to be impossible to fly faster than the sound , that is , break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and soon thereafter many people started running a mile faster than 4 minutes . Did something change physically ? No , people simply reset their targets and changed their beliefs of what they thought possible . I am trying to do the same thing with personal finance . <p> The hardship or challenge in personal finance is to change ones frame of mind , specifically ones values . The technical details of personal finance are very simple . Anyone can learn them in a few months . ( It is amazing this stuff is not taught in the school system but I guess this would not entirely be in the interest of the schools sponsors . ) If that was all there was to it , most pf blogs should shut down immediately , as they would have nothing new to say . However , the primary function of pf blogs is to support/suggest/guide attitudes . For example , if you live to eat , eating a very basic diet is not going to be amusing . If you eat to live , you will likely be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a health perspective . I for one live to learn and read so when I experimented with not buying books , that sucked , but at least I tested my limits and that is what athletes/extreme persons do . <h> 12 users responded in " How is saving for extreme early retirement like learning to swim ?

If there are no small pools , or depending on how the pool is organized , theyd have to hang on the ropes . <p> Isnt TLBlack from France ? Its not clear to me where she was living when she observed the blubbery beginners struggling to make it down a 25-meter pool . Seems like it would have been 25 yards if they were in the US , though . <p> Regardless , whenever I see an obviously out-of-shape person attempting to swim , jog , or do any other physical activity , I have to commend them on their effort , especially if they make a habit out of the activity . They surely know they look out of place , so the feeling of self-consciousness must be significant . However , whether attempting to become a better swimmer or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really like the comparison that TLBlack makes here . <p> @ Jacob : Per your earlier blog entry , I feel the same way as you do about swimming and work . I spent my high school years waking up early and coming into school in the pre-dawn darkness , during winter , to swim endless laps . I got in great shape , and still remember all of the strokes and techniques , but as soon as high school was over , I quit competitive swimming for good . I did n't  want swimming ( which was always an enjoyable activity as a younger child ) to become an activity associated with so much unpleasantness . I feel the same way about work now . I 've done it long enough , and need to quit before I become completely burned out . I want to use my time and energy for my own purposes , not constrained by the whims and desires of an employer . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Executioner TL is from Socal and now lives in France . I would expect US pools to follow the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or half that ( 25m ) . I have never been to a US pool so I do n't  know for sure . <p> Frugalyeah , sometimes people really cant make it all the way yet !

I 've noticed that its a lot harder to teach something that was so easy for me that I cant remember learning it than it is to teach something I remember struggling with not too long ago . Its the ability to relate to others that are learning that makes the difference . <p> As for the idea that your readers are extreme , last week , I would have argued that I was n't .

I think rock climbing offers an interesting perspective because it is hugely mental , despite appearing mostly physical . <p> The difficulty scale ( Yosemite decimal scale ) was initially designed to span from 5.0 to 5.9 , with numerically greater numbers indicating greater technical difficulty . <p> At first , 5.9 was the realm of the expert . <p> Then , with new climbs increasing sent and graded 5.9+ , the scale became open ended , and 5.10 was born . <p> Then 5.11 . Then 5.12 . <p> We are now at 5.15 . <p> The interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that as soon as that next barrier is broken down the realm of the top .1% that grade becomes increasingly pedestrian . <p> 12-year-old kids are sending harder than the ripped , dedicated , technical masters of the past , and making it look easy . <p> Humans are so strange in the way that they have so much trouble opening the door for themselves but , once open , it is so much easier to follow . A lot of parallels to what Jacob has done with ERE , perhaps ? I know ERE has had that effect on me. 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287792 @2287792/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Now , it seems that civilization swings between a class based society and a democratization . Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire were somewhat democratic . Feudalism was not . The 18th , 19th , and 20th century saw a revival of democratic principles . The 21st and 22nd centuries will see their decays . Hence , after a brief interlude of the latter , were returning to a society with land-owners and indentured . <p> This time it wont be in terms of noble titles and who your parents are , but in terms of how many assets you control . Corporations will become the new fiefdoms and the nation states will lose more power probably to the point where they are taken about as seriously as the church is today ; theyll exist but they wont be a dominating force . <p> For some perspective , the church was the government peaking about 500 years ago . The primary church tax was tithing and some still do that today , talk about legacy power ! Its voluntarily though , because the church has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . You can already see that their powers are getting watered out by global trade agreements like NAFTA , WTO , and the EU . <p> Will the people in the middle class prosper or fade away ? Insofar that they are useful to the " asset-class " , yes . After all , some people in the asset class ( equity lords ? ) are incapable of doing simple things like frying an egg or changing a flat tire(*) However , if you 're pressing a button on a machine that could be pressed less expensively offshore , or ditto , you are filing papers or analyzing data , the answer is no . <p> ( * ) I 'm not making this up . I have examples , but I want to protect the innocent = <p> The middle class will be differentiated into those producing needs and those producing wants . The " wants " producers will be out of a job because they cant remain competitive on a global basis , and because wants can no longer be afforded locally because the balance of tradethe sweet deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper notesis shifting the other way . <p> My advice : <p> Under no circumstances get yourself indebted . If you have debt , you are owned by someone . If you are owned by someone , you are the new under-class . <p> Try to align yourself and your interests with the asset-class as much as possible . They will mainly be looking out for their own through lobbying and behind the curtain deals . Make sure those deals are at least working somewhat in your favor . Do n't  join the middle class , the wealthy will inherit the earth . <p> If you work for a living or plan to work for a living , work on things that can not be transported in any way whatsoever . Your finished product should not be transmittable in electronic form or via a shipping container without massive costs . Consider , for instance , that EMT services can not be outsourced because the problem is right here and now . However , brain surgery can be outsourced via robotic interfaces . <p> You can expect a full transformation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too secular in duration for most people to notice and they will blame other things . Anyone paying attention would have noticed a lot of this in the bank bailout , for instance , though . <p> Why is this happening ? Why is there a cycle ? Well , its pretty simple . Its the same reason that there is a business cycle . In the beginning there is little **26;1015;TOOLONG for freedom . As productivity/etc. increases , quality of life increase . Eventually , this **27;1043;TOOLONG is taken for grantedthis happens when people start thinking of perma-growth to the point that they do n't  even think about alternatives . At this point , people are willing to invest in low return assets ( McMansions and big cars ) because " they can afford it " . They will give up the rights that their great grand parents fought and thought hard about for expedient " low freedom " concepts like safety and comfort . This undermines the previous productivity much like a foundation breaks down if its supporting too much weight . This begets the decline . Easy-peasy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening to the middle class " <p> @Jacob No beef with your take on modernity or advice for the next century , but your characterization of Ancient Greece and the Roman Empire as " democracies " in opposition to " class " societies is way off , probably due to over generalization . In both ancient Greece and in the Roman era , during both the late Republic and the Empire before 400 A.D. there were distint classes based on wealth ( so technically timocracies , see http : **33;1072;TOOLONG ) . Voting was skewed to favor the wealthiest . There were vast hordes of proletariate who were de facto disenfranchised but kept from rioting by cheap subsidized grain and public entertainments . If anything , the Roman world was very similar to late 20th century America . <p> Also , query whether some of the apparent inability of equity lords to care for simple service needs like cooking and auto repair is n't really the product of a calculation that time is better spent in trading bonds or negotiating contracts with Chinese suppliers because an hour spent doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by frying ones own egg . Just playing devils advocate here . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Maus I mean the level of democracy relative to the Dark Ages was higher before . <p> I realize its a trade-off for the " equity lords " , but they 're setting themselves up for a big liability . <p> AJ said , <p> " Under no circumstances get yourself indebted . " <p> What 's your take on student loans ? ie. Reasonable debt load , career training ( not for a BA in the Humanities ) . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @AJ Student loans are probably the worst kind of debt from the perspective of indenture . They ca n't be discharged in bankruptcy . It thus depends heavily on the interest rate you get . If you can get under the inflation rate , its not too badthen its just the price of admission for the job . If they are above inflation , like 3%+ , watch out ! In terms of controlling the professional work force , massive student loans are probably the most brilliant debt scheme ever . <p> In short they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar duration of work , that is , if the education took 4 years , the student loans should be paid back in 4 years , my opinion . <p> How do you play China into this rational ? Feels like the Chinese nation state is n't going to get any weaker and that they are getting stronger in global trade agreements ? Interestingly , China also prospered relatively well during European Feudalism . <p> Mo said , <p> @AJ , Jacob ; Having paid off an excessively large amount of student debt , I consider myself an expert in this area , though its not a title held with pride . <p> I agree that student loans are not " good debt " , as some suggest . I also agree that student loans can be a driving force pushing many people toward a borrow/work/consume lifestyle . And I agree wholeheartedly with the concept that the debt should be limited so that it can be paid off in a short amount of time . <p> I disagree with the notion that one should place much emphasis on the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student debt . Inflation benefits the debtor only if the debtors wages ( or earnings ) increase along with inflation . There is no guarantee that your individual wages will increase just because inflation exists/increases . <p> For some professions , wages may not keep pace with inflation , may stagnate , or may decrease due to factors that are not predictable or controllable by the individual . Furthermore depending on the discrepancy between inflation and wage growth , and whether or not there is inflation in the cost of essential items , inflation can actually make it harder for a debtor to repay debt . For example , if essential food prices increase , but an individuals wages do not , there is less money left over to pay off debt ( assuming the debtor chooses to not to become malnourished or starve ) . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @dpmorel China+India are 2 billion people competing for the middle class position currently held by 1 billion **28;1107;TOOLONG . Due to resource limitations , the pie is not getting bigger , therefore it will be divided differently . The latter three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt them in the aggregate but benefit some of their workers . <p> I do n't  agree with your assessment on the Roman Republic/Empire ( unless you 're using a different standard of comparison that I may be unfamiliar with ) , but you are definitely right on the money that history comes in cycles and I think that we will be moving toward something similar to feudalism . <p> Of course , I 'll take the opposite side of your implied belief here and state that I think a feudal society would trump the crass " democracy " that were experiencing ( or experienced ) . I think that Huxley nailed it in Brave New World : when the mob took over , happiness became the only pursuit . Ironically , a democratic society is often founded by visionaries , but once these visionaries pass away , the next few generations squander the work of those who built such a successful society . That is what were seeing in the United States , and as an analogy , that 's what Rome saw toward its end ( Juvenal and others were disgusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republic over Feudalism , yet I would never approve of democratic mob rule as they end as quickly as they begin . Happiness is for the unevolved , and even some modern psychological evolutionists are admitting that the human brain may be wired in such a way that humans can never achieve a perpetual happy state . Essentially , were happy for a few days , but then back to normal ; but , as they point out , this keeps us moving and working toward something ( I learned this from FEE Austrian Economics Seminar Podcast ) . Essentially , vision is what makes life worth living . <p> Otherwise , I applaud your post since it looks at the larger picture in a historical context , which people wont find anywhere in the educational system . <p> LOL the last sentence of the previous commentator . Umm yeah you will . You might have to sit in on a few of those useless " humanities " classes for it , though . <p> csdx said , <p> @Jacob re : student loans , but if your lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out ahead . Of course if you 're only planning on working for 5 years the equation changes , but even with a pretty accelerated 10 or 15 year schedule ( or part time work after retiring ) , I 'd imagine most ( state ) college tuition are worth it . Hmm thinking about it , if I were actually saving 75% of my income I 'd be able to pay back my loans within 2 years . <p> Also I think the pie is getting bigger ( at least as far as world GDPs ) . But you are right that there are only so many resources on earth ( although with new technology we can get access to the harder to reach/ riskier ones , see deep-water drilling ) . But I think a better measure is the per-capita GDP . And a trend has been that the more affluent , the less children . So if the trend continues as China/India/Africa develop maybe the coming resource crisis wont be as bad , and we level into the population cap , rather than hit the boom and bust cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major policy shifts to push sustainability further than it is going , its one of the few systematic trends we have going for us. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @csdx " Hows that deep water drilling working for ya so far , BP ? " ; -/ <p> Now for the money question . Suppose you were falsely convicted for a crime . As a result , you were in prison for 15 years of your life . Upon finding out that you werent the one who did it , your name is cleared completely and you 're awarded $15 million in damages . This is clearly a stellar return . The question is , if you could replay history , would you want things to happen in the same way again ? <p> I 'd say , in answer to most of your points , its not all about the money . Money is currently how we make most of our " human " laws " ; or at least the most important ones . The other way is legislation by career politicians who are elected by a popular vote . The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ultimately compatible with natures laws . This causes a strain in the systemkinda like tectonic fault linesand these strains are occasionally released . There are actually many things we cant do(*) no matter how much money exists . Economists are unaware of thissubstitution is one of their main articles of faith . <p> ( * ) Most importantly ; we cant make free energy and we cant recreate life from scratch Yet , were destroying both . <p> csdx said , <p> I do n't  think college is just trading money for time , but really time for time . Assuming its a net profit , then you 're essentially trading college time for being out of the workforce earlier , or a higher quality of life for the consumerist . Though , you can value your time in your 20s more than your 80s which can skew the equation . However , if , as your prison analogy suggests , you view your time in college as a terrible quality of life reduction ( but not your job ) , then there 's no reason to trade college time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your prison analogy is " how much quality of life am I sacrificing now for more later " . Personally , though I enjoyed my college years , and even met my fiancee there , so for me I 'd call it time well spent to retire early ( since I 'm not going down the ERE path the payoff is over a longer period of time ) . <p> Re : economics v reality . I do n't  see them as fundamentally opposed . To paraphrase , all economic models are as good as the assumptions put into them . So while we can assume things that are wrong ( infinite energy ) , it does n't  mean the whole field is wrong . Also models necessarily can not account for paradigm shifts . Take the standard supply-demand curve , if what was an inelastic demand suddenly becomes something people learn to do without ( or find a new alternative ) , the models predictions fall apart . <p> Instead I see the root issue in humans tendency to be short sighted . Thus , well want politicians to act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even despite logic or a good economic model telling us its in our long term disinterest . <p> for a lot of people in the West . Early Retirement Extremes Jacob is brighter than me and has summarised the trends pretty well . I did n't  see quite as much of the big picture until my nose was rubbed in it in 2007 , but <p> Carol@inthetrenches said , <p> Has anyone come across statistics in their reading on how much land and/or business in America is now owned by foreign holdings ?

@@42287794 @2287794/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Jacob Can you tell me what kind of bike you own/price range ? I am shoppng for a bike which I hope to use for errands and at least 3 days/ week to work . I 'm 45 female and in fair/good physical condition The dealers i spoke to all recommend different brands . They were not helpful . thanks JL <p> Although I already gave an answer , I have thought a bit more about it , so here is an expanded answer . It depends on several things . For instance , I ride a road bike and I like to go fast . I practically treat my commute as a race ( all within the laws of traffic yes , I 'm the guy who will stand and wait at a red light at 3am when nobody is around ) . When I stop at intersections , I race the cars to the other side ( and typically win ) and when I see another cyclist , I 'm thinking " his/her ass is mine " rather than " Aw , that is nice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " = . I also do interval training on the bike and since I started I have added an inch to my legs , lost 5 pounds , and lower my resting heart rate from 55 to 45 . My bike has no room for fenders and no braze-ons for racks . <p> I bought it new from the local bike shop and paid $1300+taxes . They spent 1 hour fitting it to me adjusting the height , length and angle of the saddle , handlebars . When I got a loose crank somewhat later , they tightened it for free . <p> Now , you may think this is a lot of money for a bicycle , but just how much did you spend for your car ? Considering this is my primary transport I thought I could pay a little extra for quality . The good thing about bikes is that it is much easier to buy relatively high-end equipment(*) . So while I would never pay $25,000 for a mid-range car as I do n't  derive any pleasure from driving , I will certainly pay $1,300 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several other areas , where it is possible to buy the best of the best ( or nearly so ) without being stupendously rich . You just have to change your aim a bit . Instead of buying high-end sports cars , you buy high-end " sports " bikes . Instead of collecting rare paintings , you collect hand-made custom knives . Instead of buying store brand soda , you buy Coca Cola , incidentally , I prefer Sams Cola ( the Walmart brand ) over Coca Cola . <p> I got my previous commuter bike for $35 . That was a $70 Walmart mountain bike bought used from a professor that was leaving campus . Was that a cheap or a frugal purchase ? Well , it was certainly cheap , and the bike also sucked . The front brake was broken so eventually I had to time stops in advance since my braking length was about 20 yards ( my ride was mostly off road and flat so it was not a big hazard ) . I got a gel-saddle for 25c at a yard sale . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by seemingly upstanding young students ( I was at a rather well known university well known for its moral values ) , I figured I could ditch the bike by parking it unlocked when the crank finally failed . Sure enough , less than a day later somebody stole it . Good riddance and problem solved . Was it frugal ? Consider this . It took 30 minutes to walk and walking was previously my main mode of transportation . Riding the bike took 10 minutes , but I could run the distance in 15 minutes . Since the bike had no fenders , riding was not an option when it rained ( which it did often ) . From that perspective the bike was frugal as well as it saved me 10-40 minutes a day from time to time and the only use for the bike was the off road commute since the drivers in that area apparently got points for hitting cyclists . <p> Therefore picking the right bike depends very much on the conditions you are going to use it for . Are you going to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or snow ? Are you ever going off road ? Do you need to carry anything like clothes or groceries ? How fast do you like to go ? How far do you need to go ? And do you ever plan on doing something else with the bike ? <p> Now being older , wiser , and also uh .. better looking , eh .. would I buy a road bike again ? No . I would sacrifice a few pounds ( my bike weighs 18-19lbs , just a few pounds more than $15,000 Tour de France bikes , a cheap steel bike probably weighs around 25-30lbs ) for more braze-ons , the ability to use fatter tires and take it off road ( my current bike has a spoke count of 16 front 24 read .. if I hit a big rock or drive off a curb , the wheel would go out of alignment ) . Today I would get a touring bike because it is almost as fast as a road bike ( for me ) , but it comes with the ability to mount cargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less fancy gearing , and more bosses for more water bottles ) . It would work about as well for my commute and better for my long distance events . I 'm thinking something like the Surly Long Haul Trucker ( about $1000 with cheap components , I 'd probably upgrade them to at least 105 , because Tiagra shifters just annoy me ) or the Rivendell A Homer Hilsen ( about $3000 ) . <p> Another thing you have to consider when you buy a bike is that riding will probably change you . An untrained individual will be quite uncomfortable on a road bike . The saddle is too hard , the handlebars are too far down so the butt and neck hurts , etc . After several months , this will change . If you buy a more " comfortable " bike , then unless you are a " comfortable " rider , the slow shifting , low gearing ( spin-outs ) , and lack of aerodynamics will begin to annoy you as you get more fit . <p> Maybe one idea is to look at which car you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to ( remember price is not so much an objection for a bicycle as it is for a car ) , what kind would you be driving ? The sports car ? The SUV ? The Jeep ? A van ? A sedan ? Consider the distance for your commute and multiply by 7 . This is the comfort level . For instance , if your commute is 5 miles , imagine driving 35 miles in a Jeep with knobby wheels ( mountain bike ) , would that be fun ? Probably not , unless you love Jeeps . To derive the price level , take the price level of your imaginary car and divide by 25 . Thats would much you would spend on a similar level bike , thereabouts . <h> 23 users responded in " How to pick a commuter bike " <p> I thought you claimed that one should never buy a bike for more that 100 dollars ? = <p> I think a new bike is a bargain . Me , my wife and kids all ride sturdy Dutch Batavus bikes ( www.batavus.nl ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get a new bike when she turnes 12 ) . The bikes cost around 500-700 euro . My wife and I both carry groceries home on our bikes . The kids ride to school on their bikes and we visit friends who live less than 5 miles by bike ( except when the weather is really bad , then we take the car ) . We do practically everything by bike . Since we live in the Netherlands this is common practice . I consider a good bike a good investment . Used daily they last for at least 15 years . I spend about 50 euro every few years on replacements , I think it costs around 50 euro a year to ride a bike . That 's a bargain ! 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Jack I did ? I must be inconsistent then = It is possible to get a used one at that price that will work . Indeed its an interesting question . For instance , for $1300 I could get 13 $100 road bikes . I actually borrowed such a bike initially when I moved here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought the $1300 one mentioned above ( after trying to find one on craigslist but I was too uneducated there not to be ripped off , so I went for the LBS .. hmm = ) . If I had to do it all over , would I do it again ? Yes , but I would probably get a touring bike instead . If I only used it sporadically , I would go for a less expensive model . <p> I think another way of calculating it is cost per mile . Currently mine is about $0.33/mile and declining . <p> As of right now , I think I have spent $0.70/mile on my commuting . I got a older bike ( Panasonic DX-2000 , Panasonic shut down their US wing in 1989 so the bike is at least 19 years old ) and it cost me $160 . I have n't really done much to it ( new tire , new tubes , etc ) and got a nice upgrade for free ( my brother bought me a new seat which revolutionized my riding experience ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I should still probably buy some clipless shoes to go with my clipless pedals as well as some riding shorts , but I just have n't yet . My understanding from walking around my local bike shop is that shoes can be really expensive , but Amazon might have some better deals . My initial goal was to only spend $300 on bike related expenses in the first couple of months so I think I am doing pretty good . <p> I do need to learn a lot more about self bike maintenance , with my next project learning how to work on my shifter ( that probably is n't the technical name for it , but it is the guide over the big gears that moves the chain around ) . In certain gears I think I can hear the chain rubbing against the shifter . This probably is n't good and at the very least makes my riding less efficient . <p> I now commute 22 miles on the day and average about 45 minutes each way . Today I got my first sub 40 minute time . My goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late and dark early , but this could be difficult because stop lights are unpredictable and annoying . <p> Hi Jacob I 'd like to put my two cents in regarding a womans commuter bike . I 'm 52 and not in the greatest shape now , but I used to ride a lot , commuting 22 miles R/T every day , going on 40-50 mile weekend rides , and did one 1,600 mile tour . I AM IN LOVE with my current bike , which was also not expensive ! Its a Specialized Expedition Sport , Womens model . It has 26-inch mountain tires ( smooth on the centerline , so low friction on pavement ) , Shimano components , 8+3 gears , front fork shocks , and both a seat shock and springs . Plus shes pretty ! ( pic here : LONG ... Altogether , with rear rack and front basket , out the door with tax , she was $385 . I love her look like a cross between an Amsterdam bike and a mountain bike . And while pride can be an issue , the truth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3/4 cartilege missing on one side , 1/2 gone on the other ) , plus have a gamey hip . This bike is wonderful because I can get on and off her easily , so I actually get to keep riding ! I commute still every day ( less distance , only 6 miles R/T now ) , but I also throw saddlebags on and do most of my shopping via bike also ( baguettes and celery sticking out ) . I can recommend this bike highly for middle aged women , in shape or out . The bike is high quality , the 8+3 gears are good for hillclimbing or speed , and the additional road friction from the wider tires is n't noticeable at all . Its durable , goes over bumps , driveways , gutters , curbs , etc. easily without being too delicate . She also did n't  cost a lot , so while I would n't want to lose her , if I did it wouldnt be a huge ding . <p> Props for the Panasonic DX-2000 ! ! I rode one of those for 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And I still have it . It was my 2nd adult bike , my mom bought it for me for like $200 new when I was 16 years old . Great , great bikeit still is , I still have it and will be setting it up in 09 as my backup bike . 10158 @qwx420158 <p> Besides fitting your body , I think a commuter bike should have good clearance for fenders and eyelets for attaching a rear rack and baskets , and ideally a front rack as well . There actually are n't  a lot of bikes that are good for this , but the Atlantis by Rivendell is a good choice . It also would probably work well for a woman because it has a shorter top tube than a lot of other bikes , which is better for a womans shorter relative torso length vis-a-vis a mans torso . <p> Budget for a good front light and install a red led light in back , alongside two amber car trailer reflectors . <p> BTW , for car free family lifestyle check out the ZIGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front mount child carrier that you could also use as a shopping trolley on shopping trips . ( more convenient than baskets on the bike because when you go into multiple stores you can take all of your stuff with you ) . <p> Barring the ZIGO , the bikeHOD carrier from the UK looks like the best for shopping but it costs maybe $450 to buy and have it shipped to the US . I have been getting by on just baskets . <p> FruGuy said , <p> Hi Jacob I 'm thinking about buying a folding bike and wanted your opinion of them and this model , in particular . <p> The bike would mainly be used to save time on my 5 mile(R/T) commute in LA .

If you can get one with a coaster brake , youd save a bunch of brake cables as well . <p> You took the words out of my mouth . I just had this exact conversation the other day . If you 're a biker , and that 's a big means of your transportation , is n't it worth all the money in the world to get a nice bike . Why sacrifice so much quality to save a few hundred dollars ? More importantly , bikes are AMAZING for your healththe better the bike , the more you 'll love it and want to ride it , and the healthier you 'll be . You really need to view a bike as though it were a car , or even more valuable than a car given the health benefits . <p> Caine said , <p> Just bought a used Dahon Speed D7 folding bike and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of train and bus riding in the future and found they have very few options for full size bikes but cater to folders .

It looks like a road bike , but with more forgiving geometry . Theyre built to be raced off-road , so they are beefier than the lily-livered aluminum or carbon fiber road bike . <p> I own a Brodie Ronin , a steel cross bike , which I toured with in France .

If its the only bike you own , ability to fit slightly wider tyres is a bonus . Fender mounts are nice but there are great real full length plain black plastic fenders available now that can fit anything , even track bikes and high end road bikes , called road racers I think ( better than those sks things ) . Get it fitted properly by a trained bike fitter . The more you ride the better it gets . <p> I prefer good health over either of those choices . I drink mostly ( filtered ) water . <p> ly said , <p> Look into the bikes used in countries where bike commuting is default over cars . The Netherlands does bikes SO WELL !

Fit is more important than anything else . A crappy bike that fits you like a glove will be more useful than the best bike in the world that fits you poorly . <p> 2 . New riders are terrible at determining if a bike will fit them so take someone along who can give you some advice who is n't trying to sell you a bike . <p> 3 . Bike shops want to sell what they have on the showroom floor so if things are n't  feeling right do n't  buy what they recommend .

Generally this is free or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again new riders are terrible at this so ask someone to help you . <p> 5 . Riding a bicycle should be a pain free experience . If your bike hurts you something is wrong . If you have done no exercise in a long time and the pain is not acute its worth keeping going to see if your body will adjust . But do n't  drag this out too long before you get some help . Nothing saps your desire to ride like an uncomfortable bike . <p> El said , <p> Most places in the world do not have the bicycle infrastructure as in he Netherlands . <p> 1 . To ditch the car , use the bike to do groceries ( up to 20 pounds ) . Use a backpack or big nessenger bag ( without brazed-on for rear racks ) or shopping panniers which you can even homemade to save some money ( with rear rack ) . 2 . Have a habit of stopping by in the park for a cup of tea ( on a thermos ) , I do my chin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other half of the exercise . 3 . I find the ride on the foldable bike not like riding a bike ( maybe due to the small wheel ) . My first bike is a foldable cost around 300 dollars and still uses it when my car has to go in for servicing so it go in the car and can ride out and later when the car is ready ride back to the shop . Other than that or on very short trips , its not been used much . 4 . A cheap mountain bike would be the best all rounder . Maintenance is cheap and the 26 inch wheels 36 spokes are basically indestructible compare with 32 spokes or less 28 inch road bike . A good used one would be a nineties Trek 900 or even 800 series . 100 dollars supermarket bikes are not recommended as they rust easily and parts are bad . It needs to be at least 250 or more new for one that can last . 5 . A road bike would have have he best speed but probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the load around half ( 10-15 pounds ) . More maintenance and unless one can find a decent used one a starter would be around 500 or more . 6 . Commuter bikes has upright riding position , easy ride , rear racks , very urban and useful but could be boring for some . 7 . Best to try test ride and choose depends on your requirements . I have three bikes , foldable , low cost mountain bike and a fixie. = 8 . If I can completely ditched the car then it will be two bikes only , one for fun and other a workhorse .

I have a nice manual Schumacher with big copper windingsnone of that digital stuff . <p> Sodium carbonate also known as washing soda .

If not , go to the gardening/pool section and look for pH booster or pH up , which is what I got . <p> A piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel as that contains amounts of metals that are toxic . I use a door hinge , but rebar is perfect . The important thing is that it has a large surface area . <p> Unless you used stainless steel , the solution is also non-toxic .

The negative can be submerged no problem . <p> The higher the amp , the hotter the process . This is not good . Just stick with 2 amp . <p> Stupid things you should not do ! <p> Do not use sodium chloride ( kitchen salt ) it produces chlorine gas which is not only not very good for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or do anything that causes sparks . Keep the charger as far as possible from the solution . The reaction releases hydrogen ( as well as chlorine gas if you 're being stupid ) . Think Hindenburg . So keep it outside in a well-ventilated area . <p> Do NOT use a metal bucket . Consider where the ions like to go , right ? To the rusty bolt on the ground clamp , not the bucket . <p> Do not stick your hands in the water . Do not stick anything else in the water . <p> Make absolutely sure the clamps AND whatever is attached to the clamps do not touch each other and short circuit . Your charger wont like that ! <p> 12V is not going to kill you unless your resistance is low , which incidentally is the case if your hands are wet and covered in electrolyte , or you 're wearing a metal bracelet or rings in which case , well , just do n't  . <p> I 'm sure there are other stupid things you shouldnt do , so if you feel like you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its better to leave it alone . <p> Other than that I have had great success with it .

I do n't  know about you , but I get a kick out of it .

This is only true insofar their customers are efficient in the same way the stock market is believed to be efficient : Everybody has all the information available and make rational conclusions . <p> I 'm sorry , but I do n't  have that much faith in humanity . <p> What actually happens is that each company offers a range of prices , high and low and they are aiming to take each others high paying customers by offering a lower rate while retaining their own high paying customers . <p> This maximizes profit of both the individual insurance company and the insurance industry as a whole . What is happening is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other but rather against their customers . <p> I hope I am not stating the obvious . <p> Think of it as a game with certain rules . You all know the rules . Work hard and you shall be rewarded . Call the insurance company following this script and you shall get your rate lowered . This does not just concern the insurance industry but also the investment industry ( why are index funds popular ? Is it because they are simple or because they provide the industry with cheap non-controlled funds ? ) , the drug industry ( drugs for everything ) , and so on . There are a lot of well-intentioned stooges in the world willing to help you compete . But who wins <p> Maybe the best way to think of it is to see the world as a casino . There are players and there 's the house ; except nobody realizes there is a house and perhaps there is no house or man behind the curtain in the first place . <p> It is very convenient to believe that there is a powerful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an **27;1170;TOOLONG way of seeing things and it does not explain anything . <p> The so-called man behind the curtain is an emergent property of the system . It is a pattern originating and slowly developing as all the actors play out their role and try to maintain their vested interests . It can happen as most people are just interested in living a simple non-complicated life just doing their thing and going about their ways . This pattern can not be reduced to individual components in the system . In other words , there is no one person or group of persons that are pulling the strings . <p> No , everybody is pulling each others strings and so the strongest emergent qualities stay alive almost in an evolutionary sense . You may think of these as " supermemes " . ( You are probably already familiar with memes . ) A supermeme would be a meme that no person would really hold but would exist on the meta level of human behavior . It is like how air molecules organize themselves in a hurricane . The individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be a quality that let 's the media companies that promote fear draw the most attention and thus be the most profitable . It would be a quality that means that reinforcing the status quo is more powerful that challenging it . <p> These supermemes are controlling the regular memes in the sense that they determine the available choices . It is maintained by the limited choices that people have . They think they have many choices , but what they really have are many options and no choices . <p> Few get to choose their choices and make their own way . <p> I recently saw a poll asking people what their most important goal was for 2010 : Earn more , be more productive , start a business , travel . Four choices meant to appear exhaustive . What is more telling is the absence of other choices : Gain friends , attain enlightenment , become a better parent , A similar effect is seen during elections . Too many people believe that a vote on a third party in a two party system is wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Consider your environment . Your behavior . Everybody elses behavior . How much of that is due to the belief that they are doing the right thing without knowing why . How much of this behavior is simply " going along " ? If you look at your 20 biggest influences to which degree are they all saying the same thing and have they reached this conclusion because it is epistemologically true or merely by parroting each other ? <p> Fun fact : Humans are more likely to believe something that is repeated often rather than something that is demonstrably true . <h> 10 users responded in " Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain " <p> Your post really underlines why watching tv and generally ingesting mass media is probably not good for figuring things out on your own . All that not listening to the experts takes a great deal of time and concentration . If you spend 10 hours a week on TV ( and ingesting conventional wisdom ) , you probably need to spend at least another 10 counteracting all the assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And your point about having all the info not necessarily helping couldnt be more true . <p> I recently purchased US health insurance so that if I had a terrible car accident during my visit home I would be cared for . I had way too much information availablepages and pages of items comparing one insurance to another and all I wanted was something to keep us from going bankrupt in case of dire emergency . I thought I 'd chosen wisely ( but certainly did n't  take the time to sift through all the info because it would have taken months ! ) I purchased a short term insurance that I thought would be good for my 1 month visit . <p> But while I was gone , DH had a bad accident in France ( thank god it was in France ! ) . This demonstrated to me first hand that having short term insurance for a catastrophic accident ( or long term illness ) is worthless . DH has already been in the hospital for one month . If his insurance was ending now , hed be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( expensive ! ) rehab before he can walk . <p> Incredible . I had all the informationmore information than I could even ingestIm of above average intelligence and education too ( ok , ok , everyone thinks they 're above average , but I 've had the IQ test for what its worth ) . But wow , what a bad insurance decision I madeluckily nothing bad happened because the insurance I chose was basically worthless ! <p> Anywaycool postyour posts always get me thinking . <p> Steven Austin said , <p> Trish , Nassim Taleb makes the killer point that almost any level of skill/talent is often handily dominated by luck ( bad or good ) . Havent decided whether I have fully embraced that point , but I am regularly riveted by it . <p> ERE , the two ideas that most struck me in your post were the " emergent supermeme " and " more telling is the absence " . Ive been practicing synthesis lately and so I 'm left here with the suggestion that what is most telling is not the supermeme that emerges , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That Which Is Seen And That Which Is Not Seen " essay several years ago and am still reeling from it . So we are here ruminating on your post about what we see unfolding " in front of us the curtain " and what we suspect perhaps unfolding " behind the curtain " . Weve " gone meta " and The Curtain has emerged as a property of our avenue to understanding our environment . The curtain supermeme has emerged , but most importantly , what supermeme(s) has(have) *not* emerged ? <p> Alex Oliver said , <p> The " fun fact " was Hitlers PR strategy . <p> AJ said , <p> " They think they have many choices , but what they really have are many options and no choices . " <p> Or , they have many options for the same choice ( or a very limited set fo choices ) . <p> Great post ! <p> hickchick said , <p> I 'm from Tornado Alley where you have one of two options during a storm . <p> You can stand out in a field and hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunker down and wait for the storm to pass . <p> I can honestly say that it never occurred to me to TRY TO BECOME GREATER THAN THE SUN and change weather patterns . <p> OK , maybe I 'm stupid , but you completely lost me again with this one . I re-read the first paragraphs about the insurance thrice and I still do n't  get how that is an example of " having all the facts available while remaining oblivious to the connection between them . " <p> I think the problem with your entries of this sort is that you quickly shift through too many topics and ideas . You do n't  fully develop any one idea . <p> What I 've found w/ some of my writing is that it makes complete sense when I first type it . If I come back to it after thinking about something else , I 'll notice all types of omissions and unfinished thoughts . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Steve Austin So if I understand this correctly , the interesting question is a ) the emergent behavior ( supermeme ) has an " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; b ) if the current supermeme did not evolve , what else would have evolved ; and c ) what will the current supermeme evolve to ? <p> In response to ( a ) the fact that behavior is decentralized makes it very hard to attack " keystone " beliefsthere are too many keystonesand this makes this supermeme very resilient . Another point of resilience is certainly that very few are capable of seeing it . It is similar to Neo seeing that something was not quite right in the matrix movie ( prior to the blue pill ) . <p> In response to ( b ) ( and partially c ) , the real question is whether we are in a climax stage wrt our environment or we can expect some succession . I think we are but that the environment is and will change due to our actions . We are still operating as if the environment is an untouchable boundary condition but it is not . When the environment starts interacting dynamically with the sociotechnological system , the supermeme has to evolve . <p> I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the stuff ( 3 chapters ) in the book I am working on will cover this . <p> @Alex Oliver Also , people are more likely to believe a big lie <p> @AJ That is what I was trying to say . <p> @hickchick You could also move out of Tornado Valley . <p> @mockum The second paragraph is what is obvious . The 4th and 5th paragraph ( between the two single lines ) is the hidden part ( hidden to the consumer/personal finance strategy level , obvious to the company strategy level ) . I like to think of these posts as a kind of book of five rings writing where rereading after a while will bring new understanding as they operate on several different levels . Another way to say it is that I 'm too lazy to write everything out = <p> Long time reader and first time poster . I do n't  know how you come up with these unusual and excellent topics but keep them up . I really enjoy your site . <p> sophomore said , <p> Many have heard the Adam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand .

@@42287806 @2287806/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I have written earlier about my experiences with peer to peer lending . Personally , I treat it like an investment no different from any other investment . In my experience the risk/return rates are similar to liquid junk bonds . However , peer to peer lending has a social component to it and it is a lot more intimate than putting limit orders on junk bond ETFs . You are essentially trusting a stranger with your money . This social component along with the bidding process can make peer to peer lending rather engaging . When things work out I do feel that I am directly helping somebody out . Conversely , when somebody intentionally screws me over , I do , in a sense , take it personal . Then of course there 's the bidding process . Luckily , I have been conservative here and never gone below my pre-established minimum rate . Think of it as stop loss . Nevertheless , while I personally prefer to stay out of this game ( just like I prefer to stay out of forex and naked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnival of peer to per lending just arrived . The first article in the carnival is a good summary of various tips and experiences from different PF bloggers . If I may add something . Try lending a small amount e.g. whatever amount you could comfortably loose outright for a year and see how it goes . Remember , loans have a horizon of three years , so it is wise to build positions on a time frame of three years . That is longer than most peoples patience , including mine when it comes to investing in debt . Time is really the key here since six or even nine months is not enough to tell how stable a borrower is . I think one emotionally needs to learn how to deal with defaults and delinquencies before committing more money . Personally , I have a hard time with people breaking their promises in a situation where I can do absolutely nothing , so peer to peer lending is not for me . <p> " Personally , I have a hard time with people breaking their promises in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw about 10k into Lending Club as a trial and thought I could deal with the defaults as merely a cost of doing business , just as drops in the stock market can reduce principal or a drop in stock price after a CEO asks for a sexual harassment suit by canceling consulting contracts after being spurned . However , when a loan does n't  even receive a single payment , its a little disheartening . I 'm going to give it more time and see how it goes . No five year loans for me though . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I am neither the sharpest knife in the drawer , nor am I savvy at all about the lending thing you are talking about . I read the experiences you had from your previous post as well . So you install an amount of money into Prosper or Lending Club , and then lend it out to Joe Dokes after Joe files an application and you " bid " on it based on his application ? ( I have not researched the Proper or Lending Club websites but I certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of faith then in your fellow man ! So are you saying somebody could borrow $50.00 or $100.00 from you and you simply " trust " them to pay you back ? What is the recourse if they do n't  ? Do you just lose ? I am not sure I would make a formal loan to anybody who just needed $50.00 . Even if I knew them well . If someone can not come up with 50 bucks from somewhere , to me they are pretty well toast anyway . In my apartment complex , I lent $20.00 a month to a certain tenant . This was usually on the 27th of each month . It was to carry him on Budweiser until he got his SS check on the 3d of the following month . I made him pay me back $21.00 . He never failed , but I had him by the yang if he did not pay me . In my experience with peopleI sorrowfully could not invest in a lending program . <p> Hi Jacob , I thought about lending several years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals . It seemed like way too much work , even though the potential return was enticing . I just stick with the asset allocation I am comfortable with and ride the ups and downs with patience . Over time , my returns have been good ! <p> Q said , <p> I use peer to peer lending as part of my forming portfolio and I like it quite a bit . Yes , people default , but , this is what banks go thru . <p> As a lender you have the added advantage of the site doing a lot of legwork , and can just go on stats instead of just the sob story . <p> Plus , if you have great credit , you can take a loan from said site @ say 6-9% , then turn around and lend for 24%+ . Just like a bank , you make that spread and so far it has worked . Just like stock picks , you win some , you lose some . <p> Generally I like to send goons over to hang out outside their doors but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my creditworthiness checking pans out . <p> csdx said , <p> @HSpencer , usually the total amount of the loans are in the range of thousands of dollars or so ( I think most sites cap at 25k ) , and your $50 goes in as a portion of the total . Of course if you wanted to you could just back the entire loan , but otherwise you can divide your money among various loans ( and have your very own subprime empire ) . The loan can be for anything , from business startup capital to consolidating credit card debt , just whatever the person wants to write . <p> And as for trust , the recourse you have as much as a bank does when someone defaults on any unsecured credit . Really if you own any investments your in exactly the same business , just more indirectly . After all earning passive income ( dividends , capital gains ) is all about trusting someone else to put your money to work , rather than do it yourself . <p> Macs said , <p> I 'm using Zopa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some advantages over Lending Club and Prosper . For a start you can lend into markets as well as listings ( Zopa listings seem to be the same as LC and Prosper , and generally I avoid them for the same reasons ) . <p> But by lending into the markets you get a lot more back up from the site . Zopa themselves use proper credit reference agencies to vet borrowers , and debt recovery agencies , for one thing ! Default on Zopa and you get chased to court if necessary . <p> So far I 've not put much in only -350 spread over four markets from A* down to C ( and one listing , which is a special case ) About five months in everyone is paying on time , no arrears . I 'm reinvesting the payments , so I now have effectively -390 out on loan at an average gross rate of 9.6% ( 8.6% net of fees ) . <p> If its still going well at the end of the year , I might up my stake a bit . Yes , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or 5 years if you 're in the 60 month markets ) , but the way I 'm looking at it , I could tie it up in a bank saving bond for that length of time and struggle to get 4% . I could put it into equities and face a similar risk of capital depreciation , and there are n't  many shares with current 8.6% dividend yields . With Zopa I have the choice to keep re-lending , all the while building up the monthly repayments and compounding the capital , or if I need to , I can stop re-lending and have a small monthly income by withdrawing it , over a space of three years . The longer I can go on re-lending before I need to draw the income , the larger that income will become , of course . Shares dividends do n't  come monthly , and a saving bond has penalties if you take the money back before term . <p> So , as part of a diversified portfolio for a small proportion of my assets , I 'm very happy to keep it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all . <p> I suspect but have n't looked into details yet a tax advantage can be had by declaring it as a business rather than personal venture and applying for a Consumer Credit Licence I quite like the idea of becoming a financial institution , however small = <p> Robert Muir said , <p> I just checked on my account and I 'm $25 ahead , three months later , ( after taking the $200 default ) . The only reason it was $200 was due to an error I made in the very beginning when I accidentally invested $100 twice with that note . Also , in reviewing the deadbeat , I saw two red flags that I completely missed when I made the loan ( again , a newbie mistake ) . <p> I 'm beginning to feel better about the deal . Like Jacob , I consider it a fairly high risk , junk bond type of play . <p> If your level of risk is lower and you do n't  want to spend a lot of time on it , you can pretty much automate the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would get you over 7% return ( perhaps 5-6% after defaults ) . <p> One of the bloggers I follow just invested $100k in LC . Outside of a calamity , the money should double in about 7 years . <p> I seem to hear about people making double-digit % gains in P2P lending , but is that normal or is that like when people only talk about their wonderful stock picks at parties and leave out all the losers ? Are we just hearing the good stories and not any of the other side ? <p> I 'm a cynic by trade so I do n't  see myself dabbling in this . Seems like a lot of work to get enough diversification . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kevin M I think its a combination of two things . 1 ) Many of those who blog about it only has a handful of loansa few hundred bucks 2 ) Loans tend to perform well for 3-6 months before they go bad . <p> So you could easily see 15% for six months and then suddenly find yourself at -5% because one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very few delinquent loans make a recovery ) . <p> There are only 2 types that can lend money successfully and consistently .. banks and gangsters . Both hold your assets as collateral although in the second case those assets may be subject to damage if you do not pay up . Far too many people make personal loans on a handshake basis and get burned . I have seen too many people stiffed by their own family members . If they can stick you then anything is possible . The solution : Do not lend , ever ! You will not only lose the loan but the friendship/relationship as well . That is why it is always important to disguise the fact that you have surplus funds ie always look like you are just making do . If that fails and you are still approached for a loan you can politely advise that you yourself are looking for some money to borrow . When friends and relations look into your finances like barracuda it is always clever to dissimulate like an inky cuttlefishand make yourself scarce ! <p> Alex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing in Lending Club for almost two years and has been doing quite well . With loans , until they run their course it is hard to tell your actual rate of return , but to this point he is making nearly 13% on his money . Even when one loan defaults , your $25 investment on that loan does n't  take too big of a bite out of your overall gains . <p> I agree that you should never loan to family/friends unless you plan on the money disapeering along with the relationship . But P2P lending through Lending club seems like a good way to diversify your investment portfolio with only a small amount of capital at risk . Just think , a decade ago it would have been next to impossible to make this type of investment with less than 100K . <p> I have about four years experience in lending with Prosper and Lending Club and have lent something like $300K over that time , with about $45K active right now . Thousands of small loans . <p> The main advantages to me are its almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of cashflow , because you are not only being paid interest , there is a considerable amount of principal coming back to you each month that can be reinvested or pulled for other things . Disadvantages are noted above its difficult to liquidate , although you can sell loans now . <p> It has really evolved over time , but is still a " buyer beware " type investment . Its notable that Prosper has gone to mimicking Lending Club in the way it operates LC seems to have the better model for lenders . <p> The key is having a lot of loans and minimizing defaults . You can do stat analysis at http : //www.lendstats.com for both sites . <p> Oh , and I have found its best to avoid lending based on the written descriptions and lend based on the numbers/stats only using the search filters provided , and only the stats you deem most important . <p> To understand why this is true I would have to refer you to the book " Dance With Chance " , which is a very interesting read that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and when it is better to have more data . Paradoxically , more information can often lead to worse decision-making . <p> Ill be interested to read the articles in the " Carnival " . Thanks for posting that . <p> I once met a beautiful girl on North Shore , Oahu while visiting family and for an interview . She was a fun , creative , california hippie girl who was on a 2 year leave from college in the mainland and lived freely while working part time on local farms with native produce to the island . She lended me a favor by picking me up and personally touring me around the island that i was considering living in if a pending interview was successful . <p> I would have lent her $1k in cash for a year long , just after such a favor . Of course she did n't  need any cash living a partial ERE lifestyle . We remain friends and visit each other even to this day . <p> Person to person lending only exists if a certain trust in favors is developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face relationship with your lenders before you even consider lending out money . A 3rd Party bussiness does n't  help the situation any except for legal protection plus fees if that . <p> ( Oahu is my first stop once i achieve ERE ! ) <p> Chucks said , <p> I 've thrown about $50k into Prosper and have to say I 'm pleased with the returns . I joined shortly after Prosper intensified their verification process and started vetting lenders much more carefully . The site is fairly young so its tough to determine the exact default rates for each type of loan , but investing with lenders who have previously held prosper loans definitely reduces default as its very unlikely a scammer is going to borrow money , pay it back with interest and then attempt to borrow some more . My current returns are hovering around 20% something percent , though I expect that will drop off over time . <p> I would n't get into such investing . As it is , DH and I are not currently investing in mutual funds . We would rather have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as practically useful , like land . <p> Jerry said , <p> I have been lending on Lending Club for past couple of years . Its nothing big and even if all my loans defaulted , it would not put a dent in my financials . As a newbie , I used to browse new loans in funding stages in A or B rate . However , after many days of funding , a great number of these loans would not get funded because of investor funds not fulfilling borrowers required amount , or loan in review would not get final approval by Lending Club . If you look at the stats , less than 10% of requested loans actually get lent . So , my funds would sit in the account accruing no interest for days , sometimes weeks . <p> These days , when I have funds to invest , I go to the trading account and buy the secondary loans from other investors . This has three advantages . First , obviously , is that these loans in many cases can be bought at cheaper than new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher interest rate if he wants to sell his loan to the next investor . I have picked up A rate loans at close to 20% . Second , and more importantly , I can see the borrowers track records before taking the leap and taking position . With seasoned loans , past performance of the borrower , along with the credit rating ( which by the way is updated monthly on the trading platform ) , makes investment decision a lot easier and efficient ( third advantage funds invested same day or next day ) . <p> The success and failure stories of P2P lending are always interesting . If you are lucky and get no or only 1 default then P2P works and is great and proves humanitys inner greatness . If you are unlucky and get several defaults then its a scam and humanity is terrible . <p> When we talk about its success and failure I often see it limited to a couple hundred $ as Jacob mentioned in the comment stream . I would say that you 'd need AT LEAST 100 loans to hit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks are not about just a couple dozen loans .

@@42287808 @2287808/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> In my recent post on How to retire in 5 years , I defined financial independence/early retirement at the point where expenses equals 4% of investable assets . Retired Syd asked what my underlying assumptions were for the 4% withdrawal rate , specifically <p> Would someone that is planning on extremely early retirement ( say in their 30 's ) really be safe at a 4% withdrawal rate ? <p> To which my answer is a very qualified " Maybe " . 4% means that a person needs 25 times annual expenses or 300 times monthly expenses . This makes it fairly easy to use in estimations . Of course , such calculations remain estimates . They may be precise but they are far from accurate . 30 years is a relatively short horizon when it comes to liquidating buy and hold investments . The stock market has historically remained flat for periods comparable to this time period ( within a factor 2 ) . <p> A 4% withdrawal rate is the canonical value for late ( 60 year old ) retires planning to live another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after which I will book a one-way cruise trip to shark infested waters and disappear under mysterious circumstances . So having almost 70 years to go , am I safe ? <p> First of all , I am not keen on making one-time estimates on portfolio growth and average inflation and extrapolating this 70 years out like an annuity ( that 's what insurance companies do ) . Volatility ( particularly in the beginning ) can easily kill such extrapolations . It is the same problem when sending a satellite to Saturn . Early mistakes causes much bigger cumulative errors late on than late mistakes . To account for the volatility , I generally use firecalc.coms calculator , which only requires my present annual expenses , my present asset base and the amount of time until the above mentioned trip . The fireclac automatically accounts for historic inflation and historic returns . This is in my opinion better than assuming fixed numbers as it accounts for volatility and thus computes a likelihood that the portfolio will outlive me . <p> Still , will future returns reflect past returns ? In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product of cheap domestic oil , immigration , and military dominance , all of which are unlikely to repeat for another 70 years ? Who knows . <p> This leads me to my real answer to whether a 4% withdrawal rate is safe . I think extreme early retirement is qualitatively different from early retirement . Retirement is typically thought of as spending an accumulated nest egg at a certain rate without income . However , I can not see myself as never having any kind of income again . Who knows what I will be doing in 5 years ? Possibly this is different at age 60 . A 70 year old might very well be doing the same as he did at 65 . I hope not though . I for one am doing different things compared to 5 years ago . I 'm married . I freelance . I 'm very interested in investing . Neither of these were even something I considered 5 years ago . Also I live in another country , something I did not plan either . <p> I also think that true financial independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . It comes from not spending any money at all . I will keep working to make myself more and more independent from the financial system by wheeling and dealing and creating and making rather than buying . Doing so can only make my " retirement " more and more robust . <h> 15 users responded in " How much do I need to save for extreme early retirement ? " <p> But is it really " retirement " if you continue working ? I suppose it depends on what your definition of retirement is . My definition of retirement is walking away from the corporate rat race and doing a few shifts at macs/starbucks et al . I would have to spend a great deal more time at the 9 5 desk job to have enough to retire and never work again . <p> Also Jacob you are a bit shy with your numbers how much of a retirement nest egg do you have ? Do you currently use any of this for living expenses ? <p> Good post though . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I define it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do not need to worry about money again and can go and do something else . I think our definition is fairly similar . I might enjoy serving coffee , maybe , but I would do it only as long as I found it interesting . If money were short because the market had a down turn that cut me short by 5 years , I would like to have to ability to volunteer ( cost of living paid ) somewhere without all the liabilities of the rat race . I could do one year every 5 years . I guess I have to do a post , where I define " retirement " . <p> Yes , I 'm shy about my numbers . You should be able to piece together the clues in my posts to get a good idea about it though . Hint : Its far from the million dollars that all the other pf bloggers seem to want . It seems that pf bloggers either keep their name or their numbers a secret . I plan to eventually reveal my name and make the blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone has some good arguments for posting my networth , I 'll be happy to listen . My worries is that someone starts using it against me , frivolously suing me , breaking into my home , cross referencing my name to account numbers , etc . Maybe I 'm too paranoid . I am currently reallocating my assets for income/yield , that is to say , whenever I have cash , I invest for yield and whenever I sell a position , the monies go to a yield position . I have about half of my living expenses ( after we move out of this expensive rental ) covered by now . The reason that I do n't  do a complete reallocation now is because I can save a lot more on taxes if I wait until I do n't  have a day job income . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> " I also think that true financial independence comes from not spending any money at all . I will keep working to make myself more and more independent from the financial system . " <p> That is a very interesting perspective . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent from the financial system for various budget categories . <p> * food have enough seeds and dirt and perhaps animal stock to replenish your own food . * housing buying a house , trailer , or boat makes one more independent , but there are still taxes to consider . Also maintenance , repairs , and/or insurance . * clothing I can actually imagine buying so many clothes that you never need to buy more . Or you can have cotton , wool , spinning machine , sewing machine , etc . However , I sure like a lot of the fabrics that have come out in the last 20 years and would be sad to miss them . <p> It also strikes me that you could trade financial dependence for dependence on other things such as your social structure , your health , etc . Its probably good to diversify here as well as everywhere else . Have money you can fall back on , skills you can fall back on , friends , church , government programs , land , solar panels , etc . <p> ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current amount each year probably ( 4/12 ) % of the current amount each month . If my investments are doing very well , I 'll put the extra into savings ( and stop counting that money in my " total " ) . If they are doing poorly , I 'll try to live on less , but if I have some savings , I can use that . This way I absorb the volatility . I may have trouble some years , but I wo n't get into a situation where I am out of money forever . <p> Another strategy is to not retire the second I barely have enough , at least not if I have so much because the market is awesome right then . <p> Also , I will generally make my withdrawals from whatever sector is doing best to help keep my portfolio balanced . <p> Ok , I like FIREcalc , but I seem to recall reading somewhere the success percentages beyond 80% become meaningless . Due to the fact you cant predict wars , famine , poor bank leading practices , etc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my case ) the reality becomes we cant predict anything that far in advance so we have to accept the earlier you retire the more unknown your future will be . Accept the fact and adapt as you go . At least that is my plan when I pull the plug in another 15 years . <p> Well , I 've been hanging around the early retirement forums and checked out the firecalc . Like many others have said , its hard to predict the future so the calculator can only be used as a tool . I think saving more is definitely safer than saving less because your expenses could increase unexpectedly . So 4% of the nestegg today may not be enough in 5 or 10 years . I guess I am a bit of a worrywort . As to your networth , if you and your wife are still living on $500 a month then you only need $150k ! : O The hubby and I already saved twice that , but we are only 25 and do n't  think we can retire on that yet . 10155 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you build your own house ? Can you self-insure ? Have you developed a metabolism to need less clothes ? Or the sweat glands to not need AC ? Can you live for less than the deductions for taxes ? <p> @Canadian Dream I meant to include the war , pestilence , famine , and that last one as well but in all the excitement of the writing , I forgot . Another consideration is the bus scenario . I might get hit by a bus tomorrow or I might get terminal cancer in 5 years . We can calculate expectation values forever and ever . What I suggest is to live every day as if one is going to live forever . I do not think that retirement is a financial point . It is just a state of mind . I do n't  plan to change anything fundamental when I " retire " . I do n't  see my life as having two stages other than preretirement means that a job is demanded rather than chosen . Lots of people are mentally trapped by jobs and notions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way , so I can see the difference now . Nothing is ever 100% safe . <p> @thebaglady Yes , but you could also get hit by the bus-scenario above making the quest and effort that has gone into extra safety meaningless . Incidentally , whenever I give my numbers they are for a single person living together with another person . If you want household numbers , double everything I say . I will not make that assumption when I talk about limits though . For instance , if I say it is possible to live on X dollars , I mean that that is possible for a single person . The fact that I live with DW means that I get a few extra benefits due to scaling . <p> mjukr said , <p> Here is your financial insurance policy : are your living expenses sufficiently low such that in the event of a bad market year , a job at McDonalds ( i.e. minimum wage ) is enough to cover the shortfall ? <p> Then you are good . <p> Note : I use the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job that requires zero experience . So even if you 've been out of the " rat race " for 10 years and no longer have marketable skills , you 'll still have a potential source of income <p> My goal was always to retire at 45 . My estimate was that I would need $500,000 which I think is probably the least that anyone should entertain . At this level , you can fairly safely assume a $20,000 to $30,000 return with a conservative investment strategy and easily get by with frugal living and still stash back some of your interest income . <p> Personally , I recently retired at 41 with $700,000 . Everyone thinks I 'm crazy but I think I can make a go of it as a single man with no kids . <p> First of all , I am not keen on making one-time estimates on portfolio growth and average inflation and extrapolating this 70 years out like an annuity ( that 's what insurance companies do ) . Volatility ( particularly in the beginning ) can easily kill such extrapolations . It is the same problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Firecalc and Fidelitys retirement planner . You have to have an account with Fidelity to use this service . Wtih the fido planner you can get a very customized report . I think it is better than firecalc because of this . <p> I am a lot older then most on this forum at 56 . I have retired this year , but my DW is still working . We wont have to go the extreme route , but I find this blog a wonderful storehouse of great ideas to save money . <p> We have a paid off house worth around 300k and retirement accounts of about a million . We have retirement medical insurance from previous employer . It cost us $80 per month with a combined $3000 deductible . It includes $20 3 month prescriptions and dental . I still get income from commissions on my long time accounts about $25k per year and my DW earns about 38k . We hope to move out of tax hell ( Maryland ) in a few years . <p> However without our retirement medical insurance , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you age IMHO . I think you can be proactive and live a very healthy lifestyle , but some illnesses and accidents are in Gods hands . <p> Robert Muir said , <p> Re : " We hope to move out of tax hell ( Maryland ) " <p> Just because MD has Sales , State Income , Piggybacked Local Income , Personal Property , and Real Estate Property taxes ? I left MD back in 78 and never looked back ! <p> michael said , <p> I 'm retiring in two months in my forties ( well , 49 if you must know ) . I 'm not going to spend a fixed 4% percent , but rather will use an the Endowment Spending Policy . I may have to cut back some years , but it should make the money last for me indefinitely . <p> deegee said , <p> Like retired@40 , I am a single man with no kids . When I was closing in on my retirement 2 years ago at age 45 , I did not do the x% SWR calculation . Instead , I calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxable accounts while keeping a good sized IRA for later . I also wanted to run a surplus at least in my early ER years to cover possible deficits later on until I turned 60 and could tap into my " reinforcements " such as the IRA , pension , and SS when in my 60s . <p> I did use Fidelitys Retirement Planner and met with their reps ( I am a Fido investor ) just to make sure I had not left anything out . My SWR rate , BTW , is about 2.4% and the ratio of investments ( taxable and IRA ) to expenses is about 45:1 . <p> bigato said , <p> " some illnesses and accidents are in Gods hands .

@@42287809 @2287809/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Warning : this is a contrarian post and as such it may question some deeply held beliefs . If you keep going you might not like what you read . <p> The education industry has successfully installed the meme that not going to college ( buying their product ) putatively leads to a life in poverty . A common selling point is a piece of shoddy statistics that demonstrates the correlation between average income and level of education . For whatever reason education takes longer and longer while getting more and more expensive at rates way above inflation level . This has promoted counter studies questioning the monetary value of going to college compared to just getting a job and avoid incurring sometimes massive student debt . To alleviate this problem ( and perhaps help the education industry ) the government has introduced 529 plans to allow institutions to charge even more for their degrees . All in all this is a great deal for the educational institutions but is it a good deal for you ? Is it a good deal for society ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convincing people that it is impossible to live without a car hey wait ! <p> This post was actually inspired by Brip blap , wrote a post called A clear and present danger : the humanities . One of his points was that the government should encourage educational programs that result in higher salaries ( such as engineering ) and discourage degrees that tend to lead to lower salaries ( such as English Litt. and ancient Egyptian algebra ) . Also financial aid should be cut for people who take longer than 4 years to finish their degree . The result would be for the government to subsidize students that will keep the US at the forefront of technological innovation as opposed to the forefront of publications of deconstructionist studies in incomprehensible sociology journals ( ? ) I found myself agreeing until he said he was being sarcastic = . I guess this means we disagree then . Hence this post . <p> The idea suggested in the article above has actually been promoted by a number of European governments . With the lower birth rates of an affluent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science and engineering ) is a genuine problem in Europe . With the higher birth rates of the US , manpower is not as dire a problem . Europe has to get the most out of their youth and thus they desire to steer students towards building bridges and computers and away from writing yet another study on suicidal poets of the 18th century . Also getting them out of the door fast helps too . <p> I 'll take this one step further . <p> I think the idea that college education leads to a more productive society is wrong . Hard work and intelligence leads to productivity . What happens when we send 70% to college instead of 30% on the false presumption that education makes people more productive and talented is simply that the levels are dumped down . To keep getting the cream of the crop , education is extended for the smarter part ( the 30% ) . The other 40% get a degree that no longer means a lot . Hence we waste 4 years by sending 100% to highschool , 70% to college and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school with higher standards , 30% to a college with higher standards and only a few to higher educations . <p> Your talents helped you earn your degree not the other way around . <p> The problem is that higher education does not make people smart or more intelligent . Rather it serves the functions of <p> separating the rich parents kids from the poor parents kids with some monetary allowance made for exceptionally bright kids of poor families and a lot of intellectual allowance made for less bright kids from rich and influential families . <p> getting money from students parents to fund the university sports center , domed buildings , and professors that are researching increasingly specialized and often irrelevant subjects . If it werent for grad students who are mainly admitted to serve as TAs rather than for their bright ideas , the show would be even more expensive unless professors would be paid less or universities would be built like barracks rather than expensive imitations of medieval castles or modern architecture . <p> regulating entry to the job market . This is the their most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher the degree is required . There is a negative feedback mechanism here . Prolonged education helps decrease growth as it allows people to spend multiple years attending lectures , playing varsity sports and being generally unproductive . <p> Increased education does not lead to more productivity . Rather it is increasing productivity that leads to the country being able to afford parking their young in essentially unproductive endeavors for increasing amounts of time . <p> Modern education reads like an intellectual travesty . There are four reasons why this is so . These are : 1 ) 2 ) 3 ) 4 ) On the test : List the four reasons why modern education is an intellectual travesty . Thus any person with reasonably well developed intelligence and short term memory can get a degree . <p> Unless you need highly specialized knowledge ( researcher , brain surgeon , accountant , ) a college degree is little more than an admission ticket to get your foot in the door of the white collar work force . <p> I predict that a more accurate study that corrects for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in having an office job rather than having a degree . This would eliminate the two main financial reasons for going to college . It would relegate college to be a place of higher learning and thinking . I think it is naive ( I used to be highly naive ) to expect these qualities amongst the student population in modern universities . <p> I TAed for a couple of years . Maybe 1 in 10 of my students were actually interested in learning something . The rest just wanted their degree so they could go out and get banking jobs under the illusion that people with hard science degrees are smarter than average . Well , maybe , but if they are , why do they need a degree to prove it ? <p> What smart students care about is economically maximizing their GPA . Studies in economics even uses this idea as a text book example . I cant think of a better example that demonstrates the cynicism of modern education . <p> Most office jobs do n't  require an understanding of history , biology , medicine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective short term memory . It should not have to take 4 years to figure out who has that and who has n't  . <p> I suggest return to a gilded system of masters and apprentices . That way people can feel like productive members of society much earlier and does not have to go through the lord of the flies experience of high school . I think this would work . I am positively convinced that if you give me a 13 year old with an IQ of 135+ and a sense for numbers I can teach him how to perform my work in 3-5 years . The counter argument is that a 13 year old would not know whether he wanted to be a carpenter , a dentist , or a research scientist . However , some 22 year olds do n't  know either . In any case it would not be harder for someone to change apprenticeship than it is to change career today . <p> One may argue that this is strictly training ( focusing the mind ) and not education ( broadening the mind passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only be teaching exactly what is useful . However , I submit that you can not educate a person that is fundamentally uninterested in a topic ( the GPA maximizers ) . I have forgotten many things I learned through HS and college since these subjects were useless to me other than contributing to ( and mostly lowering ) my GPA . On the other hand a sufficiently clever and voracious person can learn things on his own at any time . <p> With the perfection of the printing press books are so cheap that one no longer have to go attend lectures to copy down the notes from the professor ( the high price of books was the original intent of lectures and the difficulty of communicating new research was the original reason for seminars talk about institutional inertia ! ) . It is also possible to get lectures and curricula from places like the teaching company , the personal MBA , the self made scholar , and many others . Oh , and the library ! <p> Of course this does not solve the problem of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certain financial subjects focus on certifications rather degrees . On the other hand college degrees are getting so diluted that employers have started testing potential employees because they can no longer trust the quality of education with so many being admitted it had to happen , market forces right ? ! Possibly such companies will outsource this testing . This will result in a new breed of institutions that test whether students actually learned anything at the other institutions . At this point one could skip the education and just go for the certification . <p> What to do until then ? You could either do the tried and true and spend a ton of money ( and opportunity cost ) on getting a degree or you could be entrepreneurial and try to get your foot in the door in some other way . As long as you can get your foot in the door , being autodidact practically puts on you on equal grounds with a college grad . <p> Disclaimer : I have a MS in one area , a PhD in another area . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could lead to the conclusion that either I 'm a hypocrite or that I 'm bitter and not too smart . <h> 96 users responded in " The secret of education " <p> I think you are romanticizing premodernisim a bit . Living under church rule was pretty oppressive as I am sure you are well aware . For a modern example one would not have to look further than fundamentalists that are alive today . I agree that societies thought is not ruled by science but still by the mythic belief that existed in premodernisim . However , I believe there is a larger population of rationalist that exist today influencing those at the mythic stage of development hence no witch hunts , slavery and other travesties that existed in premodernity . I also believe due to this influence many at the mythic stage have taken on the next stages language or science to support their beliefs . This is the reason why such books as the Secret are popular . Basically magical mythic beliefs pumped full of a pseudoscience to make it sound legit . It goes to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the masses still griped by their mythical beliefs . Postmodernity is needed because we have to be aware that different worldviews exist and that people who observe the same thing will explain things differently . I think this would solve a bunch of problems the world is going through at this moment . If we could realize that people can explain a similar observation in different ways such problems as religious tensions would be non existent . I agree with you that the downfall of postmodernity is assuming that all observations are equal . I believe that there is a hierarchy of thought . That is a dangerous statement to make , it reminds me of plato stating that the philosopher should be the ruling class because they have the highest thoughts and then putting himself in that ruling class . That being said sometimes I agree : ) . I think this is actually the downfall of democracy . Here you have the vast majority of people stuck at a mythic stage of development where majority rules . This is why people such as Sarah Palin exist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view is needed . Have you ever read Spiral Dynamics by Don Beck and Chris Cowan ? They explain the developmental stages that societies go through more elegantly than I can . In it they state societies have to develop through each stage until the reach the highest stage . In other words you can not skip stages . It was an interesting read . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Financial Samurai I took it off again . Loads to slow . <p> George ( the original one : - ) said , <p> @shawn " people who observe the same thing will explain things differently . " <p> That is a powerful statement for anybody who wonders why so many human interactions , like politics , are n't  rational . Well worth repeating a few dozen times per year ! 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I love Philip Brewers GED-for-college idea . Basically take a test to get the degree instead of spending 4 years to do so . <p> This is basically what I had to do in my career anyway pass the CPA exam . The stuff I learned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those classes . I easily could have skipped the middle-man ( university ) and studied directly for the test after high school . <p> I went to a liberal arts school , so I had to take plenty of non-business classes as well . I 'm sure some of that stuff stuck with me , but my guess is I 've learned more through independent reading which is minimal cost or free ( yay for libraries ) . My appreciation of a good book or nice piece of art has nothing to do with what some professor lectured on . <p> I do agree with some of what you said , but part of college is showing employers that you were able to complete something . You can stick to a schedule ( showing up for class ) , you can make decisions , meet deadlines , work in a team , organize your time effectively , etc . All college students learn these skills . They transfer over well into the workplace . <p> Bridget said , <p> I think you make a good points regarding higher education however , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country I live in determines who will do what by the time they are 12 not many chances to grow up later and figure out what you really want to do and get the training/education . <p> The key is knowing yourself , however , that is hard early on in life . I 'm an engineer with a bachelors and masters . My masters degree was done after having worked for four years I am doing something I really like ( have been for 20 years ) and am fairly good at it . However , I would n't have been able to do this effectively without the degrees . Yes , there are aspects I do n't  use today , but it is a layered approach and there are analogies between the different fields . Without having been exposed to those areas early on , I might not have known to look in those areas . Additionally , engineering teaches a way of thinking that can be used in many situations . <p> I did go back and take some social science-traditional liberal education classes at a community college later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thinking and was better able to determine how it applied to my life after having some experience . <p> When giving advice , I usually tell someone that if they wish to go to college , try a community college first to inexpensively determine what you want to do and get the required aspects out of the way . If you know exactly what you want to do ( be a pilot/doctor , for example ) , then there are programs to help you get there actually there are many different paths to that end . <p> There is no shame in having a skill and owning your own business , either . In fact , that is probably a much faster way to becoming financially independent if done correctly . Plus , the skills are needed auto mechanic , plumber , etc , we are humans and there will always be a need to maintain the infrastructure IT is another infrastructure/power ( electrician ) yet another infrastructure . <p> So , I agree with your premise , however , one needs to have a lot of self-awareness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the opportunity to go back later and get the education/skills to do what you truly want is important . If you know what you want early on , find the different paths that can get you there and embark on one , moving to the other paths if you neeed to . <p> Wannabe ERE said , <p> I cant believe you 're arguing that our country has too MUCH education .

I just do n't  like the idea of an older generation deciding what a younger generation should be focusing on . The college generation is usually much more in tune with the future . I remember comp sci majors pushing to specialize in PC and video game programming . Departments kept pushing them back towards mainframe programming because they feared the new specializations were fads . Obviously the students were much more aware of industry trends . Maybe this is only true in certain fields . <p> A Master and an Apprentice could cause more destruction upon an economy and country , than a collective whole of millions of admission Ticketed work forces who socialize about drama . <p> Example a Trained Assasin in the arts of biological poisions , weapon technology , fitness and flexibility , Military Stradegies , Herbal health , Rates and Angles , and economic isolation , for the past 5 years could control the world pretty easily , let alone a business or empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used my parents money to avoid beginning work and then did n't  apply anything I learned from my coursework to my career , I agree completely . The college experience was great but not a contributor to my income earning abilities . I value education but not the mutant monster that higher education has become . My sons refused to go to college . I was upset at first but they just prove to me that what you need to know for business success you do n't  learn in college . I am the perfect example . <p> Lolonymous said , <p> Wow . I 've never agreed and disagreed so strongly with one single thread . <p> First , I think anyone agreeing with you wholeheartedly is an idiot . Your argument has no credible sources other than your anecdotes . Further , it attempts to convey its message using terms like hard work intelligence and IQ . Only ONE of those terms can be concretely and quantitatively described . And that term , IQ , has slowly been dismissed by the scientific community . It has about as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , I do agree that education in the US needs a lot of work . Degrees ARE gateways to corporate jobs . Many corporations , especially those that entertain the thoughts of sending employees overseas , demand at least bachelor degrees . Education can not educate someone uninterested , as you said . But , for anyone that does pursue education , their efforts are not fruitless . Learning a higher level of reading , thinking critically , accepting different cultures and thoughts , these are all skills one can learn from a college . The question is , how many students really do obtain these skills ? My bet is not many . <p> JacobJust how many people do you think have IQ 135+ ? Statistically , it should be less than 2% . Maybe the other 98% do n't  need advance degrees , but they do need jobs and life purposes . <p> Also the most commonly given IQ tests in the United States tests lots of verbal information too ( that a math geek sort may or may not do particulary well on ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the U.S high schools , but I also question if it is developmentally appropriate to just accelerate them right into PhD programs in physics just because we can . We all can do lots of things that are not good ideas . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @chris A high IQ just correlates well with advanced physics or math . I would n't say its the only ability required , but its the most important one and its an unsubstitutable . Hard work , attractive looks , table manners , or social skills , which work well in many other professions wont compensate . The only problem I see with accelerating people is if it only done to some and not others . Those with other abilities could go into other programs . <p> I think one can make a fair prediction of who will go where even at a young age . Looking back to middle school and comparing with reunions and I must say that I 've had very few surprises in terms of what became out of people . <p> I strongly believe that most students are marking time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like people need to be as old as they are now . People just mature very slowly . Go back two hundred years and people made colonel at age 26 . They commanded transatlantic ships at 22 . They became professors at age 24 . And those are just the hard ones . <p> Rhonda said , <p> Good points . I know a small business man in his 60s that is the millionaire next door type . He sheepishly admits he did not graduate HS &amp; never went to college . He had to study hard and try several times to pass the state tests ( multiple choice questions ) to obtain his masters license for HVAC . But he knows HVAC systems inside and out . He can easily understand and compute the airflow for the systems he installs and he is excellent in problem-solving difficult installations . In this community , he is the best in the HVAC field .

They too learned excellent hunting &amp; fishing skills from Grandpa &amp; could easily feed themselves if need be . <p> Our daughter , 16 , is completing a majority of her High School requirements through the Community College via concurrent enrollment . Each semester-long college course is worth a year of High School credit . She is a Junior in High School , and at the same time , a Sophomore in College . The best part of it is that Concurrent Enrollment students are not charged tuition , though they do have to pay for books ( which I buy used , then re-sell ) . <p> We have raised our kids very differently from the mainstream . We have home schooled since 1995 . Our boys have excellent welding , auto mechanics and woodworking skills .

Good for Dems they want to raise taxes . Good for Repubs want who less government interference . <p> Elimination the 529 will lower college costs because college costs have risen to meet the funding available . <p> Jessica said , <p> I think going to college makes you a more well rounded personis it necessary , no but that is why not everyone goes . It can be overrated and too expensive but it is easy to say it was unnecessary and you could have learned it all on your own after you are done . Would you really have sat down on you own and learned the basics of how government works , an introduction to philosophy , and statistics . Not to mention the foundation for whatever field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemistry now that I have a minor in it but I struggled with organic chemistry the first time it was presented to me . It is easy to say something is easy after you have learned it . <p> HoppyTheToad said , <p> I do n't  understand the dislike of 529 plans . They allow parents to save for their kids college ( including vocational problems at community college ) without having to pay taxes on the earnings . Most parents hardly save anything for their kids college . <p> Perhaps the irritation would be better directed at a financial aid system that has colleges advertise fake prices and then offer a " discount " based on the EFC ( expected family contribution ) . Ever notice how department stores perpetually have jewelry " on sale " ? We all know the " normal " prices are fake . College prices are the same , except that parents do n't  know what the " sale price " will be until after their children have paid the application fee and applied for financial aid . <p> The easy availability of loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bankrupt out of them ) drives tuition prices up as well . I 'd bet that the loans result in prices going up way more than the almost non-existent savings rate in 529 plans , especially since people are usually more careful spending money they have saved than borrowed money . <p> HoppyTheToad said , <p> I just looked it up . 529 plans were started in some states in the late 1990s and reached their current form in 2001 . Tuition rate increases had already been going on for two decades before this . <p> 3 degrees later and I 've realized your exact frustrations . In high school I thought college would weed out the not so smart , not so motivated people , then I thought in college , wait they ca n't hire these people .

Their parents dropped the ball as much as the school . After all , I 'm sure there are many students who do n't  have to rely on the education to get employment . And a liberal arts curriculum is fine for them . But if your child is going to need a job after school , then as a parent it is your duty to guide them notice I did not say dictate towards a field in which they will be self supporting in the future . The biggest fault that the college has is that it has too many required courses that do nothing to help the student become employable . <p> HoppyTheToad said , <p> I think we need to look at why businesses began to use college degrees as weed-out tools for jobs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago that was about the legal challenges of using employment tests these days . Decades ago , they supposedly were much more common . Since then , it has become harder for companies to use them without worrying about being sued for discrimination . Apparently even giving reading and math tests ( not IQ tests ) can be trouble . I guess hiring managers decided that it was just easier to skip the tests and only take college grads , since college weeds out many of the people who would fail the employment tests . <p> Cru said , <p> Liberal arts reformed my viewpoint and thought patterns in ways I would not have reached had I ( somehow ) spontaneously decided to start reading on these subjects . Additionally , the lecture time connecting the study into something meaningful is something that would have been left entirely up to me had I taken the autodidact route . Alone , I do not have knowledge of concepts and keywords that will bring me to realizations I seek , nor would I have any interest in a topic that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . An intellectual community provides these things . The obligation brought by the cost , and the desire for the entry ticket lead to study people otherwise would not undertake . I 'm not convinced that is a bad thing . <p> HoppyTheToad said , <p> As far as wishing people could " test out " of college , its already possible . Colleges like Thomas Edison State College ( part of the NJ system ) offer degrees that let students test out of most ( maybe all , depending on the major ) requirements using CLEP , AP exams , DANTES exams , etc . <p> One of my friends used CLEP exams to skip the first two years of college . He then went to a brick and mortar college and will graduate soon with a history degree . He has been accepted to several law schools and will start in the fall . At one point , he was debating using Thomas Edison vs. attending his current college . He made the right choice ( for him ) to go to a local school because it enabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law school . <p> I know a few families that have their kids do the " homeschool " college approach using CLEP exams . I would n't consider their English degrees from Thomas Edison as equivalent to an in person degree from a state school . I took several CLEP exams in college and I know how easy many of them are . I spent twenty minutes total studying for one of the social science ones . If many people start getting their whole degree using CLEPs and the like , I think it will dilute the value of regular degrees even more . ( I doubt many people earning these degrees ever take any math or science courses higher than high school level . ) <p> That said , I wish there were an alternative credentialing system that was rigorous and respected . CLEP tests are n't  really seen as rigorous . <p> On the homeschooling forum I visit , there is a physics professor . She said in all her years of teaching , there has been either zero or one student capable of testing out of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She says attending the classes and working in groups to solve the problems is necessary for understanding the material for virtually everyone . And lest you think she does n't  think people can learn on their own , she homeschools her kids and they are graduating a few years early . <p> phred said , <p> No , " gilded " is correct . The masters and apprentices are working in skilled areas and making the gelt . Their lives are truly golden . <p> It is the college kids who do n't  have good jobs , are n't  making much gelt and have these loans they stupidly took out . Hard to find time to compare and contrast Shakespeare and Marlowe when youre tired from flipping burgers all day . Their lives are truly tarnished , and they did it to themselves . <p> ael said , <p> Contrarian posts such as this and discussion of them are very broadeningThanks <p> sherry said , <p> Wow . I am someone who was 100% interested in learning , had a great GPA and pursued both the humanities and the sciences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective of a scientist only . <p> What I learned from my science courses I taught myself , and a book or mentor would have been adequate . But what I learned in my liberal arts classes I could not have done on my own . Maybe I 'm not so bright , but I found that being around other ugrad students , grad students and professors helped me to see and understand things that I would never have seen had I been reading books or looking at art in a vacuum . These people broadened my worldview . Of course there were plenty of uninterested folks in my undergrad classes , and I wished they werent there , but the interested few changed my life . Even today , 20 years later , I miss the intellectual rigor of my liberal arts education . <p> Would I want my own kids to study the liberal arts ? YES . But I agree that current tuition prices are insane and unsustainable . We need to find better ways of pursuing these life-sustaining interests outside of universities and after completing our degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ werent interested at 18 or 20 might come back later with some life experience and really get something out of the liberal arts . <p> I 'm curious about your views on scholarly endeavors . Youve mentioned that you earned an MS and a PhD . In other posts youve also talked about walking away from your field after early retirement . What I do n't  understand is why you devoted so much time to the study of something that does n't  interest you . Did your interest fade after several years in the field ? Why do you not continue your scholarly work after retirement , simply for the love of the subject ? Why do you not take on an apprentice simply because you can ? As a retired scholar you could be very particular about the people you work with and the projects you take on . This is a freedom that most people do n't  have when working in academia . <p> Pardon any typos , I 'm writing this on a phone . <p> Sclass said , <p> Great post Jacob . I wholeheartedly agree . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  like you . When was the las time you ran into somebody who could teach the self anything of modest complexity ( not in the forum but say on the street ) ? <p> College is good for preparing to enter the robot army . Most ( smart uncreative ) people need it . When a young person asks me about how much education they need , I take a hard look at their IQ and creativity . High IQ and low creativity you would be well suited to going to college , getting a corporate job and let the management tell you what they want to solve . <p> The corporate cube farms are full of smart uncreative people . The smart self taught creative ones are usually telling the drones what to do . Often the leaders did n't  go to college which has become kind of a success paradox at the high end of earners . Somehow the system did n't  get you effectively placed in the machine and now you are out here messing up the system ; ) . <p> On the separate topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  want to live in a world of all techies even though I am one . Somehow people have confused salaries in the corporate machine with what everyone should do . There are now some books about it . A similar thing happened during the space race and the US was flooded with engineers as the universities tooled up and pumped them out . Kind or like what happened to MDs recently . I think the pendulum will swing around and the Netflix CEO will stop complaining that he can not find enough engineersand he ( or his replacement ) will complain about all the boring content on his perfectly functioning streaming media site . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @FrankCJones My interest faded after 15+ years of focus and work in the field . At that point I did not feel like I was learning anything anymore . Everything had turned into incremental improvements of minor details . It had become a routine of rinse and repeat . <p> I now work in finance where the innovative spirit ( working out of the left field ) is still encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we already know by a couple of decimals while insisting that this kind of research is " very interesting " ) . I also do some volunteer work in cancer researchmainly lending my numerical skills which seems to have been somewhat less developed in that field ( they still live in the 80s ) . <p> The thing is , most people intelligent enough to do decent in life ( not even well , just " decently " ) are also smart enough to go to college . And given most 16-year-olds do n't  have much of a worldview beyond doing homework and playing video games ( no matter how intelligent ) , college is a natural progression . <p> Not many teenagers have much thought of their lives beyond the next few days , much less the next few decades . ( And ERE is VERY unlikely to be in their minds ! ) So realistically , its very unlikely to find intelligent , middle-class teenagers planning their life without automatically including college . <p> Also , the majority of people who DO NT have tertiary degrees do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to popular opinion , not everyone who did n't  go to college is a self-made , bootstrapped billionaire or pursue ERE . Most just end up on minimum wage jobs , barely eking out an existence . ) <p> Whether college is useful or not is n't relevant to most peoplethey go because its the default option and not many teenagers can think that deeply about life . <p> Although I do speak from an Australian experience , where college ( or university , as its called here ) costs about $5K a year and the government gives you interest-free loans . <p> Chuck Findlay said , <p> Want a higher education for free ? <p> MIT has all their courses on-line for free , they video tape them and you can absorb the information from any net-connected computer . <p> You do n't  get a fancy piece of paper saying you spent thousands of dollar . But if information is your goal , the on-line course is a way to go . <p> RJ said , <p> I agree , almost entirely , with this post . I was fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished my undergraduate degree with $7000 in credit card debt which took me 3 years to pay off . Having learned from that experience ( and seeing that I did *not* land a job that paid substantially more than people working at jobs in the U.S. without an undergraduate degree in business management ) when I decided to return to school for my masters and Phd I decided NO DEBT . I graduated in 2008 with my PhD and no debt , even managing to put aside money for retirement regularly during the 6 years I was in school . <p> However , after working for 6 years on the treadmill that is tenure track life at a major U.S. university , I can not recommend this path to anyone the pay in no way compensates for the massive hours spent earning tenure , serving on incomprehensible and useless committees , attempting to motivate and incite passion in students whom 90% of the time are simply there for the credential , and for *some* of my peers , trying to pay off massive student loan debt at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> In addition , urging people to spend their prime earning years to go into debt for degrees in the humanities that simply wont pay much and cost far too much money to earn to begin with is exceedingly poor advice today . The university system is incredibly wasteful and inefficient , and unless you can show a direct and real need for an advanced degree ( e.g. , *some* schools of engineering , medicine , etc. ) then it is not a prudent move . The quote from the movie Good Will Hunting still resonates with me ( . " You dropped $150K on an education you could have gotten for $1.50 in late fees at the public library . " ) . <p> The reality is that those who want to learn and become independent thinkers and *doers* will do so without a crushing school debt load or tying up their best years in pursuit of what is a poor substitute for the " American Dream " . Pursuing learning and advanced education is actually only for a small minority in this world I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my experience over the last decade , Jacob is correct about the number of students at universities that are there for the credential , not really to learn . We do need people in some fields with advanced education and the training to make them highly skilled in what they do . <p> However , we do not need to continue to push advanced education and its corresponding debt load to young people that do not understand what this is going to mean in another decade or so of their lives . I was always surprised at the number of my peers who were shocked that they could not afford to buy a house straight out of graduate school as their student loan bills tallied $600-1000 per monthbasically a house payment . For people coming out of medical and legal programs , the monthly student loan repayment can be much , much more . <p> Just once I 'd like to hear a college administrator , or HS guidance counselor say " People with their master plumbers license make about One Million dollars more during their lifetime than people with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree . <p> edge said , <p> I may be an exception to the rule , but I got an English degree at a private liberal arts school , and it has served me well . Admittedly , I went right on to law school , but the ability to organize my thoughts and string sentences together served me well . I am ERed and FI with plenty to spare . I think you are too quick to cynically attempt to write off the liberal arts in general and English ( and History ) majors and their ilk . If the world were solely composed of scientists , not liberal artists , what a sad machine it would be . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287813 @2287813/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> One of my core philosophies is to maximize the quality of things I spend a lot of time with/in/on and minimize the quantity of things I do not spend a lot of time with/in/on . <p> This way the reduction in quantity pays for the more expensive quality . This works well because in our society , quality is often underpriced and quantity is overvalued . What I mean by this is that it is easy to earn enough to afford high quality because wages are so set so as to be allow one to afford enormous quantities . Quality is also cheap because people do not put value on it . <p> One example : Six pairs of shoes at $20 that last 2 years each vs one pair of $120 shoes that last 12 years . Which is better ? <p> Obviously the latter . The cost is the same , but you are wearing something that is better constructed for a good many years . In this case it is even quite likely that the lifetime can be extended . Other high quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a watch acquired for $200 new will have a used price of very little five years later . A watch acquired for $800 will probably sell for close to the same five years later . Which is less expensive ? <p> I think the best strategy towards keeping and using nice things is to approach every purchase with two objectives in mind <p> Plan to keep everything you own forever(*) <p> Consider everything you own for sale at all times . <p> Minimize the use of resources . <p> ( * ) Here forever is some combination of the lifetime of the object and a reasonable estimate of what that lifetime could be . To stay with the shoes , they can last 10 years . Appliances can also last 10 years . You can also get shoddy workmanship that last far less time , but that is no excuse . <p> This will force you not to buy anything needlessly and at all times know its value ( to you ) while minimizing planetary impact . Okay , the last is just one of my values . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchildren wont stop you . Anyway <p> This does not mean that you should go out and start replacing everything you own . You already own something that does the job adequately . You probably have several spares ready too . However , once you really run out of something essential , put down the money and get something , preferably used , that will last you a long time and provide superior qualitative use value . Over time , consequently , your stuff will increase in quality and decrease in quantity . <p> Jacob comments : <p> In terms of buying new and used , you must consider the difference between purchase and selling prices and then divide this by the utility or happiness it brings you . It is this number which must be minimized. <h> 19 users responded in " Day 16 : The stuff you actually keep and use " <p> I 'm not sure I am following a lot of your logic . Near the end of your post you said if you run out of something , get it used . But earlier you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price new and used 5 years later . Why wouldnt you just buy new in the first place always ? <p> And $200 and $800 watches , really ? I do n't  think you really need either . If you need a watch get a $10 one from walmart . They could die every year and would still be cheaper than that $800 one after 80 YEARS ! But they last a long time , I have had one ( I use my cell now ) . <p> I also keep everything I own forever . I do n't  buy top of the line either . For example I would n't buy a Ferrari just b/c I planed on keeping it forever , it still would n't make sense . I would buy a good Toyota though(used). 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Sam It is usually most economical to buy used . For some reason stuff that has had no previous owners command a premium . If I was into cars , I would buy a classic car , use it and watch it appreciate , and keep its value . This makes car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean that everybody should drive a classic . I like watches . I paid around $600 for my watch . I could probably sell it for about the same . This makes my watch ownership essentially 0 , unless I break it . <p> Although I agree with your general point , I was surprised that you did n't  go ahead and do the math right . Clearly , $120 now costs more than $20 every other year for twelve years . The exact value depends on the discount rate , but by my calculation , the net present value of the cheap shoes is under $100 . <p> ( Youve done this math in other examples , so I know that you know this . Others might want to imagine that they took $120 , bought a pair of cheap shoes , and then deposited the remaining sum in a checking account where at least part of it would go on earning interest for the next 12 years . Over that length of time , there 's a pretty good chance that the interest would add up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Your greater point , of course is still truethere are many advantages to buying the more expensive shoes : Youre wearing better shoes for 12 years . You only have to go shopping once , not six times . You do n't  face the risk that inflation will outstrip the return on your savings account . ( On the other hand , you also face some extra risks . Its a greater loss if you spend $120 on a pair of shoes that turn out to hurt your feet. ) 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Philip Brewer Calculating this as an annuity would probably be overkill as the lack of precision ( gas , opportunity costs , shoe cost , " feel " of good shoes vs bad shoes ) destroys any kind of accuracy that the present value calculation would yield . It would be like launching space probes using the general theory of relativity . <p> It is however interesting to note that AAII.com sells a lifetime subscription , effectively a perpetuity , for $290 while their annual subscription costs $29 . I got the lifetime subscription which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal rate , hence <p> If you could value all these in the same units , you could calculate the internal rates of return for the two cases and pick the highest . This would probably be more accurate since PV calculations rely on being able to reinvest the ( early ) cash flows at the same discount rate and here it seems a big weird to think about reinvesting the early use of the shoes and getting the same rate , hmmm 10151 @qwx420151 <p> A possible contradiction : buy things to keep forever , but calculate the cost as the buy price minus the sell price <p> House solid foundation , close-in location , but affordable because its old and small . <p> Car old but long-lasting ( I use Consumer Reports ) <p> Watch I admit , I get Timex Indiglo .

Heavy stainless steel silverware . Plastic storage containers instead of baggiesI bring these to work of course , but also to restaurants to bring home leftovers . <p> In response to Philip Brewers comment , I just assumed Jacob meant to buy all the shoes at once either the 6 pairs at $20 or one pair at $120 . Discounting $20 over a few years is immaterial to me and probably most others . <p> This is a good idea in theory . However , in practice how do you Jacob or anyone else go about buying quality items ? Obviously there is a difference between quality and just high priced crap . Do you use Consumer Reports or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user reviews are pretty much worthless because they are not long-term , but merely based on the users recent history with the product . <p> PS I 'm in need of a new pair of brown shoes for work any recommendations ? 10152 @qwx420152 <p> And then there 's the question of whether you 'll take proper care of the item you purchase <p> Using the shoe example , I know that I wear through certain parts of shoes regardless of cost/quality ( unless they 're armor plated ) . In those cases , the cheap pairs make sense provided they 're not creating a hazard or compounding the wear problem . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> Kevin , <p> At least Consumer Reports does have some long-term data . There 's also word of mouth . Sometimes you 're in a position to try things before you buy them ( for example , you can try lots of tools if you volunteer at Habitat for Humanity ) .

@@42287814 @2287814/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> In my search to determine what people actually mean when they say they want a " comfortable life " and in particular a " comfortable retirement " I have come across two conflicting definitions . No wonder , then , that such statements confuse me . <p> I usually think that comfort means being free from physiological ( mental and physical ) pressures or stresses . For instance , there may be less stress associated with sitting in a certain chair . What I did not understand why anyone would go to such great lengths and engage in work that was clearly stressing them out to sit in a chair that was mildly more comfortable but caused a disproportionate level of stress , that is to say , the marginal utility of upgrading the chair was lower than the marginal cost of adding one more year of work . <p> However , there is another definition of comfort which is founded on contentment and general life satisfaction . Uh oh , that 's a slippery slope right there because it is subjective to all sorts of external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider ourselves to be comfortable when we are satisfied . However , wants are supposedly infinite , at least , you know , the material wants , as I note that wants to get off our asses and exercise seem to be fairly limited , and this means that those wants can never be quite satisfied . They always grow on top of a moving baseline which in the worst case is defined by what everybody else seems to want ( keeping up with the Joneses ) and in the best case is defined by what you want . <p> This means that a person can never be quite comfortable in this frame of mind . Being comfortable based on such wants actually turns out to be a stressor and the usual argument ( which I have been asked is ) : Well , youd like to own a boat , so would n't it have made sense to work one more year , then you could have bought a nice boat instead of cheap fixer upper(*) . I could have done that , but maybe then , that boat would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice truck , so that 's one more year on top of that . Since trucks wear out , I 'd need to make sure that I had money to replace it when it wore out in 12 years , so add a third year . And so on . <p> ( * ) I have n't bought one yet , but I 'm looking . <p> " Just one more year and I would be able to retire in comfort " ; except that 's what I 'm telling myself every year and meanwhile my salary and responsibilities keep increasing and it becomes harder and harder to let go and then at age 48 I get a stroke which leaves me without control of the right side of my body , but not everything is lost , because I can always spend the boat and truck money on meds . <p> Some more comments : Maus makes some great comments below , so I figured I 'd respond to them in the main post . <p> The first issue is the safety or income factor . First people seek a 4% withdrawal rate to cover their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenarios over 30 years . Then they seek 3% just to be safe which is a 33% margin . Then the target changes to 2% just to be a bit safer even though this is actually a 100% improvement compared to the original case which means that in the historically worst case theyd end up with millions of dollars they ca n't spend . Heck , even I will end up with a million bucks in my fifties and several millions by the time I die simply because I saved too much . The only danger would be to suddenly double ones spending but I figure as I learn more and more and adapt an increasingly sustainable lifestyle my spending is more likely to go down than up . <p> There is only so much safety money can provide , so working to accumulate more money to provide more safety is irrational . If , say , the country gets hit by hyper inflation it does not matter too much whether you have $500,000 or $5,000,000 . The marginal safety provided by money is decreasing . If I wanted ultra safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 year supply of toilet paper , etc. and put a guard on it . That 's safe . Still , that does not eliminate the other safety issues like getting cancer ( it also happens to vegans , just not as much ) , or getting killed in a freak accident ( falling toilet seat from the sky ) . <p> A closely related safety issue is that people are more comfortable with what they think they have control over like their jobs and their cars and uncomfortable with what they do n't  have control over like investments or airplanes even though the latter is statistically safer . For instance , I did not lose my portfolio in this downturn and in fact it came out stronger than it went in , but many people lost their jobs . In that sense I think there 's a necessary transition from thinking about once investments as actually being investments than being a savings account denominated in a stock market index . I think many make that mistake . In fact , the changing ones frame of mind is not easy . Personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved enough for retirement ? " but " Can I live off my investment portfolio income ? " much in the same way that a salaried person asks " Can I live off my salary ? " <p> The poverty of imagination is another great point . It amuses me that so many people say theyd still be working at their job even if they did n't  need toyou know , the passionate ones do you really mean to say if you had these hundreds of other opportunities to do other stuff , youd still pick your job of all things . I think many think there 's little alternative to their jobs other than sitting at home watching their DVD collection twice over , then going out to eat at every restaurant in town and then what ? Imagination is important but unfortunately , the imagination available for sale is pretty expensive : vacations , resorts , exotic activities , Theres no need for that . Learn to play the guitar . Restore a classic car together with other people interested in the same thing . Meetup.com is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing problem , you know , a yacht club , or a coffee club with a biking problem . Personally , I have scheduled activities 4-5 days a week and that 's certainly enough for me . Sometimes its even too much . <h> 46 users responded in " One more year before comfort " <p> Jacob , I think there is a third aspect of comfort that induces the " one more year of work " syndrome you address here ; and your last paragraph hints at it . People find comfort in storing up resources to stave off fear of the unknown , e.g. a stroke at 48 . But more money is a poor , and often illusory , bullwark against the unknown future disasters that might strike . It is difficult for someone to calculate the marginal utility of saving for the heart attack or cancer that might occur ten or twenty years from now . Will any amount of money really suffice ? <p> And for others , the very idea of " comfort " as a goal is off putting . I love to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8-9 more hours a day to read does not entice me . In this case , I suffer not from a poverty of funds but from a poverty of imagination ; since I have so few ideas about what I 'd do if I werent practicing law . The marginal utility of the latter is certainly diminshing with each passing year , but not yet enough to tip the scales toward unfettered free time . As a mid-term goal , I 've got to come up with one or two compelling replacement activities . <p> Want to Want Less said , <p> Jacob , <p> I 'd love to hear more on this as I have seen this first hand with my DH .

That is not an easy question for most people who retire at 65 and I suspect its an even harder question for those seeking to retire early . <p> Once you know what you want , you can work as long as it takes to get you there .

You have taught me so much about searching for my own dreams and looking for alternative ways . I try and argue the point of retiring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always seem to lose ! I guess because I 'm argueing with people who think eating in a Name Brand resturant and taking cruises to " see " the world ( do n't  all ports look pretty much the same ? ) is the ideal life . I want to learn the piano , join a book club , hike the mountains around my home , live for 4 months a year in the country side of Mexico ( we are buying property there by my husbands family ) . We are now debt free and I need to learn more about investing so look forward to your future post . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Tina B Marinas pretty much look the same , I say , based on the my observations of 3 different ones = , namely , like a big parking lot with a break water in front . I think what matters to these types is not how things look or what one finds there but how exotic the name of the port is ? <p> Indeed , it completely depends on what one wants out of retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between cruisers and charterers in the BVI ( very popular area in the Caribbean ) ; specifically , the charterers go down there for 12 weeks of partying and pay thousands of dollars per person for the privilege and then they fly back to their jobs . They do n't  like to learn that there are people anchored across the bay in their own boats who stay and spend the same for the same view and water annually .

The biggest trap I 've found myself in is that of the pension terms I ( or a surviving spouse ) can only get my full benefits if I reach age 58 and declare retirement . <p> Well sure , you say , just pile up enough cash to exit the workforce whenever you want . Heck , I do believe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there 's another snag in the pension terms . If I exit employment before age 53 ( e.g. 5 years before retirement age ) , then the interest on the retirement benefits stop accumulating . <p> Note that this is n't the same as vesting . Ive been vested for 10+ years now . Its just a rule that keeps you working so you do n't  have reduced benefits ! <p> Now if I 'd understood the gravity of this second part of my pension rules , I would have arranged my career and life slightly differently 6-7 years ago , before passing the point-of-no-return regarding these benefits . <p> The old idea of retirement is dead its better to go the " Tim Ferriss " way ( which in some senses is also the ERE way ) and just take many mini-retirements ( for lack of a better word ) along the way . Work in bursts earn some money , then take a break . Or , combine that with some streams of investment income to smooth out the income chunking . <p> It can take a long while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits accrue in a magnifying fashion on the other end ( in the future ) . The longer you hold your div-paying stocks , the higher the effective yield on each purchase becomes .

The strategy is similar to what a contractor , a consultant , or a freelancer may pursue . Also see Charles Longs Living without a salary . <p> Great post . I 've never really thought about the possibility of retiring early . However , this post made me ask if I really want to be saving everything in retirement accounts or regular accounts just in case I decide I want to live of my income sooner . Hmmm .

Poverty in imagination . Many people I speak to are terrified of retirement , even more so retiring in their 30s unless they have close to an endless supply of money . <p> While I am not one to have many great hobbies I truly do n't  believe I would have trouble with retiring by 37-40 . As it stands right now 51 is probably more likely . <p> Jacob , it would be interesting if you one day posted your schedule for a month , just documenting how you pass time and which type of activities you do ( beyond sailing , practicing fencing and writing your book ) . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Aniara That 's a good idea with the schedule . I believe I have done a post on that already though ( between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting once I get the book out . Right now my schedule looks exactly like it did in grad school except I 'm sitting at home rather than in an office . I get up at 9a . Check the markets . Do the blog maintenance . Then I read " randomly " ( books and net ) . If inspiration suddenly strikes I fire off a blog post . Around 4-5p thoughts start to condense and I can write something for the book . DW comes home at 6p and I make dinner . We walk the dog around 10p . DW goes to bed around 11p . Then I enter my most productive hours and write/edit until 2a and then I go to bed . <p> @Craig That 's where I was about five years ago then I realized that I was just investing unconsciously for " some day in the distant future " and not taking any of the benefits now . It pays to be conscious about the life/value trade you are making on a day to day basis ( weekly , monthly ) . I 'm not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of setting aside cash ( saving , investing ) is n't to make a nice big pile for 30 yrs down the road it should be for the streams of income the cash can provide you and the sooner you can live off it the better , probably ( continue to diversify , of course ) . <p> Q said , <p> A drinking club with a sailing problem where do I sign up ! ! ? <p> Ruth said , <p> Jacob , I am going to hit my 4% early retirement number before I 'm able to retire for other reasons . My options as I see them , then , are once I have my 4% number and am still working : ( 1 ) keep saving for my 3% or 2% number , which would feel like " one more year before comfort " and depress me ; ( 2 ) start spending like an average person on middle-class luxuries , which does n't  interest me much ; or ( 3 ) spend the money I usually saved ( about $25k a year ) on other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends loans , etc . That sounds fun to me , to be my own foundation , sort-of . I 'd really like to know if any of your readers have been in the position of having saved their early retirement nest egg but continued working , and what they did with the % of their salary they were saving before , especially if they decided to begin spending it one way or another . Thank you and sorry this was long . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Ruth Whatever income I made after 4% was saved to decrease the " 4% " . My portfolio is now in a runaway mode since I withdraw less than what it has historically done . I never saved it for safety though and I am really picky about what I work on now . If I had kept working " for comfort " I could have been a millionaire in my late 30s which although its a nice score was not all that important given that I cant/wont use $30-$40k a year just to live . However , it still bugs me that some have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really quite pointless and not something I 'm proud of . I 'd even consider it something of a disorder or maybe just a bad attitude . <p> Ruth said , <p> Thanks Jacob . That 's what I 'm afraid of , becoming a competitive saver/hoarder . So that 's why I 'm trying to figure out what to do once I have hit my number but am still saving just because I cant quit my job yet . What can I do with money that is as exciting and empowering ( to me ) as saving it and watching it grow ? Eating out more is n't going to do it . And I do n't  want a boat or anything that I 'll have to maintain once I do quit . But I can imagine that becoming a philanthropist could be really fun . Rich people seem to do such boring things with their money ; maybe I 'll bankroll a theater company that does plays about simple living = <p> Its good that you post something like this .

I too would be interested in your daily routine . I probably have enough saved to retire ( I 'm 38 ) , but I just get so bored and end up web-surfing all day if I 'm not working . All my friends work and there 's nobody to hang out with . Ca n't stand golf either . Any tips ? All I seem to do is take off with my backpack and travel for 9 months at a time 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @ApW Routine ? I do n't  really have any . I do what I feel like . I 'm not really aiming for productivity-mentality of things I have to get done that 's not work i.e. the way career people do vacations with a schedule rushing around to see things .

Those years of missed opportunity can never be retrived . Did I mention that retiremet has been the most enjoyable experience of my adult life . My advise is be ready to gamble a bit you never know what the future holds . <p> Early Retirement Extreme : One More Year Before Comfort : " There is only so much safety money can provide , so working to accumulate more money to provide more safety is irrational . " Good to keep that in mind . I tend to be frugal , <p> but it is better to roll with it than fight it . Its also a warning call for all those one more year to comfort merchants . You will almost always be financially better off working for another year . But <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd still be working at their job even if they did n't need to " <p> I have friends like that . Even if they won the lottery ( a small amount , enough to retire , but not enough to live like a jetsetting socialite ) , theyd still be working because they literally ca n't think of anything else to do . <p> Its not really about passion its more about the fact they have no other interests outside work . <p> I do n't  think you can be passionate about most types of work . I 've never met anyone who was obsessed with a accounting or cleaning hotel rooms ( unless they were running their own business ) . Maybe if you worked in a field like medicine , law enforcement or social work , where there are bigger factors than the work itself ( ie. justice , helping people etc ) . <p> Bruce Lees thinking on the quotes page if you need inspiration ! Or you can also read Jacobs excellent article at Early Retirement <p> Eric said , <p> As I approach early retirement I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but often comfort has not loved me back . As I look back on my life sometimes I was sometimes happiest when I was stressed out and super busy . And when I was most comfortable I was , well kind of lazy , not particularly useful for anything , and just generally weak all around . So I 'm going to pick up a regimen which will induce a little bit of stress across the board mentally , spiritually , and emotionally just to keep sharp . <p> Edward said , <p> Its completely outside our realm of thinking and difficult for us to imagine , but for many ( most ) of the people I work with who say they want a " comfortable retirement " mean they want enough money to buy whatever they want , however much they want , whenever they want , for however long they want . Which , in fact , for them means a bottomless well of cash . Judging from their near ZERO savings/investment levels , this is an impossibility . I 'm afraid theyll all die without having their full greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the life I currently have is endangering my drive . There will come the time when I have to sacrifice something good to get to true greatness .

@@42287819 @2287819/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> The reason our utilities are so low is due to a ) We live in CA and b ) We keep the thermostat set really low or really high . Last winter , we did our first season together without any heating(*) . It was my second season without any heat having gone " heating-less " for a winter in a central European climate just to see if it was feasible ( it was ) . <p> ( * ) The thermostat was set at 55F to protect the plumbing and it rarely switched on . <p> However , many people are not so fortunate to live in mild winter climates . With oil ( and gas ) reaching record prices , it is to expected that heating costs this winter will be somewhat higher . It would therefore by prudent to adopt the following two strategies . <p> Start becoming more physically active . As mentioned in the post above unlike aerobic exercise , heavy physical labor or strength and/or workouts boost ones metabolism for several hours afterwards . This can mean the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blanket . As furnace-level metabolisms requires substantial amounts of weights to be lifted , it is recommended to get started now . By substantial , I mean 50-60lbs per hand for men and 25-30lbs for women with about 50 full body repetitions . This is a lot ! <p> Get better winter clothes . Unfortunately practically everyone has grown accustomed to living in the 70F bubble of central air . Hence " winter " -clothes often comprise light cotton/polyester sweaters . These are insufficient for cold temperatures unless layered on top of each other . Even then they do n't  beat a heavy woolen sweater . With food prices going up due to crazy peoples insistence on pouring food in our cars , it is reasonable to assume that wool prices will go up . It is also reasonable to assume that wool prices will go up anyway as people try to save money by turning down their thermostats . Since winter clothes is currently on sale , I am ordering mine now . <p> The brand I like for clothes that last forever is Filson . They seem very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very inexpensive although not as inexpensive as finding something for a couple of dollars as a thrift store . <h> 8 users responded in " With record oil prices is it time to buy winter clothes ? " <p> We live in the mid-Atlantic and have an old twin-style home with poor insulation . I 'm terrified of our heating bill this winter . Despite leaving our thermostat at 55-60 through the dead of winter last year and using space heaters whenever possible , our gas bill was still outrageous . Our gas prices are set to go way up this year , too . <p> Have you considered using a wood stove and sustaining a woodlot for your heating ? Seems up your alley . I ran the numbers and it seemed like making traditional income investments to cover energy bills would require less capital . But its a lot easier to accurately calculate how much woodlot to buy than predict future energy costs and investment returns . <p> Since you 're looking at RVs you might consider relocating every season to stay in an area where you do n't  need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their summers were cheap ( off season ) and cool ( mountains ) . I bet there 's an equivalently cheap and warm winter spot . <p> FHR said , <p> There is a cheap and warm winter spot : Texas . While the summers here necessitate air conditioning ( 3-4 months of consistent 98-102 days ) , the winters are fantastic . We seldom get freezing weather and if we do , you only need to turn the heat on enough to ensure the pipes do n't  freeze . Last year , I turned the heat on for only 1 day ( wifey was REALLY cold ) and the year before for 3 days ( snowed us in ) . NOTE : When I put the heat " on " its at 60-63 tops , so the house is not exactly toasty . <p> Our electric/gas bill is enormously higher in the summers than in the winters . We can cruise along with $40-$60 electric/gas in the winter but it spikes to $200+ from May September . <p> Farmwife said , <p> We too heat with wood .

We help our neighbors who sell the logs , and we save the gas and time running back and forth getting loads . <p> Our summer bill is low in the $50-60 range . Especially if I keep up on hanging my laundry = <p> Living in New Hampshire , my wife and I made a similar but opposite decision : we have not used our central air conditioner since moving into our house in 2006 .

This draws complaints from my mom when she comes to visit at Xmas , but that 's the way it goes around here . My favorite in-home attire during the winter months is a long-sleeved T-shirt covered with a thick hooded sweatshirt ( hood up ) , plus thick fleece pants and nice warm socks . If it gets too cold inside , I can always go outside and shovel some snow , or strap on the snowshoes and take the dogs for a stroll to get the blood moving . Then the 55F house feels like an oven upon returning ! <p> Derek said , <p> My rent includes all utilities , so I keep my apt at 83 in the winter and 70 in the summer , and do n't  pay a cent for it . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Derek But if your neighbors did that too , rents would be higher . But wait , maybe yours neighbors are doing that already . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I have a Country Flame wood stove for heating my home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , and I have it ducted into my central heating fan where I can run that on " fan only " and spread the woodstove heat throughout the house . Delivered firewood is $75.00 a rick so I do n't  buy any . I have land and chain saw so I fetch my own . We had an ice storm last January , which caused loss of trees , and though my labor I netted about two cords of firewood . However I live in an apartment through the week , so I have to keep the thermostat at 55 degrees F so I do n't  risk freezeups . My apartment utilities are free so that is not any factor in my heating costs , as I manage the complex and get that as part of my compensation . If I were at home 24/7 , in winter months , I would only incur labor costs for my heating . Many people have no options but to lower their thermostats and put on warm layers to hold down costs . This is cutting into their fixed costs of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a city home or apartment where alternative heating process can not be installed .

@@42287825 @2287825/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I have a confession to make . I write a personal finance blog , but I rarely read other personal finance blogs . There is a reason for that . Here is the reason . I find that once anyone get actively involved in any community , they will start to ( subconsciously ) adopt the thinking modes of the community almost like by osmosis . This leads to similar thinking . In addition , it leads to thinking about the same things at the same time while reaching the same conclusions . In other words , herd behavior is born . If individuals in such a herd are very busy as people generally are when there is a quantifiable performance pressure more , bigger , faster , there is too little time to step outside of the box when so much time is dedicated to following the rest of ones peers . <p> There is a similar phenomena in scientific research . Feynman ( a famous physicist ) once remarked that the best way to find new insights into a problem was to ignore previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this should be done after reaching some technical proficiency as well as some maturity , otherwise crackpot theories obtain . In a similar vein , Einstein did his greatest work revolutionizing the understanding of special relativity , Brownian motion , and the photoelectric effect while working in a patent office with little or no contact to the buzz of the ivory towers . I think it is fairly accepted that something similar to Einsteins miracle year would never happen today ( that 's why it was considered a miracle ) . With the publish or perish mentality of modern academia and its expectation of attending several conferences and presenting multiple papers every year ( rather than a new idea every other year ) it has been rendered nearly impossible to step back and take a creative look at the fundamentals . Instead everything looks much the same as last time . <p> It is difficult to say which system is better when they are so different . In a mass production system , agents distinguish themselves by quantity and matching expectations . Popularity in the current mass market philosophy clearly requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the system by imitating it or quoting it . The key here is telling the end-consumers what they want to hear . This is done by telling them what they already know . For instance , consider modern pop music ; it is an entirely forgettable experience , yet it is a popular choice of music . It is widely consumed because it is familiar and people know what to expect(*) . This results in a herd that moves slowly yet moves consistently and steadily . It serves a purpose . For instance , blogging about index funds , tips on career advancement , and lists on many many ways to save money reinforces the status quo thinking . The effective purpose is to reassure people that they are doing alright . This is naturally a highly prized product that can bring in lots of advertising revenue . <p> ( * ) I have a theory that says that writings , research , statements , anything , are much more likely to be considered to be of high quality if the recipient agrees with the content or the philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural tendency . <p> Original ideas can not be mass produced . I can not say that my posts are exclusively original but to the extent some of them are , it is certainly getting harder to come up with new insights . New insights can frequently be had through interdisciplinary means . These areas are abundant because they have not been harvested by specialists . This is not to say that all original ideas are useful . However , incremental ideas are not all useful either which is why I tend not to read them = <h> 23 users responded in " How to do original research " <p> Pure , virgin originality is a rare flower . I look for it everyday but have yet to see it ( and I wo n't stop looking ) . <p> For me , others are the source of things that are new , at least new to me . Where I think there is much to be seen in others is not what they say , but what they do not say . I look for the ideas that come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not just about active collaboration ( though that can be just as useful as going it alone ) but of passive emergence , i.e. swarm intelligence and all that related work . The marketplace genius of many individuals collectively solving a problem that not one ( or even several ) of them individually could solve and perhaps not even grasp . <p> I do n't  think I 'm really looking for originality in my PF . In my writing , yes to an extent , but in the blogosphere I 'm looking more for ideas and support . = <p> Plusoriginality is a myth of modernism . Everything is derivative on some level . Your choice of phrase reflects the books you 've read , for instance . It makes sense that if you do n't  want to be too derivative of the mainstream blogosphere you would n't spend too much time reading it . <p> That does n't  mean people do n't  come up with great ideas that its quite possible nobody would have thought of .

I see the herd mentality among academics all the time . Great post , Jacob ! <p> Only a small minority of people will ever do anything truly original , and most people will go their entire life without a single original idea . Thankfully , the rest of us are able to stand on the shoulders of these few great ideas . <p> I am perfectly happy to act like a natural born engineer and spend my life repackaging others great ideas into something that is usable by the general public . In other words , I do take original ideas and mass produce them . However , there is a certain art in the repackaging , no ? <p> Making financial basics accessible and palatable to the masses is exactly the roll that pf blogs are best at . Maximizing career , saving money , and investing in index funds is nothing revolutionary , but it is enough to put anyone ( even with the lowest starting position ) into the wealthiest echelons of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here to prove it to you ! I see plenty of reason to strive for that goal and help others along the way . <p> I think you have yet to really push into revolutionary territory . Early Retirement Extreme presents ideas that may be new to some , but in reality just about everything is repackaged from the ideas of others such as Henry David Thoreau . Transcendental " Frogpondians " still come off to me as selfish and too quick to advocate Utopian ideas rather than realistic solutions . <p> I admit freely my blog and others like it are n't  revolutionary ( that 's not the point ) . At the end of your post you were wise to take a step back and admit that your ideas are n't  all that original either . If you are struggling to find new insights I recommend you stop taking yourself so seriously and just write . It is when you feel pressure to challenge the status quo and be profound with every post that you loose your human voice . Then I have no reason to read your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx420155 <p> When I look back in my research career , I have had 2 maybe 3 ( only two were actually published ) original ideas that nobody else had ever thought of , literally speaking . Of course getting these ideas did require some previous knowledge , but I would not say that they are merely derived . Claiming that suggests that creativity is a purely mechanical process although I admit that lots of science is just like that . For instance , I have published north of 20 papers . This means that I have my 2-3 original ideas whereas the other 20ish are not particularly " original " . This may come down to semantics . Obviously there are varying degrees of originality . <p> I would n't discount the fun you can have drawing analogies from biochemical engineeringhmmm , that 's my guess of your disciplineto personal finance . Youve already had some unusual posts that have introduced out-of-the-ordinary concepts and tools ; I really do n't  care if they are original or not , only that they have a perspective that is drawing on other areas than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much personal information about yourself , I would like to hear more about the region of the world where you grew up and how it compares in money , planning , spending , materialism to where you live now . 10157 @qwx420157 <p> I thought EREs a particle physicist ( based upon some guest post that he did w/i last couple of weeks ) . <p> Original ideas are relatively easy to come by if you are willing to cut yourself free from the prevailing thinking in the niche or discipline that you are in . That being said , the best way IMHO to cut yourself free is to go and study something entirely different . This opens up an entirely different perspective and tool set for you to borrow from . <p> Im stuck in academia at the moment ( and desperately trying to claw my way out ) and what boggles my mind is how most of these incredibly intelligent and hard working people are clueless about nearly everything outside their niche . <p> The problem is that venturing outside your niche is like getting aboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and prestige that let 's you cross fields easily . In the biological sciences , reviewers are n't  looking for original ways of thinking they are looking to give money to proposals that have the best chance of success . And those with the best chance of success are probably the least original . Me-too always works better than Me-first . <p> In terms of running a PF blog I 'm not really out to come up with earth shattering ideas . I want to use it as an impetus for myself to research and learn about those things that I 'm weak on . I also want to use my blog to clarify and explain ideas to myself and to my readers and to inject a bit of my personality and philosophy into PF . <p> AJ said , <p> I think a writing is high quality if I went in with an opposing viewpoint and came out with a similar viewpoint . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> Original means almost nothing to me.

So why bother ? As long as your way of explaining an existing idea is useful or entertaining to someone , its okay . <p> Its different with scientific publications though but in the blogging or in the movie business , for example , the same ideas can be reused .

My main party trick as a mathematician is ( sorry to say , but at least its not my only mathematical skill ) to generalize results that are already out there this is indeed standing on the shoulders of giants but it leads to new results , and sometimes these new results are surprisingly and qualitatively different from the original ones . <p> Oh yeah , about Einstein : I wondered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity .

I think only 4% of the population actually have original ideas , majority are derivatives .

This has led me to practice the idea of ignoring popular thinking , after I gain a solid foundation of subject knowledge , and trek out on my own a bit . <p> Also , I disagree with your thought that I think it is fairly accepted that something similar to Einstein 's miracle year would never happen today ( that 's why it was considered a miracle ) . I do not think Einsteins discoveries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breadth and depth will never happen again . To the contrary , given the proliferation of information , and the ease with which individuals can tinker in hacker/maker spaces , and the abundance of communication mediums , I venture to say we are poised to see this become a regular occurrence in the near future . <p> Academia is for now the status quo , but because of bloated administration , and core tenants , rules , guidelines , and popular philosophies , I think there will become a point where academia becomes moot and groups or cells of interdisciplinary individuals will come together and further our collective knowledge and advancement . <p> Specialization will become a thing of the past , particularly if economies of scale shift and hacker/maker spaces and technologies/access to , increase . <p> Denise said , <p> I really want to stress that I do not think large corporations like Google and Apple will spearhead this shift .

@@42287829 @2287829/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> This Saturday we almost bought an RV . We have been prospecting for the past few weeks and visiting various local RV dealers . At our third RV dealer , we got double teamed by a couple of manager+trainee ( I believe ) . After mentioning our frugal budget , we got steered in the direction of a 34 ' class A ( 1991 Georgie Boy Encounter ) . This unit had no slide outs but it was 5 feet longer than anything we have previously considered . So far we have had me pulling for smaller sizes and DW pulling for larger sizes . For me it is a compromise between size and maintenance/depreciation costs . Were still rookies ( and the salespersons can really smell that ) and thus I do n't  want to go very high for our first model ( which may be our last ? ! ) . I basically the costs of this one sunk . <p> ( * ) For the experts , were looking to become full-timers but generally not to drive the thing around ( e.g. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of a fifth wheel , but we do n't  have a truck , also we would like to avoid commuting in a truck . <p> For that reason I am also forcing myself to go slow ( When they started talking about price , the first " number " was " under $20,000 . Then after my hemming and hawing ( Yeah , dude , just try to get me excited about spending money , I challenge you ! = ) , the numbers started dropping " $18,000 " , " $16,000 " , " $14,000 " . Then they went inside and left us alone ( presumably a salestrick ) . Out comes the general manager with a new number " $12,900 ? ( ** ) . Now I could sell a few positions and have that money in a few days , but I do n't  think that would be the best way to do it . Instead I propose each of us saving $1000 a month . That way we should have a useful amount of money in 6 months which is a reasonable amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . If we can not manage to accumulate the money and ditch enough stuff , I think were not ready . Doing a lifestyle change on the spur of the moment is just bound to end badly . <p> ( ** ) I later checked the blue book value and this number was around the low end . Just goes to show how little we know . <p> Another stumbling block which I think should be cleared first is to literally get rid of a lot of the stuff we have . Now , I do n't  think we have a lot , but we certainly have more than what will reasonably fit in an RV . Besides , if you moved recently , you know that people usually are surprised to learn how much more they have when its all out on the floor compared to when its stored in closets , drawers , etc . In my case , I pride myself on not having much clothes , but I still have enough to get dressed for about 10 days without doing laundry . I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny RV closet . In addition there 's my text book addiction . I have a lot of 1200 page books on investments and economics . Those would be nigh impossible to sell ( They fetch $1$3 on the used market ) and are difficult to borrow in the library . On top of that I have a bunch of weights , rings , clubs , vests , etc . Other than that , I think I 'm good . DW+common possessions , not so good . Therefore were having a yard sale the coming weekend . <p> In terms of getting rid of stuff , I think a good list of guidelines are <p> If you are surprised to learn that you actually own " one of these " it definitely goes , no excuses . <p> If it has cob webs on it , the spider says it goes . After all possession is 9/10 of the law . <p> If it has not been used for a year or I would say even over a month it goes . A month is probably a very stringent goal and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for a few books , I do n't  think I own anything else I would n't sacrifice for the " year " -rule . <p> If it does n't  " fit " , it goes . This goes literally for clothes , but it also goes toys that are no longer acceptable in your current life . Like the beer bong or the 300W mono amp . <p> If there is a double , one goes . For instance , there 's no reason to own two waffle irons or two lawnmowers . <p> I think this list is self-evident and a fairly good starting point . I 'll let you know how our yard sale goes next Saturday . <h> 14 users responded in " Downsizing for an RV " <p> Sounds like a good plan . I 'm hoping to move into a van later this year . Even though I do n't  have much stuff I 'll still need to get rid of a lot of it before I can move into the van . <p> spork said , <p> If I were shopping for an RV I might wait until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find more accommodating sales-critters and better prices in November . On the other hand , RV dealers are probably having a rough year this year with the high fuel prices , any time could be a good time to buy <p> Have you ever considered buying some land somewhere and putting up a cob house ? Land would probably be your largest expense ( I know of at least one five acre lot going for $40,000 outside Charlotte , NC ) while the construction of the cob house could be as cheap as $5,000 . Some cob houses in England have stood for hundreds of years . They are environmentally friendly and if you wanted to could turn it into a pile of dirt when you got old and wanted to erase your presence from the face of the earth . <p> Buying land also would let you farm your own food and raise your own animals . You could also install a grey water system to irrigate your garden and conserve water . <p> It may be a little more expensive in the short term , but it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And besides , your wife might think that living in a cottage is cute and preferable to an RV lifestyle . <p> Alex K said , <p> Amen brother ! I just made 28 ebay auctions Sunday , getting rid of stuff I just do n't  use . I moved across the country in 2001 with only a car-full of stuff , now I have a whole house full of junk . <p> I hear having a slide-out makes a huge difference on RV interior space , but you probably saw that at the RV lot . Of course the drawbacks are they are heavier and also you would be less " stealthy " with big slideouts extended . It would be obviouse someone is camping there as opposed to just an RV parked there . <p> Are you planning to park it in a conventional RV park or stealth camp ? <p> Seth Miller said , <p> I was also wondering more about the plan of where you would park it ? and if you are planning on staying at your jobs ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> The problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers are just not very compatible with someone who wants to settle ( it would be quite hard to sell a cob house or a straw bale house as I have considered ) . <p> We intend to park it in an RV/mobile home park . There are several around here . Alternatively , we might be able to negotiate a deal with a homeowner who will let us park it in his driveway/on his land . The problem with this approach is that it probably does n't  come with hookups ( except electricity ) . <p> Jason said , <p> Jacob ( And DW ) I 'd definetely " Pretend " you bought the RV by getting rid of EVERYTHING that would not fit in an RV . You can do that for the next six months to " Try out " the lifestyle !

@@42287840 @2287840/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Personal finance blogs primarily fall in three major categories . First , there are the " getting out of debt " blogs . Second , there are the " just got out of college " personal finance blogs . Third , there are the " career track " personal finance blogs . Of course there are more categories such as retirement blogs or I-won-the-lottery blogs , but these are the biggest . <p> Drawn below is a graph depicting this triad . <p> The x-axis shows spending . The y-axis shows earning . The diagonal line shows where earnings are equal to spending . Those who are in debt have been spending more than they have been earning and thus they lie below the diagonal line . " Graduates " ( young people ) have low earnings but hopefully also low spending . At that point in life there is a tendency to spend as much as one earns since earnings are relatively low . The major group is what I for lack of a better word call the career track blogs . Here spending is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years as earnings and spending get progressively higher as a roughly constant margin for the retirement plan is retained . Since one particular blog shows a snapshot in time of a persons finances , plotting all the bloggers at one time reflect the typical financial path taken by a person in our society . It looks like this . If there are any amateur astronomers reading this just think of the similarities to the typical evolution of a star on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram . No , there is no hidden cosmic significance here = <p> A person in this diagram may start in debt or at the spending=earning line . As earnings go up savings are gradually increased to 15% at which point they are held constant . As earnings keep going up spending is adjusted accordingly . After 30 or 40 years , the person retires with a modest drop in spending ( no cafeteria lunch and no commute ) . This path is how most people think when it comes to personal finance . Other paths may sound strange or even impossible.Here are some other paths . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the typical path above is just one of several possible path . The typical path corresponds to going into student debt , then getting a career for 30-40 years eventually paying off the debt and accumulating a large amount of money ( ideally 1-2 million dollars in retirement funds ) and then retiring at a high spending level which little concern for how the money is spent.Early retirement can be reached through perhaps modest student debts but saving substantially more at a rate of 30-50% for 15-20 years at which point early retirement is possible at age 40-50 . This does require some budget control to carry through.Extreme early retirement is reachable with even smaller student debts ( or perhaps no student debts ) and saving 50-80% for 5-10 years . This makes it possible to retire between ages of 30 and 40 . This requires substantial money management and frugality skills.The two conclusions to be drawn here is that by observing a large group of personal finance bloggers one can get an idea of how a person ( a blogger to be exact ) typically behaves over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strange " blogs to see what other paths are possible . <h> 27 users responded in " What people ought to know about the different kinds of personal finance blogs " <p> I have enjoyed reading your blog . It does seem that most blogs talk about getting out of debt . I have been able to save at least 15% of my earning since I left college . I now save over 30% of our income for investing . My blog falls in the category of investing for people who have been able to save some extra money . I am on the early retirement track but I have two big issues that will not allow me to retire before 60 , young children and paying for medical coverage . <p> As an economists , I am impressed . Nice way to explain the situation on the blog world or sphere . I was thinking of some bias existing in blogs which is somewhat related to your post so here is an idea of self reported wealth on personal finance blogs . For some blogs that have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for housing is crashing down and while the financial market has low or negative returns , the wealth factor of self reported value goes up or is maintained ! This self reporting bias is evident and as a lifelong student of bias I find the information of interest . To me , one of the issues one must face is decision bias to make better decisions and accurate reporting/scorecard is a method to check bias with evidence . Perhaps I will classify personal finance blogs with a cognitive dysfunction . <p> Well , I 'm thinking you 'd put me in the " just graduated " collection of blogs . I 'm not really in the " get out of debt " group , except that I am in debtbut its not credit card/car loans/etc. debt like a lot of those blogs , its student loans debt . And yes , debt is debt , but I guess its not that I was overspending like a fiend , I was just borrowing to go to college . <p> imho this is your best post yet . I think I fall into the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I 'm at LEAST 57 ( my 100% income replacement crossover ) but most likely until 62 . The catch is that I have started saving young enough and in large enough amounts that I will have amassed a huge amount of wealth ( $12-15 million ) . I will be free to spend significantly more at age 57+ then I do during my career . <p> My goal is to maximize my lifetime financial potential . Literally I will spend as much as I can ( and have as much fun as I can ) between now and when I die . That of course requires investing now for maximum spending later . I think I 've picked a plan that is the best route to achieve my goals ( at least for me ) . Sitting around with nothing to do is not for me. = 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @simplicity in kansas I think one factor that keeps net worth from going down during downturns is that people keep adding savings . Personally I am breaking just about even e.g. portfolio drop for 2007 equals my savings resulting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher net relative to earnings have seen a drop wheres those with high earnings relative to net will usually see their net increase at all time thus appearing very successful . Of course then there 's the fact that not every blogger reports earnings and spendings ( or net ) . Also not every person blogs . <p> @adfecto heh , I bet that 's because you do n't  disagree as much as usual in this case = Its interesting that you approach it as an optimization problem . This lead my to consider what I have been optimizing . I think the answer is independence or self-sufficiency . <p> Hannah said , <p> @Adfecto " Sitting around with nothing to do is not for me . " <p> This assumes that there is " nothing to do " when one is not at work performing their job . Which is a rather dire way of looking at leisure time ! If anything , would n't you want to retire earlier on less , since even half of the projected 12-15 million should be sufficient to provide a very comfortable lifestyle ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " <p> As for me , I am currently 21 and starting out with nothing ( zero inheritance , saved wealth , or financial/familial safety net ) . I plan on aggressively investing the bulk of my income , and retiring in my late 30s on approximately 500,000 in investments to support a very simple , frugal , minimalist lifestyle . I know , sacrilege ! But what can I say : I 'm an extremist when it comes to my worship of my leisure time . I only have approximately 40-50 more years on earth after that , if Im lucky , and you know how life is its short . And I 've made my peace with that . The point is , my FI style is more about aggressively maximizing my Time rather than my Investment Income . There is a distinct point ( early on , as you can see ) when I want to " cross over . " I want to use that free time to explore ideas and philosophies , learn about human history and different cultures , create art , appreciate other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of literatures Great Books ( a big one for me , because I love to read ) , enjoy films , take bike rides , hang out at the beach , spend an idle evening cooking and entertaining guests , volunteer for causes I believe in , etc. etc . Goodness , talk about nothing to do , there 's too much to do ! What pains me is that there is n't more time to do it all , and that I do n't  have FI now . <p> Sitting around spending the majority of my life working , accumulating more money than I really need , that 's not for me. 10157 @qwx420157 <p> I have to chuckle ( at myself ) . I started out ( around 23 or 24 ) with the same opinion as Adfecto . I distinctly recall saying to myself and others : " I 'm the type of person who does n't  mind working , and can see myself working past 70 . " But now ( 38 ) I have done what Hannah says she will do by her late 30s . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can and may *change* her/his mind . I hope to see Hannah stick to her guns though , because what she proposes is both doable and admirable . <p> Thrifty Canadian said , <p> @Steve Very interested in how you changed and how hard you think the change was . Stuff like convincing spouse is more difficult than changing life style I suppose . You want to share with us in a guest post , since you now Sitting around with nothing to do " ? 10157 @qwx420157 <p> Canada , it was an easy gradual change from about age 31-36 . Probably nothing that rates a guest post . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Steve I 'm also interested . I find this anything but easy . I 've probably been too institutionalized . DW actually seems to be more accepting of my ER than I am . <p> Hannah said , <p> @Steve Thank you for the encouragement = I too would like to hear your story about how you achieved FI . Real life examples always make the dream seem that much more tangible ! <p> Its funny , reading over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But my life has been anything but .. I grew up in the foster care system and went through a period of homelessness in my late teens after " aging out " with no financial or familial safety net . This was a period when I had a bit of a " wake up call " regarding the nature of money , employment , society , consumerism , financial literacy , financial independence , mortality , self-perception and how it all ties into determining the quality of our lives . In short , my unusual circumstances forced me into a position of taking a good hard look at my priorities and circumstance , and figure out what I truly valued in life . <p> I think the defining aspect of my personality is that I am simultaneously a romantic and a realist . I have a bit of an " English major temperament " = which explains my fanatic worship of Time as a means to simply contemplate and appreciate life . I am also an INTJ and have strong tendencies toward questioning herd mentality and being skeptical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and facing up to economic reality , also makes me a realist . <p> I know that only time will tell if I indeed " stuck to my guns " but I truly believe that , on many levels , FI is not simply a means to an end but a worthy challenge a lifestyle , in fact . Its sort of like an exclusive game , where entry is admitted to those who exhibit unusual levels of endurance , self-control , and patience . Part of the fun is testing out ones own willpower ! <p> Nice post I am definitely a niche investing blog that focuses on retirement planning or living off your income producing assets . I do have a several decades before I retire however ( I 'm still in my 20s ( <p> I 'd buy him a beer or two . I got the idea for this post from Early Retirement Extremes What You Need To Know About The Different Kinds of PF Blogs and the graphical presentation . Since I would probably fall into the Career Track classification , I 10150 @qwx420150 <p> I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly after graduation . Being European ( ER is an American thing IMO ) , the idea was totally new to me but very exciting . My first goal was like 3-4 million say , " Adfecto " style retirement . Just like Steve I 've come to change my mind and I credit this blog for that . These days I 'm thinking a few 100k ( as far as I 'm concerned ) to 1M ( for a future family ) . I 'm now 28 and I hope to be there by 40 . <p> That said , I hope I 'll love what I do so much that I wont want to retire at 40 , but its good to have a choice . I do know I 'll want to spend time with my future kids ( more than my own dad did ) . 10150 @qwx420150 <p> Forgot to add my savings rate is 50% ( of net income ) . Basically , for every dollar you spend , you put one aside . This seems like a good balance to me : frugal but not obsessive ( obsessive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life will be better after retirement ) . <p> Very nice . The aspect I have encountered much in the rural area is seasonal work whether it be farming , Alaska fishing , or in the forest . Work your butt off for a few months and take a season off . Small retirements throughout ones lifetime . I have done this and like it . The time off and fun gives rejuvenation to go at it hard again . <p> blah said , <p> I am curious how much of the overall US population constitutes the middle class . I ask this because this article did a good job of categorizing the classes of PF blogs targeting the middle class , but I wonder , how many people are considered poor and so just live paycheck to paycheck and how many people are so rich that money is just numbers and games . I know that the rich are in the minority , but i wonder how many middle class there are that fit the typical description here vs how many poor who life like the college student their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary widely , but what about here ? Is there a reliable consistent source for that ? I am confused , because whenever I academically read statistics put out by the census bureau or other government agencies , it appears to me that the number of poor listed is much less than what I experiencially see around me in the world as I go about my daily life . I wonder if it is because of the places I have traveled or where I have lived , but I have done a ton of travelling in my life and have seen more of it in the places I have gone than the statistics seem to indicate . The reason I point this out is because I wonder how typical the typical PF blog is , vs is it just that those type of people read PF blogs , ie , people who are way thrifty either by choice or by circumstance , would not tend to read the average PF blog to start with either because it is unenlightened or well , because it is totally in a different financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are talking about . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @blah I cant comment of statistical data or official numbers . However , pf bloggers seem to have a WAY better understanding of personal finance than the average person . I used to think that having saved 100k before age 30 ( before most people have serious income ) was unique/remarkable , but for many pf bloggers this is more the rule than the exception . <p> PS : This was my understanding four years ago when there was still only about 100-200 pf blogs . Now there 's close to a thousand , so this rule may no longer hold . <p> Extremist here . I 'm saving over 80% of my income and hope to be able to retire within two years . I do n't  know where I fit on your personal finance blog graph . By title , my blog focuses on just graduated yet I 've often struggled with that b/c very few twenty-somethings are thinking about early retirement and its a passion of mine . You 're not the only one who struggles with the name of their blog , Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy comes down to this : you only live once and I cant imagine ever laying my deathbed wishing I had worked more hours or climbed higher on the company ladder . I can imagine wishing I had spent more time with family , friends , and doing the things I loved . <p> I have to add one more . I have been home sick for the last couple of days . Days of medicine and being in my chair to recover has allowed time to catch up on the financial blogs . I am amazed how many coupon/free deal blogs there are . And what store has what price . Since my way of doing things tends to keep me OUT of stores they are not something I would follow but they do seem very popular . I guess I would refer to them as Discount Consumerism blogs . <p> andy said , <p> Hi also from Kansas ! <p> I just want to add that I think its funny that people come to this site , and comment about how they wo n't retire early , or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that they will have mega millions when they retire / live a " more fulfilling life " . <p> I think the blog and philosophy behind ERE is flying straight over their heads . <p> I think this is an excellent ( yet simple ) graphical illustration of the concept of early retirement . There are a lot of people that learn better from a visualization and this may help some understand it better . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287842 @2287842/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> In the past I have mentioned the importance of selecting hobbies , activities really , in such a way that they do not cost you money , rather they should be free or at best actually make you money . <p> Disclaimer : Yes , I know that my two sports ( inline hockey and shinkendo ) cost me money and thus are not in accordance with what I preach . These are recent additions though . <p> I do n't  know about you , but pretty much anything I get my brain on eventually turns interesting once I learn enough , so having had a hobby for a long time or thinking that something new is not or less interesting is no excuse for not picking up something different . <p> If you lack ideas of what to pick as a hobby that has little net cost or is even profitable , here 's a list . Feel free to add your suggestions . <p> Home renovation . ( At the very least you can learn to fix your own house . Possible developments include care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during real estate bubbles . ) <p> Carpentry . Or cabinet building . Consider elevating one home renovation skills to the point where you can make things as good as or better than machine-made store-bought items . <p> Watch repair . ( This is what I am currently trying to pick up . It seems that many watch and clock repairers are self-made . The books to get are the ones by de Carle or enroll in a correspondence course . Get Bergeon tools either from ofrei.com or eBay . ) <p> Mechanics . Any vehicle is good , but I would suggest starting with things that are generally maintained by owners e.g. two-wheelers . My grandfather used to buy up cheap bicycles , fix them up and sell them again . He had more than a hundred stacked up in his garage . <p> Fitness . ( This will first make you healthy and if you are good at it , you could get certified , usually costing anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousands , and leverage this into teaching classes at a gym/fitness center . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-taught . It is almost impossible to tell you what to learn exactly these days . In my younger days I became adept enough at *nix to become the administrator for the theory group at my department . ) <p> Gardening . ( You almost have a duty to learn this . Oh uh , there I go with my personal values again . ) <p> Cooking . ( Same as above . This could be leveraged into catering if you are any good at it , but you should probably not start thinking in terms of gourmet restaurants just yet . Wait until you have won a couple of baking competitions . ) <p> Crafts . ( This is for girls right ? Wrong ! For those , who are too inept at knitting like myself ( I taught myself to knit from a webpage and managed to make a scarf about half a foot long before I gave up ) , how about building steam engines ? Some have gotten so good that they now build models for museums . If you are creative and good steampunk seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonk . I used to be a wonk . Then I took at break and now I 'm a wonk again in a different field . Pick something you 're interested in and start a blog about it or a web page . If you write well or have something interesting to say ( at least one of these qualities are required ) , you can gain a lot of interesting connections . The world is much smaller than you think . <p> Teaching . If you 're a masochist , you might consider tutoring . Tutoring seems to fall in two classes of students . The clueless who desperately needs a D or else , and the keeners who want to go from A to A+ . You may like it . It pays okay right out of the box and its a chance to keep your high school/college skills sharp . <p> Investing . ( And personal finance , obviously ) . Admittedly , this can lead to losing money as well . The interesting aspect here is that the remuneration depends on the size of your portfolio . You gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to when you are managing $20k for the same work . Hence , investing as a hobby is something that pays off eventually . <p> Things that did n't  make the list <p> Music . You have to be really good if you expect anyone to pay you for music lessons . Unlike fitness where you could probably be an " expert " in a couple of years , becoming a good musician will take at least half a decade . <p> Sports . Same thing . You can probably make assistant coach , but coaches seem to have spent at least half a decade or more on the sports before they can break even . Consider whether you 're one of the best players in your town/city . If not , you 're probably not good enough to get paid . Just my two cents . <p> Collecting . I could have put this on either list . The problem here is that you get paid from assembling collections but mostly from " holding " , that is , waiting . The problem here is that its a fast way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what will sell and what will not sell . <p> Research . There are very few fields , where you as an amateur can make a viable contribution , simply due to lack of the access to the proper channels . Science works much like a guild in that sense in that if you do not have the proper credentials , you will largely be ignored . <p> What the items on this list have in common is that they all belong to " rock star " -professions , where most of the money goes to a few people on the top and where differences that are only recognizable to a few experts translate into a large monetary difference . <p> Jacob comments : <p> It seems I was wrong or at least incomplete about music . I never thought about playing for others even though I know a couple of people who do this ; maybe because they seem to play more for the fun of it than for the money . <p> If you absolutely must do science , astronomy is an area where amateur effort is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Comet hunting in which you spend long nights looking for " stars " that move and variable star observation where you spend a few minutes each night per star recording variable stars which change their light output for different reasons . If you want to have a go at the latter , go to AAVSOs site to get started . You do not need an expensive telescope for the latter , since you 're just comparing the brightness of your target star relative to a reference star . <p> I DJ on the side playing " Music " and make a very lucrative paycheck doing so . Granted the upfront investment is large but what brick-and-mortar type business is n't ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @jon I was n't thinking of DJing at all ( I know two people who DJ(ed) ) ; maybe because I do n't  think of it as " playing " music , hehe 8- ) , but what do I know . What I meant was people playing an instrument , unless perhaps its really unique yet popular like bagpipes ? <p> You do n't  have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have to be better than your students . I taught piano to children when I was 16 yrs old ( 15 years ago ) . I made $15/hr in a small , Midwest town . I had high school friends who did the same with the guitar , violin , and flute . <p> Mo said , <p> I agree with promoting music to a hobby that one can use to make money . Many upscale restaurants , hotels , parties , etc will hire a pianist , harpsist , or string instrument player to help set the desired mood . The right instrument helps , though Much to my chagrin , no one wanted my solo clarinet performance could have been the musician though oh well . <p> Under the idea of mechanics , in certain climates lawn mower repair can be a very needed skill . Also similar engines are used in go-carts and other contraptions . <p> Refurbishing antiques combines several of the disciplines mentioned , and certainly seems to be something that people can make some side money on . <p> I have a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I do n't  know if that 's the real name for such a hobby . Basically he can make things out of plastic , wood , metal , fiberglass , etc that closely resemble things you are familiar with . Generally he makes things that look like movie props . Youd be surprised how much someone will pay for a high quality Storm-Trooper costume ( hundreds to thousands ) , or a toy gun that is similar in style to Han Solos blaster , or lamps or furnishings that look like particular scene from a movie . There are some legalities to be mindful of , apparently . <p> I do n't  know if providing expert opinion or testimony really counts as a hobby , but it seems to be as much of a hobby as tutoring , and is something one can do on an as needed basis in early retirement . <p> Alex said , <p> under the idea of music- there are ways to make money playing music that do n't  involve teaching . street performing ( on the weekends , if you 're still working ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is variable depending on location , time , weather , etc. clubs usually pay anywhere from $10-$100 a night , depending on turnout and popularity of your act . <p> Scott said , <p> Thanks for this post , Jacob . I think a lot of people have the idea that hobbies are for enjoyment exclusively . They fall into something , usually out of proximity , and stick with it no matter how reasonably it aligns with their life style/goals . <p> fandd said , <p> Really enjoyed this post . I was wondering about this when your previous post mentioned a " neutral " hobby . <p> Jan said , <p> I think this is one of your better posts . <p> Profitable hobbies are like income-producing assets and sources of passive income : everybody recommends them , but few manage to come up with interesting examples . <p> jane said , <p> I 've always been a reader/writer , mostly as a hobby but also a few years trying to teach English to adolescents . Now , in retirement , I 'm making a little money copy-editing for friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just banked an $85 check for the first chapter of a six-chapter book @ $2/page ! No bloggers yet , but let me know when , Jacob ! <p> I 've always wanted to be a bike mechanic at least become proficient at working on my own bike . I want to take a class/workshop . Better yet teach myself . To that end I 'm borrowing a couple DVDs on bike repair from the library and am about to purchase a bike stand from Amazon ( cheaper than the one I saw on Craigslist ) . I think I 'd use it at least weekly ( fitting in with your rule about making purchases ) , but if you have thoughts/advice I 'd like to know . I like the perspective you bring to these topics . I also knit and have sold these items . Not as much in the warmer months . <p> On sports , I have a friend who picks up a little cash as an umpire . He is paid to umpire high school and city league games . He turned his passion for baseball into a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city leaguesat age 50 ! You do have to really know the rules , be tough , and be diplomatic . Learning the rules could certainly be done in a short while , the others are things you either are , or you are n't  . I imagine the same applies to a number of other sports . <p> Hi Jacob , maybe in fitness or teaching category , I would put Salsa dancing ( or any other dance , actually ! ) . Its fun , cheap and sociable , and in few years ( let me say 3-4 ) opens the doors to assisting and eventually teaching . There 's no certification required or professional study , as Salsa comes from the street = <p> Luke said , <p> What about beekeeping ? <p> Ive been doing some research and it sounds fascinating . Granted , there is some outlay ( ---/$$$ ) to begin with , but most of the sources I 've read suggest that it could turn a profit in the second year . <p> Even if it did n't  , its a very scalable hobby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be much different from 1 hive to 50 hives . <p> Add to the mix the fact that bees are very important for the ecosystem ( green hobby ) , farmers will like you for your airforce of pollen-dropping bees ( free land to put extra hives on ? ) , honey is a very healthy foodstuff that can last for centuries if stored correctly and lots of people like it great for treating sweet-toothed friends , building social capital and possibly bartering ? <p> JerseyGirl said , <p> Great post ! <p> One thing that women ( or guys too I suppose ) can do is beauty treatments . I love hair , and I recently cut my very thick , tightly curly hair from hip length to a few inches past my shoulders . I was spending so much money on products ! Now its much more affordable , and frees up lots of time . <p> Anyway , if you can style hair you can make a nice income on the side . If you can braid , install false hair or even just style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your hobby . If you are n't  using chemicals then you do n't  need a beauticians license , at least in my state . <p> You could also do things like hair threading , which take 5 minutes per customer , and women will gladly pay $10 for , plus a tip . If you do these kind of beauty treatments during the evenings when most women are off from work , you can make a nice profit that can go directly into your ERE principal , while you still work your day job . This under the table money ca n't be beat . <p> Enhancing beauty is fun ( for me anyway ) and its a great way to socialize while you make some cash . <p> Bakari said , <p> One thing to be careful of though <p> Sometimes if you make too much money at something , a hobby starts to feel like a job . <p> I used to go out for long bike rides all around the east bay at least once a week . I went on a 2600 mile bike ride from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not get paid for what I enjoy ? <p> I spent almost 2 years as a bike messenger , and now I almost never ride for fun anymore . <p> I 'm sure it makes a big difference if its 40 hours a week vs. now and then , but just to be on the safe side , I never seriously pursued a career as a porn star <p> Bakari said , <p> p.s . I always liked to fiddle with bikes , and now I am actually covering a shift at a bikeshop right this very second as I type this . I spend about 8 hours a month here , so it still feels like a hobby I get paid for <p> Luke said , <p> Bakari , I had a related experience when I decided to bootstrap my teenage love of SoCal punk music into a small-scale business to help support my university studies , buying stock from US wholesalers to sell on in the UK where fringe music fans like myself werent yet supported . <p> I made out like a bandit for a little while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year ( just ) ) . To begin with it seemed like next to no effort to scout out wholesalers/record labels , order up a big box of merch and then eBay it for a healthy profit . But then I started to realise that I spent more time sending out parcels than I did listening to music and going to gigs . <p> I guess that 's when music stopped being such an interest of mine I havent worn a band t-shirt in years ( sniff ; ) ) 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Bakari , Luke Yes , this is a real danger . I stopped reading SciAm , Nature , Astronomy , Sky&amp;Telescope , and other magazines almost as soon as I started studying physics . When I started doing research , I would tend to have very little interest in physics problems beyond my own little niche . The " physics-energy " was just gone . I needed other kinds of stimulation . Other hobbies . Presently , physics is completely ruined for me . I do n't  care to follow it at all . Thats kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school sparetime with my nose in a college text book and deriving equations just for fun . <p> Carlos E said , <p> What about photography ? If you study enough you can get very professional photos . I 'd won 2 contest already ( and my gear is already paid by the prizes ) ; and my friends hire me for their weddings , so I do n't  even have to buy a gift and get paid bay them . <p> My hobby is Krav Maga which is a self defense martial art . I make very nice money on the side teaching Krav Maga several times a week and also running intensive Krav Maga Seminars here in Thailand where I live . I also get spin off personal fitness trainer work from the Krav Maga and have a few extra clients for personal fitness . I get paid to bring my clients jogging along the beach frontnice work ! <p> My main day job is as a teacher in an school here in Thailand , so I occasionally do English tutoring on the side as well . <p> Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being a Krav Maga Instructor . <p> morrigan333 said , <p> Disagree about music . It depends on who you want to teach . Beginning children or adults do n't  really require that much experience or expertise even if you 're merely an adequate or mediocre player . You just have to be more accomplished than your potential student pool . It does , however , require a great deal of patience to teach children ( and deal with parents ! ) , and if you 're teaching a non-portable instrument like piano or organ , you have to have a studio or buy one for your home . But at $15-$20 US for a half-hour lesson , it can add up quickly . I have n't tried this myself , but I have many friends who do it to suppliment their income and they think its worth it . <p> but I think these are hobbies that most people can start out with and build from there . jacob from Early Retirement Extreme has a much bigger list if you need some more <p> Joe Betz said , <p> How about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems into English . Freelance translation is definitely lucrative . Of course , its likely to be a different genre than poetry , but its translation nonetheless . <p> Your list is pretty awesome ! ! ! Money-making machine might be a stretch . But many hobbies really can pay off if you 're good at them and know how to market yourself . Lots of good stuff I get here . This would be so helpful for people making career choices ! Yes , blogging is also a nice idea for those who have interest in writing . I am also a writer . I am writing blogs on Finance care education . These days when people want to make money , the first thing they think of is blogging . To make a decent income today , I am writing via sites like Elance , or ebooks . <p> Incomplete list of hobbies that could earn money : I like picking interests that are either cost-neutral or productive : coding , cooking , writing , reading I have n't figured out how to make gardening work for me yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobby is buying and re-selling on eBay . I started with things around the house and have grown from there . I make plenty of money doing it ( over 1500 saved this way in 2014 ) and plan on furnishing our house with it . Definitely a blast . Started blogging on it too , which who knows , maybe thatll be a hobby that pays off ? <p> Nice post . I never thought of having a hobby that actually pays but this way of thinking makes complete sense . Thanks for sharing . <p> grace said , <p> You can also do pet sitting if you enjoy spending time with animals . There is a lot of money to be made if you are personable and reliable . Its not exactly a hobby but caring for pets while their owners are away is a flexible and rewarding hobby/money-making endeavor . <p> CT said , <p> Over the years I had several hobbies that both helped save me money &amp; earn quite a bit on the side . One was sewing for my household ( mending , alterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . But beware , sewing for profit can get you in over your head ; especially doing alterations , there is a huge demand ( I 'd rather create then alter so I rarely altered ) . Most of my sewing for profit was making Halloween costumes ; I also made costumes for local high school plays ( for free ) and my university Alma mater ( for profit ) . Another hobby was cake decorating &amp; holiday candy making ( Christmas &amp; Easteragain you can get in over your head ) . I stopped that one because of new laws passed in my state making it too rigorous to certify a kitchen . One final money making venture was assembling ( no real crafting here ) wedding , shower &amp; quinceanera favors &amp; invitations . People pay for the supplies and a per piece anywhere from .50 to $3 . Assembling Centerpieces drew $15 to $40 ea . Church pew bows $2 ea . Manicures are big money makers too !

@@42287846 @2287846/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I like to think of myself as fairly ordinary . To outsiders I seem to fit into my neighborhood . I watch movies , cut my lawn and play with my son outside when it is nice out . Yet despite that Im so fundamentally different from them . You see I do n't  plan on working past my 45th birthday . Now being almost 30 , most people think my plan to retire at 45 is merely the idealized fantasy rather than a likely outcome . When in fact barring any major problems like my house burning down the day after my insurance company goes bankrupt Im for certain to retire before 50 and very likely to retire at 45 . So how is this possible ? Well simply put it was a choice . About five years ago I decided that working until I turned 65 sounded like a bad idea . After all I liked my job , but I can easily think of at least a half a dozen other ways to spend my time rather than working . So I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it at 55 , but then I thought , what the hell let 's go for broke and try for 45 . That 's when I started to look into it . I realized retirement is actually a fairly simple equation if your investment income is greater than your spending in a year you can retire . So you can either save more or reduce your spending to get there a lot faster ( even faster yet , if you do both ) . So I took a hard look at my lifestyle and realized I do n't  really need a lot of money to be happy . I 'm happy with home cooked meals and borrowing books from the library . Assuming I can pay my mortgage by 45 my wife and I can easily live off of $24,000/year in todays dollars.Then came the challenge of reducing expenses . In the beginning it was easy to find the wasteful spending on power ( switch to CFLs ) , food ( cooking more at home ) , water ( low flow shower heads ) and using the library for DVDs as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance deductibles to reduce premiums and focusing more on my investing to get a better rate of return . The end goal of it all is simple . How can I have a happy lifestyle on the lowest amount of spending possible while maximizing my savings ? You see I do n't  want to retire by giving up my lifestyle today . I still eat well on $300/month to feed a family of three . I eat steak with a drink of red wine , but I do n't  expect to do it all the time . I also grow a garden , because it saves money and I enjoy doing it ( and it tastes so much better ) . <p> Early retirement can be achieved by anyone . Its just a matter of your priorities : do you really want a new car or would you rather buy a used one and retire a year earlier ? Then you set your goal and work towards it . It is n't about getting there by living in misery , but rather find your own path . Each of us is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck finding yours . <p> If anyone would like to share their plans and goals for early retirement or financial independence let me know at LONG ... <p> I 'm in Regina , SK . It used to have very affordable housing until about 20 months ago when the boom hit ( I managed to buy before the boom ) . You have to remember that $24,000/year assumes I 've paid off my house . Right now I 'm living off of $34,500 , but that includes paying down my mortgage at an accelerated rate . <p> This is not my goal ( I 'm already in my late 50s and I want to work at least till 65 ) , but its so nice to know that I could do this ! It has been freeing to be able to say all these years : " I 'm working because I want to , not because I have to . " <p> DH and I could now , at about age 40 , " retire .

New kitchen gadgets were going to free up time . Building on every piece of property was going to create so much tax revenue .

I 'm just saying 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Caine The reason it did n't  happen as predicted is that increase efficiency has always translated into more stuff and more waste instead of more leisure time . We could have a 20 hour workweek by now if we accepted a 1950s lifestyle . The workweek could be even shorter if optimized . <p> Let 's say I worked 3000 hours per year when I was working . I worked 7 years ; that 's 21000 hours . I expect those 21000 hours to pay for 80 years of my life . Thats 80*52=4160 weeks . Roughly speaking that 's a 5 hour work week if I distributed my effort rather than relying on financial methods to shift cash flows . I consider that entirely realistic for everybody to do . However , people would then have a consumption corresponding to my $6000-7000/year level ; not my average " neighbors " $24000/year level . <p> Retirement Extreme The Early Retirement Path. - It used to be people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 55. - Then <p> Caine said , <p> @Jacob wrote " The reason it did n't happen as predicted is that increase efficiency has always translated into more stuff and more waste instead of more leisure time . " I disagree to an extent . I cant really prove anything mathematically . I can only tell you my life experience . I grew up in the 60s , in the same house I 'm living now . Both my wife and I would have to work full time today even to live a 60s lifestyle in this same house . In fact , in many ways life was better then . School busing , band , sports , and craft classes were free . They either cost or are non existent today .

And then probably spanked me just for good measure . Now this type of behaviour is normal$600 iPhone for each of the two teenagers , one for mom , one for dad . Oh , and we might as well get a tablet too . Damn , daughter keeps stealing itbetter buy her one for herself .

Linoleum countertop ? Do n't  make me laugh ! Granite ? That was so last year . Its quartz nowmore stylish , better antibacterial qualities . Of course it only costs a helluva lot more . The new " normal " has gone completely off the rails in spendy habits . My 3-year old nephew uses a $500 iPad . I had a 40-cent stack of paint-by-numbers books and a stuffed wiener dog doll from a flea market . <p> Kathy said , <p> I did n't  make it by 45 but I did at 53 . Never looked back . Never regretted it . We had a plan and a priority . And we have more money now that we ever did when working , thanks to wise investments and no " keeping up with the Jones " lifestyle . Now.we may just be the Jones on our street ! <p> Good start . My husband and I ( ages 39 and 44 ) are doing much the same thing . Also , I think its good to mention your approximate combined salary ( currently ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending = an earlier retirement . My husband and I were earning nearly $13,000 per month last year ( gross ) with rental income . We spent anywhere from $3000 to $5000 depending on the month . He " early retired " last June at age 43 . We sold the rental property ( which we owned outright ) . Now , we live on about $3500 $4000 per month . Gross income falls around $5500 per month . Our only debt is the mortgage which will be paid off in about 2 years .

@@42287847 @2287847/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> One of the most annoying aspects about living with a low expense level is dealing with well-meaning ( and ill-meaning ) people who think more spending is in order : " How can anyone be happy spending so little ? " , " This is one step away from being homeless . " , " Living below the poverty line does n't  sound like much fun " , and so on . <p> The natural inclination is to try to be defensive and try to explain how one can be quite happy by spending little and how above a certain level , happiness and spending actually has little to do with each other ; or try to explain how wise spending makes the money go significantly farther . <p> This rarely works . <p> If anything it confirms the spenders that they do n't  want to spend ( ha ! ) time looking for good deals or otherwise making do , using up , or doing without useless things . <p> A better strategy is needed . <p> Lately , I 've experimented with drawing attention away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-asset side , by providing some less than subtle running commentary on market reactions and various investment decisions I make . I have previously kept quiet about investing and money matters . <p> I may just be imagining this , but I sense that the attention from " concerned " individuals has gone down materially after I started talking about investing . <p> I wont be too in the face about it , so I 'll say things like " I added to my gold position on the correction today " and not things like " I just bought an additional $10000 worth of gold . " <p> I will admit , that the latter is sometimes tempting . Especially when people are bragging about their new sports car <p> which they probably got on lease . <p> I think the reason is that while spending money on consumerism is a socially accepted bragging point and a measure of your social status , investing and talking about money is considered taboo . <p> I suggest being subversive about this taboo . However , when someone brings up their new car lease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same amount of money on some investment because you know better . Rather , just start talking about the market and investing on a regular basis , like an investor would , much like consumers talk about their cell phones and exotic vacations . You can mention how you just increased your holdings of things and that without going into specifics . Be subtle . <p> The result would be that the prejudices people have of you as low-consuming individual , which most people for some reason see as a horrible way to live , are replaced with an image of being an investor , which is more socially acceptable . Furthermore , it will take peoples attention away from the fact that you 're not spending to the fact that they 're not investing . <h> 22 users responded in " " Your early retirement lifestyle is one step away from being homeless " " <p> That is a good technique no matter what the subject ! Basically , changing the subject stops a lot of discussion . Another technique may be asking a question on another subject . 10153 @qwx420153 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my broker today , redirecting some assets and incorporating a new methodology with a few investments I had not been paying any attention to . For the month of August , I am wincing , as I am overbought on precious metals owing to the original plan . I had decided to invest more into gold and silver , which are counter-cyclical to paper investments . While I am not particular in the sense of metals " survival money " functions , I am considering all options as we plunge into the fall of the year . I prefer not to speculate in land , as it takes more time , and the sell ratio of improved lands at this juncture is not promising . I do like multifamily housing , but I have that already , and it is a full plate . Looking over this year to date ( YTD ) my gains have properly plugged along at a statistical level of acceptance . While not overly optimistic for the out year , I have rehearsed the end of year swings in my mind and I will sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that promising at this time , we can agree . <p> HahaWhat if your own Mom questioned you about " being homeless " if you happened to subscribe this frugal lifestyle ? ! ? = <p> That is what my mom asked when I told her about my plans of retiring/being financially independent early in life . She said I had to have half-a-mil in the bank , a new car , and a house . <p> I 'm currently finish up my schooling ( doctorate &amp; MBA ) so I am well-accustomed to living well on $10K per year or less .

Which is odd , as she has a chequered career history herself and earns considerably less than I do ! <p> My fiancee knows about it , but she treats me with the mild amusement of a loving partner who realises that I 'm strongly interested in the subject , but has n't  realised that it goes deeper than interest . <p> Hopefully once the dividends start coming in shell appreciate the concept more . <p> bigato said , <p> I used this strategy sometimes with success . When asked why did I stop to study ( college ) , I said I studied too much on my own since young , there was nothing more to me to learn there .

To my wifes family ( specially to her father ) I will tell I 've stockpiled and invested too much money in all my years of working ( will be 13 to 15 years by then ) , that money could last two lifetimes and could buy me anything I want , and I did n't  need to do any work anymore .

Some great advice in the post threads . My families own houses they can barely afford with long standing mortgages .

If someone is interested in investing , then I will talk to them and it is a good conversation , but I find it is useless to evangelize frugallity because it will just make people mad but not change anything for the good .

@@42287851 @2287851/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> One of the most common objection consumers have to extreme early retirement is that its impossible to enjoy life on a low budget and therefore not worthwhile . That spending 75% of the best daylight hours working 9-5 so they can afford to " live a little " for the next 40 years is a better strategy . <p> I 've heard many of these objections and they all boil down to statements like this ( which I lifted off the comment thread of a single article about extreme early retirement ) <p> " shouldnt wait for tomorrow , but have fun now " <p> " cant afford little luxuries " <p> " do n't  want to live in austerity " <p> " does n't  enjoy good food " <p> " going to be missing out on concerts , games , toys " <p> " cant buy nice gifts " <p> " should live for the moment and do n't  count on an uncertain future " <p> " cant buy a collection of nice shoes and purses " <p> " never leaves the house " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatable . It happens every single time . In general , if you ask the average consumer what enjoying life is all about , it distills to the following trifecta : buying tickets , going to restaurants , and shopping . <p> That 's it .

I know , because that 's what I used to think . And its also what consumers keep bringing up . <p> Its true too ! But only insofar that you 're unaware of any alternatives to buying tickets , going to restaurants , and shopping . <p> When I first started saving massive amounts of money by reducing my spending , I had no replacements .

Started a new career that I do enjoy . <p> Sports : Placed 1st and 2nd in 2010 in two bay regatta series on a J/105 ( 35 ' yacht ) was out on the water racing almost every week On the winning team of the citys roller hockey league four seasons in a row ( center forward ) Various bike rides ( 3 centuries ) around the east bay . Also a grind up Mt Diablo. 3 years of Japanese swordsmanship ( three times per week ) . Clean&amp;Press 2+70 kettlebells . <p> Writings : The ERE book + another one . The ERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Lived in an RV ( I consider that an adventure . Not an austerity measure . ) Ocean racing Dinghy sailing on the local lakes and estuaries Mountain biking in the hills of the east bay Road biking around the east bay Long distance running ( only 13 miles , but self supported in 90F ) A trip to Yellowstone and Nevada desert A road/tent camping trip to Portland , OR and back again A road trip across the country . <p> It might surprise you just how little money I spent on all this . But it was not a lot . It was less than what the average household spends on furniture per year . <p> This is just my list . My idea of fun is mainly mastering various skills ( intellectual , technical , and sports ) and creating big projects . Other people have other ideas of what fun is . The point is , you can almost always find a low/no-cost way to have fun no matter what your interests are . Do you want to travel ? You could move to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for $300/month . Here are some other examples from other people pursuing ERE . <p> So let 's compare that list to the rather expensive entertainment budget of the average consumer <p> Buying tickets to see a 4 hour long game . <p> Eating a steak at a restaurant <p> Shopping <p> for 40 years maybe interspersed with a trip to Disneyland or some other country . That 's okay if you enjoy that . But there are also many other things to do . What I 'm saying is that not spending money is not limiting . <p> However ! <p> It does take some time to figure out what to do without spending money and how to do it . This typically takes 6-12 months . I , therefore , also want to warn any neophyte that this period probably IS going to frustrating and suck and feel like you 're not living . Its also going to take some effort .

Its 6-12 months after shifting from a " I must pay to have fun " -mindset to finding free/cheap activities in order to save money . <p> Typically , the first year of saving 75% of net income will be hard because its a steep learning curve . All beginnings are hard <p> Well , i think I agree to that list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to cost lots of money . But even here , many people like to go an expensive gym , do horse riding Biking also gets expensive if you get a good bike . But of course you can have fun for long term and with low cost if you do n't  have to drive to far places for a ride . <p> For me , my biggest hobby is to work at the moment . I love to learn new things in there every day . But after work , writing blog posts , chilling with my wife while watching a DVD is also fun and cheap = <p> What I miss on the list are social activies like having come togethers . I experienced those events usually to be quite expensive , even if expenses are shared . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Rico We do social activities/get togethers ( dinner &amp; drinks at home ) 1-2 times per month . All that does is to double the cost of dinner from around $5 to $10 on that day . <p> Hendra Mak said , <p> Long time reader first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indonesia ( currently live in Sydney ) , I find it easier to pursue personal financial dream i.e. ERE <p> In Asia where everyone try to conform to everyone in materialistic sense , Its EXTREMELY HARD to explain the fun part of non-consumer activities . If you think peer pressure in West is too much too bear , try Asia . <p> Thanks Jacob for your illuminating insights , your book is one of the best finc books I ever read . Let me know if you happen to stop by in Sydney , I will buy you a drink ! = ) <p> Without being rude to you , I have to say that everyone who is successful and has worked and attained financial stability and freedom has also enjoyed the journey . Everything that you list you have done has also been done by someone holding down a job . <p> I mention this because I find your thinking very black and white , many , many people get a lot of enjoyment and satisfaction out of their careers and make good money too that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful memories . You have n't really retired , you are just working from a computer like most people do . Why does it have to be either/or I love my life , my job , my stuff and I run my own company which is exciting and creative so please realize that you are not speaking for a great majority of people . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Lynn The great majority of people would not show up to work in their chosen career if they did n't  get paid to do so . Even if they do get enjoyment and satisfaction from it , its the paycheck that makes most people show up . <p> Only a minority would show up without monetary compensation . I belong to that minority . <p> Indeed , anything on my list can be done by someone holding down a job . However , the popular misconception is that its impossible the " live life " without spending money . I just proved otherwise and did far moremy list was done in 3 years timethan someone who 's tied down to a job would have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live a little . " Instead I prefer to " live life to the fullest " <p> Its pretty amazing what can be accomplished when instead of " living a little " during evenings , weekends , and the allotted 2 weeks of vacation , you can instead have 52 weeks of vacation a year to do whatever the hell you please <p> With our 52-weeks of free time each year we are traveling full-time . We 've just spent the last 3.5 months in Mexico , will continue to explore in Mexico for another 6 or so weeks , and then will continue southward through all of Central and South America . Its a little hard to do this with a full time job , and we are doing it now in our 30s instead of in our 60s and 70s <p> I can say without a doubt , this tastes better than any restaurant steak ever could <p> leeholsen said , <p> its definitely a process . i found i really did n't  even miss going to sports games ( except baseball , i love baseball and still go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picked up reading used books and its a lot more satisfying . i 'm going to read probably 30 books this year including gulag archipelago , a historic book ive wanted to read for quite a while . <p> when you make this process its sometimes hard to find things that fill the time at first , but you can find something . i know if i was ere now and could n't find anything , i could still spend time hiking with the dog daily while the kids are at school ; i know i always enjoyed that as a kid . <p> when i think if i would have started saving like this 5 years ago , i might be working for myself at my own pace now ; but its possible i could still get there in 3 years . <p> C40 said , <p> Great post . I think it is ironic/unfortunate that even when this ( the subject of this post ) can be explained so simply and clearly , people still will not believe it . Many will simply WANT to believe otherwise so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think it is comparable to performance enhancing drug use in bicycle racing ( and other sports ) . When you look at the details it has been obvious that PED use is commonplace . You can have one guy ( Lance Armstrong ) win 7 Tour de Frances in a row against a field that is all but obviously doping themselves , yet some fans just do n't  want to believe the truth . Its still obvious now that it continues yet people believe the claims of " it has gotten cleaner over the last 2-3 years ( which is exactly what they 've been saying for at least the last 15 years ) <p> People stretch and manipulate their own perceived realities in order to believe what they think will be more fun to be true or more fun to believe . <p> I think what it boils down to is this : spending for consumption vs. spending for experiences . The items most people spend may provide immediate gratification ( steak . . . Mmmmmmmmmm ) , but the experience that you spend on provide skills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a good rule of thumb to employ when making spending decisions is " will this provide value to me indefinitely in the future . " Travel , exercise , and training opportunities almost always will . Whereas one-off expenses " tickets " as you call them rarely do . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Saved Penny Not quite . The difference is between 1 ) spending as the primary means ; and 2 ) making as the primary means . That is , spending in order to get things or experiences instead of mainly creating those things or experiences yourself . <p> Working can also be one big soul-sucking experience . I eventually solved the problem through a series of downsizes that began way back in the ' 90s . The first thing I worked towards was eliminating my debt . Then I built up some savings . Then I changed my attitude about stuff ' . I found that the less I had , the less I needed . And the less stuff I needed the less income I needed . I moved to Mexico last year . I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . I rent a house that 's dirt cheap . I make leather sandals . Life is good . <p> I do n't  think that minimalism and retirement is for everyone . Some people just do n't  know what to do with their spare time , and enjoy the community at the workplace . Early retirement is only for the determined . <p> Again ! I have to comment as there is a single mindedness to this topic . Many people that are working especially those that are business owners , entrepreneurs have complete control over their schedules . If I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to go to Mexico , I can pack up my computer , get on a plane and go , rent an apartment and look at the ocean . My point is that you are making a big assumption when you think that everyone wants to retire and they do n't  because they are locked into commitments . You have chosen to live your life with extreme frugality and many people would n't consider that a life at all . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford that candy bar or not , that would depress the hell out of me . I do n't  live in the US so my perspective is different and life style is different . <p> I really do n't  see the fun in your life at all . I would be curious as to how many hours you are putting into this blog and the money you have made from it and what the hourly breakdown would be . You are still working my friend , whether you want to admit it or not . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Lynn I think you 're drifting off topic here . <p> The point of this post is that people mistakenly reject ERE because in their mind its impossible to enjoy life without spending money . In their mind and experience enjoyment is proportional to spending . In my mind and experience , enjoyment has little to do with spending . A consumer can spend on an $80/concert ticket to get 4 hours of enjoyment and do it over and over again . I can spend $80 on a musical instrument ONCE and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In fact , you just added another typical objection with the " If you have to debate over every penny you spend , whether you can afford that candy bar or not , that would depress the hell out of me. " -comment . I get that comment a lot too ! I do n't  debate whether to spend every penny just like you probably do n't  have an internal debate every time you tie your shoelaces . It just becomes natural . I do n't  think about " not spending " just like you seemingly do not think about " spending " . <p> Fair enough that you do n't  see the fun in the things I like to do , not everybody enjoys yacht sailing , mountain biking , woodworking , camping , going to Yosemite , etc . I do n't  see the fun in certain other things . <p> The point is one can do things without spending money , whereas consumers tend to think that this is impossible : That frugality is about the mental exercise of eliminating things to buy instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As for the time spent on this blog , I can give you a fairly accurate estimate . In 2012 I wrote 5 or 6 blog posts . That probably took a few hours total . The blog makes about $100/month ( I 've never been serious about monetizing it with ads and happily reject/ignore most . ) . The book that I published in 2010 makes about $1300/month . Obviously there 's no effort to that anymore . It did take more than 2000 hours to put togetherequivalent of a full years work . I 'd estimate the entirety of the blog post work to be around 1000 hours but that all happened years agoId say about half an hour per day over some 3+ years . I think I 've written 3 ( maybe 4 ? ) posts in 2013 so far . My invested savings from my career which I retired from in 2009 produce on the order of $1000/month on average ( capital gains and all ) . Out of this I spend about $600/month . <p> To reiterate the point . Its possible to enjoy life without spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but currently ( since 2012 ) I do in fact have a real salaried job doing something which I had previously done as an amateur hobby . <p> This job allows me to work on machines/data that would only be accessible if I had millions to spend . I enjoy this very much . I sometimes come in on weekends even as nobody else does . I think about it during evenings . I cant wait to get back in in the morning . <p> So I get why some people like work over everything else . I can see why someone is driven . However , in my experience from the past 15 years , from observing coworkers , who leave at 4:00 sharp and only do what they have to in order to avoid getting fired , such passion is only shared by a minority . The majority would rather be doing something else than work if money was not an issue . <p> The main reason they do show up for work is that they mistakingly believe that money IS an issue and that they would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money their paycheck provides . <p> In my case , since I do n't  need the money , everything I make from the job just goes to savings . I do n't  care much about that money because it cant buy me anything I cant get without needing to spend money anyway . Should this job ever lose my interest and I reach the point where I 'd rather be somewhere else I 'll just quitbecause I do n't  need the paycheck and I know that I do n't  . Easy as that . <p> amy said , <p> Lynn , some people choose to do things differently . What 's wrong with that ? What does it matter how many hours he puts in or how much money he makes . As long as he is happy it does n't  matter . The point is there are plenty of free and cheap activities out there to do that do n't  involve spending a lot of money , whether you work or not . You just have to choose it . <p> C40 said , <p> Lynn it seems you feel a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common misconception about ERE ( that we do nothing and have no fun ) is wrong . <p> He s not saying that what you are doing is wrong , or that you are a bad person , or anything like that . He s just saying that what he did is not wrong and is , in fact , very good for him and quite a few of us here . <p> He s not claiming that you or anyone else with a job can not have fun . He is saying that becoming FI and quitting his first job allowed him to have a lot more fun and that how much fun you have can depend very little on how much money you are spending that it depends much more on your intent , the way you enjoy your hobbies , and the amount of time you have to spend on them , and making conscious decisions ( which most of us enjoy doing itself .. and again not saying you are n't  making conscious decisions ) <p> " Never leave the house ! " As a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my balcony in nice weather and read books . <p> leeholsen said , <p> i think lynn is missing the whole ere lifestyle , its not living on nothing and never having the money to leave your house ; its about finding things of value to you and discarding the things that are n't  of value to you so that you do more things that you value . <p> and i 'm right with you slackerjo , ive turned into a big(used) book reader since i started this and love it . i 'm replacing that with hundreds of doolars and hours i used to spend at sporting events and concerts that i have found i do n't  miss and enjoy it more in my 72 degree house as opposed to sweating , getting eaten by bugs and usually drinking more than i should . <p> For me its pretty easy . I 'd much prefer to stay at home with my baby than go to another soul-sucking job . And my list of things outside my kid-raising duties is long as well . But then I 've never been the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a couple ) billionaires who still work obsessively . I just ca n't get my mind around their mentality . <p> learning said , <p> Great post ! <p> First , Jacob accurately described my process of becoming more frugal . At first I looked for cheaper ways to get the same thing , then I started to realize that I do n't  need as much as I was raised to consider normal . This 2nd type of frugality brings more peace of mind . <p> I also went , and am still to some extent going , through the transition process of changing from a consumer mindset to a non-consumption-based happiness mindset . To put the issue simply and bluntly : I do n't  know what to do ( or , rather , I did n't  know what to do ) , besides go to the mall , the movies , walks in commercial districts , restaurants , vacations , etc . I find myself inadequately educated to be happy . I was raised to work and spend by parents who were themselves worker-spenders , and surrounded by more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer activities . But I do n't  know enough about enough things to do to actually have a fully happy life doing other more fulfilling things . Most of my formal education was dedicated to preparing me to be a hard-working employee . In the less important non-work time , one does less serious entertainment activities . One has to re-approach and re-discover ones leisure activities with all the seriousness of work , or rather , of something important and happiness-producing . <p> I also think that a reorientation of all social relationships is a key here , to be aligned with is it making me happier ? I was surprised to find , upon reevaluation , how many of my friends were really also partially professional contacts . <p> I 'm glad that Jacob mentioned the frustration and the feeling like you 're not living of the transition process , because that has re-inspired me to keep making an effort of learning and changing , so I do n't  just go to the mall by default . <p> This one is particularly interesting to me because the items he lists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saudi Arabia , with the exception of shopping , which is n't really easy in Jubail , the city where I live . <p> Loama said , <p> Over time as we 've replaced spending money with low cost/free hobbies , we have gotten greater personal satifaction and enjoyment out of life . We do n't  make decisions whether to spend money or not , as we love our hobbies so much we always would rather do them instead of going out and spending time and money on the typical things e.g. , dinners , movies . Weve replaced consumer activities with activities like sailing year round both racing and leisure on a wide variety of boats , hiking , painting , guitar , foreign language . Not only do we save money , but have a sense of personal growth . <p> crazyworld said , <p> I am conflicted on the issue to be honest . I have no interest in sports or steak or shopping or nice cars . So far so good . But , I have no huge passion that I have figured out to pursue outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that is good . I do enjoy my work , workplace &amp; the people who work here ( small company , creative field ) . Extra time would be good , but with a child , I cant really go gallivanting off to find my " passion " , nor would I want to right now . Though I would not show up if there was no paycheck , so it fails your test there . Still not sure what the point of my relative frugality is ( nowhere close to ERE , but as compared to the average professional couple ) . Reading &amp; travel would be good , but travel is expensive ( I read all about the cheap ways , it has n't  worked for me yet , not even with 100K+ on a miles card ) . <p> to life in Saudi Arabia. - They say spending on entertainment anywhere really only comes down to three categories : " buying <p> Prieten said , <p> Somewhere I heard the question , " Are you up to the challenge of leisure ? " Lots of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't  have to go to work again . These people identify with their work and the things that work makes possible . I once saw a documentary that said full employment will become harder and harder to maintain . Globalization and automation are chipping away at even formerly " safe " professions . But the wheels of capitalism only turn if people keep consuming at a high rate . These two trends are not compatible . I think those in ERE mode are enjoying their leisure while they can . Once the wheels fly off capitalism , however , I think some of the best laid ERE plans will fail . I think 2008 was a wake up call . Yes , the markets did come back nicely . How many times can we rely on that ? Yes , this sounds apocalyptic . How can we prepare ? I am learning to grow food <p> I think a significant part of the challenge is to find a meaning in life . Becoming financially free and retiring early is a great objective to have . Certainly it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones own passion , as crazyworld put it , takes time and will be different for each of us . The things you suggested will certainly help stucture your time and help fill in days ( much as a job would ) while you figure out your own deeper meaning to life . <p> Very nice post . Ah , the existential questions of our time . My perspective is buying things is not going to give you happiness . Having a rich cultural lifestyle is a better way to go , but our American society is geared toward consumerism and things to possess . My passion is music , travel , languages and the like . So your words definitely ring true to me . <p> I just found this blog for the first time and am looking forward to reading it more in depth . Your 5 year plan looks interesting and I will see if I can apply some of your principles to my retirement plans . I look forward to more articles in the future . <p> You are always going to have people on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence since they do n't  know what side to choose . I work be there are things I wanted and I thought only more money could provide . I got the 6 figure job and ended up with no time to do the little things I really enjoyed some people really love the 8-5 and find time afterwork and on the weekends to enjoy life . It was n't working for me so I chose to do something different and work for myself . Sure I am still working but at my pace and my hours . I never miss my sons activities , have more time and energy for my wife life is great . I can see why 6-12 months would be the curve . you have to get use to the new way of life just makes sense . <p> Jacob , I 've been reading your blog for well over a yearone huge thanks to you . Although I 'm not yet financially independent , I am currently on sabbatical ( as in , " taking time off from making / saving tons of money so I can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socialize a lot ( I guess you could call that a hobby ) , garden , travel a bit , read a ton , hike .

I 'd like to add my story and see what others think and if I am getting the mindset you wrote about . <p> I made a lot more money than I was used to over the past 3 years . I used some of it to pay off $60,000 of debt and save $35,000 . I just quit my soul killing job and now want to challenge myself to see how well I can live while saving 60% of my $3350 net pay which comes from my retirement pension ( this is how much I have after taxes , rent and school tuition for my child ) . This means I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medical ( I have excellent insurance for $25 a month through the VA/military ) and hobbies . <p> I live outside the U.S. , but the costs are comparable . I know people here who live on $900 a month and are able to save $300 a month . I took out my rent , taxes and school tuition to be able to compare apples to apples with these people . <p> Some ideas : <p> 1 . I am saving FIRST before any other expenses besides rent and tuition and it comes out automatically to an account that is difficult to access . 2 . I am turning off cable and wired internet and landline in favor of a $30 a month mobile internet receiver and a Netflix subscription that runs $8 a month . This move will save me $130 a month . 3 . I am using the envelope system in the extreme . When the envelope is empty , NO MORE SPENDING for that itembe it food , gas , entertainment etc <p> My goal is to save $25,000 a year even though my income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done because I have no debt and love to exercise , read , and do other no/low cost activities . <p> get bored , unless they can spend loads of money on entertainments .

@@42287855 @2287855/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> It is possible to pump up truck tires ( here RV tires ) with a bicycle pump . They both use schraeder/auto valves . In fact pumping the truck tires requires less strength than bicycle tires since the max PSI is generally lower ( about the same as mountain bike tires ) . Of course it requires more air and so more strokes . My pump requires about 10 pumps for each PSI . <p> Now that 's an excellent opportunity for a free workout . <p> I use a floor pump and stand right over the pump locking my arms . Then I just so half squats similar to Hindu squats but not quite as hard ) . - I lost count but my six tires required a couple of hundred squats . <p> Now , you could buy a 12V pump for 15 bucks or a 110V pump for 40 bucks , but then you would just end up with a superfluous pump that is weaker than you are and why deprive yourself of a free workout ? <p> So grab that floor pump and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) and top off those tires . You 'll save on gas as well as gym memberships . <p> Update : Seeing as I recently blew out the hose of the pump while inflating a car tire , I should warn you that compressed air is hot ( its physics , babe ! ) which is apparently enough to kill the rubber hose on an 6 year old Walmart pump . I 'll see if the hose can be replaced . If not , I 'm getting a bigger pump . <p> Second Update : A pair of scissors fixed the rubber hose . I just cut off the few torn inches at the end and reattached everything . Lesson learned : Always think before you go out and buy ! <p> This reminds me of Eric Brentes book BETTER OFF , where he makes the point that labor-saving devices deny us physical labor to our detriment . Have you read it , Jacob ? I found it insightful and entertaining . The ideas presented therein align with frugality and sustainability . Think " hand-powered clothes washer. " 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Louis now . <p> Chris L. said , <p> My cigarette lighter pump died just recently so I picked up a foot pump after reading this post . I did 30 psi from 10 psi in about 10 minutes . You know you can do abs and triceps with a foot pump too right ? I tried chest , but I guess I 'm too far out of shape to compress it at 20 psi . Perhaps if I started that way I could . My old compressor took about 15 minutes and of course you have to run the car to keep the battery charged and powerful enough to work right . As long as this pump at $20 outlasts the other one , I 'm all good . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Scott I havent read it ( will put a request in at the library now ) , but that 's the point I 'm trying to make with bicycles , lawn mowers , laundry , and hand mixers and also electric can openers and electric fly swatters = <p> @Chris L. Nice ! The force needed also depends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to switch from pushing with my arms to just bracing my arms/upper body and sinking my weight onto it ( using legs ) around 70 Psi . But yes , a human can put out around 150 Watts which is higher than what small electric pumps can do . <p> @Kevin M Actually the main library had it so I did n't  even have to use interlib , but thanks for the offer . <p> Chris L. said , <p> You were right about 10 pumps/psi give or take . It seemed to go up faster as I got air into the tire , but that could just be me . I had my wife try and she did well at 9-1/2 months pregnant with her foot ! Shes not the average pregnant woman though . I think she just gained a baby and nothing else . Looking forward to future posts and thinking hard about putting together a backyard chicken coop . I 've already got a garden in . Things Ive wanted to do for some time . Next thing I want to learn to do is start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been waiting far too long to do these things . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> @Chris L. I do n't  know if you will see this post but I just read a book called the Last American Man which has alot of this kind of stuff in it . YOu might enjoy it . <p> Its pretty impressive what the human body can do when called upon ! While I 'm not sure this would be my favorite way to blow up my tires , I 'd certainly be willing to give it a try . = <p> Chris L. said , <p> Hey , this is an old post ! Incidentally I had to junk my walmart pump I used it for a few months and had some 3 leaky tires which I would routinely pump vs. replace . I do live in the North and that might have something to do with it . The plastic pieces cracked and broke so I just brought it back with the receipt so I suppose that made it a no cost rental . I ended up paying $15 a tire to have them cleaned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pumping and for the cost of much less than one tire . <p> The issue is with getting products that can withstand regular wear and tear and the junk at walmart just cant . Incidentally my old battery powered pump was a gift , but this ties back into the real cost of shoddy materials that need to be perpetually replaced . No reason one should go through 2 pumps in under 5 years . <p> I 'm doing something similar but replace RV with mobile chicken coop and tire pump with cinder blocks that surround the coop . I 've recently had to buff up my security in my mobile chicken coops to keep the coyotes away ( I pasture feed my chickens ) . The edges are encased in cinder blocks . Daily I get to pull the blocks away from the coop , move the coop and put the blocks back . Its my weight baring exercise for the day . My husband says I 'm crazy and if it was up to him he would have butchered the chickens a few weeks early ! <p> Theevildrsin said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ) . One of the tires on his BMW sedan was so low , he could n't drive it . He was at a loss so I pulled my mini bike pump from my Jeep , , rolled up the sleeves on my dress shirt and tucked in my tie and proceeded to pump up the tire . It was tough work for such a small pump but I got it inflated enough for him to get to a service station . I enjoyed his surprised look that I was able to inflate the tire . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Theevildrsin Ah , a master of the universe . It reminds me of all the " broken bikes " I pick up , where the " broken " part is a flat tire .

@@42287863 @2287863/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I posit that most people can attain financial independence in less than 10 years and in less than 5 if they are truly determined . I also submit that many people not are willing to make the necessary changes . <p> Read part I hereNote : This was one of the first blog posts I wrote when I started this site back in 2007 . It is also one of the most popular . I describes what I did in the period from 2001 " 2006 . Maybe some day I 'll write a summary of the period 2007 " 2011 , but for now you 'll have to dig into the blog to see what has changed and what has remained the same . When I set out on this journey in 2001 , I did n't have anyone to follow or look to for ideas . Blogs did n't really exist and I did n't have access to a good library , so I had to figure out most things myself . In retrospect and with more guidance I would have done it differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I still do all the things described here . In particular , do n't think you have to follow the exact details of what I did to reach a similar goal . In fact , you can follow the journals to see how it 's done better than I did . With that in mind , here 's my story <p> One thing I noticed early on was that small expenditures could quickly add up . $100 there , $50 there , $5 every day for a month , In the months were I bought very little my savings seemed to go up very fast . If I spent more my savings would go up less . It is n't rocket science that sweating the small stuff IS important . Therefore I canceled my radio subscription and eventually my gym membership . Of course it goes without saying that I did not have a TV . I did have a cheap internet connection though . I stopped shopping for clothes outside of thrift stores . I also changed my diet into what was basically two different types of meals for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply in 30 minutes : Lentil soup and tuna salad(*) . For breakfast I had oatmeal with water , seeds and raisins , and for lunch I ate a couple of bananas . Maybe once a week , I would buy more interesting things ( spices are my friends ) . Of course when I went home to visit , eating different food was quite a joy , but it is not that difficult to eat the same kind of healthy food day after day . It only takes a little getting used to . A large part of the world eats nothing but rice and while it is hard in the beginning one quickly gets used to thinking of food as fuel for the body rather than snacking entertainment . <p> ( * ) You do n't  need to eat this boring . This strategy was mainly due to me being in grad school and not wanting to spend very much time cooking . Many grad students rely on ramen and pizza because of the time pressure . In comparison , my diet was better than average . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My savings rate of my after tax wage income was pushing 80% that year . However , that was so boring that I vowed not to skimp on things that somehow improves me i.e. makes me smarter or in better shape . I think that is a good rule to go by even though it pushed the rate down to 70% . I think one can get too extreme . Today I allow myself more " frivolous " expenditures thanks to my substantial passive income . We even have cable now . Still my savings rate on my after tax wage income is around 40% which my passive income bumps up to almost 80% . The main reason for that is that since I think a lot about my purchases , I simply do n't  need to spend a lot of money to be comfortable . <p> Financial independence is only one form of independence . I was interested in other forms of independence as well . After all , what do you do if people wont take your money or your money becomes worthless or you lose it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating , solar ovens , and growing my own vegetables ( not a success ) . I also tried to make things last longer . I mended socks , repaired electronics , etc . Most of the times I found that I could do without something or jerry rig a simpler solution without heading down to the store . It may seem like trivial example but rather than buying an energy saving gadget , I simply got used to switching things off manually when I did n't  use them . Simple to understand but the difference in attitude is huge and results follow when this attitude is taken to other levels as well . For instance , how would I deal with 90F heat ? I could buy a AC unit , buy a fan , or I could simply learn how to sweat . Sweating may sound uncomfortable , but after a while the body adapts and the heat is no longer an issue . It is only when you live in an air conditioned society that you never get a chance to adapt always being subjected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt the preconception that it is impossible to live without AC . Well , people managed to live without AC less than a hundred years ago . The same goes for heating . Even though the heating was included in the rent where I lived , I experimented one winter with whether I could do without heating in a temperate climate . This meant long underwear and sleeping in a thick bathrobe under a sheet , a fleece blanket and a sleeping bag , but I managed just fine . Today I am comfortable in a t-shirt down to 65F relying on a larger than average metabolism from a vigorous exercise plan . This in turn means that I can eat well and maintain a single digit body fat percentage . It all fits together . <p> I began simplifying my lifestyle trying to rely more on skills and adaption to the environment rather than on tools ( think money ) . I have researched this with a fairly open mind . I have looked into car-living or boat-living , places where every cubic inch of space counts to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus minimize my need for space . I know a thing or two about homesteading from researching in how to be creative in making solutions from scratch . I know how to make soap from scratch ( though its easier to buy ) and what common household items to substitute for shampoo or toothpaste . I even know how to make baking soda ! I can cook with almost no heat and very few utensils . There is of course a lot of " actionable " details to this story , but in trying to convey the idea to other people the biggest obstacle has generally been the frame of mind rather than things to do . We have become so used to heading down to the store and thinking that we need everything we can buy there ! It is a lot easier to learn techniques than it is to change ones entire belief system of how the world hangs together . The end result of all this was to make everything I truly needed to live well fit into a couple of large suitcases and reduce my expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining a comfortable lifestyle . In terms of quality I live somewhat above the ordinary consumer class standard of living since I own more luxury items but in terms of quantity my life style is quite a bit below . <p> When I finally got my PhD , I had no student debt . Furthermore I had saved enough of my grant/paychecks to actually make up half of my current net worth ! After finishing my PhD , I became an academic researcher and was now making about as much as a state trooper or a long haul trucker . As I have hinted in earlier posts , I did not become financially independent by having a six figure income . Far from it . Rather it was through creative ways of increasing my savings by being increasingly more independent of the general economy . Quite an adventure . <p> I think it has been argued before whether a college education is really worth it . My answer is that it depends . A college education is certainly not a magic bullet to financial success . Monetarily , a college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since going without a college education means earning money sooner and not accruing any student debts . What is important is money handling skills , not income . On the other hand , although I could have had a much higher income by NOT getting a PhD ( entering grad school is almost financial suicide ) and choosing engineering or accounting rather than science ( that 's a specific as I am going to get ) , I did not think of expected income or even employability when I picked my major . However , unlike the higher income educations , my particular major has allowed to visit more than 10 countries for conferences and workshops without paying a dime out of my own pocket , publish many articles and part of a book as well advise on million dollar projects and thus have some influence in the scientific world . Having a " blue collar " job would probably not have been as intellectually satisfying to me , but that 's just me . For those who have their heads and hands screwed on right , spending up to 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arcane details that are interesting to maybe only 5 or 10 people in the world probably sounds crazy as well whereas building a beautiful house is a great accomplishment . <p> Financial independence means that all living expenses are covered by capital income from interest , dividends , There is no need to work for a paycheck anymore . <p> jane said , <p> Just wanted to let you know I love your slant on money &amp; all that means .

Of course you can " achieve " financial independence by lowering your standard of living to near ascetic levels and then saying your are financially free to maintain that without working . <p> Financial Independence is supposed to be about being able to maintain the standard of living you have . For just about everyone that includes eating out , cable , transportation , and you know , heat . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I 'm working on part III . I hope to have it out soon . <p> @ Brian . In my view financial independence is about having more choices not about having enough money to spend without concern . I realize that these are two different goals which can only be unified for the few who have a very high income . Those with normal incomes have to choose whether they want to spend most of their life on a job to enjoy the comforts of spending a lot of money or whether they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for most of their life . There is no free lunch here . <p> You 're right , I have to live with eating out only on special occasions , sharing a small car with my wife , and keeping the thermostat down . Is that hard ? For some it may be , it is not hard for me . On the other hand , we do n't  ever worry about having enough money to pay the bills or whether we have enough saved for retirement , or whether we can quit our jobs and go back to college , or even whether we will still have a job tomorrow . Is worrying about social security , job security , and paying bills hard ? Maybe not for some , but it would be for me . This is why I made the choice that I did . <p> I 'd love to know more about the passive income , not sure if you 're comf. revealing details , such as what the sources of income are , at least in a general sense ( or maybe that 's elsewhere on your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s said , <p> i was hoping you can give more details on how you get to FI ( not the LBYM side , but the investment side , if any ) . If you have a portfolio , what asset allocation did you follow , index funds or actively managed , etc . <p> I 'm so inspired I can not stand it ( I know this is old Im having so much fun reading this blog that I just discovered ) . I love how you challenge readers to think about other ways to live . We live the way we do because we 've gotten used to it . I love hearing about " alternative " ways of living which used to be standard until the last 50 years . @Brian people have different ideas of FI . All the financial bloggers I read seem to be very successful at what they 're doing . For the record I do without 3 of the 4 items you mention . I use heat as I live in Colorado and it gets chilly in Dec . Jan . Feb although thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heat threshold . I 'm going to lower the thermostat tonight and see how it goes for awhile . <p> Jacob In retrospect , do you wish you did n't  go to grad school , so you could retire even earlier ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Financial Samuria In retrospect I would have learned a trade allowing me to set up my own business doing something with a wide demand . Then maybe I would have gone to college later , much later . <p> I think it is easier to educate yourself than to train yourself . Of course , you could argue that thanks to my education , I am in a decent position to set up shop as a quant . I am not convinced that small investors necessarily derive a benefit from exploiting inefficiencies from mathematical complexities . Small investors should probably stick to FSA . <p> Of course these questions always have to be asked in the sense of " if you would have known what you know now " .

@@42287870 @2287870/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Here is a chance to take advantage of some economic inefficiency : Recycle your envelopes . DW and I used to sell used books and recycling the padded envelopes which I got from buying other used books is really a no-brainer when padded envelopes easily cost north of $0.75 . Some used book sellers would even take the chance on the purchasers good faith and include a stamped return envelope to send the padded envelope back . In this system the same envelope could take three trips or more ! Another advantage is that it cuts down on the garbage as well . If people paid directly for the volume of the garbage they had to dispose of like they do in Switzerland , I believe we would observe some change in attitude towards recycling . Getting rid of things without throwing them away . What a concept ! <p> I must admit that my envelope recycling bin started earlier and included regular envelopes as well . I had a very small stash of pristine envelopes for business matters , mailing resumes , and things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelopes . You know the envelopes that sometimes come with subscription offers or credit card offers or mutual fund statements and do n't  have a return address nor one of those prepaid postage marks ? Score ! These are useful for things like birthday cards , christmas cards , and letters to strange people . Finally there 's the category of nicely opened but clearly non-pristine envelopes . We got to remember that the point of the envelope is to protect the contents of the envelope , not to convey a message . Still many people are as concerned with form as they are with function . Do n't  send class three envelopes to them . However , they are ideal for people who are environmentally conscious or know you well . Simply use tape to close them and cover the old address with some white paper and more tape or a white sticker .

@@42287875 @2287875/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Americans have a strange fascination with lawns . Even in the rolling hills of California , where grass is normally brown , people maintain luscious green lawns . The squarish plots of green in the middle of all the brown are some of the first suggestions of signs of intelligence ( or lack thereof ) when seen from space . An American lawn is often bought in a carpet like state . Rather than fencing in the area and seeding and watering it , the lawn is rolled out and cut to shape . <p> Despite lawns being fairly useless unless you have a ruminant or two ( note to self:get a goattear up the lawn ) much energy has been invested in the art of maintaining them . <p> It used to be that lawn mowing was a relatively simple task . There would be a handle to push and a set of wheels that turned a blade and cut the grass much like a scissor . However , this has evolved into a self-propelled engine driven mayhem of spinning rotors of doom and size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small tractors to cut their small lawns which are no bigger than the size of their bath rooms . This takes about 45 seconds . Like Dave Barry , I am not making this up . Of course this does not take into account the 20 minutes needed to go and get gas for the lawn mower , the weeks or months one has to work to save up to buy one , and the hassle of fixing it when it breaks . <p> What I suggest is to get a push lawn mower . You may have tried one in the past and have been turned off by the fact that it is hard to push because the blade does n't  turn . This is mostly because the blade is not adjusted . It is easy to get a cheap used push mower , because many people , who at some point desired the " simpler life " they read about in a glossy magazine , got a push mover and now do n't  know why it stopped working . Of course , if you 're nice , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver ) , or you can just take buy it for $25 like we did ( usually they sell for $100+ new ) . If you are patient , you might even get a free one just for taking it off of someones hands because they need more space in their garage . <p> To adjust it , note that there are two big screws on each side ( so four screw total ) of the inside of the wheels which adjusts the blade angle and separation . You cant miss them . Instructions and a picture can be found here . I would like to add that you generally do n't  need to turn the screws much ! Start out with 1/4 turns or less . Remember to be symmetric , so if you turn the left front screw 1/4 of a turn , turn the right front screw 1/4 as well . If you turn the front screws clockwise and turn the rear screws counterclockwise or vice-a-versa , you change the angle . If you turn all four screws in the same direction , you change the separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want the blade to spin freely and be one iota from contacting so that when you push it fast and stop the blade should keep spinning for a second or two while still being able to cut . I had mine adjusted in less than 5 minutes . <p> An additional advantage is that a push mower actually cuts the lawn , so as far as I understand there is not need to remove the fine cuttings . I have been cutting it for a couple of months now and the cut grass simple sinks down and " disappears " . Rather than cutting , a motorized lawn mower with a spinning rotor slays the grass and leaves chunks of it lying around . This should be raked off or collected . So using a push mower saves time as well . <p> One problem is that the push mower does not do edges very well but neither do motorized mowers . I say , just get used to your edges being a bit ragged . If you are OCD about your lawn , get out on your knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you have to , right = . However , if you lawn does n't  connect directly to the porch or stones , you can also used a shovel to cut the edge . <p> Of course , the frugal alternative is to get rid of your lawn altogether and either match your backyard to the local climate / types of vegetation or plant some edible vegetables . Lawns are mostly useless , but at least if you have to , mowing them can be inexpensive and fun . <h> 32 users responded in " Get a push lawn mower " <p> We do n't  obsess over our grass . It gets mowed when it gets mowed and we do n't  really worry about it until it comes time to sell our house . Then , we might water it a bit and/or edge it .

What a joke . <p> I personally do n't  have a lawn and if I did it would consist of mostly flowers and garden vegetables . I 'd be willing to try a push mower on whatever square of grass was left to cut . Sounds easy enough to maintain , no additional fuel cost , and the upfront cost is much lower . Sounds like a win-win-win to me . <p> We had one at our old place , where for the first time we had a lawn to mow , and esp . since it was a rental , we knew the money spent on a power mower would be too much for the short amount of time we 'd prob . need the mower . Plus the environmental component , the lack of noise , the easier storage ( smaller ) , easy maintenance and use , etc. all made it a good decision for us . <p> Granted , we did not have a massive lawn , but it was definitely a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't loud , all the neighborhood kids loved to follow my husband while he mowed and beg to push the mower and generally drove him crazy ( in a cute , kid way ) , but I think he wished for a loud mower at times so he could have some peace from the posse of kids that swarmed around him every time he mowed the lawn ! <p> Anyway great post , I think both the push mower and the suggestion of no grass lawn at all are great ideas , some that simply may not occur to some people but that once those possibilities are considered may end up being great environmentally friendly and frugal choices that work for many . <p> For what its worth , goats do n't  really eat much grass = They would however , love to trim back all your bushes and trees especially roses !

Works like a champ ! <p> I think a lawn is very wasteful of water and other resources , especially in california where it is essentially a desert . We ripped out our front lawn and replaced it native garden . It needs almost no water and very little maintenance . Plus it looks a lot better ( IMO ) and is better for wildlife ( insects , birds ) <p> At the time Santa Clara county was offering a rebate of up to $1000 to replace your lawn with a low water garden . We took advantage of this and supplied the labor ourselves making it very inexpensive to convert . If this is something you 're interested in , I 'd check with your county to see what kind of rebates you can get . <p> Next up is the backyard 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Photoguy One of my favorite pet peeves are the broken sprinklers which flood the sidewalks every night .

I was reading an article just tonight in " Fine Homebuilding " magazine about some contractors who were tearing out their own recent work to make changes in the home for the rich clients . They had changed the landscaping three times already . <p> CB said , <p> There are various grasses , such as the native California bunch grass that work very well in gardens .

It works fast . <p> Few neighbors hire " mow-blow-and-goers " so there are not that many hours of high decibel scattering of spores and spewing of gasoline fumes . Most neighbors use a rake or ignore their little patches of yard . With a little knowledge and interest , they could feed themselves royally from it .

We have several neighbors that never set foot on their lawns except to walk to the mailbox , yet they pay a fortune to keep it maintained . <p> I was sweeping our grass from the street back on to our lawn the other day and my neighbor offered to let me use his blower . I said my broom was working just fine thanks . America is so lazy . <p> I got ta say if you live in California , stop wasting water on your lawn ! Just let it turn brown , save money on watering it , and save time and money by not having to mow it any longer . Who cares what your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , <p> I 'd like to pitch in with everyone who suggests tearing the lawn out and putting in a vegetable or herb garden . There are very few investments that get you returns over 500% . A good vegetable garden is one of them . <p> @roscoe while I commend anyone who makes makes their own vegetable garden , I would hesitate to call it an investment . It may turn out that it actually reduces the resale value of your home . <p> Roscoe said , <p> I do n't  know if were defining investments the same way . I would n't be surprised , since Im new to the whole discussion . I 'm defining an investment as something you expect to return more than you put in , which a vegetable garden certainly does . Fifty dollars in pots , soil , seeds , and such can net you five times that ( and Ive seen garden blogs with numbers attached reporting returns as high as 800% ) in vegetables you do n't  have to buy at the storeand more , if you turn your tomatoes into sauce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your own stock , the largest ongoing expense of the garden ( seeds ) is gone . <p> mjukr said , <p> We have begun the process of converting our lawn into usable garden space with the remainder mostly planted with native wildflowers/grasses . <p> We had a home before with a yard , but we just let our rabbits and chickens loose on it , and before we knew it , we had a dirt patch . It was great- it did n't  take any water or care to maintain , and then when we wanted to start a vegetable garden , the work was minimal . <p> @roscoe I simply meant that if people value their lawns as much as it seems , then converting a portion of your yard may make your home less desireable and reduce market value . So you may save $300 / year on food but if your house price drops by $2-3k then it has n't  paid off from a strictly monetary perspective . <p> Small gardens may be easy to convert back to lawn , but Ive seen many that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Also , unless you account for labor costs , I would tend to think of gardening as more of a hobby that happens to reduce expenses rather than an investment . <p> I agree with most of your points as I see too many people obsessing over their lawns . All of the money spent on gas , fertilizers , and pesticides not only costs a lot it also harms the environment . <p> I do however disagree about completely giving up your lawn , especially if you have kids . Having a lawn promotes them to be outside playing and running around instead of inside and it beats playing baseball in the street ! <p> I have been living in a condo with an association of 3 units for 10 years . We do not have a very large grassy area in the back , but it is enough to kick a ball around in with our 3 yr. old . In the beginning , my husband and I did all of the lawn work ourselves , even using a push lawnmower . After more than 5 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending our free time on it while the other owners benefitted from our labor . They whined that they could not do it because they were just too busy . Of course , my husband and I work more hours at our jobs than they do . It seems they have other priorities or are just lazy . So , now we pay someone $75 a month to mow the lawn and do other yard/tree work using the condo fee . It seems a waste , but since there is no cooperation , we have no choice and we all suffer more or less equally by having to pay for it . Its not that we disliked the work though and if we ever move out into our own separate home , we would have no problem using a push lawnmower again . We consider it a good form of exercise . <p> Eric said , <p> Lawns are stupid . Riding lawnmowers are even more stupid . If I had a lawn I would turn it into a garden . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Jeanie Have you tried working something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep doing it ? <p> Jane said , <p> Great post . I 'm Australian and here people are just as anal about their lawns as they are in America . Our urban plot is mostly veg but there is still some grass about that is kept long and weedy to feed the guinea pig . These little animals are great mowers of lawn . We do own a motorised lawn mower but could do without the noise and pollution . The hand mowers were very popular once here but have gone out of style . Time to bring them back , I say . <p> The bigger issue in maintaining a nice lawn is the water it needs to be kept green over summer . Total waste and money down the drain . Water here is expensive ( at least in Melbourne where we live ) and many people do n't  bother keeping their lawns green over summer . Brown is the new look . Sadly , near dead lawns create dust . <p> Now Jacob , petrol mowers are not good but what about those blower machines ?

My lawn is 0.3 acre , and requires mowing every 9 days or so during the Summer , but just once or twice in total over the 6-month period Oct . March . A family member gave me a free self-propelled walk-behind mower , and I bought a $140 cordless edger from Lowes . I 'm saving almost $60 per month after expenses and have turned my 45-minute lawn care chore into an exercise session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green and beautiful , but the main reason we have it is for our small children .

@@42287884 @2287884/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> There was a time , a simpler time , perhaps 10 years ago(*) , when people were able to make detailed advanced plans to meet their appointment to do a certain thing at a certain time . For instance , several people would schedule to meet at a certain time and place and they would all manage to do so . Or , say , a person could be given a list of groceries to pick up and the person would pick up the groceries . All this worked on a combination of small pieces of note paper and the ability to follow instructions . <p> ( * ) Fun fact : To put 10 years in perspective , it is estimated that out of the species alive at the end the of the 19th century , about 20% of them had gone extinct at the end of the 20th century . Hence 2% of the planetary bio-diversity is lost every decade . <p> Today , cell phones have replaced these skills . In fact cell phones are now considered a need and have even begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use cell phone tracking to keep track of their kids . Is that just me getting old or is there really something fundamentally wrong with that approach ? <p> Regardless , cell phones are not really needed . In fact phones are not really needed . For years I relied on email ( I did have access to a public phone in the hall in case of emergencies ) and now I have skype for talking . Data access is a need since I do use it for work , volunteering , writing the book , writing a blog , etc. but cell phones would merely be a nice to have feature . I would therefore suggest dropping it altogether or replacing it with a land line with free local calls , etc . Alternatively , if you must , get a cell phone with a prepaid plan and wait to use it until you break your leg ; surely telling someone that you just saw a cute bunny rabbit on the street could wait until , say , next year or if you are more merciful : let people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get back to that whole " setting up appointments to meet " -deal . <p> Is your cell phone worth it ? This is easy to answer . Multiply your monthly bill with 300 . Then divide this with your monthly savings rate . This is the number of months , that your cell phone is keeping you from retiring e.g. If your bill is $50 and your monthly savings is $500 , then your cell phone is delaying your retirement by 50+300/500=30 months or almost three years . <p> For the geeks , the 300 comes from the principal 4% annual withdrawal rate , hence 12/0.04=300 . <p> My apologies for wasting the time of those without cell phones , both of you . I mean it . <p> Jacob comments : In light of the comments below ( and some private emails ) , there is a safety concern when it comes to being out of communication range so to speak . The way to get around this is to make detailed plans , tell someone where you are going and when you will arrive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team " if you 're not heard from with X hours . In addition , never get " stuck " anywhere where you depend on reaching your destination in a certain time " or else " . This would include heading out in the cold in clothes that is not warm enough or heading out in the heat without water , and so on . I think cell phones creates a certain risk management hazard in that they encourage the lack of contingency planning and common sense as well ( see for instance this post on winter clothing ) e.g. an " I got my cell phone if anything goes wrong , I 'll just call " -mentality . There are basically two schools of risk management . The first school says that risks can be managed if one adheres to strict procedures . The second says that risks can not be managed because there is always some unknown unknowns that were not accounted for and that the best risk management is not to take chances and remain flexible . I belong to the latter school ( Wall Street belongs or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded in " Day 4 : Drop the cell phone plan " <p> @Netnuts We are probably more in agreement than you think . I may just spend as much on sports as you do on restaurants . The important thing is not to have regrets . One potential regret is putting off full time hobbies/interests until one is 60 . This is the one thing I do n't  understand about traditional retirement . People have these plans for what they want to do with their million dollas in their 401k , but what if they do n't  make it to 65 . <p> Roark said , <p> There is no reason to have a cell phone contract / plan for emergencies , at least in Canada . I inserted an inactivated SIM card into my unlocked phone and my phone displays " for emergency calls only .

E.g. here in Germany my phone is a cell phone , with a contract that has a base price of G0 per month , and G0.01 to G0.03 per minute . The contract includes a local area phone number , so people could call me , as if I have a land line , as long as I 'm within two miles range from home . <p> I really do n't  need a cell phone plan . I normaly pay less than G1 per month , and all flat rate plans start at the magical G10 here . Also a land line would have a basic cost of G29 here , without any minutes called . <p> I use this former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my DSL line , and have symetric upload and download rates . Sharing a land line between phone and DSL makes the DSL asymetric , so the phone will eat upload rate . <p> I use the former TV line for internet cable modem . Its funny here , that the best DSL line offered by phone company has 16mbit downstream , and is bundled with phone and TV to an extreme price , while cable company here sells 52mbit internet without bundling TV or phone much cheaper . <p> So well I have a dumb cell phone and even two independend internet lines . But I need those for work . I also have two linux root servers in two different countries for same reason . <p> A 2nd independend internet line adds G19 per month . But internet lines have only an uptime of 99% in average , so they are down 3 days a year in average .

Even so , if they made a more cost-effective plan I 'd jump for it , as I only use about 50-100min/month . Although the leftovers accumulate/rollover , so I 'm set for life . <p> On a side note : I still think modern cellphone , and even smartphone technology , still can not hold a wick to an aware human mind .

Not surprising given that there are literally thousands of stations available fromn around the world , all free . The only cost is the price of the radio itself ( assuming you already have an internet connection ) . I do like being able to listen to stations from multiple countries . <p> Routine use is simple . On mine just press on button plus a station preset button to listen to that station . <p> I am surprised that these radios are not more popular . When I mention mine most people have never seen one . <p> Main downsides are that unlike an ordinary radio it does not come on instantly ( it has to boot up since its basically a computer ) and if something goes wrong it could be the radio , your network , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complexity . For me usually rebooting the radio fixes any problem . Also there is some one-time initial setup that you have to do to choose station presets and set up the connection to your network but its not that onerous . <p> Other negative might be if you live in a very large city ( I do n't  ) where you already have a huge selection of stations available .

@@42287897 @2287897/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> What I 'm about to tell you goes against my usual advice . Despite my admonishments about finding hobbies that are free and do not require room for storage , I have taken up watch repair as a hobby . <p> Watch repair has significant upfront costs for the tools . So far I have paid around $300 . Fortunately , the tools show very little depreciation , and I get the impression from some eBay sellers that some of them use precision tools , rather than gold , as an inflation hedge . Also , there are very few running costs with the hobby , mainly cleaning supplies and oil . The storage problem is there but it is not bad . My tools fit in a little wooden box , about 3 ? x3 ? x12 ? or so . <p> Thus far , from teaching myself via books ( I suggest getting Watch Repairing As a Hobby by Fletcher ) and an correspondence course from the Chicago School of Watchrepair from the 1950s , I have managed to take a 17 jewel movement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it back together and make it run again . <p> A 17J mechanical watch is not so complicated . It is essentially composed for a barrel with a spring inside that provides the power , a gear train to ensure that the hands are rotating at the right speed relative to each other , a balance spring , which holds a constant frequency ( the timekeeping part ) and an escapement that connects the gear train to the spring . Essentially the gear train provides energy to the spring to keep it going , much like pushing a pendulum a little bit each time it goes past , and in return , the spring operates a lever that releases the power of the spring at a slow and constant rate rather than all at once . <p> This invention is more than four centuries old and like the deep plate , it is a climax technology having reached perfection many years ago . This means that watch technology is essentially unchanging . <p> A watch is a remarkable example of precision technology . A good mechanical watch keeps time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision tolerance of 1/86400 . You do not find this in many places . <p> These days many people use quartz watches or cell phones to keep time . If you want to know the exact time or only care about your time keeper insofar as knowing the time , this is a much cheaper option . Today , these pieces have almost supplanted mechanical watches . <p> Mechanical watches , however , are pieces of art , or more accurately , they are technological art . While paintings and sculptures bore me , I can stare at a running steam engine for hours , and the same goes for a watch , so bear with me . Me putting a mechanical watch on my wrist or tabletop is the same as you putting a picture on your wall . Conversely , you putting a quartz watch on your wrist or a cell phone on your wrist is the same as me keeping my walls bare . Hence , today mechanical watches are somewhat of a luxury item on par with artat least that 's how I see it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasional battery change . Despite being battery free , mechanical watches also require service . To keep time , mechanical watches can not have any friction causing dirt in them . Since oil dries out , they must be serviced every couple or years , much like an engine needs an oil change . Hence , watchmakers are needed in the same way that mechanics are . To keep with the analogyyou are unlikely to find many 20+ year old quartz watches in operation , just like you wo n't see many computers or cellphones still running after that time . Mechanical watches last a lifetime or more and so can easily be considered heirlooms . My 30mm Omega Seamaster is from 1961 . <p> Anyway , it is an interesting hobby that could potentially be turned into a small business and a source of profit . It could even be pursued as a career . The typical education takes 2 years and starting salaries are 40kish . I have thought about that , but for now I will leave it at the hobby stage and keep practicing . My first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidentally , if you ( or anyone you know ) have any old mechanical windup or old self-winding watches that run poorly or no longer run at all and just lying around in a drawer , I 'd love to have them for study to practice on and possibly fix them up . Write me an email at jacob at early com for more details if you are interested in sending me with some " study materials " ( if outside the US , make sure to declare it as a gift ) . <p> Winding clocks are more sustainable than those that need electricity and electronic parts . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Jan I suspect that in this day and age there may actually be more or rather easier money in repairing big clocks since wrist watches are now a luxury item , whereas many still have a mantel piece or grandfather clock . In other words , people with Rolexes will want to see credentials , whereas people with a $100 clock might be satisfied with simply getting it repaired at low cost . <p> Keith said , <p> Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

@@42287903 @2287903/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> If you want to become financially independent in 10 years , Todd over at the financialmentor.com makes a cogent case for how the math works . The extreme savings method is robust unlike other methods such as real estate or businesses which require a good deal of luckhas a high rate of failure due to causes beyond your immediate control . This means extreme savings will work in 100% of the cases whereas real estate or business start ups will only work for a few , maybe 5-10% . Still , not everybody succeeds with such a savings program and the post gives some reasons why . Having succeeded myself and seen others fail , I somewhat agree/disagree but I also have some understanding why an extreme savings approach can fail . Hint : Its not the theory , its you = <p> " It takes the self-discipline(*) of a celibate monk living in a brothel to survive on 20-30% of what most people earn in our current culture . " , said Todd . I would say it takes an extreme level of independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is perhaps why extreme early retirement attracts so many INTJs as this personality type exhibits those traits more than most other types . " Surviving " is easy ; its the " spending less than you earn " which is hard because it makes you different . To wit , consider two families . One earns $90000 and the other earns $27000 . The latter is surviving on 30% of the former just fine . No problem . However , it would take a self-discipline and an independent streak for the $90000 family to not spend in the same way as their friends and colleagues . On the other hand , if those friends and colleagues were spending less , it would be no problem at all . Its the " not fitting in " that 's hard . This is why the ERE forums have come to serve almost as a support group for what are typically highly competent people who " should " be spending 5 times more than they do , at least according to everybody else . Many of the questions actually deal with the grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it , not by the actual " surviving " . <p> ( * ) Self-discipline is not that important . I eat take-out food on occasion . I sometimes buy things *gasp* new . <p> In defense of extreme frugality : First , it certainly does depend on your values . Those values are not always to retire early . For me my initial motivation was environmental having realized how much waste our consumer culture generates . It took me a couple of years to realize that with the high savings rate I had , I would be FI in just a few more years . I used to enjoy buying gadgets , a lot . This , incidentally , was what I enjoyed most about my stuff . Doing " consumer research " comparing specs , buying the gadget , and playing around with it for a couple of months after which I lost interest . Then I was onto the next gadget . Had I kept this up , I would still be working 60 hours a week , but I would have owned the newest iPhone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a few months for my values to change but eventually I got as much joy out of not spending money as I did bringing home shrink wrapped boxes of new toys . <p> It is said that your need for money is inversely related to your level of skill . Money buys convenience but more importantly , it compensates for lack of skill . My favorite example is the malfunctioning toilet . Suppose your toilet fails to flush . Now , you could say that an extreme saver would n't have the money to fix it and would thus quickly find himself in deep shitdiscomfort . However , an extremely frugal person would likely learn ( quickly ) or have learned to fix the problem himself . The end result would then be the same : A working toilet . So both solutions are ultimately convenient . However , imagine that the toilet broke Saturday night ( do n't  ask ! ) and you could n't get a hold of plumber until Monday morning . Wouldnt it be more convenient if you could fix it yourself ? <p> It takes time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another quote by Illich which I paraphrase to something like " a man is educated in proportion to his ability to understand and affect his immediate environment " . In this regard most of us are barely out of the toddler stage . If we have a problem , many of us just call an authority . We usually pay others to " understand and affect " our environment because we just never learned ourselves . Were like idiot savants who only understand one thing , our job whatever it may be , but we understand that really well to the exclusion of everything else . <p> This can change . Fixing a toilet , knitting a sock , building a bicycle , installing a compressor to make a fridge , and similar projects are n't  rocket science . It can be learned by anyone who can read and follow instructions . Its just in this society that nobody does it . On top of this there is a tremendous sense of satisfaction in being able to say " I made that " or " I fixed that " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought that " . For me the latter always comes with a sense of shame . <p> To illustrate , I will think that your new sports car is nice and fun to ride in , but what really impresses me is a heavily self-modded truck that gets twice as many MPG running on bio-diesel or an electric scooter built out of conduit pipe , old frame parts , and discarded golf cart batteries . Standard cars mean nothing to me . Conversely , I understand that the LA dating scene is entirely predicated on the price tag of ones vehicle . <p> So I may only be spending $6-7,000/year but do consider the value I 'm adding using those monies for parts and optimized living and location compared to someone who is spending $60,000 blindly . We may just be getting the same value out of it . <p> Sometimes it is argued that the absence of money excludes certain things . This is correct , but they also include things which are otherwise out of reach due to the absence of time spent on the job . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be too expensive for me to take the family to France for a month every year . However , it would be entirely feasible for me to move to France ( yes , I got an EU passport ) and stay there for years because I do n't  need a job , the plane ticket would be amortized , and I would n't be supporting a house in the states . If I had kids I would n't be able to afford expensive private schools , but I would have 12 hours a day to help them with their homework . I do n't  have the budget to shop at Whole Paycheck , but I do have the time to garden . The same goes for sports . I can dedicate much more time to an activity which usually beats having a personal trainer and all the latest gear . There 's a strong limit to what money can buy which is easily surpassed with time and effort . <p> Conversely , using the examples above , someone who works for a living ca n't afford to go to France for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two houses ( unless they were saving 50% already ) and they might be underwater on the " biggest house they could afford " which would make for a hard sell . If they 're high earners they 're likely economically better off if they outsource the raising of their kids , because they need to work to pay for " fun-time " . And who has the energy for serious sports and gardening if one works 60 hours a week ? <p> Much more important than confidence and independence is the ability to envision the possibility of doing things differently . If you cant wrap your head around it , you cant set the goal , and without seeing the goal , you cant get there intentionally . Many cant imagine doing things for themselves instead of paying others . I believe this is the source of all the " I cant live on $10,000/year " . To illustrate , $1000 will buy you a good bicycle . However , $1000 will also buy you enough parts to make SIX bicycles which are equally good . Most cant imagine doing thatdont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( But many are willing to stretch their mind far enough to maybe get TWO used bicycles of the same quality . ) In the same vein a hundred bucks in carefully handled seeds will feed a family for months , organically too . A hundred bucks spent in a restaurant will feed a family for a day . <p> I see this as the greatest barrier for most people are this is to a large extent why I 'm putting my life on public display . Of course this is just meant as an inspiration . The point is not to copy what I do but to understand the principles and the philosophy . For instance , I 'm not going to move to France , but some probably will . And you do n't  have to live in an RV . That 's just what I do . <h> 44 users responded in " Why so few succeed " <p> Thanks , it was a refreshing read . The philosophy is yet to get completely imbibed in me , until then I need such articles . <p> Dienekes said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you decide to " spend less " without changing your values , you will never sustain it or will be miserable while doing it . This is so true . I could n't sustain brown bagging lunch at work despite numerous tries ; however , once I changed my values ( namely , the importance of not wasting left-overs and using the savings to further my financial goals ) , I actually enjoy doing it . <p> " It took a few months for my values to change but eventually I got as much joy out of not spending money as I did bringing home shrink wrapped boxes of new toys . " I have n't bought a new electronic gadget , new book , new game , or new clothes since Thanksgiving ( when I discovered the ERE book ) . I hardly notice . <p> I did n't  know you lived in a motorhome when I wrote that post . I just thought of obvious ways to save money while living affordably and that idea came up . Funny . <p> Also , I agree with you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the post as well but it was already too long . It ties into values . Green values should naturally lead to reduced consumption when actions are congruent with values . It is one of my primary motivators for reduced consumption . <p> Finally , I 'm an INTJ also . <p> No coincidences. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @rodpba My personal cash flow is complicated and comes from a variety of sources . However , my expenses could be met with a the cashflow going into my broker account ( which I can also write checks from ) the rest is just a bonus . Dividends from US companies are ( usually ) highly reliable and predictable paying out the same amount or a slight increase each quarter ( different quarters for different companies ) . Some of the funds pay monthly ( e.g. last friday of the month ) . All these amounts to several dozen inflows ( checks ? ) per yearabout one per week a random intervals , typically between $50 and $250 each time . I can tell you how much Im going to get for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also have a pretty good idea about next year and the year after , etc . <p> I want to add something to the idea in your first paragraph about business and real estate taking luck <p> Where we agree is the extreme frugality approach is mathematically certain . That is clearly one of the beauties of the strategy ( there are others ) . <p> However , I do n't  agree that real estate and/or business require luck . <p> My experience is they are all equally valid paths to financial independence , but they require different skill sets to succeed with . <p> The point at the end of my article is to build a wealth plan based on your unique attributes , resources , personality , disposition , and skills . <p> For some of my clients that answer is unequivocally business or real estate no luck involved . For others it is frugality and saving . <p> One mans medicine is another mans poison . <p> Anyways , I feel pretty strongly on that point so I just wanted to bring it up . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to live below your means , especially because you cant show off a large bank account or no debt like you can a shiny new car or cute shoes . = <p> My husband and I have been living on half of a six figure income for the past two years ( still a decent amount of money , I 'd like to get our expenses still lower , its a process ) and while at times it was hard , I am thankful we did it because my husband recently developed some health problems and our income currently looks like its zero for the time being . If we did n't  have the huge emergency fund we do , wed be in so much trouble right now . At least I feel like I can breathe a little bit and he can work on getting better . This means more to me than toys . <p> bigato said , <p> An article that express some views opposite to yours can be such a inspiration . Todds article is great and well written . About your article , I 'm suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ago my houses main pipe broke . It was so easier to learn how to fix it myself , instead of worrying about finding someone to do it , worrying if it would be well done , how much it would cost . <p> There was a comment that I was thinking if would fit better here or in Todds blog . I 'm putting it here because I think is more tuned to ERE . Todd make a very good point asking why someone want to retire . I agree that most do n't  really want to be retired in the full meaning of the word . Most just want to do other things with their time . But one thing that none of you two talked about , but I know most of the readers here feel , is that some people like me lost the hope in the system so deeply , that would n't want to work any other conventional job . Were just done with that . No other job could motivate us . Not even a lot of money could motivate us to keep working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for my family , and for society ( at least for the part of society that I feel that deserves it ) . But I wan na do it my way , the way I believe in . It couldnt be in any job . I 'd rather garden , build , cook , take care of our health , take care of our safety , teach what I can . In fact , I love nature and it all fits together . Country land and living is also cheaper . <p> rodpba , I 'm also from Brazil . I think I heard about another guy from here also reading here . We should know each other ! Maybe start a thread on forum ? <p> When I first started to read your posts , I thought you were a nut . Now , Ive taken what you 've said , and my life has changed . <p> I think I probably do some things even more extreme than you , but overall , you do much better . <p> Its become a game with me . Instead of driving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I now choose to play tennis near my house . And I 'm having more fun playing tennis . <p> Its a small change , but that alone with making my own food saves me thousands a year .

I have a problem even cooking from scratch , let alone to supplying the food I cook with . I like what you have to say here , but I also have to look at the time involved with learning and completing these tasks as well . It takes away from work . family , social life ? But as you said , its truly a dedication . <p> I think it is a matter of choices ! What choices we make to satisfy our wants and needs . Do n't  we all make a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we do as a career ? When I earned more money , I spent more ! I earn less and my expenses are reduced too .

I have lived in three countries : Denmark for 24 years , Switzerland for 4 years , and the US for 7 years . I think a lot of perspective can be gained from living in different countries . However , I do n't  put much value in tourism . I 'd say as a general rule if you have n't filed a tax return ( held a job ) in the country you 've visited , you have n't gained enough of a perspective and have only seen the country from the " outside " as a visitor = Being a visitor can be amusing but I mainly consider that to be a form of entertainment ; not so much a form of personal development or international understanding . <p> Its why most people fail , with the exception of odd , extremely focused individual like Jacob ( ERE ) who finds this all a breeze . <p> partgypsy said , <p> I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can save an additional 1% for retirement but this makes me feel I really am aiming too low . My husband and I used to live on around 15K a year for a number of years while I was in graduate school . Now we combined make over 70K while we are not saving anywhere near 50K a year . True we have a house and 2 kids ( and all the expenses associated with that ) but maybe we need to rethink it . My husband still does alot of things himself , fixing his bike , fixing things around the house , cooking food , our older daughter has a little garden , but Ive fallen out of those things , even cooking because I 'm at work all the time . And I miss that . There is real satisfaction doing something yourself , and having that self-reliance . <p> I found that to be very interesting . Especially that there are so many INTJs .

Explains why it appeals to me , but only partly . = <p> rattigno said , <p> Jacob , <p> Thanks for the very insightful post . I like a lot of your early retirement philosophy , and I have avidly read most of your posts . I am just not as extreme yet I have 3 young kids , and there are certain things I think its worth working for ( a good education , for example : I would n't want my kids to get 12 hours of me a day ! and relationships : that includes a vacation to Europe every year to visit my relatives ) . Otherwise , by worldly standards , we are probably reasonably frugal ( no TV , etc . ) . <p> I think I have found a good balance , overall . I save roughly $1 for every $1 I spend , and I already have a sizeable net worth at 35 ( about 10x my expenses ) . While the kids are in school , I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant , I have some flexibility I can take days off or shorter days , or I can put in more other times . With the money saved , I could always pull the trigger and mostly live off the savings , although I would have to cut my expenses in half ( which will happen anyway after the kids are grown up ) . On the other hand , I enjoy doing work and I do n't  see myself not working at all maybe its just social pressure , or the idea that I want my kids to also learn the value of work , or who knows what . But contributing to a project makes me feel good and it does n't  need to turn into workaholism . That is where I am not as extreme yet = <p> Also , on the point of not hiring repairmen , etc. : I am not much of a handyman ( I have done tiles and fixed other things , though ) and I do n't  enjoy certain chores ( for example , painting ) . Since my hourly rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes perfect sense to work 2 hours , so that I can pay the painter to do a 10-hr job , while I take a hike with the kids . Or am I missing something ? <p> Finally , I would be interested in hearing what you ( and others ) think its possible/reasonable to do with kids . <p> Thank you again , Jacob , for your very stimulating and fascinating insights ! <p> Karie said , <p> We live in one of the most expensive areas in Canada . I think I could personally live on far less than we are now and I certainly do n't  feel the need to keep up with the Jones but my kids sure do . Expectations are high and kids are always comparing with their friends . I view this as my ultimate obstacle . My husband is also happy to pay for things he does n't  want to do like recaulk a bathtub . Perhaps I should have done it ! Something about the way were living is just not sitting right with me . I loved the article and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking outside the box in the future ! <p> The costs associated with a job are far greater than just the dollars spent on clothes and travel and your article really outlined them perfectly .

I 've recently become able to make financial decisions for myself and my children without any other input and find myself gravitating toward a simpler life . ERE is full of great information . Thanks for the wonderful resource and the reminder that its okay not to follow the crowd when the crowd is so good at drowning out alternative ideas . <p> If people just woke up and saved everything they could for a period of time , they would be retired by 40 by just saving &amp; investing <p> and this is even without a business .. ! <p> bales33 said , <p> My father and mother raised me in a " weird " way .

@@42287909 @2287909/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> When financial independence is a priority , it is very helpful to develop an idea of how much money one needs to support a particular expense . Consider a daily $1 cup of coffee . That is $360 a year . With the canonical 4% withdrawal rate , one would need to save and invest $360/0.04 = $9000 to support the $1 cup of coffee/day lifestyle . <p> Aiming for the lower figure of $15000 is doable in a foreseeable number of years . After saving $15000 one NEVER needs to worry about food again . One is financially independent of the food expenses . <p> My suggestion is to tackle recurrent expenses in this way one by one . How much does it take to become financially independent of food , housing , clothing , transport , health costs , internet , movies , cable , <p> This results in a set of smaller goals to work towards . It will also create a certain discipline . More importantly , it will make one reevaluate whether the expense is really worth it .

I was wondering how you found the $900 on the $0.25/day coffee . For some reason , I am getting something like $2,250 , so I suspect that I may be doing something wrong . <p> I am going to try to figure out what expense I should start with on my expenses . It will be nice to say something like , " I am financially independent when it comes to food ; I am working on housing . " etc . <p> This argument is made quite a bit and yet is so flawed . Final savings numbers are really skewed when not taking inflation into account . Although in principal it is still a wise idea to save as much as possible , I 've analyzed in a more realistic way to come up with hopefully more accurate numbers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> How do you eat for $50 per month ? I think I can do it $5 per day ( $150 per month ) and I thought that was super cheap . <p> I did my own coffee calculation , and I pay $8 per pound for ( what I think is ) super high quality coffee . That comes out to 16 cents per cup . Sugar was 4 cents and creamer 5 cents , so the total is 25 cents . <p> @George : I would think it by buying everything in Bulk , making food that lasts more than 1 day , etc . <p> This post is excellent !

I can probably do that through Breakfast and Lunch , but then supper is generally twice that amount per person all by itself . <p> @Robyn : Generally if you want to retire and have a yearly income you can calculate a safe withdrawal rate around 4% ( some people use 3.5 or 3.75% to be safe ) .

@@42287911 @2287911/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> The most effective option to save money on clothing clearly is not to buy any , hence this is what I would recommend . <p> This strategy can work for several years because most people , myself included , simply have way too much clothing e.g. more than what we can wear at one time . If you have clothes you can not wear at all , get rid of it . Someone else can probably use it . <p> Now , your average piece of clothing should survive the laundry cycle about 100 times , maybe even 200 . If you have 10 shirts , that 's 1000 cycles . Even if you only wear them once before you wash them , that 's three years . This should be sufficient to get well on the way towards financial independence . Some people have even more years worth than that . Consider that many things can happen during this time . You might change your size ( usually always a bad idea ) or the clothes might go out of fashion . Having less clothes makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that sort of thing . It also means that you can get a new piece more often . This follows from Lanchesters square law , also applicable to tank warfare . <p> For the rest of us , I highly recommend sticking with " classical bland " , this means either gray or navy for the guys . For the girls like with most things , its more complicated . <p> But I guess that did not come as a surprise . Oh , I slay me ! = <p> To make clothing last longer , you should seriously consider doing laundry less often than that as it wears down the fiber . One way to wash less often is to change clothes appropriate to the task . <p> You should also learn how to mend holes . I think that pieces that are not directly visible , socks , underwear , anything that goes under the top layer basically should be mended , patches , etc. until it disintegrates . You can pursue the same strategy with towels and bedsheets . For instance , if you only use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you only use one ( old ) bed sheet , it lasts about 3 years before it rips . Quality may vary . Of course this is anecdotal . <p> Now , suppose after 2-3 years that you actually did run out of , say , pants . What do I do ? I would get underwear and socks new , but everything I would get used . Start with freecycle , then move up to thrift stores , and then move on to extreme sales events at outlet stores . Going beyond that constitutes failure , in my not so humble opinion = <p> In my experience , homemade clothing does not really save any money . <p> Now it may be that you work somewhere were you have to look expensively dressed because someone in corporate thinks it increases your productivity or inspires customer confidence . This often requires paying the part ( out of your own pocket , naturally ) . Again , look for sales , but do not feel too bad about this one : You wo n't need those clothes in retirement , therefore they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than making your savings rate smaller . They do not enter on the factor 300 numerator though . <h> 31 users responded in " Day 6 : Clothes " <p> I air dry my clothes , and that helps the color stay in them longer . That said , I just unloaded $60 on a new blue cotton jacket at Dillards . Probably I should have recond a thrift store before doing that , but I tend to forget about thrift stores . <p> Amy said , <p> Clothes are more expensive now . Not just because everything is more expensive because of gas prices but because clothing companies simply make crappier clothing . <p> I tend to buy the same brands of clothes ( usually the same exact items ) when I need new clothes . I have noticed that my older versions have held up so much better than the new ones to the point of it being ridiculous . <p> Example : underwear . My old ones I 've had for a couple years now . I bought some new ones -the same exact thing- a month ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkly , uneven , and scratchy , and the patterns on the material are rubbing off . ( Please , no jokes about my butt here ! =P ) <p> Because things are made so much more cheaply nowadays , it forces us to either buy the items more often or to buy higher quality . <p> I am a big proponent of buying high-quality . However , it seems like every couple years I have to move up a notch just to maintain my quality standards . = ( 10158 @qwx420158 <p> In Little House on the Prairie they took old bedsheets , ripped them down the middle , then sewed the outside edges together .

My sheet actually ripped right in the middle ( a foot lengthwise ) . I turned it into rags . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> More ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors . Another strategy is to have the exciting parts of your wardrobe be the cheaper parts or the parts that wear out quickly anyway . * Garage sales and church sales are cheaper than thrift stores . Consignment shops are cheaper than stores , tend to have more work-appropriate things , and may also even have sales sometimes . You can also throw clothing-exchange parties to swap clothes with others . And do n't  forget about hand-me-downs . ( I used to get hand-me-ups from my younger sister before our sizes got too different. ) * The new front-loading water-saving washers add less wear-and-tear than regular washers. * Line-drying definitely helps keep elastic from disintegrating , so even if the thought of air-drying your jeans and towels makes you cringe , try it for your socks and undies. * Many people swear by washing and drying clothes inside out to reduce wear and tear on the part that shows . ( I am too lazy for this one. ) * Along with learning to mend , its good to learn to re-attach buttons and maybe even hem things . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , there 's no point in mending it . * Other things affect the wear of clothing , too . For example , gaining weight increases wear on the inside thighs of my pants but reduces wear on the sit-bones of my friends pants . Resting on my elbows too much wears out my elbows . * Home-made clothing can save money if you have a cheap source of fabric ( such as yard-sale sheets ) . It can also save money if you are an odd size or have very particular tastes . Learning to alter clothing can save money if you are an odd shape . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> One problem I have is that its very hard to find certain things that fit . So I am always on the lookout for those things , and if I ever find extra , I get them . Once I had four pairs of khakis ( I kept finding more khakis when what I really wanted were more black pants ) , but now all but one have worn out , so I 'm glad I got them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same ones all the time , so do n't  be surprised . <p> I forgot to mention that sometimes you can turn pants into shorts or long-sleeved shirts into short-sleeved shirts . I 've also heard of people removing a collar and turning it upside-down to sew it back in . <p> Also , if you 're line drying outside , try to bring the clothes in as soon as they are dry so they do n't  fade . ( Do not leave them out for three-day stretches ! ) On a nice breezy day , all but thick-cotton things might even be dry by the time the next load is ready to hang . Beware that its against the law in some neighborhoods to have clotheslines . Sometimes you can hide them so they wo n't bother the neighbors . ( Or if you 're retired , maybe you can dry clothes while your neighbors are at work . ) But you can also get drying racks .

I keep it simple <p> Consider also line drying your clothes . A lot of wear comes from the dryer cycle . <p> Also , consider which clothes are " lightly dirty " and " actually dirty " and consider hand washing the lightly dirty ones .

And buy simple items that will last a long time and ( hopefully ) not go out of style like khakis in beige , brown , grey and shirts in solid colors or basic stripes . <p> I shop sales like crazy and have a nice outlet mall near my home that has Gap , Banana Republic , Tommy Hilfiger and several other decent stores . I have n't found a good thrift shop around , but I 'll keep looking .

I have 6 pairs of earings ( all silver ) and 2 watches . Jewlery decisions are reeealy simple . That 's it most days . I have a grey and navy pants also , but the same formula works for each ( I just have far few tops than for my basic black ) . I rarely wear patterned anything as those outfits are more memorable and I feel I cant wear them again as soon . This winter I 'll need to replace a 10yr old black sweater , but that 's all I 'm planning on .

" Tops cost less and you can have just a few which you swap with your friends a lot . 3 ) Ironing clothes wastes time , energy and ruins clothes much more than washing . Most clothes will dry perfectly if left to dry on the hanger rather than on the line . Using the drier is out of the question if you want to preserve your clothes . I do not even own an iron . If some piece needs a little straightening I use the blowdrier . Worked for me since I was a teenager . 4 ) Buy good underwear . Do not try to save money here bad idea . A good bra and adequate panties make the clothes that go on top of them look great . There is a difference between underwear and lingerie : underwear is for putting on , lingerie is for taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . There is no way a blouse will look good if there are little bows and lacing making tiny bumps under the fabric and ruining your figure . 5 ) When trying on new shoes , do n't  focus on the shoes , focus on your posture . Good posture makes all clothes look fantastic . Poor posture makes Chanel look like you fished it out of a dumpster. 6 ) Learn to sow .

@@42287921 @2287921/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> As mentioned in part 1 , I am reluctant to give specific investment advice on this blog . The reason is that unlike frugality and personal finance , which anyone can learn in a couple of months ( the difficult part is following through ) , investing properly takes at least a couple of years ( here too , the difficult part is following through ) . <p> I saved money for 4 years before I even began investing . I 'm throwing this out there , because an extreme early retirement strategy does not rely on compound returns simply because there are not very many years during which it can compound . If the market is with you , you may reach your goal in 4.5 years instead of 5.5 . <p> That said , I realize that " being in the market " can be exciting . I also realize that many probably would not want to spend much time dealing with investments , so in part II , I 'll describe a method that is useful for cash flow and is simple to implement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a no-fee method . All you pay are trading commissions and you can easily find a broker that offers this . You will only need to make 10-20 trades a year . I use this method myself for my IRA money . ( I have an IRA to reduce my taxable income . ) <p> To implement Dogs of the Dow , all you need to do is to rebalance into equal amounts of the 10 highest yielding Dow stocks each year . That is essentially , the first ten on this list . This collection of stocks currently pay 4.4% and so it provides adequate cash flow for your recurring expenses without the need to liquidate stock ( this is not the case for a broad index fund ) . <p> Each year , you check back . Sell any position that is no longer in the top ten . Buy any new position in the top ten . To minimize capital gains tax , hold gainers for slightly more than one year before you sell them and hold losers for slightly less than one year before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules for this , learn themif you know how to fill out schedule D , you already understand this . <p> Obviously , you do n't  want to sell off an entire position and then buy it again . This will trigger wash rules and other annoyances . Just sell or buy a little of each position that needs adjustment . <p> Only trade once a year . Add or withdraw cash the rest of the year . There are two ways of handling your cash position . The first one is dollar cost averaging . This makes you fully invested at all times and thus Wall Street likes this one and promotes it at every chance . <p> The other one is value averaging . With value averaging , assume , you have 100k in stocks and 20k in cash . Next year you decide you want 106k in stocks , setting a 6% growth rate . It is up to you to set the growth rate . I would set it at your withdrawal rate + inflation or around 6% . If you portfolio has dropped to 97k @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portfolio has risen to 109k , you need to take 109-106=3k out of it and put it towards your cash position . Next year , the stock part should be at 106*1.06 = 112k . And so on . This method will automatically sell stocks in years where stock performance market is strong and buy stocks in years where stock market performance is weak . <p> I think index investing with a 3-5 year cash buffer is the simplest strategy you can get away with . The Dogs of the Dow portfolio , which is almost as simple , allows for less of a cash buffer and should therefore have higher return rates ( not to mention its historically higher return rates , after all , you 're not buying overpriced stocks which you would when index investing ) . It should also fare better during a protracted market decline that lasts longer than your cash buffer . <p> Yet as I said , investing is very individual . Do whatever makes you sleep well at night . <p> Thanks for the thoughts . I 'm only in a Roth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our income should triple so I 'm trying to figure out what the best plan of attack should be . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> Value averaging . Never heard of it .

If you pick it too low , you might miss out on stock gains . Of course dollar cost averaging just sets it to infinity ( all in ) and so here one takes all the losses two .

There have to be more people out there with more years of experience and there is a dearth of real conversation on the topic on the internet . <p> Unfortunately , I am not a mathmatcian , which would give me a vocabulary to explain the issues I see with value averaging , but an English major . <p> Anyway , here goes . You seem to have hit on one issue with your reply , as you stated when your portfolio grows to a point where it is significantly larger than the amount of money you are adding per period then a one or two percent change in the total market seems to have an outsized effect on how much you would need to purchase , i.e. I have 1,000,000 and I am adding 15,000 per quarterly period plus or minus the change in the total value . If there is only a 1 percent decline , I must add the 15,000 plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than if I just had 100,000 and needed to add the 15,000 plus 1,000 more for a one percent decline . <p> Second proplem , which I think you also refer to , a situation like the current market where the rate of increase in the market is larger than the rate used to compute the value path . Essentially , I have not purchased since March 2009 because the value path indicates no need to purchase because of the rate of market growth , but logically , I really should be buying now because we are so early in a new market cycle . <p> In summation , value avergaing may not help me avoid buying too much in top of market if the market is growing below the chosen rate in the last years of a market cycle . Likewise , I may buy less in the begining of market cycle because the rate of market growth is higher than the rate I choose . <p> Even with these proplems , I am going to stick with it for at least one market cycle because I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is buying too much at the top of markets . <p> shwgeek said , <p> There was a study on the effectiveness of a derivative of the Dog of the Dow method by the Motley Fools a while back . I did n't  read it closely , but its worth considering for those of you who are planning on following the LONG ... <p> I tend to agree with Jacob that for really early retirees , the savings rate makes the biggest difference . Case in point : we started out around 15 years ago with $0 net worth , today were looking at semi-retiring in the early 40s . The *one* single factor that mattered was saving &gt;50% of our take home pay . <p> It took me a while ( roughly ten years ) before I found a strategy that I 'm comfortable with for generating my retirement income ( value-based dividend growth ) . Since bargains do n't  come around that often , it usually takes a long time to build up a portfolio . If I had known ( or decided earlier ) to go with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio than what I have now . <p> So I 'd say work backwards from what you plan on holding in retirement , and go from there . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @shwgeek I would fully second the suggestion to start building your retirement portfolio already . It takes a long time to switch over a portfolio but in terms of buying low but also to avoid triggering taxes . <p> I read that the Dogs of the Dow is a statistical anomaly and will probably not continue to work . <p> hellofreedom said , <p> Firstly , thanks for a great book , and blog .

I speak from 25 years experience . <p> Secondly the vast majority of the shares available are held by hedge funds , pension funds , insurance companies , and college endowments and they do not care about dividends , just total return . Dividends are not contractual , they can be cut , omitted , or fail to keep up with inflation at the whim of the board . Dividend investing is a thing of the past simply because the corporations do n't  need the individual investor any more .

This allows for substantial diversification while still making it possible to follow each company individually . <p> No company should exceed 10% of my total holdings .

My international exposure is in my 401k/IRA ( currently less than 10% of my holdings ) because it makes doing taxes easier . I am willing to sacrifice returns for this . <p> I follow no strict asset allocation . My asset allocation is determined by my trading strategy above . For the same reason I do not rebalance . <p> When it comes to buying stocks , it gets tricky . Usually there are 10 or more criteria of what makes a perfect stock .

Both have the same net worth ( equity ) , but the first have a debt/equity ratio of 0 whereas the latter have a debt/equity ratio of 150% . Hence the former is a much more financially secure/stable person/company . <p> See how this process works . Relying strictly on measurable metrics is like hiring a person based on their GPA .

@@42287923 @2287923/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I was inspired to post the following by a recent mail from T. and some earlier writings on the ecology of society . I would like to draw your attention to The Gamesman by Michael Maccoby . In this book , which I have not read yet but I got a summary from Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot by Jim Stockdale , Maccoby identifies four types of people . These types should perhaps more accurately be identified as traits in that a person encompass all these traits in varying degrees . <p> The four traits are <p> The Craftsman ( Ben Franklin ) characterized as being inventive , **26;1352;TOOLONG , resolute , and sincere . Since any strength has a corresponding weakness they are also prone to being obstinate , stingy , and suspicious . Craftsmen were the dominant type from 1776 to the early 1900s and laid the foundation of society . <p> The Jungle Fighter ( Andrew Carnegie ) characterized as being tough , competitive , and bold , but also ego-driven , paternalistic , and authoritarian . Jungle Fighters operate in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Us against them . Jungle fighters often start from poor circumstances and battle their way up . <p> The Company Man much like the jungle fighter but his primary motivation is the fear of losing rather than the desire to win . The company man is loyal , hard-working , honest , and eager to please , but he is also afraid to take risks . Company men were born into the affluence associated with fitting into a structure and they are afraid to lose it . Lacking the skill-focus of the craftsmen and the guts of the jungle fighters , company men were the ones that made marketing and appearance important . <p> The Gamesman was the new breed of Ivy League educated people who saw the world as a giant chessboard . The Gamesman believes that everything can be analyzed , dissected , and optimized . And thus the Gamesman does not believe in the zero-sum world of the Jungle Fighter . Rather everybody can win if he plays his cards right . Gamesmen like awards . The Gamesman is cool , detached , intellectual , and open-minded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and does not like confrontations . Gamesmen do not like to fire people . Instead Gamesmen have invented elaborate systems of performance reviews , e.g. " it was not me that fired you it was your performance review " . <p> The current world is dominated by gamesmen . Hence the importance of sports rather than having served in the military ( war does not allow time-outs and it requires performance under the worst conditions rather than the best conditions of Gatorade and Under Armor , think about it ! ) as a career ladder asset . Hence the long books on exactly how to behave during an interview , what to say , what to do , and even where to sit at meetings in detailed analyses . The oldest culture , the craftsman culture , is hard to find . If you want to see the difference try to contrast and compare an popular science magazine of a hundred year ago , full of information and requiring a solid foundation to understand ( if you can get your hands on old copies , get them ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures and prose written to entertain rather than inform . <p> Ecologically speaking most species will naturally tend to feed on another species and in turn be fed upon by the next species . It is exceedingly arrogant to think the humans or their culture is the one exception to this rule . At the frontier , the craftsmen rule . They deal with nature and as such are used to dealing with problems that do n't  care about the man . For instance , being on a small boat in a storm , the storm does not care if you are seasick it will kill you regardless . Craftsmen will colonize barren land . They will set up government where there is none . The will invent tools where there were none . The jungle fighters will then move in and capitalize on these tools using them to fight each other until the domain has been conquered . When there is nothing more to fight for and no places to expand into , the jungle fighters can no longer expand . They have reached their population density . Hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company men . This allows the population density to overshoot . In other words , there are now more people providing essentially the same functions . In other words , productivity per person decreases . Having a fully formed environment with redundant assets to be terminated , the gamesmen will sweep in and start discarding people . In this sense , the gamesmen are like trees that cover the bushy undergrowth of their predecessors . <p> It is important to note though that the gamesmen are not self-sufficient . This will be a problem that will be realized by the next generation . Interestingly enough it is also inevitable and unavoidable . The gamesmen , which are actually net-negative contributers ( this interpretation fits exceedingly well with the focus on appearance and their belief that everybody wins ) , will eventually cause their own downfall . For instance , it is apparent that as companies eliminated their jungle fighter loyalty to their employees , the employes eliminated their company man loyalty to their employers . This makes the structure less more skill based but less solid ( much like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while still skirting the standard yacht racing is an even worse example of this problem , here computer programs design yachts not according to sea worthiness but according to race regulations ) . I see this problem playing out fast . The main question is , who will be the next type to replace the gamesman . There is a suggestion in Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot . I am not sure I agree . <p> to the four types of personality suited to differing phases of colonising new fields . These are the Craftsman , the Jungle Fighter , the Company Man and the Gamesman . The craftsmen are geeks , they know stuff but are n't  perhaps best with people . They value <p> I am an unusual mix a salaryman/company man according to ERE-speak and yet also entrepreneur ( craftsman in EREs taxonomy ) colonising new ground the Web <p> TallMike said , <p> Sounds like the plot of Deadwood . <p> pogo said , <p> would n't the cycle keep repeating itself though ? Assuming the downfall of civilization ! I think barring some evolutionary change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a craftsman , and it seems there 's a renewed interest in craftmen activities like being a homesteader , building your own tiny house , canning food , etc . So maybe were already on the way to going back to craftsmen stage in society . <p> Vadimgo said , <p> Interesting ideas again . An attempt to illustrate the world by somebody with not enough knowledge about it ? I can not pinpoint it yet , but it reminds me about the conversation about say peak oil between the two 2010 graduates of a liberal arts colleges .

When we moved into the RV , we obviously did n't  have a lot of space(*) , so many things were packed into moving boxes and stored outside in the garden shed . <p> ( * ) Although I think if we put everything in the RV in boxes , we 'd still end up with quite a few . <p> We figured , it would be easy to go out and get something in case we needed it . <p> Surprise , surprise , this rarely happens , because its simply too much of a hassle to go dig up that esoteric/useless gadget when other solutions can easily be improvisedfortunately the " I will just drive down to Walmart and buy a new one " -monster is long gone ; otherwise this approach obviously would n't work . <p> This also means that there really is no excuse even for the most ardent " I might need it someday " hoarder and all other things being equal , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of stuff . <p> My suggestion in terms of getting rid of stuff then is simply to put your least used " I might need it someday " in boxes and store them somewhere . Maybe you can do an exchange with someone . You store 5 of their boxes and theyll store 5 of yours . Then after a year , you can decide whether you still want to keep them around , just in case you might need them some dayor decade . <p> If the item happens to be rare , hard to get or really expensive I 'd hang onto it . Otherwise I 'd probably get rid of it . <p> There are some exceptions . I find it very difficult to part with tools or with cables . My spare cable drawer has saved a few people during crunch times ! <p> If I 'm having this conversation with myself it probably means that I have n't used it for years and do n't  foresee myself using it for years . So I get rid of it . If I really really wind up needing it unexpectedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one . <p> I could n't agree more . This has been a huge obstacle for us to overcome regarding our upcoming overseas move . The increased cost of having to repurchase any single item that you truly do need is far less than benefit that comes with purging yourself of this crap ! <p> I just spent an hour staring at the bags of sheets and towels in my shed that were leftover from my furnished rental . I gave up because it got too hot in there and I was getting frustrated . I decided to give it 6 months and try again . In the back of my mind there is this idea that a refuge family will show up on my doorstep and need sheets , blankets and towels . I know , totally irrational ( except that my sister does have 7 kids ! But they have never appeared at my door looking for a place to stay ) . <p> Spork said , <p> I have a large technical reference library that I am emotionally unable to dissolve . <p> For everything else I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't used it in a year , then sell , freecycle , recycle , or trashin that order . <p> So many people I know could use this advice . Unfortunately such tips seem to be the only thing they wo n't keep in case they need it someday . <p> prodgod said , <p> While I recognize the importance of this advice , I have to say that we frequently come across old purchases that we have n't used in years and end up finding new uses for them , especially kitchen appliances/gadgets . I know , I know I 'm just justifying my hoarding . <p> Jen said , <p> I agree ! I am packing to move Monday and I thought I was pretty minimalist , I have tons of open cabinet space and do n't  keep much , but I am still finding I have way too much stuff ! I am downsizing into a smaller house so that is part of it . I am also divorcing a guy who wont part with every piece of electronics he has ever owned , no matter how obsolete or broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that junk anymore . <p> I am starting to see the appeal in just having the bare minimum , each American just has a crazy amount of stuff . On the upside though , I did make about $150 this week selling a junky rolltop desk , two glass tables , and a kids ride on toy . That felt good . I joked with my MIL who has way too much stuff that my new job will be sneaking into her home and craigslisting her things behind her back ! = I almost do n't  think shed notice though if I really did ( not that I am serious ) . <p> Thus a balance sheet of physical assets in the example above is : -303,500 <p> This model does not take into account expenditure such as mortgage payments , which are outgoings as opposed to assets . <p> So , if you can reduce your inventory by 10% on the **32;1380;TOOLONG ( lasting &gt; 3 years ) which equate to -29500 then you could generate -2950 x .5= -1475 assuming you get 50% of the nominal value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest amounts of cash by selling consumables as I have sold &gt;250 items.These were made up of clothing , electrical goods and music/books . If each item is an average price of -5 then I have generated -1250 , which is close to my assumed target above . <p> So , looking at the items within your house as disposable assets , as an area of financial management , can reap benefits , as you reduce your home inventory and goods in hand.This has benefits inasmuch that the exercise would free up more living space for you/your family/partner . <p> An additional spin off from this is if you can sell it and somebody else have use of it then it supports the recycling/reusing of articles.I know this would reduce the amount of spend by consumers , but as I have previously mentioned , we are slaves to consumerism and recycling goods benefits more than just the giant retailers . <p> Thanks for reading . <p> Luke said , <p> markg5452 , I agree with your general idea , but the hypothetical amounts spent on goods seem way too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping on , a binbag full of tenners ? = <p> Thanks for the consensus , beds are where we spend 33% of our days ? so I calculate in a house with 4 adults then -750 per bed is a cover-all figure i.e. **28;1414;TOOLONG etc . On reflection you may be right should have been -2k . Thanks for the correction ( Doh ! ) <p> Last year I sold my farm and downsized . I got rid of tons of stuff ; left useful things for the new owners , gave stuff away , sold some things , recycled , etc . Even with all of that , when I moved to my new place I STILL felt I had too much . I know that in comparison to most Americans I do n't  have much , but I still feel I am carting around too much . <p> I did have to think about the whole " I might need this some day " bit . And truth be told , I have ended up needing a couple of things I ditched , but none of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no idea where I was ending up so it was hard to plan . But I figure if I really , really need something , I can always buy it or borrow it . <p> I 'd like to live overseas some day and no way would I bring most of my things with me . Again , if I really need it , I can get another in most places . Its been very freeing to do this .

Do you do things on the weekends or do you just watch TV or shop ? Even after quitting my job , I still fill like I do n't  have enough time to do all the things I want to do . <p> While these personality traits are not required for early retirement , they are sufficient .

They could not communicate with one another , or even see another person , and they did not leave their solitary cells . They were generally not supposed to read , but were supposed to spend their time reflecting on their crimes and feeling sorry for having committed them . They were thus supposed to reform themselves through introspection and reflection . Their only exposure to another person was through very brief interactions with the guards , who were often drunk due to the extreme monotony of the place . <p> Unfortunately many of the prisoners seemed to go insane from the long term solitude . Charles Dickens even wrote about this at one point . Also , its an expensive way to house prisoners . Eventually this type of imprisonment was abandoned , generally in favor of the idea of prisoners working as part of their reform . <p> matt g said , <p> Do you have any pictures of the interior of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?

I enjoy keeping fish , watching them , breeding them , building web applications to monitor their water &amp; feed them over the internet , you know , " normal fish stuff " = I also like playing music and recording it ( which takes a lot of space to get the acoustics right for recording something like a drum kit ) .

The main issue here is weight of all that water . <p> For the music , you could rent a studio ( I know a band that does that ) or just move into somebody elses garage ? I wanted a watchmakers bench and was thinking of ripping out the rotating chair and putting it there .

Another difference between the INTP and the INTJ is that the INTP is content to understand the system , whereas the INTJ wants to build it . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @cat They seem to be quite good at achieving it since ISTJ is high in conscientiousness and following a plan/budget . What you have in the ISTJ is close to the millionaire next door type . Frugal and hard working . MY two cents . <p> shuchong said , <p> I was doing good until I got to the " I have no problems entertaining myself for extended periods of time " . That 's the main reason why I do n't  think early retirement would work for me . I like being busy , but I 'm really bad at finding things to do on my own , and when I do n't  have the structure of a workweek , I tend to spend all my time sleeping and lazing around instead of doing anything productive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death for me I can see myself becoming a hermit and slowly wasting away in front of my laptop . Perhaps , one day , I 'll find something that I really want to do but that I cant make money on , and then I 'll start seriously thinking about retiring early . For now , I think having a job is actually good for me , precisely because it keeps my more neurotic tendencies away : ) <p> I think it does take a personality type , and I am an ENFP , somewhat unsuited for early retirement mindset , and a lot of the practices that I keep ( like bill autopay ) are precisely in recognition that my personality is non-J . <p> I do think the N-characteristic means a lot of contemplation and a bit less keeping up with the Joness reacting . <p> I love reading and other relatively solitary activities , but find that I crave interacting and talking . Working from home is almost a nemesis to me , since I miss the social interaction from a big office scene . <p> Chris L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife can understand me = Its all right there in Wiki . <p> Johnny H said , <p> Yet another INTJ here . <p> Some INTJ key ingredients to early retirement : *Plan many of the details in advance before moving into action . <p> *Mentally live in the Future , attending to future possibilities . <p> Those two accurately describe most of my idle thinking . And they 're usually about being retired as soon as possible . <p> Tracy said , <p> I think a healthy measure of self-confidence is necessary . <p> Few of us are able to retire in a mansion with 3 boats , 5 sports cars and a luxury jet at the age of 30 , even 40 . <p> But we can still retire if we live very carefully , frugally , not caring too much about what money can buy other than the freedom to have our time as our own . That " not care " attitude is unusual as we are all aware that we are weighed in society by what we do , how much we earn , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't  subscribe to that status quo , we do n't  fit in , and fitting in is important to most people . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Tracy Indeed , it seems like the only socially acceptable way to retire is with a million dollars . Its kinda the golden standard because that 's about what 's required to withdraw $40k/year which is the median level of consumerism . But yes , in this society everyone can have everything they need , and a few of the things they want , whereas only a few can have everything they want . ERE simply wants time and freedom more than things . That 's how I think of it . I was born with debt in that I could not just go into the country and live of the land . I had to buy or rent some land and I had to buy food . This was the debt I was born with and early retirement is nothing else than paying this debt off . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> Creepy : I started as INTJ , though I 've been testing as INTx lately ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problem imagining going crazy in solitary confinement , though . In the real world , I can be alone plenty , but its because I 'm not really aloneIve got books and movies created by others , I 've got neighbors with yards I can look at , I have projects I can work on , etc . <p> I do need other people , but I prefer them one-on-one rather than in large , unruly crowds like that breakfast in the cafeteria . <p> My main flaws in relation to retiring early are that I low tolerance for risk ( that greatly reduces my options ) and I have low tolerance for frustration ( that means I give up too quickly ) . <p> My advantages : I 'm good at planning . I 'm good at comprehending and controlling my finances and actually enjoy doing any related calculations ( though I do n't  enjoy doing these calculations so much on OTHER peoples finances ! ) . I 'm not rash ( I do n't  quit without having another job lined up ) . I think long-term and big-picture . And I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to keep up with the Joneses for status reasons .

The living room in that picture is even smaller than my living room . It would never have occurred to me to put the chair 1-2 feet in front of the couch . Even the path between the table and the counter is quite narrow . This seems perfectly reasonable in a trailer , but I 've never lived in one and have always wanted a wider path for some reason . <p> Is that weird to have someone over and they are sitting that close in front of you ?

Hows that going ? Also , what are your thoughts on vegan diets ? It seems like you mostly eat vegan already , with all the beans , rice , and vegetable/fruit juice smoothies you consume . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Debbie M The chair rotates so if you start leg fencing , you can turn it .

Not only by reaching FI , but also sometimes by adopting a traveling lifestyle , so he does n't  stay enough to get pissed off by " the small talk " , neither to have any deeper relationship with people . <p> I think a better name for the " introvert " would be the " sensitive " . Because as I see , we are not introverts in the sense that we do n't  wan na relate to the outside ( people and things ) . We just do n't  think its worth to spend much time talking interesting thinkgs with insensitive people . So we listen to them to learn more . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159

I used one part for the handle and the other part for the rake ( crossbar ) itself . The 19 teeth came from two $0.99 3/8 ? dowels which are cut to 2.5 ? . They are spaced 5/4 ? apart in 1/2 ? deep holes I drilled with a brace and auger . These are glued in . The handle is fitted onto the rake with a thru-tenon which is pulled in by an offset dowel which also makes the middle tooth ; this is not glued in allowing me to take the rake apart again . The mortise was made with a chisel . This joint is quite solid without any give thus I did n't  have to put in diagonal supports which would have complicated the matter . <p> The rake works very well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This always seems to be the case for metal rakes which annoys me . However , the rake is a bit on the heavy side , probably thanks to the massive handle . I did n't  want to spend too much time planing it down .

However , in this case perfect does n't  matter . I used a marking gauge and ran it all the way down the 2+4 . If the saw tracks out of line you can " bend " it back on line by sawing at an angle of 30 degrees or so . The underside line will not necessarily be straight when you do this but its good enough . If you want straight-straight . Saw an inch on the top , turn the piece , saw an inch on the bottom , etc . Then plane the edge . I do this if the edge is important . In this case I was going to plane it semi-round for the handle anyway , so it did n't  matter . <p> KevinInConcord said , <p> @Jacob , What do you use for a handsaw ( to rip a 2+4 ) ?

( I 'm not sure if that 's normal , or I 'm slow , or the wood was particularly dense ; also it was the first time using the saw , and I think I 'm faster with it now ) . In general I like Japanese saws because they can be thinner and thus waste less wood . The push-style saws are fun and nice too , though I only have a couple antique $1 ones so they 're probably not representative . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Kevin I used a Lie Nielsen 12pt crosscut panel saw . Crosscut is terrible for ripping , but it worked better than my dull 8pt D-8 Disston saw . I need to find out how to sharpen that and reset it for rip . I 'd say the 12pt is faster than 1 ? /min .

@@42287939 @2287939/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Financial planners generally agree that a 4 percent retirement withdrawal rate ( a study has been done ! ) is safe for the long-term as it takes into account inflation , economic growth , and so on . <p> This means that you need 25 times ( 1.00/0.04 = 25 ) your annual expenditures invested in income generating assets such as stocks , bonds , CDs , and real estate to retire safely . Note that the home equity of your own house does n't  count towards this goal as your house does not generate income ! <p> Here the first column is all the expenditures you 've had that day . For instance , on day 1 I spent 5.50 to see X-Men III . On day 2 , I spent $45 on groceries and on day 3 , I did not spend anything . <p> The second column is the cumulative expenditure . So on day 3 , I had spent 5.50+45.00+0.00=50.50 in total . <p> The next column is the average daily expenditure . You find this number by dividing the cumulative expenditure by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The final column is the average daily expenditure multiplied by 365 which thus becomes an estimate of my annual expenditure . <p> The more days you include in the table , the better your estimate of your average daily expenditures becomes . For an accurate estimate you need to carry out this exercise for a couple of months but even a few weeks would yield a reasonable estimate . <p> My number is around 200,000 euro . At the 2% dividends from global market cap indexing this yields 10 euro per day , more than enough since I will be living with my parents for the time being ( just graduated ) . I also have a company car . <p> By living of 2% only , income stream will increase every year and I will gradually move out , and buy a car ( if I quit ) . I will be at 200K within 50 months if all goes as planned . <p> If I retire , I will become an entrepreneur . hats my real dream , but I want to play it safe first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launching a ( fully outsourced ) side business , and I truly believe I have a fair shot at doing a tremendous amount of good for this world ( cant comment any further currently ) WHILE earning $500K for myself , if all goes to business plan . I risk about 5500 euro in startup cost for this project . <p> tom said , <p> Forgot to add , I am currently at 20K euro ( after deducting the 5K in side business equity ) , so I currently have about 1 euro per day in dividend income . This makes me richer than probably a billion of humans on this earth ! ! It also covers about 100% of what I spend if except for suits , going out and splurges . My efforts are focused around keeping said 3 cost items as low as possible while keeping it tolerable from a social point of view . <p> So this was the first post of your blog eh ? I like it . I always find it difficult to get my writing started , but once that first part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back on topic ( I know this response is way later than the last ) , at 4% withdrawal rate my number is $450,000 . However , I try to be conservative about things so I 'm aiming for 3% withdrawal rate . That brings my number up quit a bit to $600,000 . <p> Since there is not really time to " wait around " and see how much your daily expenditures are before you figure out your number , one has to come up with quick ways to find annual expenditures . You can use your tax returns or W2s to see your net income for the year adjusted for savings , investments , debt , for example , if you have savings , you can deduct this from your net income to find your expenses for that year . If you have no savings , but have gone into debt instead , you would add the debt to your net income , etc . This would give you a quick number as to your expenses . Of course , there are still other things you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . Another way , that is not too great , is to look at the debits on your bank statement(s) , assuming that they are all expense-related . This is assuming you have no credit card , or if you have one , you pay it off ; if you do n't  pay it off , you would adjust for whatever debt is left over from that period Of course , tracking your expenses is good for you , so this is just a quick suggestion for those who want a quick figure to get their number , without waiting too long to find out their number . <p> Anon said , <p> My number is $400k , which I hope to hit within 3 years .

I was more concerned with generating enough dividend income to more than cover my monthly expenses .

" <p> Right now , the ratio of my investments to annual expenses is about 45:1 . <p> I used the " Multiply by 25 " rule myself when putting together my Retire Early plan . I would use a " Multiply by 20 " rule if I were putting it together today . I now know more about how investing works than I did then .

There are at least two factors will complicate the issue : Actual returns and inflation . <p> If your investments do n't  keep up with inflation , your real income will fall . And , if there is an extended bull market in any investment class on which you are counting to provide you income , you could be in trouble . <p> On top of that , there is the reality of health care in the US and the fact that even if you have health insurance , most of our policies have a cap of one sort or another or there are gaps in our policy . Hit one of those gaps and it could become necessary to choose between your money or your life . <p> The thing is , most people pursuing " early retirement " are actually not pursuing any such thing . Retirement is when you are voluntarily out of the labor pool and do not engage in any endeavor for which you seek recompense , such as self-employment . <p> Me , Jacob , and most of those seeking " early retirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the five-day workweek and plan to finance that escape with a mix of passive income and self-employment . That is not the definition of " retired , " however . <p> But you do need the goal of a " number " as that allows you to plan . And , if you continue to generate earned income ( as opposed to passive income ) after leaving your position as an employee , that income can serve to buffer the effects of both actual returns and inflation . Which is why it is prudent to include some aspect of earned income when planning for semi-FI . <p> George the original one said , <p> I 'd argue that the math really is that simple . Its a persons comfort with the math that is complicated . <p> bigato said , <p> If the present situation keeps unchanged I would reach retirement at 44 ( i 'm 30 ) , having about 490k in brazilian currency . I would be withdrawing 3% yearly . I 'm planning to reduce expenses ( stop paying rent and others adjustments ) and learn about investing so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very probably get 400 more each month . All that would allow retire at 35 with about 215k . <p> Thinking about my expenses after retirement , when I will have more time to grow some vegetables , will cook using a wood stove i will build myself , will make my own soap from wood ashes , have some chicken , build a solar water heating system , then I will need only 110k , withdrawing 4% yearly . If I could reduce expenses to that level today , I would need only 1.72 year to pile up that amount , retiring at 32 . So the focus is really on cutting expenses . <p> I could spend a month finding a venture capitalist to fund my selling Digital Rocks Company : ) , that 's the shortcut right ?

You multiply your total annual expense by <p> Right now my numbers look bad . I have two kids and recently refinanced to a 10 year mortgage from a 15 . Got a great rate , but the payment is killer .

With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , within walking distance of groceries and the library . Now we probably get rid of one car , much lower fuel expenses .

I 'm not sure how much value there is in that higher education , but at this point I think if the kids want it I will help them . I do n't  want them to start careers as debt slaves .

Problem solved : It is a job . <p> Perceived standard of living Show me one person who is excited about extreme early retirement and I will show you five that thinks it is all about sacrifice and making your own toilet paper , something which they are not particularly excited about and even fairly judgmental about . To avoid this it is prudent to pick up something which is highly visible and desirable to Joe Average . Traveling is a sure hit . <p> Not contributing to society There is this collectivist belief shared by many(*) that capable persons should contribute to society ( Being a rentier capitalist , see above , I contribute my fortune to productive assets instead of suburban real estate and SUVs ) . An alternative belief is that as long as one can support oneself , that is good enough : This is the individualistic approach .

At the same time , they wo n't want to ask because " Capitalist " has a ring to it that suggests to the listener that he/she should know what it is . I know what capitalism is , therefore I should know what a capitalist is.

Its about concept of work , schedules and contributions in an African village I studied and can be viewed here : ( http : **35;1509;TOOLONG ) <p> The basic point from my post that relates to your post is this : Why is working and particularly working for a salary necessarily associated with contributing to society ? <p> I can think of a lot of people who work a lot of hours and get paid quite well and who are probably doing a lot of harm to our societyIm not even going to bother listing any because the examples are so numerous as to be boring . Add to that the number of people paid a salary to do work that makes no contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are so many of those . <p> Maybe you are contributing to society by not playing into that trap , by doing no harm and by not buying into an useless transfer of money in our system ( such as the diet industry or , sadly , a lot of higher education ) . <p> Also , I can confirm that this blog allows me a forum to think things over and bounce my weird ideas off other people , so I feel you 're making a contribution in that waycreating a support for people attempting to do things differently . <p> bugsbunny said , <p> My husband faced the same questions when he retired early due to a severe injury .

However , by far the most common reaction is the disbeliefmaybe refusal to believe is more accuratethat retirement in the financial independence sense can actually be achieved before age 40 .

@@42287942 @2287942/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I find great utility in being a minimalist . Having less stuff makes it easier to maintain , move , and store . This frees both precious time and money , which can be used to reach a higher standard of living(*) Forsooth , I can not rationalize the tendency to accumulate stuff for the sake off stuff at the expense of time and quality . More , more , more rings hollow in my ears . <p> Sometimes books on minimalism or voluntary simplicity are just not minimal or simple enough though . To remedy this , it is useful to get inspiration elsewhere and ask questions about what is really important ( which I define as needs ) and what is less important ( which I define as wants ) . <p> If we do n't  count the nest of a bird , etc. animals are generally characterized by having no stuff at all . Instead they have freedom and health ( if not , they die ) . They also have the ability to use their bodies , something which many modern humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those that cant do n't  . Those who run faster , with greater ease or less fatigue or with less injuries have more of it . Another way asset it the ability to move around . For instance , climbing a mountain or merely hiking uphill . We have " something " if we can do that . If we cant , we do n't  . The same goes for work . It is clear that a hard worker who can do more labor is stronger and more resilient than the worker who needs more breaks . Health is similar . It is often easy to tell a healthy body from a sick one . A healthy body moves . A sick one tries to avoid it . A healthy body has been fueled by nutritious food and conditioned by exercise . A sick body has n't  . More interestingly , these things can not be bought for money . There is no faking it . This is probably hard to understand when , say , running a 6 minute mile seems impossible or too trivial , but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent not being sick and money not spent on sick care . <p> Moving up a step , homeless people or hobos reveal the second most important needs . Since homeless people are stigmatized in this nation of homeowners , they have to move around a lot at an instants notice . Furthermore they find themselves at the bottom of society with little protection . This also calls for not being encumbered by things . The second greatest need is thus the clothes we wear . I am not talking about a huge wardrobe . Rather the clothes we actually wear should satisfy our needs as well as possible . One of my most precious possessions is my jacket . This was an expensive purchase , but given that I use it so much ( I must have put it on at least 20,000 times by now ) I could not imagine wearing anything less . I also used to like my boots a lot ( similar stats ) , but since I move by bicycle instead , I would say that the padded Endura bib tights I got last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ultralight hiking is another source of inspiration . I 'm not talking about cutting down a toothbrush to save weight . Rather , its the idea that we want to carry as little as possible and go as far as possible . This is contrary to the so-called camping trips where one drives an SUV out into a national park and then drags a 40lbs backpack a couple of miles into the woods = . Going far and fast , things must be solidly made , built for function , repairable , and generally serve multiple purposes . This is why I write this from a wireless laptop with a 12 ? screen rather than a desktop . It is the ideal compromise between size and power . It is also the reason why I do n't  like things that do n't  serve a functional purpose on a daily basis . <p> Car/van-living . This is one step up from living out of a backpack . I 'm not talking about the 15 ton RVs that look like a bus . A car can carry a few hundred pounds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and limited space , what do we really need . I would focus on " utilities " e.g. a source of water . A toilet . A more comfortable bed . These are the things I would spend on . I would not get a 4 stove burner . Rather I would get 1 burner , at most 2 . <p> Boat-living . Boat-space is also at a premium . I am always impressed about how the use of space is maximized in boats to make the rooms seem much larger than they are . Boats also allow a few more luxuries ( material wants ) but only the most important ones . Maybe a picture or two on the wall and a few books . <p> Cottages . Cottages are much like boats but poorly designed cottages can also seem much like houses . Frequently the spaciousness of a place is determined , not by how large it is , but by how much crap one tries to stuff in there . Unfortunately , a land-dwelling requires some discipline , whereas on a boat it probably sinks if loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cottages , except these ones . <p> As an afterthought , I realized how well this ties into the idea of ecological footprints . I would say that things become less important the more ones footprint expands . For instance , the utility of my brain , muscles , bones and organs are the most important to me . The utility of my clothes , the second most important closely followed by the utility of my tools . Personally . I find that things beyond that matters little in the positive sense and more in the negative sense . I think not so much of what they can do for me , but what they can prevent me from doing . <h> 24 users responded in " Minimalist inspirations " <p> Excellent post ! This made me think of something I recently read about : **25;1546;TOOLONG homes.http : **27;1573;TOOLONG It may be too drastic for some , but for the true minimalist these home seem to be a great compromise ( except for the shipping of the houses if you do n't  build them yourself ) . <p> KillerRoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , these homes seem like a nice alternative for someone wanting to live a minimalist lifestyle . I just purchased a home ( traditional ) before finding out about these ; and I currently have a roommate , but I hope to someday have such a small footprint . <p> Its interesting how you place the physiological needs ( health and basic shelter ) at the top in terms of importance , rather than the bottom , as Maslow does in his hierarchy of needs . According to Maslow , the bottom-most portion is physiological , then safety needs , social needs ( that is to say social approval ) and so on , and at the very top is self-actualization . I 'd say most of modern America conceptualizes this pyramid in a consumer sense . First : meet basic needs . Then spend money to impress/peer **30;1602;TOOLONG . Buy on credit , pay later ! And self-actualization would naturally then be whoever has the biggest and newest toys ! <p> I like how you reframe what is important .. physiological needs must be met with the most economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-actualization , not the other way around . And you 're right in that the most important things ca n't be bought on the consumer market , such as intelligence , free time , and health . You would sometimes mention how your goal is to maximize your independence . So is it safe to assume that self-actualization for you is self-sufficiency ? And is that a means to an end ( some project or life goal ) or is that an end in and of itself ( achievement in mastering the self and ones willpower ) ? Either way , I think it is a very worthwhile and admirable goal to have , especially in a society of people who kill themselves to out-consume their neighbors . <p> Very interesting post ! I like the tie you made between the necessities and our footprint . I also really enjoy how you worked up from animal and then on to the increasing levels of things we can have to make up our needs . Very good , very compelling . Thank you = <p> Get a job hippie ! = Good stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been " cleaning out the closet " for the past couple of weeks . I 'm also getting ready to buy road tires/wheels for my mtn bike ! <p> So your point about animal examples is really important to me ; something I think about every day , with the wild ones particularly admirable . I think this is why I 'm not afraid of deaththe thought that I or other loved ones go through what the squirrels in the trees face too . <p> And , of course , they live minimally . But then there is the news item I recently saw about squirrels living in a cemetery appropriating those little American flags people put on graves to line their nests ! <p> I fantasize about living much more simplistically . Ive been a huge fan of Tumbleweed Homes for a few years now and am pretty sure I could ditch most of my stuff and live in one of them comfortably . However , I 'm not so sure my husband could , so we need to find a happy medium in the next few years . <p> Very interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am eager to read more ! I think being a minimal and cutting down to the things in life that follow along with our life values are what makes the most difference . <p> I think we are more like hermit crabs thoughcarrying everything we own on our backs . <p> Chris V. said , <p> I love it ! I tell people the best health insurance is to be healthy . You can spend thousands a year so that heroic and expensive medicine can keep your sick body from dieing , but it takes a small fraction of that to keep a healthy body healthy . Eating well and exercise are the best health insurance . <p> Sometimes I think " Minimalist " gets carried away too far . There are some things that really are practical and prevent me from living in two suitcases , as it has been mentioned . I appreciate the idea but do n't  think it can be taken literally . <p> There are great ideas here , but at a certain point you can start to diminish your quality of life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have material wants is what creates an economy , even Robinson Crusoes .

Not because of the size , but because of the lack of options to park it . I prefer condo living in downtown areas .

Additionally , sharing walls reduces the energy needs and having several units share the same roof , reduces storm water runoff and urban heat island impacts . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287945 @2287945/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Note : This post was written when we lived in a house . We keep the RV thermostat at 65F to avoid condensation . <p> With the thermostat currently sitting at 55F(*) , we hope to save a pretty penny this winter on heating in fact , its been several days since the AC last switched on . Wearing layered loose clothing and getting up and lifting some weights from time to time , 55F is no big deal . Of course for those who are used to 75F and prefer to wear shorts and t-shirts during winter time while sitting perfectly still , 55F is a big deal . If wearing more than one layer feels too unusual , a space heater might be a good solution . The idea is to heat the occupied room with a space heater and leave the rest of the house cool . It is not the optimal solution . In general temperature gradients , where one side of you is warm while the other is cold from having the space heater on one side of you , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cool room or even vice versa , feels more uncomfortable than constant cool temperatures . Your choice . <p> ( * ) 55F is the lower limit for the thermostat because the water pipes are compromised at lower temperatures . Do not put the thermostat below 55F . <p> After buying a space heater and realizing that we already had one ( note to self : get rid of more stuff ! Buying something because you forgot you already own one is very embarrassing when you run a frugal blog ) , it was decided to increase wood stove usage . Indeed , we have a wood stove , but mostly being lazy and all , I prefer to adapt to the cold rather than try to fight it even it that means lifting tons of pig iron hey , its a good way to get buff for the beach . <p> Luckily firewood can be gathered for free on craigslist . However , free firewood comes with some caveats attached . Unless you are lucky enough to get first dips on somebodys firewood because they just switched to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap wood or rounds from somebodys backyard . The main motivation for the giver is to get rid of it . The main motivation for the taker is free heating . <p> Scrap wood like 2x4s , boards , and so on is usually a risky proposition . Often it will painted or treated with a fire retardant which makes it useless for heating purposes . We have gone on several wild goose chases for free firewood where much of it turned out to be unsuitable for burning . On the other hand , clean scrap wood is dry and burns well . After realizing the important cost of gasoline to pick it up we are no longer going out of our way to get it . The problem is that we have a compact hatchback and there a limit to how much wood will fit into the back . Maybe 10 days worth of heating . Thus it is not worth it to spend more than $10 in gas to go and get it . Frankly , I think we will move this limit even lower due to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talking about getting a truck the next time we buy a car in oh say 10 years . <p> Unlike rounds which are usually chain sawed to the right length , scrap wood comes at odd lengths . DW initially suggested that we get a power saw . No no no no ! Much like the powered screwdriver , the automatic egg boiler , and bread making machines , power saws are just yet another sign that the world has gone crazy . Sawing , like screwing ( ahem ! ) , boiling eggs , and baking bread can be done manually . To cut wood of this size " manually " , you need a bow saw or a frame saw . Now , it turns out that it is IMPOSSIBLE to buy a bow saw or at least it is impossible around here . We tried three different hardware stores and all they had were tiny hacksaws and of course power saws . Therefore I had to bite the bullet ( viz. shipping costs ) and get it online . I got this bow saw . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our longer scrap wood . Boys and their toys . It was somewhat pricey , but I know Bahco from when I was a kid . My dad got a set of Bahco screwdrivers which lasted forever unlike the flimsy 14 piece sets one usually gets from hardware stores . Buying quality is usually much cheaper in the long run . In addition , it is much more enjoyable to use a good tool or a good anything for that matter . This saw goes through wood like butter , I mean , I used my grandfathers bow saws before , but this one is like magic . Also sawing substitutes for pushups . I just have to remember to use my left arm as much as my right arm . Now all I have to do is to train DW in the use of a bow saw and her skills will be complete ( she is not a jedi yet ) . <p> The other choice of free wood is rounds . Rounds are a better option . They are always burnable . They are usually also from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season . Thus these are an investment for the next winter . Fire sized rounds with a two feet diameter are also quite heavy . Getting them into the car without scratching anything is good cross training . So is splitting rounds . I already had a sledgehammer so instead of getting a $30 dollar splitting maul , I got a $7 splitting wedge . The link is just to show what a splitting wedge looks like . Do n't  buy this online at 4lbs , the shipping cost is brutal . We got ours a Home Depot . A splitting wedge is less convenient than a maul , but more versatile because it allows me to split the gnarliest rounds . Never get a specialized tool , if a versatile set of tools can do the same job . It did n't  take me long to get the hang of using the sledgehammer at full force and actually hitting what I aimed at . Later it was discovered that thin pieces of wood can be broken in half by hitting them hard with a sledge hammer . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  forget the safety glasses . There will be large and sharp pieces of wood flying everywhere . <p> Now the real question is whether we actually saved anything since we bought a saw , a space heater and a wedge on top of the gasoline . The answer is a solid yes for next year , but the jury is still out for this year . I am guessing that we have spent about $100 so far to avoid spending money on AC heating . Clearly this is an investment but it is yet to be seen whether this will be a good investment . <p> A splitting wedge and a sledgehammer do the trick just fine , if you 've got nice , straight-grained pieces of wood . But if you ever start trying to use ( for example ) a whole tree that has come down in a storm , you 'll find yourself dealing parts of the tree that branch and twist . For that you 'll want not only a splitting maul but probably a couple more wedges as well . <p> Fortunately , wedges will last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thinkso they 're a worthy investment . A maul can last a generation or more as well , although you 'll probably have to replace the handle from time to time . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Thanks for the information . When we go and pick up free wood , we tend to stay clear of the difficult pieces . In many cases I would like to get a splitting maul , but the amount of wood I need to split is fairly small ( a couple of pieces a day ) , so I do n't  want to spend the money or space to get one . <p> That is awesomeunfortunately , our fireplace is gas . We still keep the furnace set at 61 and DH has to wear layers . He HATES it , but hell get over it . I cant stand seeing him and DS wearing shorts in January . It drives me up the wall . <p> My dad bought us a chainsaw at Lowesany ideas how to get rid of it ( i.e. the best way to make money on it ) ? Craigslist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never used it . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I 'm not sure . I imagine selling it locally would avoid the shipping costs which would be substantial thus allowing you to charge a bit more . OTOH there wont be any bidding from victorious shoppers . Maybe you can re-gift it ? <p> Pip said , <p> Have you tried asking about old wooden pallets at big stores ? ( home improvement type stores , farm supplies etc ) a lot of pallets are made out of untreated timber and most places will be happy to give them to you . Not sure which stores you could go to , I 'm in New Zealand and I go to mitre10 mega and farmlands . A crowbar/big hammer/back of an axe makes short work of them . = 10155 @qwx420155 <p> My parents have been doing that for years . They use an electric chainsaw to cut them up . I 'm not sure we could fit more than a couple of them into our car though , but for those with larger cars or trucks , it is a great idea . <p> Eliminating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time of year when heaters around the country are being switched on . Read Jacobs article for alternative ideas on heating your home . ( Early Retirement Extreme ) <p> When I was in highschool , my dad would always stop to grab free fire wood whenever he saw them . It was a lot of work splitting those rounds . Now we live in a condo and our heating cost is pretty low . We have a Kotatsu table and this helps tremendously . It is very comfortable and we keep the heater thermostat at 65 degree . Our building is concrete and it retain the heat very well and the heater do n't  switch on unless it was really cold for weeks on end . You can make your own Kotatsu table for about $150 with an IKEA coffee table , heating element from EBAY , and a king blanket . I 'm sure ERE peeps can cut this cost down quite a bit though . <p> Hand sawing wood very quickly gets old if you live anywhere where you need firewood for more than a month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from October thru April takes a lot of wood . 10153 @qwx420153 <p> Thanks to the big ice storm of January , 2009 , I got about 3 years worth of firewood . This was neither economical or wanted . On my property the ice storm ruined about 12 large trees . ( Lesson ) do n't  plant trees close to your house . At my age , the clean up of the damaged trees was way beyond what I could have or wanted to do myself . I hired a tree guy to come in and clean up and take out some of the trees , and cut the wood up into stove size . The branches were shredded into a mountain of mulch which we have nearly used up so far . The cost of all this was $1500.00 . That is expensive firewood and mulch . However , my property , like my neighbors , looked like a war zone , so I was happy to get this done in two days , instead of the 6 months it would have taken me doing it manually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and buildings . Again , do not plant trees close enough to your house to risk damages from them . <p> uribg said , <p> Woodstove + small house + good insulation and windows = 75 F indoors all winter and still economical , even buying firewood.The teenagers stack it , and even the ten-year-old can split wood with a wedge <p> this year Ash and I , have decides to live frugally , after getting advice from ERE , and info from other <p> woody said , <p> I know this is a really old post , but I 'll chime in with my two cents just so I can disagree with Jacob about the maul being a specialty tool while the sledge hammer is a multipurpose one . <p> A properly chosen maul will have a wedge side and a hammer side while a sledge hammer only has two hammers . The wedge side will go through rounds much more quickly than will a hammer and wedge combo . The hammer side of the maul can then be used to drive a wedge on the gnarly pieces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the hammer so it is not as effective on the gnarly pieces but it will more than makes up for the reduced weight via the speed it goes through the good rounds . <p> Now a splitting axe is indeed a specialty tool . Very few people need those unless they are only splitting nice small rounds of good straight grained wood . <p> If I had to pick only one tool out of the sledgehammer , splitting maul , splitting axe continuum it would be the maul hands down . Just make sure the maul has a hammer face on the back side and learn to swing it with care . <p> I could n't agree more with this post , It really beguiles me to see people in t shirt with heating turned up to the max , not only are they wasting energy they 're also throwing away their future . What a pity . <p> Excellent suggestions especially firewood from Craigslist . I will definitely be giving this a try . This blog is full of inspiration and keeps my desire of early retirement burning brightly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> leeholsen said , <p> i know this is an old thread because fisker does n't  live in an rv anymore , but as someone who lives in houston ; i am very jealous that i will never be able to do this : " With the thermostat currently sitting at 55F(*) " <p> i have yet to turn a heater on in Houston and even in january , the indoor temp never got below 60 . <p> when i pull the cord , i am moving north for at least one year just to know what having to worry about keeping warm is the norm . <p> Bob said , <p> I think heating is one of the least necessary " temperature " expenses . Unless you 're an old person or have health problems ( or you 're an unnaturally cold-bodied person , which means you do n't  need air con ! ) , or live in a very cold climate ( ie. weather goes below 10 degrees ) , there should n't be much need for heating . <p> The good thing about cold weather is that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its only when its hot when it gets problematic ( ie. if you 're still hot while wearing " nothing " you cant take anything else off ! ) . <p> Space heater is good but burning your own wood probably does n't  work in an apartment .

There will be at least one car gone by the end of the month . <p> Today I 'm going to discuss the management of things , that is , what many of us refer to as " stuff " . It probably holds for most of you , myself included , that you have more stuff than you actually use . By extrapolation ( technically induction ) , it therefore holds that other people has more stuff than they use as well . The cumulative mountain of unused stuff is a symptom of economic inefficiency . Inefficiency is what will slow you and everyone else down from early retirement or even prevent it . <p> Typical excuses for keeping stuff ( around ) <p> I need it . ( Answer : Then why havent you used it for the past 12 months ? ) <p> I might need it . ( Answer : Highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 months . ) <p> I did n't  know I still had that . ( Answer : Roll eyes . ) <p> This was a gift from aunt Martha . ( Answer : How about regifting it aunt Bertha ? ) <p> This antique is worth a lot money . ( Answer : Then sell it ! ) <p> I will just hold on to it a little longer . ( Answer : How long ? ) <p> I 'm sure you can think of other excuses . <p> The main problem here is that people have grown accustomed to acquiring stuff by buying it new from stores and forgotten all the alternatives . As a result , everybody on your street owns a blender that they have used maybe 10 times over the past year ; everybody owns a ladder even though they have only been up on the roof once ( I own a ladder , but I 'm up there every other week ) ; everybody stock a home library and a private movie collection ( and maybe even a private cinema sized projector system ) ; and everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a month but which were then put on hold . <p> This wasteful activity stops right now = <p> There is a major untapped resource here though . You might be one of the few people that actually have some desire to own a blender , if only for a short while . Instead of buying it ( on sale , of course , everything is always on sale in this country , ugh ! ) get it for free . <p> here 's how to get it for free . Use freecycle.org . Click on the link and see how it works . Then join . After you sign up you should start getting emails . <p> Your task for the week , should you choose to accept it , is to find one ( or several ) of your unused(*) possessions and OFFER it on freecycle . See what happens . If you do not have a bicycle , your task is to get one for free . Simply post a WANTED ad detailing your desire to get one . Oh , and if someone actually offers you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( * ) A good definition of unused is anything you have not used for one year . If you have used everything you own for a year , then congratulations . You get a C. Move the time frame back to six months . Still good ? You get a B. Move the time frame back to one month . If you 're still good , I have nothing to teach you . You get and A and you can skip this exercise = <p> You will find that most things show up on freecycle sooner or later . If you want an xBox360 , were talking much later , but I did recently see someone offer a PS1 and I gave away an Atari2600 simulator I got for xmas one year ( it was fun for 30 minutes ! ) . Freecycle will also teach some valuable lessons about lifecycle management . Unless you repeat the stunt of our former neighbors , who put an estimated 10-15 large black trash bags of stuff ( clothes , toys , ) out for garbage pickup during the last spring cleaning ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste ! ) , you will probably see that getting rid of stuff is a lot harder than acquiring it . We truly live in an affluent society , otherwise people would be knocking down your door to get your superfluous things . However , be patient , sooner or later someone will take it . If not freecycle , then craigslist. <h> 50 users responded in " Day 2 : Decluttering and managing stuff " <p> I joined freecycle for maybe two weeks gave some stuff away and then tired of seeing stuff after stuff listed . Just bought a clunker mtn. bike a month ago for $50 at a church rummage sale . Couple of weeks ago telling myself I " needed " new hiking boots , sleeping bag &amp; back pack but guess what I already have a variation on those items I can tweak .

Slowly I 'm learning that I should just get rid of them . <p> One good thing Ive learned is that reference books are overrated if you have internet access . There is almost nothing I use reference books for . My best references are my two favorite cookbooks and some older home repair books ( written closer to the era when my house was built ) .

If you get rid of a huge pile of books and then realize that you got rid of one which you should n't have , most books are easy to replace cheaply online . 10151 @qwx420151 <p> here 's a general hint . Make an inventory of everything you own . Its good for insurance purposes . Having to go through everything like that will make it clear just how much stuff you have . And if you get rid of it , you do n't  have to make an entry for it ! <p> Every time you get something new , add it to the inventory . At that time it will also be easy to include information like the date acquired , the price , the warranty information , care instructions , or anything else that might be useful . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> I 've got to forward this blog to my parents the only people I know that moved a basement full of " stuff " from the old house to the new house back in the 80s .

Ive been wearing army boots for the last two winters , for a total of thirty bucks , and they 're still in great shape . <p> Here a few thoughts that helped me let go of books ( and other stuff ) : There were quite a number of books in my shelves that I did n't  want to give away because they had been so important and valuable to me once , that had influenced me and helped me grow . When I realized that what had been the essence of these books was now integrated in me and in my life , I suddenly did n't  feel like having to keep them anymore . No need to keep a book when you have given life to the thoughts in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more people reading these copies and being inspired like I had been ! Much better life for a book to be travelling and read several times than standing in a shelf quite uselessly <p> This works for other stuff , too . Imagine how you 'd feel if you were the item and had to waste your life in someones closet . ( You do n't  need to be an animist to do this . ) To me , Karen Kingstons definition of clutter has been a guideline during the past ten years : clutter is everything that you do n't  need or love dearly . I see that your definition is more rigid , as it would n't allow to keep something " useless " just because its beautiful or inspiring . This is probably a question priorities , in any case should one restrict the number of " useless but beloved " items and then get rid of one when acquiring a new one . with greetings from germany , I 'm glad I stumbled upon your website , thank you ! <p> When I moved out of my $695/ month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park ) to a $400/ month two bedroom ( almost townhouse with an actual driveway ! ) , we had to get rid of a very old wooden dinner table + 4 wooden chairs that I grew up with using in my dads house , since our new place did n't  have a dining room ( we never used it or needed a room for one ) .

Plus the old ladies who run it are pretty fun to talk to <p> They also serve as my de facto donation spot for books that the used bookstores wont buy . <p> Another way I look at books and keeping them is to think : is this book a pivotal book in the development of my thinking/humanity ?

According to my favorite theory in the world , the MBTI , a persons highest values is a function of the personality type . <p> They are <p> Rationals : Competence and autonomy <p> Idealists : Principles and relationships <p> Guardians : Status and security <p> Artisans : Spontaneous fun and experiences <p> Since guardians and artisans comprise 70% of the population , popular advice is aimed in their direction : " You should get your finances in order " , " You should go to college " , " Travel more " , " Spend your twenties having fun ! " <p> There 's also an ongoing meme war between those two factions : " You should value experience over stuff " . <p> I see my share of them : " I cant imagine a retirement without traveling " , " Life is meaningless without a job title " , " I do n't  feel safe retiring with less than 15 million dollars(*) . " <p> ( * ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And then there are a lot of people just parroting this advice , thinking that life is only about either stuff or experiences , not so much relationships , principles , independence , or competence . <p> Wouldnt it be fun if the conversation was dominated by Rationals and Idealists instead ? <p> " You should value autonomy over relationships " , " Principles are more important than competence " , " I 'd rather be evil than incompetent " . I can just imagine how confusing this would be if the zeitgeist changed overnight and started focusing on those issues instead . <p> Look , you got ta do what you got ta do according to who you arenot according to who someone else is . Discussing whether you cant fathom a retirement that complete ignores what you find the most precious whether that 's adding to your skills , building deeper relationships , or traveling to faraway destination , is irrelevant . <p> What we do need to get away from is the consumerism/race aspect of all four of those : <p> When artisans try to one-up each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when guardians one-up each other with the size of their lawns and fine awards theyve collected , when idealists one-up each other by how authentic and personally evolved they are or how many people theyve connected with , when rationals one-up each other with how smart they are and all the things they 're better at . <p> This is too common but its a natural competitive pecking order impulse . <p> The focus must be shifted . " You should value experiences over stuff " should NOT be read as " experiences are better than stuff " . Instead see it as an artisan protest over a guardian dominated culture which talks incessantly about stuff . This is similar to how this entire blog is a protest on the careerism values of the Guardians . <p> If one or two personality types werent so dominating such protests would be unnecessary . <h> 10 users responded in " " You should value experiences over stuff " " <p> Even as a Rational , I still think of it in terms of experiences though .

Something that can be identified by a specific time and place and talked about in the sense of " remember when we " and " so there I was " <p> jzt83 said , <p> Your level of enjoyment of experiences also depends on who your are experiencing with and where you are experiencing it .

Or you can choose a ho hum vacation to Florida , but you will retain the memory of the vacation . Which would you choose ? I think I 'd choose the latter because memories of past vacations pale in comparison with the actual experience in themselves . Recalling past vacations do not really bring me much happiness at all . <p> Chipka said , <p> @Peter . I think you have simply redefined experience as things a Rational like myself enjoys . I 'm an Idealist myself but I 'm friends with lots of Artisans and their definition of experiences would be things that are specific and concrete ( events as Jacob suggests ) that give lots of sensory input in the moment . E.g. Parties , skydiving whatever .

@@42287954 @2287954/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> One thing about craigslist and freecycle which can be quite frustrating is that about half the people are ( consistently ) flaky ! Come on ! If someone goes through the trouble of listing something for free and putting it in a bag for you to pick up and you say you want it , the least you can do , if you say you want it , is to actually come and pick it up , if not today , then tomorrow . Even worse , those that post under WANTED and get an offer and then flake out . <p> The problem is not only that but sometimes you have more than one person who wants something . You tell number one that he can come and pick it up , but he does not show . So you write a mail to number one and tell him he lost his chance and you 're giving the item to number two . This has never gone beyond three strikes for flakiness , but it is annoying trying to coordinate . <p> I have , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First , if someone posts something under WANTED , then rather than replying to the person , I post the item under OFFER . This gives others a chance too and it gives me a greater chance of actually getting rid of the item . <p> Second , if several people respond to me , I send out a mail to the first 3-5 persons giving them my address and telling them that whoever gets here first gets it . <p> Third , freecycle seems to be a fairly limited group of people . Therefore I tend to give preference to people I have successfully dealt with in the past . I tend to notice if they want something I have and then if they offer something that I am interested in , I will offer to bring them what they just wanted . This saves a car trip and makes everybody happy . <h> 24 users responded in " On dealing with flakes on craigslist and freecycle " <p> Put your phone number in the ad . If someone calls , tell them you will give them directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they say they are coming over , tell them you will hold the item for them for one hour . <p> Many times people will call saying they want to come look at it some other time . Be sure to tell them someone else may get it first . Never hold an item unles they are actually on their way . 90% of the callers saying they will come at a later date will never be heard from again . <p> Some tips : Always ask the caller if they are the one who called earlier . Of course nobody called earlier , but that way they will know there is demand for the item and they better hurry up and get it . Never change your schedule for a craigslister . Only schedule viewings when you will be home anyway and tell them they need to get there within an hour or you will be gone . <p> kate said , <p> I hear you , though I never tried it because I expected what you found out . <p> My lifestyle is a bit different than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off old house in a city in NE NY and a tiny cottage on some land in SW VT . <p> When I had some stuff to give away in VT , I put it out on my driveway by the dirt road , off a dirt road , off a dirt road , and wrote " FREE " . <p> I 'll know next time I visit if that works , and I 'll report back . <p> Kate <p> fern said , <p> I share exactly this beef with you ! but I do n't  call it " flaking out , " i call it rude and inconsiderate . <p> I keep a " hit list " of all those people who ever failed to show up when they said they would and wasted my time .

I 've gotten emails from others as well , but no one follows up . <p> I also had a set of encyclopedias I was giving away , I had no less than 5 people tell me they were ON THEIR WAY , and no one ever showed up . Thankfully , they finally were picked up . <p> On the other hand , I put up a laser disc player and several discs on Craigslist last month , and the first guy who responded showed up the next day and got them . <p> cache529 said , <p> I think sending out an email to the first 3-5 persons is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say 2 flaked out3 might still come by but only 1 person will get it , so two ( possibly 4 ) people wasted their time , gas , etc. and that 's not good .

But the stuff , which had to go in storage , has to be dealt with , fearlessly . i do n't  have the patience to deal with freecycle , i plan on donating to goodwill and revisit the 100 things challenge . i am on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fear ? you bet , but hey , its just a feeling . ( i should add i am by no means wealthy , money wise ; ideas , dreams = Very Wealthy. ) am going to lower the bar : earn under $15,000 next year . Best , Jane <p> I can totally relate to this . It is unbelievable to me how rude people can be when they are being given something they supposedly want for FREE ! <p> I have had better luck with FreeCycle than Craigslist when I offer something for free , but that may be because , in my case , the geographic region is more limited . The FreeCyclers usually live closer to me . <p> Anyway , what I do is this : I ask for a small time range within which the first taker will pick up . I tell numbers 2 and 3 that they are backups if #1 does n't  show . If #1 does n't  show within the time range , I immediately email #2 . <p> Still a pain , but I have managed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , <p> I agree with the person above who said your method was inconsiderate because it has several people potentially wasting gas . <p> We gave a lot of stuff away on freecycle , and there were some flakes . Giving people a time frame of one week saying " If you want this item , you must let us know when you can pick it up this week " reduced the flakes because people who do n't  do schedules will not write you in the first place . You can then give priority to the people who can come pick up the item soonest rather than the order in which you received the responses . If someone says they can come and get it that afternoon , then they win . If they do not show up , then you can pick whoever could make it next soonest . <p> Our local freecycle group requires you to post OFFER : ITEM ZIPCODE . This method makes it easier for people to prioritize by distance . <p> For large items like the cabinets and the encyclopedias mentioned above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of transporting the item . If you can transport it for them , then you are going to get rid of it sooner . When I was in graduate school , I had a Honda Civic . I wanted to pick up a chair on CraigsList that was $20 or something . It did n't  fit in my car so the chair owner who had a truck transported it for me. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I agree that letting people race for the things put all the cost on the counterpart(s) . I like the idea to give the things to the person who gives the earliest time to pick it up rather than the first one who responds . Then if he does not pick it up on time , I 'll give it to the person who gave the second earliest time and so on . I will start doing that from now on . <p> rePete said , <p> For freecycle , I add a line to the extent of how do you plan to use this . I then pick the " scholarship " winner after a 3+ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flake on me . <p> For craigslist , my filter is placing a line to include a phone number in the email reply . Again , the people who notice this detail usually stay in communication . <p> I found your website by accident today . Sometimes I believe maybe it was n't an accident after all . I am unemployed and I constantly look for ways to make money . We are debt free and have pared way down in what we do . I have found that it is not that important to have the things we thought we needed . <p> This is a sad commentary that you have to manage people who are flakes . I agree that placing X number of hours or it goes to the next one is a choice . The problem is there is no consequence to prevent people from flaking when it is free . Donate it and then there is no hassle ! <p> Oddly enough , in my experience on Craiglist Ive never had a problem . I 've probably sold about 20 things and I can actually say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a typical though . <p> Wan na guess what I sold that was the absolute easiest to get rid of ? A 30 year old set of very used twin mattresses . I sold them for $100 and could n't believe it . I must have had 5 different people fighting to be the first ones to get them . Unbelievable ! <p> Perfect timing for this post as I am getting ready to be nomadic and must pare down to what will fit in my vehicle . I was dreading the whole craigslist fiasco , but I have some great tips for handling it better now . <p> Diane said , <p> What I do so I do n't  have to make appointments is just say the stuff will be on the curb during such and such a time and leave the address . <p> Abie said , <p> I usually but some of these in my ads , " I do not respond to emails without a phone number .

My responses have dropped considerably but I enjoy flake free responses ( most of the time ) . <p> I have n't personally exchanged goods on Freecycle but I can see the frustration when someone backs out .

So you only deal with non-flakes based on their history .

Great post . <p> I like what you 've achieved here . Clearly your happy in your own way . I 'm thinking of going down a similar road however it seems that society in general does not condone retiring early and minimizing your life in terms of material consumption . For me its hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire at 65 and its hard to keep positive about it . Your blog really helps . Thanks Jacob . <p> You hear ethical/professional conduct bandied around in the workplace a lot and everybody strives to be fine upstanding citizens in the public forum but what do they do in the quiet of their own homes well the news headlines tell us . <p> Same stands for those that profess to eat well , work out etc the proof is in their appearance . I like your wording Jacob <p> people to encourage me on this path . It was probably six months or so later before I stumbled on ERE . And then MMM . And then , and then , and <p> Doug said , <p> I ALMOST agree with you . The exception would be when , without air , it is impossible to sleep at night .

@@42287959 @2287959/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I am sure you have all heard of the concept of reducing your number of possessions to 100 things . Why 100(*) ? Probably because it makes for a great book title or blog project of the " How I did X in a year " and then returned to my normal ways with a nice check from the publisher to boot . <p> X could be writing on your laptop using candle lights of some other silly project = <p> ( * ) Life would be much easier if humans had 8 fingers instead because it would make round numbers easily expressible in powers of 2 or 4 or 8 instead of 2 and 5 . Also , there would be more of them . Anyway <p> This may all be fine and well . Admittedly , there is a cult of minimalism and I like minimalism insofar that it makes a lot of my goals , primarily revolving around the concept of independence , a lot easier to accomplish ; however , in many cases there also seem to be some kind of oneupmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith " is certainly stronger than others . <p> From a practical viewpoint , 100 is just useful to inventory your possessions . However , there is not really much point to that unless you 're writing about your project . From a practical standpoint , it is far more important to consider <p> How much volume does your stuff take up ? <p> How much does it weigh ? <p> How much do you use it ? <p> Volume typically determines your storage constraints and to some extend your transportation constraints . There is a theory that houses have gotten stupendouslya word possibly derived from stupid , I 'm just guessinglarge because of the need to shelter all the junk we pull home from department stores . Shelter is really expensive , especially if you want to it in residential areas and want to keep your possessions heated or cooled to the same temperature as you keep yourself . <p> Weight is an issue if you are carrying it . It is also an issue if you live in a boat or in an RV . We live in a RV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means we can carry a few tons per person . If we had slide outs , our weight constraint could be surprisingly small ( after deducting allowances for water ( white , grey , and black ) : maybe a few of hundred pounds each ( including the weight of the person ! ) . This is because slideouts is a modern invention ( and therefore not a solid construction ) intended to convey the sense of space for a short vacation at the lowest possible price . By reducing cargo allowances , the RV can carry slideouts instead without increasing the size of the engine or the bulk of the frame . The same goes for wide beamed cruising boats . Lots of space , but not as safe as deep keels . <p> Usage is of primary concern to a financially sound ship . This enters in your personal return on asset calculation so to speak . How much have you paid for which you do not use ? In terms of saving and spending , economically and ecologically , if you have 101 items ( and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of hell , which presumably involves having pictures hanging on the wall or a stacks of papers scattered on your desk ) it does not matter if they are used regularly , do n't  take up much space , and do n't  weigh a ton(*) . <p> ( * ) Weight is actually a good proxy for environmental impact as well . With a few exceptions ( like laptop computers and hybrid cars due to simply offshoring the impact to a high tech factory ) the more it weighs , the much resources it took to make it , and the worse it is . <p> In addition , 100 items is a static number . Suppose you have 100 items your pair of pants is one of those items ( or is that two items ? ! ) wears out . Then you go and buy another pair . Now youve used 101 items . If you keep your list short simply by rotating things in and out does it really count , simply because you have not bought them yet ? From a strictly " religious " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the rules of minimalism . <p> It would defy the other points though . For instance , I could get rid of all my cookware and start eating out . This would reduce the number of things , but would that be a net benefit to my " business " of living to outsource all my assets like this ? For some reason , I think not , other than to adhere to some faith . <p> Now it may seem I am bashing this challenge . I am to some extent . For the most part though , it is probably doing more good than bad because it forces people to take a good look at what they really needed . It also minimizes shelter needs and makes transportation easier insofar that one of the items on the 100 list is not an oympic swimming pool or a lawn tractor . What I am bashing is the idea of putting a number on it and sensationalizing it . That is just nuts . <h> 17 users responded in " The 100 things challenge " <p> Interesting Back when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fictional work called The Gospel According to Larry about a boy who did exactly that ( vowed to own only a hundred items , rotating them out if needed ) . I was so inspired that I did it too I gave away all but a hundred items . Ha ha the really sad part my mom saw me giving my stuff away and became convinced that I was planning a suicide . How is that for consumer culture ? Anyway , I had no idea this was a mainstream idea , but its really funny to me that people are actually doing this . I always thought it was just some crazy phase for awkward twelve-year-olds . <p> Maus said , <p> I agree with Jacob that the number " 100 " is entirely arbitary . What I find fascinating in those whove written about this challenge is the range of emotions it induces . Some people seem to reduce the number of their possessions easily and without turmoil . Others agonize over each item and resort to convenient fictions such as that collections of books or CDs represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family heirlooms and photographs that exert a powerful sentimental grip for some . <p> To me , the usefulness of an item is the acid test . Over the course of a couple years , I realized that I favored certain items of clothing or kitchen utensils or reference books and rarely wore/used/read others . So , I unburden myself of the latter . I am also more confident in asserting my personal aesthetic , which favors fewer items of simple but extraordinary quality ala the Japanese notion of wabi sabi as opposed to collections of the sort that fuel Ebays devouring maw . <p> Then , too , there is a part of me and this is no doubt at the back of many minimalists minds that wants to experiment with the threshold between necessity and luxury . For example , I find myself wondering just how small a space I would consider minimally adequate . At present , I live in an 894 square foot house that is much larger than I need . But at the other end of the spectrum , the Tumbleweed tiny house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> Like any " ism " minimalism can become a competition subject to an orthodoxy , which I find unattractive . If it remains a means of personal exploration and expression , then choosing " 100 " as a starting point seems as valid as any other . <p> Love it , but maybe 100 is a good benchmark for people who do n't  yet know the answers to your three questions . The number forces them to answer the questions without having to guess , simply by prioritizing . <p> Separately , I love the idea that people can have a few tons of stuff each . What a cool world . I want my ton ! 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Yes , the arbitrary number is an impediment . For instance , if my idea of minimalism is to live in a small house on a plot of land and grow my own food , then the necessary seeds and storage bins would have a huge impact on the grand total . Or does food not count as a " thing " ? <p> Minimalism sounds great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious about stuff cluttering the desk . . or anything else . Its irrational , and I 'm ok with that = I 'm certainly not going to work towards unlearning my clutter-phobia . <p> But come on ! I do n't  want to count my stuff . Yes , I can count to 100 , but it seems so tedious . <p> Plus , sometimes I like to keep a few extras of some things around ( neatly organized and put away ) because I find them cheap and buy them in advance . I saw a post recently by someone who found really cheap toothbrushes and bought ahead . What a good ideathe last time I waited until I *needed* a toothbrush , I ended up forking over 3 euros . Never again ! 10151 @qwx420151 <p> When I first saw this challenge , I counted about 40 CATEGORIES of things I wanted , and most of them have far more than 2.5 things in them . I want more than 2.5 pieces of clothing , 2.5 dishes , 2.5 cooking tools , 2.5 books , and 2.5 knitting supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really , really do n't  want to . Frankly , I do n't  want to limit myself to 1000 things , either , though it would make inventory a lot easier . <p> Because most Americans have gone the other extreme , even just imagining this extreme is probably good for us . I like it as part of that philosophy of reaching for the stars and catching the moon . And having a specific number makes it clear just how little people really can live with . <p> @Rooster , good one ! I 'm pretty sure those are n't  the two digits he wishes people did n't  have , though . <p> I have never put a number to the things I own but the philosophy and as you say the point of getting people to look at their belongings is great . <p> I have been working hard not to accumulate things and get rid of older stuff . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Did n't  you hear ? The number is now down to 50* . <p> *Of course , he does n't  count underwear or socks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared family items . Actually I think the caveats in his list are as numerous as the list itself . It is really silly and self-promoting . <p> kate in NY said , <p> I love this post and the comments here . Ive been reading about the 100 things challenge for awhile , and noticing the adaptations : do n't  include the books because got ta have the books ; do n't  include things that other people use too ; do n't  count the items in a set , do n't  count the outdoor stuff .. It highlights the arbitrariness of 100 . <p> I 'm finding it best to simply stop acquiring things I do n't  really need to have . Over the past five years , I gave away all my guest bedroom furniture and an extra bed frame , all the extra lamps , extra dishes , etc , to people who lost everything in a fire . Thats kind of how I want to do it : have a situation come up that engages me . I expect to give away all my nice suits soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations . It just makes it all make more sense to me. 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Rooster Tape the pinkie to the ring finger ; that 's more like it . I like my opposable thumbs .

At one point I had a 5+ year supply . Very convenient . <p> Maus said , <p> @Simple in France , Jacob I had to chuckle .

@@42287962 @2287962/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Modern man has an endless fascination with productivity . There is always something that could be done faster or more effective . Productivity is not a natural state though . You do not see an animal trying to be more productive . It simply does its thing , takes what it needs and no more . Not humans , they always take more than they need or do more than they have to . <p> Does this derive from competitiveness with productivity leading to promotion ? If so , it is a tragedy of the commons . The reason is that productivity methods are soon copied by the competition and once that happens you have to work even harder to gain an edge . If you MUST stay employed , your productivity is compared on a scale relative to others , not relative to what you need . <p> If you 're retired and somehow managed to ditch the ugly notion of measuring your self-worth in terms of how much you spend , productivity becomes absolute . There is , then , a concept such as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am slowly discovering this . It took me half a year . Realize that I rarely do , or at least did , something I considered useless . Now I do things , like sailing , which can be considered useless just because I can . <p> In a sense this a form of wealth . Wealth is another word for " having more than you want " . Once this is the case , you can use the surplus on unproductive pursuits . With this changing perspective , all the talk about productivity suddenly takes on a different light . In such a case a fascination with productivity is associated with a world of poverty . A world where there is never quite enough to satisfy . Such a world is a stressful world , that is , a source of continuous low level stress . <p> Changing ones frame of mindand apparently it took me 6 months of retirement to jump a levelis a form of personal growth . I remember reading something similar in Emergency ( Neil Strauss ) : Having learned some serious survival techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly becomes much less important whether ones clothing is color coordinated or whether to use antique astroparch paper or glossy lasercopies for ones resume . <p> Priorities are changed . A former edge becomes unimportant . <p> Now , what 's important here is that once abundance has been achieved , edges transform from being relative to being absolute . Consider another " edge " , the edge of being remarkable . This is the celebrity edge of simply being known . Again , this edge is being used to stand out from the competition rather than as an absolute . The relative situation creates a continuous low stress environment compared to the absolute world . In an absolute world , striving to do things to be known becomes irrelevant ; you will be sufficiently known regardless of what you do . ( This is the situation that family members are in . You probably remember your family members from the 1980s but do you remember the popular stars of the 1980s ) . <p> Early retirement apparently works slowly to transform ones mental frame towards a more absolute level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps there are other ways but early retirement is one of them . <p> On an anecdotal note , I vastly prefer less stress to the low level stress that is present in most modern life . The stress I feel now is the " original " stress of a boat about to crash . Not the continuous stress of not being able to meet deadline after deadline . <h> 30 users responded in " Becoming less productive and less competitive " <p> I 'm glad you 're still posting great stuff even after retirement .

The classic example of the tragedy of the commons is the degradation of the western US grazing lands . Because the grazing was available to anyone who had a cow or sheep , the incentive was to use up the forage before someone else got it . If you reduced your personal use of the gazing resource to try to protect the resource , someone else would just go in and take it so you would end up having less income and the land would still be degraded . The federal government put a stop to the free grass early in the twentieth century but much of the marginal land has never recovered . <p> Perhaps another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere , if you as a concerned business reduce your emissions ( and increase your production costs ) while your competition does nothing and perhaps increases production and emissions ( because their production cost is now lower than your costs ) you have accomplished nothing except put yourself out of business .

Many things in FI are like that establish you goals , move forward and as new data becomes available make decisions that will surprise you . From different vantage points new information becomes available . A person with a lot of debt will have amazing reasons to justify their debt like how they are writing debt off their interest on their taxes etc So also be really clear about what you intend to accomplish and do n't  get caught in sophisticated mazes that are beyond our pay grade .

Now , the interesting thing is that you can have two myths which are superficially different but are still ( almost ) equally useful if they have the same underlying structure . <p> The ERE myth , is that if you work and save hard , you can retire in short order . This is a functional myth . It is a working theory that is different from the Middle Class myth , that is , if you work all your life , you can get to buy a lot of things at the mall . That is also a working theory . Now , the Middle Class myth produces a highly specialized worker that relies on consumption for all his needs . A worker that is subject to disruptions and at the mercy of the system , hence the focus on emergency funds and index funds , an ant utterly reliant on the continuing function of the ant hill ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of financial worry ? ! ) . The ERE myth produces a resilient generalist with several sources of income , the skills to create solutions that do not rely on money , and an environmental resilience that has a certain ascetic zen-like attitude . <p> Now , there is another myth that produces the same functionality as the ERE myth . The myth that the world is on a tipping point . I am not going to go into the details here . Either you believe it or you do n't  . I am also not going to give the reasons ; I 'm sure you have all heard them : global warming , peak oil , and overpopulation , the latter is sometimes euphemistically known as " food insecurity " . This is the real reason I am writing this blog , and so here I am essentially coming out of the doomer closet . I think that with ERE I have found the optimal solution .

Youre retired , go have fun , while everybody else keep on working to buy stuff and pay interest and dividends to you . Its a win-win solution . Alright , enough about my modest attempts at social engineering . Onto the dooming <p> I do not think a total collapse of the civilization of the developed world is far fetched .

We in the developed world are , essentially fighting nature , as we have run out of places ( other countries ) to conquer for resources ( the Middle East was just the last stand ) . Once , the costs of that become too high , complexity will collapse . Yes , the houses and roads and all that will still be around , but there will be no technological support to build new iPods by sourcing material from all around the world , etc . Consider that your ability to buy an iPhone relies on Apple being able to ship exotic minerals from many different countries , some of which are unstable , to China ( or where ever its assembled ) which is only possible due to a complex system of sourcing that relies on cheap energy , this only being possible from a continuous military presence in the Middle East . All this is very expensive ( and paid for by the government which takes its money either from workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans ) ) , and it has diminishing returns . In the future , a 100 years from now , once your iPod is dead , it will be repaired rather than replaced and once it is unrepairable , that is the end of the iPod experience . Forsooth , try to see if you can build a toaster from scratch . A bigger problem is that we have destroyed many of our local resources ( where are you going to mine the metal for the toaster ) . Hence , what will happen is a decentralization , an insourcing , a localization . The raw resources will be in reusing and recycling resources already in existence , that is , remaking . The future winning companies will not be companies that can create value based on brands , that is , on air or abstract dreams , information if you will . Such dreams ONLY exist if things like food , shelter , and conveniences are so established that people do not need to think about them . The same goes for scientific research . Scientists brains only function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really in a precarious state . Take away two generations of scientists and their instrumentation and future scientists will not be able to replicate the experiments in the papers . I 'm not kidding you ! Now , the future winning companies will be those who manage to solve the interface from information and back to reality : 3D printing , remaking , refashioning , and building things that are meant to be truly recycledmost recycling today is actually downcycling to an increasingly lower grade of material . The future " degrees " will be in construction and engineering . Not finance , marketing , brand building , etc . The difference between the two is that the former connects humans to nature ( something that is sorely lacking today ) and the latter connections humans to humans or rather humans to systems invented by humans . <p> ( * ) The period known as the Dark Ages was essentially the system dynamical solution to the collapse of the empire . We are talking technology that is easy enough for a small group of people to understand ( consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to develop a handful of genius scientists and the associated technologists ) . The only form of centralized control for a poor region is religion as this is the cheapest means to control ; the more expensive means of control are a central currency system and a government bureaucracy . <p> There is significant debate over just how fast collapses occur . The Roman Empire collapsed over a period of 50-150 years . This is slow enough for most people ( anyone younger than 70 ) not to notice . <p> What can you do ? <p> Stay on course . You need to liberate a significant amount of free time to reskill yourself . I have done that . <p> Learn something useful . By useful I mean something that you can do completely by yourself using locally available resources . I think watchmaking is moderately useful . A watchmaker can essentially build a watch from scratch . Building a computer , on the other hand , or anything electronic is practically impossible , However , learning to repair things , even computers , e.g. " marrying " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful . Any kind of contracting will be useful . If you prefer brainwork , consider design and architecture , that kind of stuff . If you prefer medicine , specialize in general practice rather than nose jobs . <p> Everybody will need to learn how to compost and garden . This is urgent . With the current methods of industrial agriculture , all the topsoil will be gone in about 80 years . Fortunately , it can be reformed rapidly with biointensive gardening ( in nature the process takes thousands of years ) . This is also more labor intensive . Expect to spend time in the garden every day . <p> Get in shape . The next few decades is really not the best time to develop diabetes , high blood pressure , or a body that is unsuitable for physical tasks or require constant hookup to the pharmaceutical industry to function . <p> Investments that will do well are real estate , renewable resources , and any kind of waste/recycling management . At least that 's where my money is going to be . Commodities will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prices will go up , then down , then more up , then not as much down , then even more up , etc. , a better bet might be commodity service companies , like drillers , etc . Consider retailers and consumer staples ( the sellers and distributers , not the manufacturers ) . Do NOT invest in long term debt ! Technology will be in a long term secular decline ( believe it or not ) . <p> How far are we ? That depends on your perspective . If you take the view from 400000km , humans are no longer going to the moon and have not been doing so for 40 years . From an energy perspective , the available energy/capita ratio peaked 30 years ago . Real wages have been declining for a good 30 years as well ( a connection ? ) . All signs point towards us winning over nature . Unfortunately , we have not figured out how to survive without nature and that is a problem of crucial importance . <p> On the other hand , we have experienced a technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm reluctant to include cell phones hereI do not think they have created much marginal business value , they have merely created the appearance of activity ; of course for the hoi polloi they merely act as a drain on funds for entertainment purposes . Its been 60 years since the last world wareverything since then has been local scale , essentially imperial policing or frontier battles with " unruly barbarians " , which incidentally are getting costlier and costlier ( its a question of extended supply lines ) . A solidified empire is safe from external threats . Many civilians in the empire today have never seen war . Longevity has been on the increase although there are now reports surfacing that our generation may be the longest living , in other words , our children are now less healthy than us ( they eat too much sugar and move too little ) and thus they will not live as long as we do . Of course , qualitatively speaking , the fact that people can now survive for a few years more while hooked into tubes and machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  . However , on another good note , the opportunities for entertainment are now more diverse than ever . It is fully possible to entertain yourself to death ; alternatively , keep playing and enjoying the consumer party and that " they " ( the very same people that are warning about upcoming trouble ) will think of a technological solution while the Titanic is steering into iceberg territory . <h> 54 users responded in " Myths and the future " <p> There is another alternative myth that achieves many of the same goals as ERE ( at least the anti-consumerist part ) . <p> Some years ago in watching some of the alternative television stations I sometimes watch ( LinkTV is one of them ) , I became pissed off at how people in third world countries work like slaves to make these things I own . So , I began to make it my goal NOT to give these companies my money . I bought my clothing 2nd hand because at least Goodwill , etc are trying to help people ( let 's assume they succeed sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socks because they are one of those things that is tough to buy 2nd hand . I found a company Decent Exposures that makes womens undergarments and where the women who answered the phone sounded so at peace so happy that I could tell it was a good place for her . <p> My husband and I tried to do more . We tried to build an Earthship which ran us into debt and for which we ran out of money and from which we have yet to recover a typical scenario for that endevour as we come to find out after the fact . <p> But still we live quite modestly on a very good salary ( not mine ) . I am learning not only permaculture , but how to get along with other people ( Nonviolent Communication NVC ) . <p> I have toyed with the idea of spinning cotton and learning to grow it here in Florida . But I have n't gotten there yet . Time is n't the issue ; motivation is . <p> We are starting with your blog as an inspiration to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that same husband having Lyme disease very expensive and tough to really cure especially given the misinformation out there about that disease . <p> Somewhere I need a Star Trek -like myth of hope in a future that will be alot better once the capitalists ravaging our planet are no longer in control . <p> when slightly off-topic and/or in a philosophical mood , some of the stuff on there might just blow your mind . There are some quite technical and hard to grasp posts on there which appeals to my inner <p> While over at NASA I took a gander at their Apollo mission pages , I have fond memories of watching the July 1969 landing at school ( we did n't  have a TV at home ) at about lunchtime they had dragged the great big set into the assembly hall . Either its me or we just do n't  have big stuff like that with the widespread buzz of some Really Interesting Stuff Going Down now . Then I looked at the timeline , and thought of Jacob ERE <p> JoeP said , <p> Thorium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved and cost effective recycling technology , space mining , and a decline in birthrates as GDP increases will prevent or minimize a collapse of civilization . And what really kicked off the dark ages was a drop in global temperatures that created a food shortage LONG ... <p> And a world wide distribution network coupled with the technology to keep food from spoiling will mitigate food shortage issues . I strongly believe in the ERE lifestyle to free ourselves from the invisible cage we have built . But I do n't  believe modern civilization will disappear unless we are hit by another killer asteroid . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287968 @2287968/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> You may be surprised to know that paying $10 for a $2 meal is not my biggest problem with eating out . Rather its the abundance of choices on the menu . I do n't  like choices . Why do I have to spend time reading a 10 page booklet to decide what to eat ? If I go out to eat I do n't  want to be faced with a multivariate analysis of which meal combo provides the best value in terms of price and enjoyment . Ideally I just want one binary choice : " Do I want to eat here or not ? " . <p> If I were a gourmand , I would probably appreciate choices , but I " m not , so I will specifically pick restaurants that make the choice for me . Little Caesars Pizza has essentially three choices on the $5 menu . They have other and more expensive pizzas , but all they some to do is to require more choice in terms of which topping to select and I 'm not paying for the mental anguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Chipotle . It has an assembly line with very few choices at each station . Subway also has an assembly line but it has far too many choices . How do I know I wont pick some horrible combination of condiments and additions ? I do n't  . So I stick to the easy solutions . <p> Sometimes , though , I have to go out to eat " somewhere nice " to appease DW or for social reasons , so what do I do ? I have found that every restaurant typically serves something called the " burger " or the " club sandwich " . Now I never know exactly what that entails , but I do know that every restaurant offer them . Thus by making the choice once and for all that " whenever I go somewhere , I order the burger " I have minimized the mental inconvenience of eating out . Problem solved . <p> If you think I 'm crazy think about how you would feel if your 401k plan only allowed you to invest in single stocks and required you to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick a stock at random but equally likely you would probably avoid investing altogether . This is how I feel about restaurant menu choices . I do n't  care about food performance , so give me my " index food " aka " the burger " any day ! <p> One tactic that 's helped me is to limit my reading to the appetizer and salad listand when possible to avoid the Cheesecake Factory and every other restaurant whose menu cant fit on a page . Anyway , there 's an inverse relationship between the size of the menu and the quality of the food and wine . <p> Chipotle is good and consistent though I have an ongoing problem with their loading cilantro into everything . Chipotle has been most excellent for my portfolio ! 10157 @qwx420157 <p> Jacob , so what do you do while Distinguished Woman and/or your other dinner social companions are yapping about the food choices for 15 minutes ? ; - <p> Sometimes I find myself in the position of having a dinner companion who wants me to order something that she would like to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will help her eat . At that point , I just give up and say " I 'll eat whatever you order . " Dangerous I know , but one needs to navigate through such minefields carefully . ; - <p> No matter how many choices are on the menu , I 'll just order the first thing that looks good . I 'd rather make a good decision quickly than the optimal decision after an exhaustive analysis . If its not that good , I 'll just get something else next time . <p> That 's funny how you guys hate choice ! My problem is I like to go to the same restaurants over and over again and then order my favorites ! I already know I like the restaurant and those specific dishes , so I do n't  want to " waste " my eating out experience on something that I might not enjoy as much . <p> And with Steves comment I 'm one of those women who is often guilty of " suggesting " to my husband what he should get ! Often he does n't  mind , but sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and get what he really wants . = <p> Its a pet peeve for me whenever there is an obligatory/work-related event where I have to eat out . I guess one cant alienate ones co-workers or the boss , but still , its a nuisance . I like your idea of ordering just one basic item I 'll start to try that ! <p> Jacob , on an unrelated note , I wanted to know if you invest all your money in the stock market ( whether through individual stocks or index funds ) or if you put a percentage in " risk-free " investments like bonds/T-bills . I ask because I have managed to save a small sum , and want to know how much I should put in an index fund ( as opposed to a bond/T-bill ) . Given a long enough time frame , wont an index funds returns always beat risk-free investment returns ( I 'm looking 15-yr ) , and does that mean the index fund is virtually risk-free ? <p> I would really appreciate your thoughts , and apologies in advance for the amateur-ish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Regards , Hannah <p> Amy said , <p> You remind me of the guy in a video we watched in health class in seventh grade .

As I am not a professional sandwich maker , why should I have to pick the items that goes on the sandwich . <p> There is no way I could pick the optimal toppings/dressing . I refuse subway , I go to Jimmy Johns . <p> Another bad thing is that a restaurant probably has upwards of a dozen things that sound good , and half of those are at prices that I 'm willing to pay .

It is not just fuel , it is an experience ! <p> " Variety is the spice of life !

How can a menu pose such a challenge ? <p> Wake up , smell the roses , and enjoy some of the finer things in life ( and that includes restaurant food ) . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Hannah Ideally I would , but currently the markets are just not that good . I invest mostly in individual stocks . I use indexes whenever dealing with individual positions becomes too cumbersome ( bonds , debts , foreign stocks ) . 15 years is not a long time for an index but it is a long time for an individual investor . There are periods where indexes have gone nowhere for more than a decade . For instance , the Dow Jones have gone nowhere for the past 8 years .

For instance , for many people poetry is a moving experience , but to me they 're mostly just words . Conversely , a coupled set of differential equations might be beautiful to me but to many people they 're just gibberish ( what is wrong with you people ? ? ? ; -P ) . I think I feel about food the same way many people feel about participating in sports . They 're content to jump on a stationary recumbent and that 's it . I 'm wondering why riding downhill at 35mph is a challenge , why standing up in the saddle and sprinting takes courage or why companies make baggy cycling shorts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are clueless and inexperienced . Pick this one and things will be alright . Same with food here . Ive thought about going to restaurants more often so as to remember how different food combinations work but I discovered that as long as I 'm not the one cooking I frankly do n't  care , so I stopped . <p> There 's a restaurant in a small town in Italy that I used to go to as often as possible . It would solve your aversion to eating out . There was no menu . You ate what they had that night , or you did n't  eat there . The food was always superb , and I simply loved eating there . Occasionally theyd have two different soups , so you had to choose between them . Otherwise , theyd just offer you each course : salad , antipasto , pasta , meat/seafood . You could refuse any given course , or stop eating anytime you wanted to . They did n't  even keep a formal tab . The proprietor simply decided what to charge you at the end of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a small cookie , but I rarely had room at that point . I loved having the decisions taken out of my hands and getting better food than even I could cook at home . ( I *am* a gourmand and a professionally trained chef , so that 's saying something . I chalk it up to superior ingredients . ) <p> Its a good thing that that restaurant is so far away now . I 'd be tempted to eat there all the time . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I always wondered why there are no restaurants offering only todays menu . I 'd imagine with the scaling such a meal could cost $2-3 in which case I 'd go there all the time . <p> Robyn said , <p> I have the same problem with cooking at home I have visions of being a great cook with quite the selection of indgredients , but I always default to the same few things I like . It works for me and I 'm at peace with this = Makes food decisions and grocery shopping painless so I can get on with the other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not something I like fussing over . <p> I can understand your reasoning perfectly here , its fascinating to think about since I share it in regard to investing , but not food . I 'm glad you like Chipotle , since its at least healthier than many places . I love eating gourmet vegetarian/vegan foods , but I hate the time it takes to make it all . I suppose our gourmet restaurant culture falls into the category of " unsustainable " its a product of a very evolved , complex capitalist society that can turn food into " culture . " But eating simply at home is better anyway . If you can be content with just rice , carrots , apples , broccoli and chic peas , I 'd even venture to say that 's all you even need to eat ( and some nuts and beans every now and then ) . <p> Charity said , <p> Interestingly , there was a short blurb on NPR yesterday morning about an Italian restaurant in New York that does the very thing Kate described . They have a different Italian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <p> My husband is the same way . He looks all over a menu , can take about 10 minutes but in the end he orders Chicken Alfredo . At least you realize you 're doing it hubby does n't  even notice he does this . I as a good wife never mention he does it . <p> I am a foodie , and I firmly believe that the more choices a restaurant has on its menu the less good it is . You see this a lot on Ramsays Kitchen nightmares pretty much the first thing he does is slash the menu back to a dozen or so dishes total . <p> The best meals I have had ( in all price brackets up to two Michelin stars and all countries from US to Argentina to France to Thailand ) have been from places with little or no choice . <p> If the chef does n't  know what is good and have confidence in it , I do n't  want to eat there . <p> terri ann said , <p> Jacob , I love your blog and book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthinking the act of ordering food ?

I enjoyed this article and the comme to that followed . Not liking choice seems weird to me . I do enjoy eating out and trying new things . But I see the benefit in choosing a cheap meal and stick to that . My fav meal to order is Seafoodlatter but now I might try to change down to something simpler and cheaper . Theres value in that <p> RG1 said , <p> Most people who eat out seem to have particular dishes they order , like kids who go out for chicken nuggets and fries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curry chicken , and every restaurant has some mediocre version . Then there 's rice paper rolls . My primary goal in eating out is to try something different , which means I like to eat with a lot of other adventurous eaters . If we order 5 different unusual dishes , I 'll find something worth making at home . examples : harissa , pomegranate molasses , Turkish fried eggplant , green papaya salad , Burmese tea salad , spinach chaat , Spanish style potato omelet , paprikash , larb . It helps to eat the real version first rather than trying to follow a recipe without knowing what the goal is. 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287970 @2287970/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> After several years of resisting , I have come to the conclusion that sport can teach us about life at least as well as any philosophy class . More if we use it to grow rather than solely focus on winning . Sport then becomes process-oriented rather than goal-oriented . When something is goal oriented , the end is more important than the means . When something is process-oriented , the means are more important than the end . It is the improvement of the means that improves you as a person whereas achieving ends is only good for receiving awards , improving your resume ( as opposed to yourself ) , and making goal-oriented management happy . <p> Being exclusively goal-oriented means that sometimes short-cuts are taken to achieve the end . This can result in defective products . Goal-orientation is about quantity , not quality . If quality requirements are instituted as a goal , one can be almost sure that the product will be designed to exactly those specs but no more . Goal-orientation is typical of the games man attitude . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( after all , the winner gets a t-shirt ) the pick-up games are very process oriented . You do n't  get complimented so much on the number of goals you score as how you score them . Top shelf , point shots , and fancy stick handling get compliments . Shoveling in garbage , that is , getting a puck in when it rebounded from the goalies pads , get less respect . Hence most people there are process-oriented looking more for the perfect move or the perfect shot and assisting each other in doing that than scoring points . <p> I have noticed that while some people use the warm-up to skate around , stretch , and fire some random pucks off at the goalie , other people methodically practice their weak spots . Its about fifty-fifty . However , while the former group has not seen much improvement , at least during the 1.5 years I have been playing there , the latter group is getting better and better . <p> Improvement in a technical sport like hockey(*) does not happen gradually . It happens in steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing and playing with no apparent improvement . Suddenly you " realize " or you finally " get it " and your entire game takes a step up making you markedly better . This step is almost instant . Then you plateau again while consolidating and using what you just realized . I think the difference between those that practice methodically and those that just " play " is that the former do not hold back from trying new things whereas the latter are happy just doing what they already know . While both groups are process-oriented , one group plays mainly to have fun while the other group plays mainly to get better . <p> ( * ) I have done swimming , running , bodybuilding , power-endurance ( kettlebells and clubbells ) , table tennis , and karate , and hockey is by far the most difficult of them all . BTW I 'm contemplating picking up kendo . Well see how that goes . <h> 1 user responded in " Is being process-oriented better than being goal-oriented ?

Next to housing cost , transportation costs are the second biggest source of expenses . <p> The average American spends 18% on his income on transportation . <p> That is 0.18+12=2.1 months a year of work . That is a lot of time that could conceivably be used for something better . <p> Assume he also spends an hour daily in his car commuting , then that is 250 hours a year , assuming 250 working days . That is 1/8 of the working day on top of the working day . Hence , that is 12/8 = 1.5 month in addition . <p> In other words almost 3 months a year goes into being able to drive back and forth from work . Hence if you would otherwise calculate 6 years until retirement , then if you own a car , you will only be able to save 9/12 as much , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two additional years . Correspondingly , if you calculate 12 years until retirement , then you are really looking at 16 , or four more years . Conversely , if you were otherwise looking at 16 years , then giving up the car will reduce your " sentence " to 12 years . <p> Not owning a car is therefore an extremely helpful measure towards early retirement . If you want to retire extremely early , it is almost a prerequisite . <p> Not owning a car comes with other benefits . First you will save money on exercise . Driving your car over to a gym to run at a treadmill and then drive back again is inefficient at best . If you ran or at least walked or biked to and from work not only would you save the money for the car . You would also save the money for the gym . I know that very many people past college age completely ignore their level of fitness . It seems like a degree and a career also serves as a ticket downhill the path of physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will be sad to sit on the couch all day due to lack of " energy " . Commuting under your own labor is a great way to avoid this . <p> I am not especially talented in the physical department , yet I would consider it normal to , without preparation and prior training other than your daily commute , to be able to run 10 miles , walk 30 miles , and bike 50 miles . Yet many think these numbers sound insane . This suggests a large chasm in terms of frame of mind between a driver that gets around using gasoline and a walker , a runner , or a rider that get around under his own power . <p> Walkers easily go 4 miles by foot . Drivers get in their cars to get from one side of the parking lot to the other . Neither quite understand why the other is so crazy , when it is so easy too <p> So this is directed to those who are still attached to their cars . Once you get off of your addiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without it too . Yeah , I do n't  know how I manage live without being addicted to cigarettes , but I actually feel pretty good about it . As with all things the most trouble usually comes when you try to do things the new way by thinking in the old way e.g. " it is so hard to walk 2 miles to the supermarket because I need a cup of cream for this recipe and I do n't  have any " what a terrible life to live . You will automatically plan ahead for these things so the problem will never appear . Conversely , a walker in the city will not have to stand and wait 15 minutes for a bus that is going to move him 10 blocks . <p> But what about the children they need They need to live close enough to their school so they can ride a bike or walk or take the bus . Good habits are best started early . Consider a trailer bike . Consider walking them to school or at least to the bus . When I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my mom walked me back and forth for the first year . When you are retired , you will have time for this it is a meaningful thing to do ! <p> At least , in my opinion , better than working for more years so you can drive them back and forth in a van . <p> Now , if you are good with cars or motorcycles , there is an alternative . It is possible that you may buy " fixer-uppers " and resell them to recover most of your transportation costs . This is an enviable position to be in . For most of us , we will have to get a bike or take the bus . <p> Incidentally , has anyone managed to procure a bicycle for free yet ? <p> Jacob comments further : <p> Car ownership has at least the following costs . Some may not have all the costs . <p> Depreciation , leasing , or debt servicing costs . Leasing or debt servicing costs are relevant if you do not own your car outright . If you own your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become relevant . For instance , $12000 for a car that lasts 10 years comes to $100 a month . That requires $30,000 in extra savings . <p> Gasoline and insurance . These are unavoidable if you want to drive your car anywhere . <p> Opportunity costs from sitting behind the wheel when you could be exercising . <p> Health costs or lack of energy from lack of exercise . <p> Buying into an unsustainable model . Oil is not going to last forever . The IEA , which is the most optimistic kid on the block , predicts permanent decline from 2020 onwards . Drivers will likely get priced out of the market ( if a market indeed still exists , oil holding nations may simply decide not to sell anymore and importing nations may lack the resources to secure these resources by force or they may simply fight each other ) . In 11 years it would thus be unwise to have grown physically , mentally , and economically accustomed to $3 gasoline as this will not be available . Note this horizon is slightly longer than extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Green house gas emissions . The US uses 25% of the worlds oil and about a quarter of that goes to transportation . Global warming is now considered a virtual certainty and it is considered extremely likely that humans are a contributing factor . The implications of global warming are enormous . Taken with the International Energy Agencys scenarios around 70% of all species could go extinct within the next 100 years ( We already lost 20% over the last 100 years ) . Of course the horizon here is 20-100 years which is even longer . <h> 78 users responded in " Day 7 : Going car free " <p> My husband and I used to have only one car . We are both in the military and his job required him to work at a remote location , where there were no houses or towns for about 30 miles . I rode my bike to work daily and enjoyed it .

But my point is not everyone can get rid of their car . <p> Steve in W MA said , <p> Jacob , you are into hockey .

I have a pick-up actually . The only reason I have not gotten rid of it is because half a dozen times a year it comes in handy to have a pickup and because I figured maybe one day I could get a camper shell and live in it . I suppose I should get rid of it but the thought of buying a car someday is unappealing to me . Also , I think the cost of insurance is less than what it would cost to rent a pickup from time-to-time . <p> more about how moving toward active forms of transportation can save you money , I recommend this article from Early Retirement Extreme . Actually , that site on the whole offers a wealth of knowledge on how <p> I have n't followed most of your advice , including the " lose the car " part , but my wife and I have successfully managed with only *one* car ( a light PU ) for the past 6 months , and the impact on our savings has been delightful . The contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month we returned the lease-car . Between the two , our outgo decreased by over $800/month . <p> I now bicycle the 5.8 miles to work , and I hope to get a job even closer in a few weeks . I 'm hoping that I do n't  end up having to get a job that requires me to get another car . The 5.8-mile trip is pretty pleasant for 10 months of the year , but here in Dallas , we tend to get ice on the bicycle paths , which I will not brave . But the bus ( although it takes longer than biking ) is only $65/month , and will do for those two months when biking is unpleasant . <p> Lolonymous said , <p> Getting rid of the car really is the BEST step to take in terms of financial health .

Ive been systematically ridding myself of unneccessary items like my car for the past 2 years .

As a skinny bean-pole kinda guy ( 511 " 140lbs ) ive caught some comments from youngish idiots such as " eat somthing ! " or " whatchu lookin at " but only when i 'm fairly clean cut . When i let my hair and beard come in for that fresh from under the bridge look nobody messes with me at all of course women tell their kids to stay away from the strange man ! Anyway my point is it is possible to adjust the amount of attention you draw to yourself with a little thought . Women by their very nature draw more attention then men , period i wont argue that at all . To make it worse they draw the attention of men who by their nature are more forward and vulgar ( on the surface anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce their chances of a unwanted encounter by down playing the things that make them stand out as a woman sucks i know but just a thought .

I was 17 years old , slender , shy , and extremely modest in my attire . I had on a light quilted jacket as it was a brisk spring day . <p> A car full of young men threw something at my back , and roared off laughing . Whatever it was , hit me hard enough to knock me down on my hands and knees in the ditch , and took the wind right out of me . When I got up , I thought I 'd been hit by a bird , because there was something that looked like wet feathers inside my sunglasses .

Nothing I could have done differently except not be a young woman walking to work would have prevented this from happening to me . <p> The nice lady laundered my jacket , bandaged my knees and hands and drove me to work . About an hour later , she came down and delivered my jacket . <p> About three weeks later , I was riding my bike to work , and a car full of young men ( different car , but could have been the same young men ) went by and the passengers both slapped me in the butt . The second hit knocked me and the bike into a ditch .

@@42287973 @2287973/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Consumers are widely recommended to contribute around 15% of their paycheck to a retirement plan . The question whether to pick a ROTH IRA or a traditional IRA does not have a definite answer . For instance , it depends on whether ones future retirement income is expected to in a higher tax bracket ( ROTH ) or a lower tax bracket ( traditional ) , or whether one intends to live in a state with no income tax but high sales tax ( traditional ) or vice-a-versa ( ROTH ) . Finally it depends on any future changes to the tax laws ( 25% sales tax , anyone ? ) , so it is a difficult question which many experts have weighed in on . <p> For extremely early retirement , it is a lot simpler . Undoubtedly extreme early retirees will have learned to minimize their expenses to a level comparable to poverty . This means we get all the tax benefits of the poor while having lots of money . <p> Extremely early retirement planning thus falls in three stages . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maximize traditional IRA or 401(k) contributions and put the rest in taxable accounts . Personally , I have a 401(k) and a traditional IRA . I will likely open a high-deductible HSA plan soon . I also have a HSA . I am not getting a ROTH IRA , yet . The taxable accounts should carry one from early retirement age ( 30ish ) to 59.5 which frees the tax-sponsored plans from early withdrawal penalties . <p> Once retired one will likely drop several tax brackets down to paying no taxes at all . Given a small income ( * ) , I currently estimate from eyeballing the standard deductions on a 1040 that a single should be able to make $12,250 ( twice for couples ) before paying anything in taxes ( standard deduction + IRA + HSA ) . Since any extreme early retiree worth his or her salt can live on less than that , the excess can be spent to convert a traditional IRA into a ROTH IRA tax free . <p> Once reaching 59.5 , this money can be taken out of the ROTH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken out of the HSA and spent on non-health without penalty . <p> ( * ) A small income allowing one to take the deductions should not be too hard to come by presuming that one stays active . For instance , I saw an advertisement to lead a group of rookie cyclists on a Saturday tour , there 's dog walking , news paper routes , sign spinning ( ha ! ) , etc . The more ambitious might opt for freelancing and consulting . <p> Using FIRECalc , I note that I now have enough money in my taxable accounts to sustain myself for 60 years after which I intend to be dead forever . However , I fully intend to take advantage of the above scheme to escape some capital gains tax . <p> Thank you for being a continued source of inspiration and lowering the bar : ) My goal is to be out of the 8-5 by this summer . My No . One retirement plan is to not require much cash I was down to $1,300/month &amp; now have a new challenge of $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard could it be to make that amount of money and not touch capital ? I can taste the freedom of Time to pursue hobbies with a personal value ( carpentry , gardening , cooking , the list goes on &amp; on ) = RICH life . <p> Several nits to your three stages : 1 . I cant think of a reason why you would n't want to get yoself into a Roth IRA early and often . Since you can always withdraw your *contributions* to a Roth IRA ( early and w/o penalty ) , there really is n't any reason why you 'd want to keep what you could contribute in a taxable account instead . Contribute now , enjoy tax-free income inside the Roth IRA , and if you need the money pre-59.5 , you can get at it w/o penalty . Now , if you 're looking to use your IRA contrib for a deductible account , that 's a different equation , but I did n't  get the impression that your earned income was low enough to make deductible IRA contribs. 2 . Couldnt tell here whether you intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , you wont have the option of making a deductible IRA contrib ( or any IRA contrib other than rollover conversion " contributions " ) The figure I 'm working with is $8950 , standard deduction plus personal exemption . Could you line item your $12,250 for us ? 3 . You really do n't  have to worry about W-2ing to fully offset your deduction &amp; exemption(s) . Taxable investment income can soak it up just fine , and if not your IRA to Roth IRA rollover conversion will take care of the rest ! <p> Thanks for the link to retiresyd , I 'll be grilling her with some Qs soon . ; - <p> Your paper delivery suggestion is genius ! You get to bike *for* work ! <p> You 're only going to live to your 90s ? I 'm gunning for triple figures ! Just had my last grandparent pass away at age 99 , so the trend is good . Well see how the parentals do en route the century mark . <p> It is wrong to take advantage of public services to which you do not contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also something wrong with shirking productive work for the sake of selfish pursuits . If you insist on not working for money , while also having significant wealth , you are CHEATING the system . Your wealth should be taxed instead if you are n't  going to work and you are n't  going to spend your money either . Do you see how you are effectively stealing the work of others ? We work hard , pay our taxes , and then are forced to share the resources with you , who strives to do as little work as possible and pay virtually no taxes . Wrong . Wrong . Wrong . Take a job with some hippie non-profit and pay your share of income taxes at least ! Then you talk about minimizing estate taxes ? Why ? Youll be dead . Recognize all of the great benefits you got from being the USA and how the lifestyle you strive for was facilitated by the safety , security , capitalism , and freedom provided by the tax dollars that you never contributed ! I 'm curious to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @jane Making $1000 a month ? I 'd say about 25 hours or maybe 2-3 days of work . I have also thought about volunteering for room and board , for example joining the crew here http : //www.seashepherd.org . Not sure how DW would appreciate that idea , but I find it rather exciting . <p> @steve 1 ) as far as I understand I can put my $4000(2007) limit in either a ROTH or a Regular IRA . Contrary to popular opinion scientists do n't  make a lot of money . I make about as much as a long-haul trucker except that I also pay rent . Until recently DW worked as a grad student ( they get paid even less ) . DW could take full deduction and I could deduct almost all of my IRA contribution . But of course , if our AGI was $103k I would go for the ROTH . 2 ) Yup , 1040 , lines 25 , 32 and 40 for an individual . 3 ) I think I need a W-2 income to contribute to the IRA .

Unfortunately it was in the wrong city , but the job involved leading a group of fitness ( no hammering ! ) cyclists for a fitness ride every Saturday . <p> @adfecto I guess you 're a socialist = ( I never would have suspected that ! ) . What I see is how the government effectively steals my work and how it has been doing so for many years . Robbing is perhaps a better term since I would be going to jail at gun point if I refused to pay taxes . If there was an option to pay 0% taxes and then pay per use , I would take it ( if I could please have the $50k+ I have paid in taxes so far back ) . It is not like these services would not exist ( if there was a demand for them ) if there were no government . The government just takes the money from productive people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is efficient this is true by definition ( I do support tax for externalities like pollution and defense ) . Well , this atlas shrugged . Actually one of the great benefits I get from being in the USA is in paying for less in tax than I would in Europe . People are economically freer in the US . <p> Seriously , I do n't  see the problem for those that can achieve it to take advantage of what options we give them in the US . He s not doing anything illegal or immoral . <p> It does seem best that Early Retirees would use their time to do things beside serving themselves and I suspect Jacob will and is already . Someone who has the discipline &amp; knowledge to become retired at a very early age , will go quite crazy doing nothing . <p> Also , I do n't  remember reading anywhere that anyone is required to pay taxes when their income is low , no matter how they earn that income . <p> BtwJacob , thanks for the blog . I find it interesting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early , since I 've chosen to have a big brood instead . But I find inspiration to reach for my own early retirement ( 65 ? ) just by reading . I do n't  know yet when I 'll retire as I 'm working on stupid debt instead but thanks for giving me ideas anyway . 10157 @qwx420157 <p> Adfecto , are you or are you not a True Born Son of Liberty ? There is nothing more American than resisting , opposing , avoiding , and minimizing taxes that 's how it all started . ( And notice " evading " is not on the list no lawbreaking required . ) Taxes , either when assessed or paid , are neither moral nor immoral . Have you looked at USC Title 26 ? If so , have you ever seen anything more convoluted ? Your mission , should you choose to accept it , is to pay as little tax as possible , and strain the " system " you apparently love until it breaks . Maybe then you 'll vote legislators into office who will unscrew the tax code . Until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Title 26 . <p> I understand the point that Jacob is adhering to the letter of the law . I am not a socialist , but I do adhere to a philosophy that we have a responsibility to our friends , neighbors , and countrymen , and paying taxes is a part of that . <p> I see nothing wrong with a person paying only their " fair share " of taxes . I just think we may define what is fair differently . <p> In a perfect utopia I 'd support the Libertarian ideals to limit government and depend on individuals to always do the right thing . The problem is that in reality individuals are happy to trounce on the rights of others and ignore the common good . Schools , police , roads , libraries , etc are items that absolutely benefit the common good and it is your duty to pay for these services . The environment and defense are areas that require federal oversight as well . Even if you do n't  use these services directly they provide a broad lift to our entire populous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the issue of tyranny of the majority . What that means is that rural areas would never get phone service and electricity . Cyclists would never get bike lanes ( since most people drive cars , right ? ) . Corporations would run unchecked to discriminate , commit accounting fraud , violently put down unions , and ignore the safety of workers . OSHA , SEC , FDA , EPA , FAA , DoE , FEMA , NASA , HUD , FHA , FDIC , etc all of these agencies and organizations do good things ! These responsibilities are not easily replicated by the private sector . Left unchecked the little guy would get squashed . Bureaucracy is expensive but it is sometime still the best way to do important work . <p> Moving to a pay for service model would certainly cause many people slip through the cracks , not to mention how it would hurt social mobility and the equality of our society . Do you want to deal with a police officer that is paid by general tax revenue or a neighborhood vigilante group ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will douse the flames ? Liberty is about having the power to affect change and not about making sure you do n't  pay for a library you do n't  personally use . <p> My mom taught me to share my birthday cake with all of the other kids even if they did n't  bring a present to the party = <p> It is difficult to quantify the right amount of taxes but I have my ideas . To make it short and sweet , everyone pays according to their means ( wealth AND income ) but not according to the skill of their CPA or CFP. 10157 @qwx420157 <p> Adfecto , I wo n't bother to engage you politically on this matter . You believe what you believe ( for now ) , as do I. But let 's at least sort out a few things : * most schools , most police , most roads , and most libraries get funding mostly not from Federal income tax * in your list of 3- or 4-letter guvmint agencies , you seem to have omitted one : IRS * you say that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when it comes to effecting change , actions speak and words sometimes come along for the ride <p> If you believe in payment according to means and in effecting change to support what you believe , then why not take action rather than talking about it ? The most effective way for you to so effect this change is to join us : arrange ( legally ) to exploit every loophole you can find in the IRC . I 'm neither a lawyer nor a financial professional of any sort , and I am able to easily zero out my federal income taxes at very little time cost to myself . I know of no better way to get something done than to lead by example and see who follows . How many people have to exploit the IRC before lawmakers get the picture and unscrew the code ? I 'd prefer them to scrap the whole gig and start over , but well see what they come up with in the way of incremental changes . So , how do you wield your liberty ? What actions do you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means ? ( I politely and in good faith suggest that your lecturing on morality has very little effect at all . ) <p> Does extremely early retirement HAVE to mean living off a small income ? <p> Not if my experience is any guide : that is , not if you 've praciced " extremely rewarding income-producing investment activities " in the oh , let 's say 7 years leading up to your planned " extremely early retirement " date . <p> Is the goal to reduce your expenses to the point that it takes very little income to support yourself ? Personally , I want to maintain a particular lifestyle in retirement that provides choices . I travel now and wish to continue traveling in retirement . More importantly what do you plan to do in retirement ? <p> AlexOliver said , <p> @AJC : the " Extreme " part of ERE refers to the time it takes to reach Financial Independence ( be able to survive off your assets ) . ERE : 5-10 years , ER : 15-30 years , R : 40+ years . You could live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are FI , and still be ERE . <p> @krantcents : The goal is to reach FI at the earliest possible moment so one does n't  have to work if one does n't  want to . You have to weigh your values ; if traveling in " retirement " is more important to you than quitting your job at the earliest possible moment , by all means include it in your budget and work longer to save for it . <p> Jacob is retired already , he spends his time sailing and practicing martial arts and stuff . <p> AlexOliver said , <p> @Steve : " Affect " is correct in the original sentence . Affect=verb , effect=noun . <p> JJ said , <p> Adfecto , you say it well , and I 'm inclined to agree . We are all in this together , regardless if it benefits us individually/monetarily at a particular point in time or not . I 'm fine with paying taxes . I just wish the loopholes would be closed ( especially for large corporations ) and the tax code simplified . <p> Very interesting blog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to reduce economic dependence , that is , the need to consume the products of others to nearly zero to become as resilient as possible in the face of peak oil , peak water , and climate change . This is something that will affect all of those who are still alive 20-50 years from now . Financial independence is the first step towards this . FI is also a good starting point for travel . For instance , I can travel whenever I want to without considering whether I have vacation time or need to be back for work . I could even relocate for extended periods . Say I wanted to travel to France . In this case , just cancel the home/lease , buy a ticket and off you go . It will cost far less this way without all the constraints of an earn-spend worker/consumer . <p> Britz said , <p> @Adfecto : I completely agree with you , and well stated and replied . Trying to get out of paying tax is completely immoral and parasitical , unless you do n't  use societys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's your thing . ( Btw. , Steve Austin : Trying to force changes in the system by parasitical sabotage neither seems moral nor efficient . ) That is obvious but is gets less obvious if one tries to evaluate how much we actually contribute to society compared to how much we drain from it . If you have a huge salary , you might be paying huge taxes and buying stuff ( redistributing the money ) , but is your work input really worth that salary ? For instance , I 'm not always sure that mine is and would be happy to have 2/3 or even 1/2 of my salary . In fact , I really doubt that many people actually contribute anything close to what they take in fact , our riches are temporarily inflated by parasitically sucking our environment dry of value ; when oil , minerals , biodiversity , unpolluted ecosystems etc. are gone , than the balloon might burst , leaving us in free fall . Maybe too bleak , I 'm not sure : its hard to see past the indoctrinated ( but ridiculous ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you live in super-frugal mode , then you will be taking much less from society than most : your resource use will be less ; you will not be ripping up asphalt with a car to the same degree ; and so on . Another thing to consider is that tax laws might not be fair but they should , if your society is not ruled by corruptness , reflect to some degree the morals agreed on by society . Thus , if you happen legally not to pay taxes , then this may in a weak sense be morally valid in your society . However , that is very different from actually trying to avoid taxes which is perfectly immoral . Of course , though , one should try to be guided by stronger morals than these watered down and practified ones . <p> Traditionally , the retired are exempt from moral obligations to contribute : the idea is that they have already contributed enough . EREs are in a different category : they have not paid the same amount of taxes , mortgage payments , utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor have they worked the same hours . However , are these sort of metrics really useful ? To me , they show how our present societies catastrophically focus on the wrong things . I am convinced that many , perhaps most , people live their working lives without contributing any net value : you have come up with a new ad campaign or Igadget ? Whoopee ! That 's no net contribution . To make things worse , the our system itself requires far too much , so even if you are doing good , then it might be that that good should be superfluous . Eg. , if you are a road worker , then you might be doing net good building roads , but those roads shouldnt have nearly as much ravaging traffic on them in the first place in fact , those roads shoud perhaps not even be there . Another example : you are a doctor or policeman and are doing net good in society but it would be even better if people were less sick and/or poor . <p> One conclusion is that normal peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work sphere , and that is no different for EREs . Whether one is ERE or not , one should try to contribute . <p> Finally , if you do intend to leech on the system by living super-frugally but still using public services , then that is bad but it is a miniscule evil compared to the HUGE evils of the super-rich and of big companies that pay next to nothing compared to their leechings . No excuse for tiny leeching , but people tend to rant at welfare mothers ( the unfair cliche ) and ignore yeah , even defend and glorify the real criminals . <p> Jan said , <p> Your 50,000+that you have contributed covers your education , Jacob . Dorms , libraries , professorsactually , it probably did n't  . What about the library , police and probably internet that you use that you do not contribute towards by paying taxes . A flat tax of 10% on everything for everyone . That is the best way to go . <p> Your net input/output from society is a lot more complicated than just the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> What about net pollution ? The number of animals you have killed in your lifetime ( indirectly through meat consumption ) ? The number of workers exploited by your consumerism ? <p> You can argue that by not working you are allowing another person to have a job in this very scarce job market . With 7 billion+ people on earth now , and with technology making human labor ever more unnecessary , paid labor is something harder to come by . <p> And what about having children ? Is that a net contribution or are you contributing further to overpopulation ? I always hear arguments of how other peoples children will be contributing tax payers in the future . Can they guarantee that ? Have their children been given WIC , will the children grow up to be entrepreneurs or criminals ? WIll they grow up costing society more or will they be net producers ? <p> In my opinion , we should not measure ourselves by how much we contribute because chances are none of us are contributing anything . We are all damaging the earth we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all net takers from this system . By mindlessly following the consumerism culture of the last few decades or so , we are destroying the earth at a remarkable pace . <p> Sorry for the long comment , I enjoy your blog a lot Jacob . I hope you can keep it up for a long while . <p> Freeyourchains said , <p> I have a concern about differing Incomes and achieving Early retirement Extreme while maximizing my 401(k) and IRA . <p> I know the simple solution is to continually try my hardest to increase my income from saying $60k to $120kbut this is getting extremely difficult to do as the country progresses to get worse while appearing to be getting better . More and more high paying professional jobs are laying off workers , and not creating jobs . ( NASA , BOEING , Defense , Energy , Technology , Electronics , Manufacturing , etc . ) Even Google will lay you off after around 5 years of successful work . ( at which point such a high salary and high savings rate should ERE you anyway if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the numbers a few times . Yes , you save considerable amounts of money on your taxes by maximizing the retirement accounts , however ; I do n't  believe you 'll have enough left over to put into taxable accounts to ERE in less then 10-15 years . ( assumptions : if you only continually make $60k a year , with even a 3% increase every year ; with high transfer fees , ( 401(k) fund fees ) and no company matching or pensions ever given . Time to switch my job ? ! ! ! These kind of offerings are becoming more popular for small to mid businesses and hiring , so they can maximize profits . ) <p> $23,500 a year invested into 401(k)/IRA is great , but not accessible until age 59.5 without penalty . ( at least 60% of your friends might have died by then , a different concern ) <p> Only $8,000-$15,000 a year left over to invest in a taxable account is not so great for early retirement extreme . Though any increase in salary income will increase this amount considerably and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ! <p> There is also the " 5 year Grace Period " restriction on withdrawing from traditional IRA accounts ; plus no ability to access any earnings in traditional IRA , that must be taken into consideration too . <p> In order to retire in 10 years from say age 25 , on only making $60k/year it seems much harder to comprehend your guidelines , with the simple " maximize " your 401(k)/IRA . Especially with the governments intention for everyone to work your whole life , then retire around 67 years old or longer . <p> Should i spend my energy trying to make more money , automate and make passive my maximizing 401(k) investments , then diversify anything left in taxable ? Or invest straight away into taxable into say dividend growth investments , retire extremely early in 10 years or less with no age or " grace period waiting " restrictions , with 0% taxes from a lower tax bracket , and have my growing earnings cover all my frugal expenses for an extremely early retirement life ? <p> Denise said , <p> Hey Britz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you on the idea behind , and the practicality of taxes , particularly as they apply to the ERE concept . To add to that , I like to think what I do benefits society , and it does , I 'm able to improve our infrastructure and living spaces . Yet I often wonder how much of it we actually need . If folks were to re-think infrastructure , we could be incredibly more efficient . Speaking of asphalt , I make projections on asphalt values and how many trucks , of certain axles , can use a facility before a certain grade of repaving must be done . If people knew how much corporations utilize infrastructure , versus how much taxes corporations paid and how much we pay for maintenance , things would be different . Cool post . I graduate in Dec and May and just started working full-time ; my plan is to retire in 8 yrs . Long live ERE . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287977 @2287977/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> I think that in many cases a college degree is a waste of money ! I do believe that university educations should only be for a select few . In particular I do not believe that sending everybody to college will make us collectively smarter . Consequently , I do not believe that college degrees will make our society richer or more competitive . Thus I believe that government support for continued education in the form of 529 plans and cheaper tuition at state universities is a misguided policy . There I said it ! <p> The main problem is that a college education does not make people smarter . Hence , the consequence of sending increasing numbers of kids to college and demanding that they get degrees has been to dumb down the levels , reduce the number of challenging courses , and inflate the grades to allow people to pass . This hurts the smart students who do not get challenged and it hurts the stupid students who exit college with a useless degree and spend months and years before ending with a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurts the people who did not go to college as they have to compete for jobs with people with " college degrees " . I think it is generally accepted that a college degree is now so prevalent that it is practically equivalent to a union card for the white collar job market . Hence , employers use this as a first screen for potential applicants . Hence , what used to be " high-school " jobs are now " college degree " jobs : " Must possess a minimum of a bachelor degree and be able to lift 50lb " . And thus even people who know that they do n't  need to go to college to learn the skills for a particular job , realize that they better go anyway to have a shot at getting their foot in the door of the job market . <p> The effect of government sponsorship and the fact that university administrations have willingly played along ( after all , more students mean more income ) have not resulted in higher education . It has merely resulted in longer education leaving students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it deflates the credentials of the present workforce . For instance , a 1990 " A " is worth more than a 2000 " A " but less than a 1980 " A " . As such grade inflation may put pressure on people with older degrees and transfers credentials from the haves to the have-nots ( just like ordinary inflation ) . <p> Now , personal finance experts like to talk about good debts and bad debts . Since most personal finance has to do with consumption and not capital investment(*) , I am personally not able to draw the line and I think all personal debt is bad debt . However , in general student debt is often considered a " good debt " . However , I think that in many cases , in particular for the multitude which SHOULD NOT have gone to college , such student debt is quite insidious in that it does not generate a corresponding return in terms of money and opportunity losses compared to going for a more suitable job like machinist , mechanic , chef , etc . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an investment in human capital . It is simply akin to an extended vacation with room and board . <p> So who needs a college degree ? Except for a select few in highly technical fields and those who desire to be professors , I submit that most middle managers , technicians , etc. can be suitably and much more efficiently trained on the job . The colleges may cry out about the value of education , but I say from experience that you find very very few intellectual students on a college campus . Maybe 1 in 20 read the newspaper ( the entire newspaper ) and even fewer read books outside the assigned curriculum ( some do n't  even read that much ) . Thus as I see it , colleges provide very little educational value for most of its attendants and thus most people do n't  need to go there . <p> The way to correct the situation is two-pronged . First , the government needs to stop subsidizing the education industry so that the price signals of higher/longer education are not distorted . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That way people can better evaluate whether a 3 year degree in basket weaving is economically sounder career strategy than the $80,000 salary available to a precision machinist ( its not ) . Second , companies need to be less lazy in their screening process . It just may be that the person who does not hold a college degree , but rather started his own company or travelled to another country and found employment ( rather than backpacking around and wasting time ) might be a better asset that someone who partied for 4 years courtesy of the parents of the taxpayers . <h> 66 users responded in " Who needs a college degree anyway ? " <p> A productive gap year can be a very good investment of time . An extra year of maturity at that age means a good deal . Time before uni spent working locally or abroad , or travelling/volunteering , can be wonderfully eye opening and provide direction where there was none . <p> I offered my son the option of taking the 200k set aside for his education and using it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to attend college ( mathematics ) . I still am not sure it was the right choice . <p> Dr. Dave said , <p> In eight years I went from a 10th grade high school dropout to a DVM ( Doctor of Veterinary Medicine ) , but I have to agree with 99% of what Jacob writes . The vast majority of people I knew in undergrad were there to party hardy , get laid , and or explore the mind bending possibility of beer . I was ten years older than them and had a full scholarship for the last two years of undergrad and vet school . For me going to school was a job , and one I took very seriously . Ive been a practicing vet for seven years now , making close to six figures with zero debt , but obviously if I am at extreme early retirement I am thinking of getting out of clinical practice . I love teaching , or at least the idea of teaching but the comments from people who are presently teaching leave me wondering if that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for speaking the truth . I am a recent retiree , and way back in 1974 I graduated with an engineering degree . I utilized the GI Bill to pay for it and it got me a good paying job in California . I eventually became a manager and started hiring college graduates who could not write a business memo . I paid for 2 kids to go to a state college and in hindsight , one of them had no business in college . I often find myself asking , " How in the world did she get a degree . " I went on to get an MBA and then taught as an adjunct . It was there I saw first hand how students expected a B just for showing up . <p> Agree . 12 years of taxpayer subsidized education is ENOUGH . If people put in their 100% they would come out of those years with far more skills and knowledge than they have now . Math has multi levels , most schools offer a number of languages , etc . Vocational programs are also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not read is deplorable . And , yes , I certainly could have worked on my spelling more . <p> sid said , <p> I am a senior in high school and my mom is reading the ERE book , so that 's why I just randomly found this . I 'm in the process of applying to college right now ( today ) , and I am finding it difficult to see the point in going to college for a " required " experience with an expected outcome . The colleges , in endless emails , say you should go their schools ( specifically ) to " broaden your horizons , " which is great and something I want to do , but at the same time it is pretty ironic that there is only one societally approved way to " broaden " horizons . It frustrates me to have to apply for special scholarships just so I can afford to go to college for a worthwhile amount of money and not damage myself/parents . But oh well , I just needed to complain I guess . I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whatever happens I will probably be fine as long as I can learn something . The end . <p> I 'm a proud , non university grad that , by having too low of grades to enter a Canadian university , thankful for not have wasted his time . <p> Trades and crafts are going away ? Quite the opposite actually where I live . The baby boomers who were doing these sorts of jobs have began to retire , while my generation was told to go to university/college and get a degree . The result is the average tradesperson now making more than most medical/law/engineering etc degree holding people . <p> There is nothing wrong with backpacking during college . Ive been on the road for the past 16 months . <p> Dave said , <p> There are definitely a lot of things to consider . I 'm going to a local community college to pursue a degree in a field that currently needs trained graduates . The college offers help finding part-time job in the summer , and I also qualify for a few thousand dollars in grants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are willing to pay for ALL of my living expenses and possibly book expenses if I go to school . That makes a world of difference . <p> One thing Ive learned is that about 90% of all students do not take their education seriously and are just wasting money , or are trying to get a degree in something like art . If you 're going to college to learn something or get a degree in a field that is n't in demand , its just a waste . I 'm lucky enough that when I graduate , I wont have any student debt . <p> BlueNote said , <p> I agree that there are way too many people getting undergrad and graduate degrees . It is indeed the new high school diploma in a lot of cases and , in my experience , the bar has been placed far too low . <p> I for one am interested in learning about things like mathematics , history and other subjects solely because I enjoy learning . However I would rather just learn from a source like the Kahn academy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look up the syllabus for tons of different degrees at my local University , I could audit their classes for free , no credit of course , and learn the same stuff the other students do for free . Its all about having the credential for the vast majority of people , because it really is perceived as the new union card , high school diploma , train ticket to the middle class etc . <p> Bob said , <p> I always find these debates about college quite interesting . Especially coming from Australia , where college fees are paid by the government on a inflation-only loan ( aka. you get charged no interest , only whatever the inflation is ) . And you do n't  pay it back until you earn over a certain income level ( and even then , you only pay it back slowly ! ) . <p> Getting into a good college over here simply involves doing well in school the higher your marks , the better institution/degree you can get .

More incentives should be offered to entrepreneurs instead for enterprise ! <p> RJ said , <p> I work at a university as a professor and I have to agree wholeheartedly with this post . I see far too many undergraduate students working just to " get an A " rather than to really learn at my school . The debt these young people graduate with ( and that their parents co-signed for ) will make them wage slaves for at least a decade afterward and immerse them in a system that does n't  really require the very education they paid so dearly for in time and money . However , many parents today are pushing this avenue for their kids because they believe it will improve their odds of " success " even while there is ample evidence that the most successful individuals in the world did not earn a college degree ( e.g. , Bill Gates , Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( To read more about that go LONG ... <p> Moreover , the " publish or perish " mentality driving most universities in the U.S. today means that professors spend their time on research and publishing activities rather than on teaching . Teaching simply does not compare in regard to moving up the P&amp;T ladder . Many professors I know are loathe to admit this , but when faced with so many students that do not appear to really care about learning , but rather about promotion and advancement ( much like their professors ! ) , then professors are not going to spend much time on teaching when the payoff is so low . <p> The system is apparently broken not producing what it was intended to produce and reproducing the very inequities it was created to solve . We need more people ( like Jacob ) who are questioning the system and willing to do the work ( intellectual work and physical work ) to move past a system that simply does n't  work anymore . <p> Kathy said , <p> Many of the college kids Ive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorry to say , but it is true .

But my question was , what did she expect to do with the degree ? Did she have no sense of the job opportunities in that field ? ( Short answer.no ) . Finally she went back to school and became a RN and had a job instantly out of that program .

E-mail me if you are interested about sharing dividend stock picks = 10156 @qwx420156 <p> $75 a month for health insurance is completely unrealistic . I 'm 33 , in good shape and had an HSA with the most basic coverage you can get as well as a $2,500 deductible and it was over $100 . Even raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $20/month . And that 's just for the premium what happens if you actually have to pay for something like a doctor/hospital visit ? <p> Interesting idea , but seems much too low for 99% of the population . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> I 'm 33 . In very good shape , non-smoker , etc. and willing to change my behavior radically to avoid medications ( for instance , I 'd rather sneeze or stay inside than eat allergy pills ) . I pay $72/month which is below 75 , so apparently it is realistic , at least for me . I think my plan has a $3500 deductible ; I can look it up . I found it on hasinsider.com ( its blue anthem ) . To actually pay for something , I would take it out of the HSA account . Its a nice tax-advantaged place to keep money . It functions much like an IRA with the tax advantage . If you consider the tax savings , it almost pays the premium . As far as I understand , I can even use it for general living expenses once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my health . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @DGI it does not take much REIT exposure ( I 'm at 10-15% depending on which dya you ask ) to raise a 4-5% yield to over 7% . I still consider total return a bonus . Current income is crucial as I do n't  want to have too much of a relatively non-performing cash buffer to rely on capital gains . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Of the MLPs I watch , most are currently yielding 8+% and have a good track record for increasing the distributions . NRP is paying over 10% if you pick the right day to buy , but the asset price is down compared to 5-yrs ago . OKS is my current favorite and APU is okay . <p> For normal stocks , PEP substantially increased its dividend over the prior 5 yr bull market and is n't likely to cut it . Imagine if you 'd had your salary increased by 2.6x ? ! ? Its that sort of income growth that will make Jacobs portfolio soar over time without much effort . <p> Johnnny said , <p> Awesome idea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . <p> Unfortunately , high dividends are not guaranteed . Most of the companies I was following with great dividends slashed or suspended their dividends . <p> Still , an excellent strategy . 10152 @qwx420152 <p> Since I wrote back in November , Johnnys post reminded me that its probably time to revisit the dividends . <p> So far , so good on my dividend payers they all increased or held their dividends except for Unilever ( UL ) , which was down a little ( &lt;10% ) . In the MLPs , OKS dropped their distribution a little ( &lt;10% ) , but the others increased . <p> My one clunker has been Alliance Bernstein ( AB ) , which manages mutual funds . Their payouts are tied to " assets under management " , so if the market falls , so does their payout . <p> With AB , I 've frustratingly learned a lesson here In December 2007 , the recession was pretty much a foregone conclusion , so staying with AB entailed an obvious risk . My reasoning , at the time , was that even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their distribution would be cut accordingly . And , to me , that was acceptable . <p> The lesson I painfully learned was that I forgot to factor in how the clients would redeem their money if the market fell too quickly or if there was a credit crunch and the clients suddenly needed cash . Both of which are exactly what happened and the distribution for the most recent quarter was brutally slashed by over 80% compared to last year ! <p> martin said , <p> Jacob the food cost seems very low do you just spend that yourself and is it just for yourslef ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @martin When I quote numbers , I typically quote for one person only . <p> Maus said , <p> I hate to sound like a broken record , but dividend growth tied to matching inflation is going to underperform the rising cost of health insurance premiums and the medical fees that must be met under the high deductible . In the past 3 years , both cost have been &gt;10% YoY . And during the fifteen years between 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current law ) , your premium for the HDHI policy will still be &gt;$200 a month . From 33 to 50 , $75 doubles to $150 at 3% inflation . It is unrealistic to believe that premiums and medical fees will not be multiples of 3% , as they have in the past . <p> I 'd want a much fluffier cushion that an $85K portfolio provides . Your diet and exercise regimen will probably stave off the chronic diseases , but all it takes is getting " doored " by an inattentive driver or cracked in the skull be a fast moving boom out on the Bay . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Maus Theres is simply no way that health care costs can outpace inflation in the long run . If it was true , it would come to completely dominate the economy and general inflation would EQUAL health cost inflation . <p> Health care is in a bubble . Once the boomers start dying off , I expect costs to normalize . <p> Incidentally , this post was written in 2008 . It would be hard to get 7% or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost almost twice as much nowthe opportunity is gone . <p> But it will probably be back within 5-10 years . <p> Maus said , <p> @Jacob I acknowledge the post is a bit dated WRT ROI . At present , I aim for 1% &gt; than 10YR Treasury rate . Anything else is gravy . <p> WRT inflation , you observation would be correct if all components moved in lockstep at the average rate . But food and automobilies , to name two components , are far cheaper than medical care over the last twenty years , with a corresonding effect on overall inflation . Moreover , over the long haul , the cost increases of medical care might tend toward the mean ; but it is precisely the excess demand produced by boomers who want to live forever and look good doing it that will drive these costs in the coming decade . <p> Perhaps I should put some skin in the game and created a self-insurance trust that ERE-minded folks can participate in . Ill have to determine whether such a self-insurance trust would be subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 . A portion of the trust could be invested in the big Pharma and medical device companies that will appreciate from the coming demand . <p> I believe you always compute for a single . That would mean ERE for a couple would require $170,000 . That is so attainable for so many . For a backup , let 's add another $85,000 : $255,000 . Still attainable . <p> I think many people would n't want to know how attainable an ER goal is . <p> You are right on the mark . The biggest problem is how mentally trapped the consumer-workers are , that they believe $6,000 is unrealistic/ unattainable to them . Its like saying intercontential travel is not possible without a passport , " how controlled are you ? " As you walk into the forest without a passport and are now in Canada . <p> No one should have to pay a toll to cross between man made countries on this Earth that does n't  belong to man in the first place . The " Country " Brand is a Mental Trap in itself . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled Country !

You now live in a virtual debtors prison , only you ca n't see the bars except when you have trouble making payments . However , if you have debt , you are not a free person . You are explicitly owned by your debt and implicitly owned by the creditor . Meanwhile , we realize that you can not keep working forever . We also realize that you do have some extra money which we like to get our hands on . Therefore we will sell you shares in the companies we own . This is not a problem since we , unlike you , have the time and connections to start new companies , do an IPO and create more shares to sell . This of course creates much more wealth and rightfully so compared to regularly buying a broad basket of stocks at any price . Doing that you are practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving for their retirement . Better pray that there are more buyers than sellers when you retire . If not , your share of the pie might just be worth less than you think . <p> Now this may sound like an okay deal to you or it may not . However , if this sounds as outrageous to you as it did to me , here 's an alternative plan . <p> Instead of signing up for things you can not yet afford and promising to work for the rest of your active life with the hope of eventually joining a retirement community which like schools are where we keep unproductive individuals please be aware that I do not intend to insult anyone personally , rather my vitriolic rant is directed at the system or structure we work under you can do the following . Your twenties is a good time to make sacrifices . Most likely , this will be the healthiest time of your life . Thus suffering a little hardship like renting a room or even sharing it with another person rather than renting a house will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are less able to suffer some discomfort . Furthermore , now is the time to put in those 80 hour weeks instead of doing it when you are 30 or 40 and all nighters no longer feel natural . It is also a time to learn what to appreciate and what not to appreciate and gain some life experience . If you pull this off well , you will have more than one hundred thousand in the bank when you are 30 . These are your retirement savings . More importantly , you will know what is worth spending money on and what is not . In retrospect many people at the same age will be looking back and wondering what they have to show for all the money they have earned . <p> In your 30s and 40s the time for sacrifice is over . You can forget about saving 15% for retirement . You do n't  need it , because you have plenty of time for compound interest to work and you have a large principal to compound on . Now is the time to explore things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Try a different career . Start a business . Volunteer . Take a few years off to pursue a different education . Catch fish in Alaska . Become a tour guide or drive a forklift . While you still need to work to some extent , you do n't  need to work full time for twenty more years to pay off a massive debt . Thus working from time to time is a viable solution . If this sounds appealing , I suggest reading Charles Longs How to Survive Without a Salary . Alternatively , you can work hard for a few more years and build a second retirement fund which would cover the years between 30 and 60 . Once this is established you are truly financially independent . Now the main challenge becomes one of living a life in a " strange " society that is tailored towards everybody spending 2 hours a day driving to and from work , 8-10 hours a day working , and the rest of the time eating , sleeping , and watching TV . The problem is almost one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , car payments , mortgage payments , etc. you have to go to work . Life is simple that way . On the other hand , if you have no debt obligations and your main responsibility is not to work and pay bills , it becomes something else . The big question is what ? Well , whatever you make of it . It seems to me that life is a journey and since I am currently in the middle of exactly that part of it , I cant tell you just yet . <p> I imagine that when we get older and getting close to the conventional age of retirement or maybe even a little older since conventions no longer apply , we will be done with the bungee jumping and the sailing across the ocean in a sailboat . Perhaps then we shall know the meaning of life . I imagine us buying a small house in cash where we spend time reflecting , and writing .

@@42287990 @2287990/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> Okay , so maybe I am not the best person to answer this given that I never had any debt , like at all ( ! ) But there are plenty of people out there who are in debt and wants to get out of it , and occasionally I also get the random question about it , so I figured I should give my take on it . <p> So here 's my take on it : <p> In my mind all personal debt is bad . It is hard for me to think of any case where debt can not be avoided . Therefore to me , being in debt implies having chosen to spend unearned money rather than chosen to be free . At some point , a person in debt made a deal that in exchange for some trinket like a car , a new TV , a Big Mac menu at McDonalds(*) , they would work it off in the future . <p> Often the trinket becomes uninteresting or worthless quite fast . Much faster than the debt which is still there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exchange for more future work . Ultimately the person ends up with a lot of things in the present while owing a great deal of work in the future . <p> A person in debt need to realize on a visceral level what debt means . It means future obligations . Obligations means a loss of choice . Instead other people , the lenders , get to choose for you . They get to choose that you should work when you would rather not . While you have the full choice and risk of what kind of work you , you do not have the freedom not to work . There may be a wage separating the debtor from the lender making the relation less personal , but the person in debt is still a slave to someone in the sense that his work and by implication his time , that is , his life energy is owned by someone else . <p> Thus I think debt is a moral issue and that being in debt expresses certain morals . <p> The first step towards getting out of debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or very easy . Some people are capable of saying " Hey , I was wrong , and you were right " . Many are not(*) . A person may use various methods for getting out of debt which interestingly all are associated with snow , snowballs , snowflakes , snow avalanches I 'm not sure why that is , but why break the tradition ? <p> ( * ) If anyone can solve this problem , there 's a Nobel Peace Prize in it for you . <p> Introducing the Debt Snowman . <p> The debt snowman is a menacing paternalistic dude that follows you around and looks over your shoulder . When you want to buy something , the nagging debt snowman wants to know why you are spending money on yourself , when you still owe money to someone else . The debt snowman wants to know why you are ordering pizza rather than giving the money to the lender so he can order pizza . After all , at some point , the lender made a sacrifice for you by not ordering pizza so that you could spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not order pizza and give the money back . The sooner the better . <p> I am Jacks conscience . <p> The methods for getting out of debt are the same as the same as the methods for getting wealthy or reaching early retirement . Continuously increase earnings . Continuously reduce spending . The debt only adds a moral urgency . After all , if you have no debt , slacking off and taking it easy is okay . If you have debt , you can not afford not to run , its bad karma. <h> 24 users responded in " How I would get out of debt ( if I had any ) " <p> Well stated . My wife and I were happy to sign up for the 15-year mortgage two years ago , but now I cant wait to be free from it . Right now we mainly work to pay for the house .

I have a police snowman who expects me to be wearing clothes whenever Im out in public . <p> Just because I have paid these things off in the past does n't  mean I do n't  have to keep paying them in the future . Which is the only reason I 'm still working . <p> While debt free too , I find the best method is live below ones means and income . With that aspect , then it is easy to avoid the lifestyle trap that makes one in service to things . As such , my best advice is save first , pay cash , live below the income level and stick with the plan .

But if you have a guaranteed income , why not spend it when you want to as long as you can pay it off when the income stops ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @galinaz If you look at the cash flows , the situation you have set up actually corresponds to a situation , where the life insurance company owes you money and you have elected to take the pay outs continuously in exchange for not getting the large pay out at the end . In other words , you are transferring liability to the insurance company . I think that is okay . I 'm not a big expert on insurance products , but what is the difference between this approach and buying an annuity . They should have the same value , no ? <p> Jacob , wondering what you think of taking on debt for school- Im considering starting a masters degree program soon and it will mean taking on about $16,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will easily pay for that , but at the same time I suppose I 'm just obligating myself to many more years of work . What 's your take and/or have you written about student loans before ? <p> I needed you following me around looking over my shoulder 20 years ago .. I 'm not EVEN joking . Only now am I " getting it " . I know exactly what I need to do now to guarantee early retirement in 10 years time . <p> Hi Jacob I have the same question as Eden above , and generally what you think of investment as a somewhat justifiable *type* of debt . I would leap ahead and say that I think we LABEL things as investments far too often ooooh , these $200 shoes are an " investment " in my sense of well-being and forget , as you rightly point out , that there *is* a bondage to debt . Denial , or blindness , is an all too common human habit of mind . But is everything black or white ? If you invest in an education ( say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the projected outcome , is n't *some* debt justifiable ? Small businesses often also need capital to get started . Unfortunately the " financial ecology " of our culture is breaking down just like our physical ecology . In the old days , banks were very careful about who they lent to . Someone with a business proposition would have to go in , make a face-to-face connection with a bank manager , and lay out their business plan with all its details . So there was accountability , and a personal connection , together , not one without the other . Now banking regulations are falling apart , resulting in sub-prime mortgage mess and falling dollar but the accountability and personal connection are lost . And credit cards are worse a piece of plastic arrives in the mail , the 800 customer service number goes to India , and we are n't  accountable to anyone ! <p> All that said , my underlying question is , is debt for a " true investment " really that bad ? By true investment I would mean a plan for temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and map for not only payback but an assement of how the investment will actually INCREASE our ability to sustain our lives and give back , presented to someone else ( or even a small group or family ) for feedback , comment , and also accountability . <p> For example , Eden , have you actually assessed , using independent sources , what the likely long term outcome of your investment is likely to be , beyond the loan payback period ? I read an article in the NY Times recently how people are being lured by culinary schools , with dreams of becoming chefs but at least the idea that they can always find work cooking . But these same students are being rudely awakened because the availability of chef or cooking jobs is not what they imagine and the earnings are pretty low . The schools do n't  care , they just want their tuition . So the students are coming out with huge debts but are only able to earn low wages . Nobody held the students accountable to their financial fantasies . <p> @mayalibre You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student loan decision is whether I would actually earn the cost back some day . A degree is of course no guarantee of anything and I know that I could find myself in a new career field or doing something else that I could have done without the extra degree in the first place . I think I am struggling most with how to measure the risk versus the possible reward at this point . <p> @Jacob thanks for following up with a student loan post . That was helpful . <p> I love fight club references . It makes me want to swallow more than a pint of my own blood to see if I get sick . <p> Frankly said , <p> Jacob , <p> I just noticed that the header info " I have a written a book etc " mentions a feedburner link for the RSS feed but when looking at the page source the alternate tags lists http : **33;1728;TOOLONG . It appears the feedburner RSS feed contains all posts including reposts but the http : **33;1763;TOOLONG only contains new posts . Anyway , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt under control was to pay off one of the above ( student loans ) before taking on another one of the above ( home mortgage ) . <p> I always paid cash for the cars I bought even if I had one of the other forms of big debt . And , of course , I never had any other types of personal debt such as credit cards . <p> In 1998 , I paid off my mortgage which I first took in 1989 and refinanced in 1992 ( saving me hundreds of dollars each month ) . Been totally debt-free ever since . <p> In 2008 I retired at age 45 . <p> no relation to this post , said , <p> but I found an extremely extreme example of living on a fraction of ones income : " Most people rent a house , have a lot of expenses , work real hard , and maybe put 5% of their income away towards their dreams . But you have to work an awfully long time to get anywhere that way . We took the opposite approach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away into savings . We got jobs leading stone-age wilderness expeditions , so it was pretty easy to keep expenses down . " LONG ... <p> Shows what 's possible1 year of savings gives 19 additional years at current years living standards . <p> Britz said , <p> Long ago , I bought an apartment just before I started studying , mainly from the slightly vague notion that it would be a better deal to pay off mortgage than to throw away rent-money . I would be locking myself into frugality and side-jobs but would be forced to " save up " by paying off on the apartment , and even though I could have lived more cheaply on rent , I would not have the same pressure to save up , especially since I would be living very cheaply in either case . I was naive and did n't  make any actual calculations but worked hard to avoid any student debt and , after 10 years , ended up selling the apartment with a nice profit . <p> Similarly when my wife got an offer to do her phd here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the viewpoint of it being a good investment ( financially and personally ) , even though my own career might suffer temporarily and we would be chewing through our savings . This also turned out luckily , and after four months of minding our first kid , I got postdoc work here , my wife got her phd and then a postdoc , and now we both work in good jobs that we each enjoy and that are wel-paying , and with a little luck , we will both have tenure in a years time . <p> We have also tried to save up whenever we could , and this is yet another sort of investment , in delaying resource-use now in order to increase future possible usage . Yet another type of investment is buying stuff in bulk and on crash-sale , which can sometimes be a good idea even if you 're in debt . <p> In other words , I like the idea of investments , and they have worked out well ( except for my stupid and not-to-be repeated forays into stocks = ) . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against debt and have always strived hard to avoid it . My attitude has almost always been to save up and buy , rather than to spend and pay off , and I have for years wondered at people buying expensive houses on mortgages ( that I put buying my apartment back then to young cluelessness and a lot of luck in that it turned out well ) . <p> I was therefore quite surprised the other week to discover that saving up for a house is not always the cheapest strategy , nor the freest . I had finally gotten my act together after all these years and spent 15min. writing a simple computer routine to calculate just how expensive it would be to save up X number of year while renting and then buy a house with the remaining mortgage to pay off . It turns out that if you can pay off a full mortgage in a short amount of time ( typically 6-7 years but dependant on the prices , income , savings rate etc. ) , then you will end up paying more in rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving-method to be a clear winner in all but extreme cases . You might be bound for those 6-7 years but this lack of freedom would be offset by the freedom to live on your own terms , rather than potentially being kicked out by successive landlords . ( Personally , if I were to buy a house , then I 'd save up at least 25% even it were more expensive in the long run , just for financial insurance . ) <p> Eight years ago , I refinanced my home with a 5% , 15 year mortgage . I wanted to have it paid off when I retired in 6.5 years . Last year , I called the bank and increased the payment to pay it off by 6/2017 . Taking control of your finances has benefits ! <p> Does something like a home mortgage loan count as bad debt to have as well ? Thanks for your help ! 10153 @qwx420153 <p> Use a credit card and never be in debt . Carefully calculate your grace period on the month . Do it thoroughly and carefully . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date on that period . You know the approximate date your statement will arrive in the mail . ( My date is nearly always the 25th of the month ) . <p> Now the magic happens : <p> You go to the mail box and pull out your statement . You go home ( directly home and do not pass go and do not collect $200.00 ) . <p> In your house , you IMMEDIATELY sit down at your desk and write a check for the FULL amount on your credit card statement . You seal the statement in the provided envelope and add a stamp . ( You shred the three blank checks they send with the statement , you DO NOT want these laying around . ) <p> You get back in your ride and take the sealed and stamped statement/full payment back to the post office and drop in the mail . You double check everythingstamp , return address , all that stuffdouble check it . <p> You walk away knowing the credit card company works for you instead of the other way around . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only payment the free accountant gets from you is YOU ARE NEVER , NO NOT EVER late on your part of the deal . <p> And you get a pittance back1% ( I currently have about $450.00 in my " cash back " column . <p> I you can not do the above , then have NO cards . <p> Josh said , <p> @HSpencer I completely agree with you , except I use online bill payment instead . Saves me a stamp/check/and gas/mileage from going to the post office and back . I think this is more of a generational thing though . <p> DC Waffler said , <p> My experience with credit card debt was several years back , when I had to quit my job until my immigration papers were renewed . My lawyers knew how long it normally took , but no one knew it would take as long it actually did . I had only been out of grad school two years at that point , was focused on paying down my student loans , so did n't  have much in savings yet . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing and transportation costs . I requested deferral of my student loans . I started hoarding cash . I also put as much of my remaining expenses as I could on my credit cards and made minimum payments . <p> Why did I get in credit card debt when I was unemployed ? I only had about $5000 in cash , my COBRA payments alone were $300/month and I could n't legally get another job . The credit cards helped me stretch my cash . <p> Once I started working again 6 months later , I had the CC debt , the student loans , and also owed my attorneys ( $$ due when my application was approved ) . The feeling I had towards my creditors was gratitude . I had access to their cash when I needed it , and they made money off me . <p> I owed a total of $30k and I was making $32k . I managed to pay everyone off in a little over a year , which should give you an idea of how focused I was on debt repayment . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * ) , but rather a useful tool . Like many tools , e.g. , cars , prescription drugs , scissors , classified information , dogs or guns , debt can harm you when misused . Do n't  make accruing debt a lifestyle , but use it if you have to . If you are already in debt , develop a plan for getting out of debt . Use whatever motivates you , whether it be guilt , gratitude or a dispassionate spreadsheet . <p> HSpencer and Josh , I live just down the street from the bank which handles my CC . Most of the time , I simply walk to the bank and pay it in person , or I drive there on the way to doing other local errands . I do n't  have to rely on the post office or worry about the bank misplacing my payment and claiming I did not pay it on time . <p> The cash-back thing does not concern me because I use my CC so rarely . I charged $655 in 2010 and $229 in 2009 . I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so paying a CC bill is a somewhat uncommon event for me . <p> Britz said , <p> I was too tired and rambled on in my previous comment above , so my main message got a bit buried , so here it is again : <p> Although it is a vital rule of thumb to avoid debts , it is worth doing the actual calculations , because you can sometimes save money , time , and freedom ( or whatever ) by assuming debts and even mortgages , rather than save up . Not often , but sometimes , especially if you repay the debt quickly and/or if there is an exceptionally good investment opportunity . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> Re : Credit Cards What HSpencer said , but upon receiving the bill ( electronically , I do n't  want my account # floating around in the mail ) I immediately schedule a payment on the day before the due date . I keep the balance in an online savings account so I get a little extra interest during the grace period . <p> I also concur with HSpencer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add one more caveat also do n't  try this if you might be prone to letting the points/cashback give you an excuse to spend more than you otherwise would . Eg you have to be sure you can restrain yourself to only using it for that which you were going to buy anyways . <p> I 'm *pretty good* about this , but not perfect = <p> Couponkeebs said , <p> To those inquiring , I would be cautious before incurring student loan debt . There is NO GUARANTEE that your addl eduction will net you addl pay . I have 2 family members who are recent grads that are living proof of this . I would , instead , pay as you go . It may take longer to finish the degree but at least when you do you wont be stuck with a pile of debt to frame next to your diploma . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287992 @2287992/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> We just came back from one weeks vacation at the in-laws , so now I need a vacation . I always seem to need some time to recover after the bustling activity of family gettogethers . Anyway , staying in an 2.5 bedroom apartment for the first time since we moved into the RV allowed me to make some observations on what its like to live in an apartment from the perspective of a fulltime RV dweller . <p> An apartment is much like an RV . It has the same things , couches , chairs , tables , kitchen . bathroom , etc . EXCEPT everything is strangely far apart . Normally in an RV , one person can be cooking and another person can be watching TV and the third can be sitting on the chair , and everybody are close enough to have a conversation . In the apartment , one would need to either shout or get up and walk over . In an apartment things are separated . In an RV things are together . RV wins . <p> An apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except we do n't  want to waste gas by keeping the water heater on at all times ) , so I decided to try one after having deliberately used cold showers every day for the past three months . After one hot shower , I decided to go back to cold showers as I feel much better afterwards . With a hot shower , the skin is warm and damp and so the air feels cold . Also the skin tends to feel slightly puffy ( it soaks in water ) . With a cold shower , the skin is flushed but cold and so the air feels nice and comfy . The skin is not puffy . Draw , since you can have both each place . <p> An apartment has higher water pressure . Older RVs are limited to 45psi which is not a lot . Also , the toilet in an apartment has no pedals and does not need to be filled with water before using . Apartment wins . <p> We did not do any cleaning while we where there , but I imagine it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least half an hour . In the RV we can have it spic-and-span in about an hour which includes polishing . RV wins . <p> Overall there was a lot more stuff in the apartment . In an RV there is out of necessity a lot less because there is less room . Unless space is deliberately created in an apartment , the effective " empty space " will be the same . This is probably dependent on personality . Here , the apartment offers the choice , but this choice also comes with responsibility . I see this going either way . Draw . <p> In summary , I do n't  appreciate the greater separation of things and people in an apartment . But I do like freedom . An RV gives you freedom to run your utilities , but it does not give you as much freedom in terms of spaceit is much easier to move furniture around in an apartment than in an RV , but the latter is not impossible . And vice a versa . Naturally , this was just a comparison of one particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " could be solved by choosing either of a different size although apartments have a higher lower limit than RVs . The utility problem could be solved by owning the apartment , but that is probably easier done in a house . <h> 31 users responded in " RV vs. apartment " <p> What if you did n't  want to be listening to your partners TV show while you cooked ? I feel like a big downside of RVs is that there 's no place to escape to if you want to be alone . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> That 's not really a problem , but I 'd tell my partner to put the headphones on . <p> Dave said , <p> I find it funny everytime I talk to my wife about your site . I tried to talk her into a tumbleweed house , after seeing them before reading your site . Then , I tried to talk her into an RV after reading your wife went along with that . She thought it would be much too cold in the Canadian winter for that , so we settled on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and are still paying ) over $100,000 more then you did for your RV , but I 'd say we would probably be fine on approximately 1/2 the space . <p> As for the cold showers , my wifes naturopath told her to take them , its excellent for circulation she 's too much of a wuss and we shower together in the mornings ( save water ) so its hot and clammy showers for us . <p> Also consider the four season freedom of a tiny house . Build a house on a trailer . Framed walls and lots of insulation give you the comfort without the condensation . The only trouble is they are a little heavier than a trailer or RV but for those semi-permanent people a tiny house might be an even better solution than an RV or apartment . <p> Jacob , do you have any idea what temperature your " cold " water is ? After living in all parts of the country ( Texas , Chicago , Seattle , New England ) , I can confidently state that " cold " water is definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also makes a big difference . I could ( and did ) take " cold " showers year-round when living in South Texas . However , the idea of taking a " cold " shower in New Hampshire in January seems impossible to me . <p> Kristian said , <p> I would say that a studio apartment would make a better comparison . During the mid 90s me and my wife of that time had a 400 sf studio apt. in downtown Seattle for $400 a month . It was awesome and I never felt cramped ! We did not own a car and we grocery shopped at pike place market ( IT WAS AWESOME ! ) . I think that would make a good transition for those wanting to go smaller and least get a feel for it with just a little financial commitment . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Executioner I do n't  really have an idea . The apartment in NY and the RV in CA felt pretty similar to me . <p> josh said , <p> Out of curiosity how did you guys decide against getting an RV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boat and I was wondering if you factored this out based on costs . Thanks . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @josh 1 ) I do n't  know anything practical about boats/ships . I figured we should learn how to run a boat before we risked that our " home " could sink if we did not operate the head/toilet correctly . 2 ) The nearest marina is quite a distance from where we work(ed) . <p> Currently my sailing plans have progressed from reading books to having found a sailing school and trying to acquire ( slowly on ebay ) the required shoes/sea boots and gloves to I can do the basic keel boat certification from ASA or US Sailing . 10149 @qwx420149 <p> Great comparison Jacob . I currently live in a dorm ( room ) with access to a kitchen and bath . And even though its pretty small I do n't  feel cramped at all . Like you , I quite like having everything near-by plus it makes it essential to stop buying crap . = <p> Like Dave said , the biggest blockade is convincing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the space we have now . RV is n't a bad idea ( prebuilt ) , a tiny house I think would have a lot of cool factor and be more insulated ( both heat and noise ) but I 'd rather have a larger sailboat . I know how to sail one ( having owned 2 smaller ones ) but youd need a 30-40 footer to get as comfortable as a big RV ( my opinion . ) Sailboat is by far the most expensive , a new one being 4-5K/ft in length . But , used ones are all over . <p> Nice comparisons the only issue I 'd worry about is the toilet pedals ? : ) I would n't want to have plumbing problems . <p> Also , the question of " privacy " or maybe " space to yourself " seems important , if just for claustrophic reasons even with ones partner , its good to have your own space too . <p> I think I could live in an RV for an extended , mobile vacation this would be a good fiscal compromise but I do n't  think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at same time . After all , the mobility seems to be the raison detre , no ? Do you two ever take trips with it ? I 'm not sure if I 've read you talk about that or not . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @MoneyEnergy One pedal to fill the bowl . One pedal to flush . The idea of private space is a modern western invention . I 'm perfectly capable of ignoring DW if I feel like it even if she 's sitting right next to me ; -D actually its a good idea to verify whether one can stand to be in the same room as ones spouse for extended periods before getting married . No , we have n't gone on a trip yet . We really should . <p> Vicki said , <p> You have n't mentioned the rent you pay to park your RV . What part of your day/night do you spend in your RV ? Do you both work full time ? retired ? Are you both in the RV together most of the time ? Do you plan to have children ? If so , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $475/month ; all day for me , all day minus 8-6 ( long days ) for DW ; I 'm semi-retired doing me volunteer/freelancing work in the RV ( new reader , eh ? = ) , DW works full time offsite ; see above ; no ; yes ( we already have a dog in here ) . <p> @Moxie I looked into buying a resort lot when we first looked into it . However , our current arrangements are determined by DWs job . And I 'm not buying real estate in California , like ever = 10153 @qwx420153 <p> I have a 2200 square foot home , a 750 square foot 2 bedroom apartment , and a 28 foot travel trailer ( RV ) . I have the two bedroom apartment because I manage an apartment complex , and live in the apartment Monday through Friday , going to my home on weekends . My wife and I enjoy our 28 foot travel trailer , which we keep full time at a RV site within 60 miles of our home . My home is paid for and it costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all utilities , and provides shop/office space and free highspeed internet , free , since I am the manager of the complex , and the RV is paid for and costs me $30.00 to keep it at the RV site and $15.00 a day for site and utilities , when I have the time to be there . Were I to choose one place to live from the three described , it would be my house , but the apartment is just as comfortable and cosy as my house . It is much eaiser to clean and care for , even if were costing me any money to live in it . I could live in the travel trailer if I had to , but it would become tiring as the trailer , while very comfortable , takes getting used to , and does not provide me any workshop or office space besides the dining table , which I would find a problem . Were I just trying to get by on the absolute cheapest living I could , I would pick the Apartment , simply because it costs me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in managing the complex . <p> I am not sure if you 've address this on your blog , but where do you park your RV ? I am considering an RV as one of many alternative housing environments to live in once I retire and found that parking the darn thing was as expensive as my regular monthly expenses would be . <p> Took a break from this blog while I worked on a few personal things last year ( bike cross country to CA and then settled down in SoCal ) and am now catching up on where I left off = <p> TyboOSU said , <p> Got an update about our RV living situation . <p> Moved in Dec 09 , had some CRAZY cold nights in there , and because we did n't  feel comfortable runninng the propane furnace ( no propane detector , kinda spendy ) we used electric space heater that did ok job at times . <p> But mainly we do n't  run heat at all and just use layers and 40inch LCD/PS3/PC to pump out some residual heat in a small space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upkeep and probable breakdown/repair of RV items has me worried . Not to mention the fact many RV areas are not that close to urban areas , so I have to rely on my car a lot out where I live ( near Sandy , OR , SE of Portland 20 miles ) . <p> Thusly , I have cheap ass move in special rent at $300/month for a year , but because we are so isolated and dependent on car , I do n't  see this spot at least being a great idea long term . <p> Nor do we really gel all that well with the locals , most are super nice , but they are older and more conservative , no chance at great friendships occuring . <p> Thus , my wife who is disabled and cant work are looking into moving into Downtown Portland into a subsidized high-rise for about $600 for a studio . Obviously quite the jump , but base rent at our current RV place will be $405 . <p> What that means is we will sell the car/rv and get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in costs mainly ) and not have to worry about upkeep for those anymore . Past 2months alone I have spent over $1k for my car , which si worth $1500 ! ! ! Its just a toxic money pit really . And the RV is 15 years old as well , and could have issues anytime , EMERGENCY spending we really cant afford . <p> I can budget and handle mentally a set amount of money , but the real killer in terms or stress and finances is the UNFORSEEN challenges , or those we should put money in RAINY DAY fund , which for those living month to month like ourselves just does n't  last long at all due to other EMERGENCY spending like the dog going ot vet for X-rays etc , or other random expenditures not related to vehicles . <p> We are going to use human power(walk/scooter/bike) plus Trimet ( MAX trains , bus etc ) to get around adn commute to work . Not only that , but the technology is much better here in P-town center ( fast internet , more options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our **36;1798;TOOLONG and we have a bevy of entertainment options now within close distance . Exercise baby ! <p> The only real drawbacks to this downtown living are the HUGE upfront costs ( $2kplus for deposits etc ) and monthly increase in rent . <p> Does it make sense to forego expected LARGE sum emergency spending(vehicles) for a bit extra month to month ? <p> So really , as Jakob has said on here , ditch the vehicles ! ! ! ! ! ! They are just bad news . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Tyler RV furnaces are likely some of the most reliable technology you have in there . That said , the worry generally disappears with experience . I stress less now than I did during the first months because I know the problems and how to fix them . That said , if you can move into town and then ditch the car for a $200 difference in rent , its close to a wash ( because you can probably count on the car costing you about 50c/mile ) , so I 'd say do it . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was closer to my ex-work than our ex-house was . Could it be because you 're out in the boondocks ? Most parks around here are either downtown ( parking lot style ) or out in the business zones . In terms of friendships .. well , I 've never been friends with any of my neighbors ( except when I lived in a dorm ) , but we certainly talk more with our neighbors here than we ever did when I/we lived in houses or apartments . I suspect the main problem is not the RV per se , but that it is parked too far away from where you 'd like to be/live . <p> TyboOSU said , <p> Yeah that 's a bit part of the issue being so far out here . <p> We would have gone with a local bus accessed place , but considering crime around the area and generally trashy nature we nixed that . In addition some of these urban spots wont allow in more than 10 year old RVs so we were limited . It was a small miracle we moved into the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as moving to Downtown portland/ditching car , I think we will probably wait out our lease till Novemember 2010 ( approx 6.5 months ) as we will save about a thousand on termination fees alone , not to mention not paying an extra $300 in the Downtown place starting in the June move idea . <p> My main worries as I said before are issues with the car/rv springing up and really being costly in the next few months , namley the car . I mean i have possibly front brakes , tires , some minor leaks(transmission) and other things that could total about as much as I would save staying here for another 7 months , so a possible wash . <p> Early Retirement Extreme compared apartment versus RV living . I was particularly interested in this post as some of my former work friends have quit/retired and are living the RV lifestyle in California . Could you do it ? <p> Eric said , <p> Apples and oranges . If somebody wants an RV theyll be willing to tolerate the inconveniences . If they prefer an apartment no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hot showers for me are non negotiable . Hot water helps the lather and breaks up the bodily oils and grease along with any other funk . Cold water , while invigorating , is less useful . Plus this past winter circumstances forced me to take a cold shower which helped me into the mother of all colds . If you do n't  care for your RVs water heater there are numerous camping accessories you can buy or or build yourself to heat water . <p> RV sounds very appealing . Ideally I would want to rent my home out and generate income and then live in an respectable RV . <p> Bri said , <p> Do you have any blogposts about how you went about choosing your RV , and the costs of parking it etc ? <p> karhaut said , <p> My husband is fully retired and I am on the verge of retiring . We are contemplating " life on the road " but my main concern is safety . What about crime in rv parks ? How safe are travel trailers to live in ? 10155 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It all depends on the neighborhood . There are good parks and bad parks just like there are good neighborhoods and bad neighborhoods . The good thing about an RV is that if the neighborhood is or becomes bad , its really easy to move out . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287996 @2287996/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> These days not too many people get their health insurance on the free market . Instead many have no coverage at all and many get it through their employer where it acts as a set of golden handcuffs , that is , the only thing preventing some people from quitting their jobs . Indeed , some still have a job simply in order to have access to affordable health care . <p> ( Note , of all the developed countries in the world , this peculiar problem only pertains to the US , so if you live somewhere else , you can ignore this post . ) <p> However , it is possible to get health insurance on the free market and it does offer a greater flexibility than " corporate health care " ( * ) . Even when I had access to " good benefits " through my W-2 job , I elected to go with the " free market insurance " instead . In fact , even after I had retired from my **26;1836;TOOLONG and I could come in under DWs plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A kind of socialized health care available to people who are W-2 employees of tax-subsidized corporations . <p> I currently ( 2011 ) pay $91/month for a $4500 deductible HSA-compatible plan with HealthNet . <p> I consider $91/month a small sum . It is certainly nothing that 's going to break my retirement plans . Indeed , these plans exist even as people tell me they are spending hundreds , some close to a thousand each month for fully loaded health plans ; and that would be something that would break ERE . <p> To verify my numbers , go to ehealthinsurance.com and enter my zip code ( 94551 ) and county ( Alameda ) and my age ( Im 35.5ish ) . Itll give you a long list of plans . Go to the bottom in the left sidebar and click on Additional Features . Click on HSA-eligible . Then sort by price . <p> Note that the cheapest one comes in at $81/month . <p> Maybe I should change my plan . <p> Next , let 's see what the plan will cost in 20 years in todays dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most expensive health care system in the world ) , when I 'm 55 . Repeating the exercise , the cost would be $245/month . I also ran the plan for age 60 and it came to $288/month . <p> Go ahead click on the link and verify it . <p> Shortly after that evil socialized health care , you know , medicare , will be available to my age group . <p> Again , none of these amounts are restrictive for ERE . At that age , its very likely safe to move from the ultrasafe 3% withdrawal rate to a standard 4% withdrawal rate . <p> Now , I know that some areas/states are more expensive and some are cheaper . This is due to various regulations based on how much the insurance company can discriminate against things like gender , pre-existing conditions , smokers , obesity , etc . For instance , my premiums recently went up thanks to some California program that 's intended to provide cheaper health care for most people which in turn means that some people , like me , are left holding the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider moving . I promise you , if my premium costs were $500/month compared to $100/month in some other state , I 'd be out of California within a month . <p> Of course , there 's still the question of the high deductible . The answer is that your HSA covers you . I 'm adding $3050 to my HSA every year . This means it takes me 3 years to cover my deductible for two years . If I break my leg , I can take this out of the HSA . I just need to make sure that I do n't  break a limb more than once every 1.5 years . If I stay healthy , the HSA works like an IRA . Should some situation arise where I need to spend down my entire deductible year after year , I would presume that the situation is terminal and I might as well start spending down my six-figure ERE investment principal . This would still take decades . <p> This still leaves the 25%-50% of the rest of the costs , most of which is simply old age cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few more months ( on average , some live much longer , but most do n't  ) , but some of which are driven by genetic factors , like type I diabetes and other inherited diseases . Unfortunately , I do n't  have an ERE solution for this ( beyond leaving the US for another developed country , like Mexico ) . This is a problem better fixed by your political representative . <p> Jacob , how is your premium with Obama care . Here in MN , if you are single , and make 22 k a year ( that is from investments , irrespective of your assets ) , you pay about 50 dollars a month ( called minnesotacare , not medical assistance ) . otherwise , average income , with HSA , it is about 180-200 a month from MN exchanges market ( by the way I pay about the same with my employer ) . <p> I think the Affordable Care act ( Obama care ) is a great gift for people who want to retire very early with little income and lots of capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you will pay may be only half of the above price . <p> Having said that , I do n't  think insurance is needed . It is a systematic transfer of wealth from the majority to doctors ( who most of the time do n't  know what they are doing ) , hospital bureaucracy , insurance CEO/management and wall street . You need to see a doctor only if you have emergency , and emergency care , like police , defense , firefighters should be socialized as it involves welfare of society as a whole . <p> frank said , <p> Just to clarify the misinformation being spouted about the socialized systems . They work great for trauma or other conditions that require immediate treatment : broken bones , lacerations , heart attacks that require immediate surgery , pregnancy , etc . In order to keep costs down , they delay everything that can be delayed : cancer treatment , hip replacements , hernia repairs , other optional surgery . Because Medicare is socialized and we WILL eventually get something like Medicare for all in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States in the future . The good news is that you have a lot of control over optional surgery . Also , medical tourism is a way to get cheap optional surgery if the socialized system wont cover it and/or delays or too long and you cant afford home country prices . Medical tourism for things like hip replacements is very big among Brits already . <p> Drew said , <p> When was this article written and comments posted ? 2008 ? LOL <p> Is anybody talking about how Obamacare has completely gutted the system ? The days of affordable health care have come and gone . If you want affordable health care going forward , best start looking at Costa Rica , Panama , Ecuador , or some of the other Central and South American countries . <p> I just plugged my info into ehealthinsurance$300+ a month or one person .

For example , a male at age 35 I see your zip/county/HSA starting at $249.07 when sorted by price . <p> ? ? ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @All Yes , this is a repost from 2011 . I currently live in Chicago and health insurance is currently employer-sponsored . Obamacare through the exchanges would cost $148 for me ( male , nonsmoker , 38 ) for a bronze plan here . <p> Furthermore , Obamacare should actually be quite helpful to ERE . The reason is that you should have enough assets to meet the deductible of the bronze plans . Meanwhile , since you 're low income , you get a tax subsidy and this subsidy is determined as if you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it matches a typical ERE income of $5-20k/yr ( depending on specifics ) , your health insurance then becomes practically free ( after the tax kickback ) AND guaranteed . <p> mmwm said , <p> Wow . The cheapest high-deductible ( $10K per year per each ) plan we could get in Maine in 2008 was $800/month for two completely healthy people . 10148 @qwx420148 10159 @qwx420159 
@@42287997 @2287997/ 10154 @qwx420154 <p> In the next 3021 days or so I will writing the practical guide to " retiring " in 5 years with a nest egg sufficient to cover all your living expenses . I am semi-confident that it will possible to make all the necessary lifestyle changes within one month if we drop all pretense of a smooth transition and allow for some mistakes along the way . So if you do n't  mind roughing it , it is my posit that in 3021 days you could be fully underway to retiring from job-income . I expect it will take about 1 year after that to master the essentials and 5 years of sustained effort to reach the goal . After all , I did it ! <p> I reckon that those who will succeed in this are those who from one day to the next can proclaim : " Okay , I will not eat candy bars again " and actually not eat candy bars again(*) . It is the people that can lose 50 pounds and stay there without yoyoing . It is those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This requires strength of character and deliberate creative action more than it requires tips , talent , or luck . It is , therefore , much like running a marathon . <p> ( * ) The candy bar example is just a silly example . When I was 18 or 19 , I actually decided to avoid eating sweets and cakes . I did not eat any candy for 2 years and I did not eat any cake for 4 years . But when I was 24 I decided that I never wanted a mortgage , and the rest is , as you say , history . <p> Do n't  worry = . There will be no cutting back in this program . Instead things will be cut away completely = . Trust me on this one : It is much easier to deal psychologically with not having access at all compared to having restricted access . Restricted access only serves as a constant reminder of what you are missing . No access on the other hand changes your priorities and values and soon those are seen as the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There wont be any small baby steps either . Although it is of course strictly up to people to adopt what they want , I favor an all or nothing , that is , an extreme approach . A Blitz Krieg of shock and awe if you will . Attacking full force on several points leads to synergy . For example , I will be recommending commuting by bicycle . I will also recommend getting in shape to save on heating costs and medical bills . These two fit together and they will fit with others things , and so on . If you do one , you get the others for free . If you are only willing to do either one but not all , you will still have to spend time on the other one in some form thus wasting effort . The whole is much greater than the sum of its parts . <p> I wont waste any time on virtual dollar savings . Virtual savings is one of my new pet peeves . Virtual dollar savings are the kind of " savings " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that supposedly costs $20 . It is the kind of " savings " that represents money you can choose not to spend in the first place such as latte-money . I 'll give you an absolute number : The goal here is to cut your expense level to &lt;$10,000/year/adult . I live on $6000/year/adult . It can be done . <p> To make the change , you need to do three things . <p> If or when you have decided to commit , start immediately . The " I 'll go on a diet , starting next year " has never worked . Feel free to take your time thinking it over and build some commitment . Do n't  commit on the spur of the moment , but do n't  wait until the excitement has gone away either . <p> Make yourself accountable . Different people are motivated by different things . If you honor your word , you can make a public statement ( feel free to use the comment section below ) . Obviously you should not use something that is counterproductive to your goal such as spending money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No exceptions ! No exceptions ! No exceptions ! Exceptions are self-destructive in so many ways . <p> I have a list of the first 21 days made out . I figure I will give it a week or so to see how popular this series is and continue if it takes off . <p> Anyone ready to commit already ? = <p> Jacob comments : <p> Actually I 'm aiming for $6000/person/year. $10k was just the closest round number = <p> I 'm in . I have been reading your posts for a while now and want to thank you . Your writings have helped me convince my wife to cut back . Not only is our thermostat down but she let 's me cut her hair . Talk about savings ! <p> Wow , 10K per year in my family goes toward a house , heating , and property tax . It would be really tough to give up the house . I doubt I would want to go quite that extreme , but I hope to have a paid off house and a good income fund in about 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifice . Now if I could just get the rest of the family on board . . . <p> Valerie said , <p> We are on a 9000$ / adult + 1 child = . Because we have 400$ / month of debt to pay off <p> There 's one thing I always have a very hard time to cope with and its when my boyfriend ( we are not married I believe it is a waste of money ) has some desires about something , I can hardily refuse him the treat . <p> Anyone has ever dealt with this kind of situation before ? Hope there might be something that would make me reflect about that in the 30 day makeover ! <p> I 'm really looking forward to seeing this series . I have about a 6 year timeframe until I 'd like to be out of the rat race . Bring it on . <p> em said , <p> I 'm in . Already living cheaply I am a college student , so I figure why not just stay on the bandwagon into the future . <p> cache529 said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ralphy said , <p> Let 's get started ! <p> lez do it said , <p> ive been on $15k to $20k for the past 5 years . i 'm up for the challenge . <p> Marlene said , <p> Well I would be interested if doable . I only have net of $25,000 and some change . Will have to see what the list brings ? ? ? ? <p> SimplicityinKansas said , <p> While I have made significant changes in my life already with a frugal and simple lifestyle , I agree with the perspective to find passive income replacement to achieve ones lifes goals . I look forward to the list of activities and events and will compare with the changes made in my life as I am always examining ways to improve my results towards my goals . Perhaps this will be the basis of your book as a germinating methodology to create personal freedom ? <p> I am looking forward to reading your ERE Makeover . While I wo n't argue with being in good shape equals reduced heating costs , using a bicycle to commute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inches of snow does not seem practical however reduced the cost of commuting would be . <p> Jacob , I really enjoy your blog . I found it some months ago and have been reading it regularly since then . But can I be honest and tell you one thing I do n't  like about it ? The fat bashing . In almost every single post you talk about diets and getting in shape . Well , it is possible to be healthy even if you 're fat . And it obviously is possible to be FRUGAL even if you 're fat , right ? I understand fitness is an important topic for you , and that food is n't ( I mean , you only eat once a day which most doctors will tell you its unhealthy - , and you do n't  really care about enjoying food ) . But could you maybe include in your 10 thousand a year plan people who actually like eating and who might not be as obsessed with fitness as LONG ... <p> Bruno said , <p> I just quit my job ( you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13k debt ( I 'm 22 ) . However , I already get by on very little . I probably care for nothing more than my own freedom , so I 'm game . 10156 @qwx420156 <p> We live relatively frugally already , but I 'm up for a challenge . $10k per adult seems reasonable , but what about a 1 /12 year old ? Do I get to prorate the $10k based on his age until he hits 18 ? <p> I kid . <p> Looking forward to the series , Jacob . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @SimplicityInKansas I think this will be more of a step program , less integrated . The book will contain longer and more integrated discussions . I 'm using this to think . <p> @Lola It is possible to be healthy and fat , but I think all other things being equal less fat is healthier . What I 'm really aiming at here is being " in shape " which really means to be " fit " , fit having the sort of " right shape " . For instance , fit means that 5 miles on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office clothes and that it can be repeated daily . I know a couple of overweight 250 pound guys that can do that , but they are rare . Conversely , not fit means that 5 miles will take 40 minutes and will be a very sweaty ordeal that probably will not be repeated . I know that the difference in perspective between those two can be staggering . Things that a fit person takes for granted , such as running 5k without breaks , will be an unreachable goal or at least a major accomplishment for other people . In general a fit person will be much more willing to use human power , whether it is using a fork to beat eggs or walk home with 20 pounds of groceries , whereas an unfit ( is that the right word ? ) will have a tendency to buy a mixer and a bus ticket . This is probably a bigger deal than it used to be . The problem today is that society has become " bodily lazy " . One of my pet peeves ( I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For real ! A 100 years ago that notion would have been ridiculous . <p> Sam said , <p> For those who are on the fence- <p> Go ahead and commit for a year . Anyone can do it for a year . Right ? Look at it as an adventure . <p> After the year is up , you can decide if you want to continue . Either way , you 'll have better options available to you next year if you start right now . <p> Since I already live on about $12,000 a year it should n't be too hard to cut that down to $10,000 . I have a fuzzy plan to retire in 9 years at age 50 . This program should be exactly what I need . I am in . <p> I have heard you mention this not sweating thing before and am completely at a loss as to how one accomplishes this feat . I think that I am in relatively good physical condition ( 60 ? , 175ish pounds , bike 20+ per weekday ) but I sweat like a madman even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does this not sweating thing work ? <p> mjukr said , <p> @ Jacob any concessions for harsh winter climates ? I could see myself biking in good weather , but the three months of ice/snow would be a bit dangerous , methinks <p> Also , I know you do n't  have children , but many of your readers probably do any idea how we might factor in those additional costs ? <p> @ Steward I know what you mean I think some people just have more reactive sweat glands than others . I am in good shape but after an hour of racquetball my entire shirt is soaked . Some guys in worse shape than me come out with barely any sweat even though they are gasping for breath . There is definitely a biological set-point factor ! <p> Fantastic- can not wait to read these posts . I get what you mean by total giveup 10155 @qwx420155 <p> Its difficult to draw a sweat vs effort curve . The higher the fitness , the easier the body sweats under effort , but at the same time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a hot dry climate and in terms of sweat this has its advantages . Specifically , if you go fast enough , the sweat evaporates right off ( leaving small salt crystals instead ) . The problem comes when you stop and go inside , but usually that is not enough to drench you ( or me anyway ) . <p> Do you guys live in a hot and humid area ? In that case I think there 's no avoiding it . If you live in a cold area , what I usually do is to wear less clothes and be slightly freezing initially . After that , if I 'm cold , I move faster and vice versa . <p> jane in sf said , <p> Okay Jacob I am in how could I resist an extreme challenge ? Previously my goal was $15,000/year hmmm $833.33 a month I will be learning how to barter . Thanks , in part , to your example and information , my last day of working for someone else is next Tuesday YES ! ! ! ! This morning it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked myself : " What would Jacob do ? " What else a couple of jumping jacks and I was good to go . <p> I 'm ready to commit ! Or be committed Getting the food bill under control has been my biggest thing over the past year and I 'm almost there . I almost have a system and routine down . Bear in mind that there are six adults in my household for the foreseeable future so I can only pare down so much for now . I 'm working on new and less $$ living arrangements as I type . <p> @Jacob I live in San Diego , so things are not really very cold ( or hot ) and things do get rather dry . <p> I was thinking about it some more and I think my sweating issue might have something to do with using a back-pack to carry work clothes/food with me to work . Generally my back and shoulder area are the most affected by the sweating ( my riding shirt often does n't  even dry out by the time work is over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding without the backpack so maybe I too would have the appearance of not sweating that much given the wind , speed , etc . <p> @mjukr I know what you mean about soaking shirts . I wrestled in college and used to sweat 8lbs over the course of a 3 hour practice . I would have to change shirts just so I could make it through . <p> Scott said , <p> I look forward to this makeover , Jacob . I stumbled on your site a few weeks ago while searching for sites about simpler living and have been thoroughly enjoying your posts ( past and current ) since . Bring on the ideas ! <p> Courtney said , <p> Hi Jacob , ( this is also my youngest sons name : ) I have been a stalker on your blog for awhile now and get your udates delivered into my email box . I really enjoy your writing and you are spot on with everything . I grew up poor where it was nothing to live on the scraps that Coles threw out . So I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a single mum I lived on $6,000 a year also it can be done and you can still live a good life and yes I was very fit and healthy . I am now married to a wonderful man and have a second son . We live in a house that is much too big ( for me ) yet it is smaller than most here in Australia . My husband and I argued the other night as I am trying to get him to see how he can retire young and we can still have a beautiful life we argued because he stated with verbal force that he had resigned himself to working until he was 65 and that is how it is ( for him ) I am at a loss for words as he is adamant about this . All I could say in reply was he may have resigned himself to that , but I do n't  resign my husband to that life ! So I am fighting a very big up hill battle with this . It is very frustrating to say the least.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will keep struggling with this and hopefully one day my husband will see the light . I cant wait to read more of your insights : ) <p> Its definitely not something I can commit too ( I suppose WANT is the better word ) , but I 'm looking forward to reading along and cutting back in some areas . My current expenses are so far beyond $10,000 a year anything I can reduce would be a huge improvement . <p> Jacob ( Aruba ) said , <p> Hows the 30 day makeover coming along ? I think you made it till day 15 , we are waiting for the second half ! <p> cache said , <p> I was about to ask the same thing . I think Jacob made it through Day 16 . I 'm also anticipating Day 17 30 . Its been a great series . <p> Being a student I already live on approximately $10k but I have no intentions of sticking to that after graduation . I do believe in constraining your desires and I 'm very much looking forward to reading and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not into living on the bare minimum and I 'm fine with not retiring anytime soon = <p> And now I feel stupid for reading an almost 2 years old post and thinking that its a new one Well , at least I can just read the whole guide now . 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @Holme No reason to feel stupid . There 's very little timely stuff here . There is also very little in terms of linear progression . What is stupid is me writing/continuing to write it as a blog rather than a magazine . Some day when I get the time I might very well revamp the entire site as a magazine so I can " resurface " perfectly good old articles without breaking expectations . <p> AJ said , <p> @Jacob : What would be the difference ? 10155 @qwx420155 <p> @AJ I have many posts which are 1-2 years old but which are not read and commented on anymore despite being just as good and timeless as whatever I wrote last week . Due to the blog format , however , these are effectively lost in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a subject I essentially have to write them all over again . With a magazine format I could make a front page out of all the articles I have written on housing . Next day I could change the page to cover some other subject , etc .

But I was still tied to my job and Jacobs ideas about financial independence really started to kick in . I 'd got the quick panic out of the way , but of course that always leads to what next ?

I do not have any other expenses so I plan to live on 30,000.00 a year which will be covered by my pension and social security . I have a 401K plan which will supplement my extras which will not be much as I have been living simple for the last 10 years . Once I sell the house I should be able to live on 10,000.00 a year . Even with my high mortgage I will have a tidy sum for my son after my death . Retirement here I come will be awesome . 10148 @qwx420148 10159
