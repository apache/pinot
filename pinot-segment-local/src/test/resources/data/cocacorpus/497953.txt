There are many activities that people can do as a way to accomplish physical fitness goals , but martial arts combines competitiveness and inherent challenges that many students find enjoyable . <p> However , as is the case with any physical exercise , keeping participants motivated is a key factor . Many people start their regimens with a sense of excitement and fervor . However , this feeling is usually fleeting , and many fall off due to a lack of motivation . For those who own martial arts schools , this is something that you 're likely all too familiar with .

Taekwondo and karate are both sports where individuals want to test their skills against others . By encouraging participation in martial arts events , students will be more likely to increase their training and maintain continued enrollment in classes . <p> Highlight the importance of setting a routine : People are creatures of routine .

Everyone likes to be recognized for a job well done , but this is especially important in such a demanding task as martial arts training .

The user friendly interface allows for anyone to be able to use the software . <p> We chose Kicksite for a couple specific reasons . Its customizable to our needs . As an ATA school that teaches other programs ( BJJ , Fitness Classes , Yoga , Zumba ) , it was important to us that we were able to create our own belt structure and have the ability to have one student in multiple programs . Kicksite made that all too easy . Also , the ability to use a tablet at our front counter for student attendance and then have automatic " miss you " emails sent out frees up time for myself and my staff to focus on better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use Kicksite , Melissa and the other Kicksite staff have gone above and beyond to take me from a beginner user to expert .

@@106599565 @1999565/ <h> Share Now ! <p> Summer can be a rough time of year for martial arts businesses . With school out , families schedules change , and parents are often no longer interested in weekly afternoon classes . Veteran martial arts teachers know all too well the summer doldrums where it seems like all of the hard work you put into grooming new students goes out the window as soon as that final school bell rings . <p> With fewer prospects for revenue , just getting through the summer in relatively solid financial shape can be a scary proposition . It does n't  have to be that way , though . The summer is actually a golden opportunity to not only drive more revenue- but to roll right into fall with more students than ever before . How ? By holding a martial arts day camp . <h> Why martial arts summer camps just make sense <p> Day camps are wildly popular during the summer , and with good reason : They give kids a fun , safe place to go to when their parents are at work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weekly afternoon classes are so successful during the school year because they fit perfectly into a familys schedule like a well-placed Tetris piece . You cant expect to continue that successful game plan when those schedules change dramatically , though . You have to tweak your approach and give parents a compelling alternative to summertime mainstays like swim practice , Little League and soccer camp . <p> According to the American Camp Association , 14 million children attended camp in the- U.S. as of 2013 . That 's a big , lucrative market to tap into . Moreover , enrollment rates for camps across the- U.S. remain steady . In 2016 , the ACA found that 82 percent of camps saw their enrollment either increase or stay the same over the previous five years . In addition , half of all camps were operating at close to max capacity ( 90-99 percent ) . <p> As veteran studio owner Mike Massie noted , martial arts summer camps are virtually recession-proof too . Parents are more likely to look for full-time jobs when financial hardship strikes , and that means theyll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send their kids while they 're at work . <p> Parents need a place for their kids to go all day during the summer . That 's where a martial arts camp comes in . <h> Revenue opportunities abound in the summer <p> Martial arts businesses stand to make a ton of additional revenue by holding day camps of their own throughout the summer . How much extra dough can you expect to rake in ? Well , that depends on a number of factors , including potential costs like bringing in seasonal staff to help with the added workload or offering a transportation service to get kids to and from the camp . <p> Do n't  let shouldering additional expenses turn you away from the summer camp business model , though . Keep in mind that your rates will increase commensurately and as many schools have found , parents are more than willing to pay the extra expense for a full- or even half-day summer martial arts camp . According to the Martial Arts Teachers Association , school owners can expect to bring in anywhere from $30,000 to $50,000 of extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sting out of any attrition from your regular weekly classes . Speaking of which <h> Its so fly when students stop by for the summer <p> " Offer group rates and promotions for students who sign up friends . " <p> Summer camps are great opportunities to stave off the dreaded " were taking a break " talk with parents . When sketching out their childrens list of summer activities ( Little League , swim team , etc. ) , parents may find that there just is n't space for weekly martial arts classes . Offering a summer camp let 's you get ahead of that scenario by providing the same level of exercise and camaraderie as other summertime sports while also providing the life lessons and personal growth you only get through martial arts . <p> If you lay the foundation now , you can seamlessly segue into summer by getting current students excited about continuing their martial arts journey all season long . To provide a little extra enticement , consider offering group rates or promotions for students who sign up a friend or two . <h> Cultivate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp as an opportunity to reach prospective students who might not otherwise have considered martial arts classes . Once they 're at the camp , you can get them hooked on martial arts so they 're begging their parents to sign them up for classes in the fall . To keep up the momentum , you want to be sure that you balance out more strenuous exercises with fun activities , even if they 're not strictly martial arts-related . There 's no reason you cant take a break from the action to play a game of kickball or go swimming , for instance . <p> Another important factor to consider is maintaining a brisk pace of development so new attendees feel like they 're making progress . Accelerated timelines for belt advancement can be helpful here , as are regular skills demonstrations for parents to see how their kids are coming along . When they see how much progress students are making in a relatively short amount of time , those parents will be far more likely to enroll them in regular classes when fall rolls around . <p> If you want to build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowing in all summer long , you should really consider holding your own day camp . There 's no shortage of overwhelmed parents who need a place for their children to go during the day while they work or run errands . Its a fantastic opportunity to improve student retention from school year to school year and begin filling out your fall classes with a new crop of excited students . <p> Do n't  dread the summer embrace it . Make the changes in season and family schedules work for your martial arts business by holding a day camp of your own this summer . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119753 @qwx979753 119777 @qwx979777 119767 @qwx979767 119752 @qwx979752 119755 @qwx979755 119766 @qwx979766 119761 @qwx979761 119764 @qwx979764 119797 @qwx979797 119769 @qwx979769 119759 @qwx979759 119771 @qwx979771 119791 @qwx979791 119788 @qwx979788 119756 @qwx979756 119803 @qwx979803 119798 @qwx979798 119794 @qwx979794 119760 @qwx979760 119792 @qwx979792

While many styles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krav Maga is one of the rare ones that uses the technique- " bursting . " Rather than blocking your opponent and responding , bursting is the process of blocking and attacking at the same time . This will catch any attacker on the street off-guard unless he or she is also trained in Krav Maga ! Since this is taught in the military , there is also a lot of attention paid to disarming your opponent , and maybe even using his or her weapon to stay safe . This will come in handy if you 're approached on the street by a person with a gun or knife , because you not only neutralize the threat , but put him or her into a vulnerable position . This training also places an emphasis on your attackers most vulnerable points the eyes , face , throat , neck , fingers and groin . <p> Jiujitsu If you begin practicing jiujitsu and realize that it seems similar to Krav Maga , that 's because Krav Maga is actually rooted in jujitsu teachings . Judo and aikido are rooted in this style of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ samurais so they could defend themselves even if they were disarmed . While it focuses on defense and attack , the most notable difference between jiujitsu- and other styles of martial arts is the fact that it uses the opponents energy and momentum against him or her . Jiujitsu instructors also spend a lot of time teaching you how to place your attackers in joint locks , which can immobilize them . Brazilian jiujitsu is similar , but- not exactly the same . This style was actually developed for people who are n't  strong enough to pull off a lot of the strength-based moves in traditional jiujitsu . Many of Brazilian jiujistus fight moves take place on the ground , incorporating chokes and joint locks . <p> Aikido Aikido is a Japanese martial art that 's incredibly effective on the street , but also takes a lot of training . Its a very complicated art that 's derivative of- jiu-jitsu practices . In addition to jiu-jistus- joint locks , aikido- focuses heavily on your- movements , mimicking how your body may move in a sword fight . Its a graceful martial art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your opponents strength against him or her . Unlike Krav Maga , since aikido is such a graceful martial art and its self defense purposes certainly come in handy , you 'll also learn a lot about balance and control while studying it . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119803 @qwx979803 119756 @qwx979756 119791 @qwx979791 119798 @qwx979798 119771 @qwx979771 119777 @qwx979777 119753 @qwx979753 119792 @qwx979792 119755 @qwx979755 119764 @qwx979764 119797 @qwx979797 119766 @qwx979766 119767 @qwx979767 119760 @qwx979760 119794 @qwx979794 119752 @qwx979752 119759 @qwx979759 119761 @qwx979761 119769 @qwx979769 119788 @qwx979788

@@106599601 @1999601/ <h> Share Now ! <p> One of the most challenging things about opening a martial arts studio is determining what you should charge . On one hand , you want to turn a profit , but on another hand , you want to make sure you are adding martial arts students and retaining the ones you have . The key is to find a fair price that- compensates you for your space and your or your employees- work . Here are some tips for determining your rates : <p> Figure out the structure Will your studio offer private classes or group classes ? Open studio time ? Will you offer family rates ? Fixed monthly rate for unlimited service ? Will you supply uniforms and belts ? If so , it may be possible to charge a bit more , since students wont have to go out and buy their own . Its important to determine the structure of the studio before even thinking about charges . Not all martial arts services are equal , and there are some that should definitely cost more than others . <p> Consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitness classes- lock their students- into a contract . While this can be a good way to get a lump sum of cash up front , it can prevent people who are n't  sure if martial arts is for them from joining . Consider allowing prospective students to pay per class , at least in the beginning . After all , people are much more willing to shell out $10 than $100 for something they may be on the fence about . This is especially true if you 're gearing your classes towards children . Since kids can lose interest quickly , your studio will appeal more to parents than studios that do n't  offer trial classes or pay-per-class rates . <p> Look at studios around you A martial arts class in Southern California or New York City is sure to be more expensive than a martial arts class in- Nebraska . There 's no set price for the entire industry . Look into other studios in the area to find a comparable rate . Its also important to look at the types of classes and services offered in your area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you would for group enrollment without looking like you 're gouging your students . <p> Stick with what you decide If you choose a price for your martial arts studio membership , you need to stick with the price for quite a while . While you may be sure that you could make more money by bumping dues up $20 or so , it may not work out that way . If your students and members feel betrayed by a quick spike in prices , its very possible that you could lose a lot of business , potentially causing you to make less money than before . If you do decide to raise prices , be sure to give everyone plenty of notice . Your students and studio patrons will also appreciate the transparency and likely stick around despite the price hike . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119761 @qwx979761 119803 @qwx979803 119794 @qwx979794 119756 @qwx979756 119798 @qwx979798 119767 @qwx979767 119764 @qwx979764 119792 @qwx979792 119769 @qwx979769 119766 @qwx979766 119788 @qwx979788 119777 @qwx979777 119760 @qwx979760 119755 @qwx979755 119797 @qwx979797 119759 @qwx979759 119791 @qwx979791 119752 @qwx979752 119771 @qwx979771 119753 @qwx979753

If you want your child to be physically active , a sport is probably at the top of your list . But which ones do you choose ? With so many out there , you and your child might be taking a stab in the dark . Instead of going with popular team sports , like baseball or soccer , consider martial arts . Here are just a few reasons why a martial sport can benefit your child : <p> Goal setting Learning to set and work toward goals are important skills everyone needs . At a young age , your kids are probably just starting to learn how to do this , and discovering the ability can help them succeed in school . Martial arts can help your kids create and achieve goals . <p> Martial arts feature belts , which students are awarded after learning certain skill sets .

This has another byproduct : building self-confidence . <p> Self-awareness Most martial arts classes have a mix of age groups , so your child might be paired with kids a few years older or younger than he or she is . This helps everyone in the class gain more self-awareness . Your kids will see that they can achieve difficult goals the way the older kids can . It 'll also show that younger children can do great things .

@@106599608 @1999608/ <h> Share Now ! <p> Today , anyone who is interested in taking up karate or taekwondo classes can easily find a martial arts school that teaches these specific disciplines . There is no shortage of instructors looking to increase class sizes and overall enrollment . As an owner , it 's important to understand the need to think outside the box and come up with innovative advertising and marketing strategies that set your training facilities apart from the competitors in your area . <p> Unfortunately , for many people who start a business not just a martial arts school their specific area of expertise may lie in a skill or trade . Because of this , they may not necessarily be as strong when it comes to having the knowledge base necessary to run a company that is viable and thrives in the marketplace . This is nothing to be ashamed of simply because there are a number of resources available that can improve anyone 's business acumen . All it takes is an open mind , a willingness to respond to change and a desire to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mindset needed by those who are beginners to martial arts training . <p> Understanding why school growth is stagnant and students leave Students who sign up to take classes at a martial arts school often do n't see their training through to the end . They may feel as if the training does n't meet their needs or that the tuition is just too much to handle . Whatever the case may be , dropouts lead to a decrease in revenue . However , in order to do this , you have to figure out why students voluntarily end their training . <p> According to FightingArts.com , there are a number of factors that cause people to abruptly stop attending classes . The biggest reason is the amount of personal time that must be committed to the activity itself . If students have full-time jobs , taking martial arts classes after they get off work may seem exciting for a while , but it may become impractical . Similarly , this feeling can overcome students of any age group , particularly those with parents who have to shuttle them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall-offs include moving away from the primary training facility , an overall loss of interest or a medical related issue or injury . All of this data must be uncovered to help school owners develop a retention plan to keep class enrollment numbers at a respectable level . Typically , dropouts are n't always sudden . Keeping an eye out for warning signs can result in faster response times when it comes to keeping students on board . <p> Innovative ideas to keep student interest high There are a number of ways for martial arts school owners to keep their classes full and their students maintaining an intense desire to continue their training . Much of this calls for innovative ideas . <p> For example , scheduling training around upcoming holidays is a great way to not only keep things festive , but to ensure that interest remains high . Next month is Halloween . Throwing a costume party and allowing students to participate and also bring their friends particularly those of school age can not only be a fun event , but a great source of referrals . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea for a Halloween garb . Having a party that promotes people to dress up for the occasion is a great way to drum up interest while also raising the reputation of the school with the local community . <p> Another tip referenced in a separate article from FightingArts.com , is to develop a branding strategy that also incorporate promotional efforts . Most businesses strive to be recognized by customers simply by name only . Branding efforts are often undertaken by many companies , but in order to be effective , they require a commitment to service and the delivery of quality products and services . <p> The website suggests filming classes and developing a line of instructional videos that can be sold in the school or online . Additionally , if an owner is so inclined , he or she can write a book that students can purchase and study when they are n't participating in classes . <p> Another tip is the creation of branded merchandise or protective equipment . Placing the name of the school on a karate or taekwondo uniform , along with an eye-catching logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not only can this instill a source of pride , but it can also help create a deeper connection with respect to loyalty that will ensure students continue attending classes . <p> Understanding why students enroll and why they leave is a great way to begin developing strategies to reduce dropout rates . Of course , no martial arts school will have a 100 percent retention rate . However , taking steps to ensure that students see the value of their training while creating methods that invoke feelings of pride in their school can help ensure that the business not only thrives , but grows as well . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119792 @qwx979792 119761 @qwx979761 119794 @qwx979794 119756 @qwx979756 119764 @qwx979764 119803 @qwx979803 119797 @qwx979797 119766 @qwx979766 119771 @qwx979771 119788 @qwx979788 119760 @qwx979760 119769 @qwx979769 119791 @qwx979791 119755 @qwx979755 119777 @qwx979777 119798 @qwx979798 119767 @qwx979767 119753 @qwx979753 119752 @qwx979752 119759 @qwx979759

Although there is some mystery surrounding it , scholars have a fairly good idea of the influences that shaped the practice known today as karate . <p> Beginnings with Bodhidharma Some historians believe that a Buddhist monk named Bodhidharma is responsible for shaping the practice of many modern martial arts , including karate . As legend has it , Bodhidharma developed the earliest forms of martial arts in an effort to create an activity that exercises both the mind and body . The monk traveled all over the East , spreading his teachings in Zen Buddhism wherever he went . His teachings first surfaced in a Shaolin style of temple boxing , but were preserved in the majority of Chinese martial arts . <p> On the other hand , there are plenty of scholars who doubt that Bodhidharma existed at all .

This type of karate was created in 1938 by Gichin Funakoshi . Funakoshi was born in Okinawa , but is credited for helping spread what is now regarded as modern karate all over the world . The name of the first dojo , or school , he opened was " Shotokan . " <p> Old elements preserved today Many of the older elements of the martial art are still preserved in today 's practice .

While there 's no replacing professional marketing or public relations , social media is the ultimate way to get the word out about your martial arts studio , for free . If you have n't begun using Facebook , Twitter , Instagram or Snapchat as a business tool yet , here are a few reasons why you should and how to get started : <p> Become a recognizable name in the community The martial arts community tends to be a friendly , tightly knit one . If you find a few people in your area on social media who are active in the community , you 're likely to find a whole lot more .

Begin by suggesting it to a few people you know who are active in or interested in martial arts , like your current students and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more people who feel the same way will add your organization 's page and check out the services you have to offer . It 's important to keep the page active , so people who have n't experienced your studio firsthand consider it a reputable business , but you also need to know where to draw the line nobody wants to see eight posts from one page clogging their news feed every day . <p> Keep it personal Do n't use stock images or pictures from Google Images when posting on your social media pages . While stock imagery is just fine on your business 's website , social media is a place to be a little more personal . Use pictures of your students , your staff and the studio itself . However , it 's important to get permission from anyone you photograph before you post their picture on the internet . Share your student 's achievements and even news about the community . This is an opportunity to get involved in the neighborhood while also spreading the word about your business . <p> Consider your demographics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people following your page as well as the people running them . Choose one or two to be your business ' main online presence . Think about what makes the most sense for your particular business and the people you 're trying to attract .

However , younger demographics also use Instagram and Snapchat a lot , so these platforms can be extremely useful if you 're trying to get younger people into the studio . Both of these platforms are very image-heavy as well , which is best for a business like a martial arts studio . While some businesses can effectively use Twitter to promote the business , it may be a bit too text-heavy for martial arts or fitness studios . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119764 @qwx979764 119794 @qwx979794 119755 @qwx979755 119771 @qwx979771 119769 @qwx979769 119798 @qwx979798 119759 @qwx979759 119777 @qwx979777 119756 @qwx979756 119791 @qwx979791 119760 @qwx979760 119788 @qwx979788 119752 @qwx979752 119792 @qwx979792 119803 @qwx979803 119753 @qwx979753 119767 @qwx979767 119766 @qwx979766 119797 @qwx979797 119761 @qwx979761

From establishing self-confidence to finding peace of mind to becoming more disciplined , there are tons of benefits of studying a martial art . As you train your students , you may even notice that some show potential for leadership . But how do you spot future leaders ? And should you encourage this talent in them ? Here 's a guide for identifying and helping stand-out students : <p> Why help ? While your main goal as a martial-arts instructor is to teach your students technique , you can also help them in other areas of their lives . Martial arts does more than provide a workout it teaches other skills , as well . What 's more , you are a leader . Part of being a role model involves bringing the very best out of your students . <p> Ronald Reagan said , " The greatest leader is not necessarily the one who does the greatest things . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " By helping your students develop their own potential for becoming leaders , you ensure they 'll , in turn , help their peers . Student leaders show others the ropes , which is always important to have in a martial arts class full of students of varying abilities . <p> How to spot leaders Leaders are n't necessarily the students in your class who are the most skilled in martial arts . Sure , knowing the forms and having good technique will naturally make other students look up to a peer , but other qualities are more important . Good leaders are patient , communicative , empathetic , aware , honest and focused , among other things . <p> Pay attention to how your students interact with each other and you . A student who is devoted to learning and often helps newer martial artists could become a leader for your class . Ask yourself whether a student is doing something you , as the instructor , might do . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119759 @qwx979759 119798 @qwx979798 119761 @qwx979761 119788 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx979771 119797 @qwx979797 119794 @qwx979794 119760 @qwx979760 119791 @qwx979791 119755 @qwx979755 119766 @qwx979766 119777 @qwx979777 119756 @qwx979756 119753 @qwx979753 119764 @qwx979764 119769 @qwx979769

Its also stated that it can take decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But even then , that does n't  mean you 've learned all there is to know about karate . There is always more to learn , and you can enhance the skills you already have . <p> Martial-arts training will help you win fights While many forms of martial arts do teach you valuable lessons in self-defense , other varieties focus more on the physical aspects of the exercise . If you 're interested in learning martial arts solely for the purpose of self-defense , be sure to discuss the teachings with the instructor before committing to the specific class . What 's more , - though martial arts can teach you some valuable self-defense skills , they are n't  always foolproof in street fights- or other situations- in which- you may find yourself in serious danger . According to Survivoropedia , most black belts are n't  trained in specific enough areas to be able to take on dangerous opponents , especially if they 're younger and more physically fit than you are .

If it were , how would people be able to practice it in the studio ? While a forceful self-defense move can certainly debilitate someone who 's putting you in danger , you do n't  have to worry about killing someone with a single kick or punch . This certainly does n't  mean you should fight people left and right- because many moves can seriously injure people .

@@106599736 @1999736/ <h> Share Now ! <p> There are so many forms of martial arts , and while some practices are ancient and others are modern , they all have one thing in common : People who participate in them love them . There are a variety of reasons that martial arts practitioners enjoy doing it . Some reasons are obvious , like the focus the martial art teaches , or the self defense that makes people feel safer . Other reasons are a little less obvious , like the camaraderie that comes with the studio they practice in . Here are a few reasons that people are so dedicated to their martial arts : <p> 1 . Its a confidence booster Martial arts is physically trying , so prolonged practice not only helps you get in shape , but the longer you do it , the better you get at it . Both of these aspects of martial arts make it easy for the sport to help boost your confidence . This is true of any variety of martial arts . Whether a student begins as a child or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill and growing it with the support of your instructor can do wonders for self esteem . <p> 2 . You learn self defense Hopefully , you wont need to use your martial arts skills as self defense , but its always good to have those skills in case a situation arises . While a child definitely should n't take the skills he or she learns in martial arts classes to the playground , an adult who finds him or herself in a dangerous situation , like a street robbery or home break-in , will be happy to have learned the techniques necessary to stay safe without needing a dangerous weapon . <p> 3 . Its a productive way to release energy While people do n't  necessarily feel the need to get into fights , many have pent up stress that they would rather not release in an altercation with another person . Exercise is a great way to let out any anger or aggression in a productive way . Have you ever gone into a kickboxing class or- on a run in a bad mood , and finished as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a little bit of physical activity to get that negative energy out . <p> 4 . It increases focus The physical aspect of martial arts is merely a small part of the overall practice . According to Crow Martial Arts , participating in- martial arts can sharpen your mind , allowing you to focus and learn easier . The stress relieving aspect of martial arts is also a key factor in enhancing focus . For example , how well do you work when other thoughts are racing through your mind ? Martial arts helps you tune out those other thoughts and solely zero in on the practice at hand . Once you learn to do that in your martial arts classes , you can incorporate that mental strength into other aspects of your life . <p> 5 . The social aspect There are few places more supportive than your local martial arts studio . Not only will you get to- know every member of your class , as well as your instructors , but these people- will also support and encourage you throughout your martial arts journey . Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the atmosphere in a martial arts studio , so you 're very likely to become friends with- the people you practice with .

@@106599795 @1999795/ <h> Share Now ! <p> As exciting as it is to practice martial arts , many people want to take their training to another level and pass their knowledge on to others . One way to do this is to open your own martial arts studio . This rewarding experience does n't come without its challenges , though . While the end result is definitely worth it especially when you see how much your students love learning from you there are things you should know before opening your own studio . <p> It 's not cheap Getting a business up and running comes with a lot of expenditures and a martial arts studio is no different . Before you decide to take the plunge , it 's important to research costs , determine your budget and stick to it . According to Champion 's Mind , the five biggest expenses to work into your studio budget include : <p> Insurance : Injuries can happen in many martial arts classes , so you want the business to be protected if a situation arises . There are some providers who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments . Of course , you want to make sure your belongings and the building itself are covered as well . Do n't be cheap when it comes to your insurance ! On the off-chance that you need it , you 'll be relieved that your provider has your back . <p> Equipment : While you wo n't have to purchase hundreds of pieces of equipment before opening , you 'll want to have a good base for your first students . Figure out what 's most important for the style of martial arts you 'll be teaching and purchase that before splurging on unnecessary items . You 'll also need building necessities like a refrigerator , seating for parents , and mirrors for the walls so your students can watch their form . <p> Rent : Rent is pricey just about anywhere , but it 's an absolute necessity . Unless you have the money to drop on a building that you can buy upfront , be sure you factor rent , plus some into your business ' monthly budget . <p> Marketing : Nobody is going to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to network and get the word out before you even open the studio doors . Get people in the martial arts community talking . If necessary , hire an outside entity like an advertising or marketing agency or a public relations professional to build up the hype . <p> Permits : You ca n't just start allowing students to come and go without having the proper permits . Consult with the U.S. Small Business Administration early on in the process to ensure that none of the permits you need are out of your reach . <p> Consider hiring a lawyer While most of us do n't have the budget to keep a lawyer on retainer , a few consultations are never a bad idea when you 're opening a new business , especially if you do n't have any experience . Not only will a lawyer ensure you have all of your permits and licenses , but he or she can also make sure you fully understand everything that you sign from leases to rent . Your lawyer can also help you write waiver and release forms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studios begin with just the owner instructing classes . However , if you 're interested in hiring employees or other instructors , it 's important to make sure you 're working with people you trust . It 's a good idea to make your first employees people you 're already familiar with like family members , friends or people you 've trained with . If you 're going to look outside your social circle , you need to know what you 're looking for . Do you want your instructors to be industry accredited ? If so , you may have to pay them more than you would someone who has n't been accredited . Are you open to hiring people who have n't had a lot of industry experience ? How high of a rank do you want them to have ? According to Fighting Arts , you should also be suspicious of people who claim to have incredibly high ranks , as an eighth , ninth or tenth dan is n't usually obtained earlier than the age of 35 . <p> Though this may seem like a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pride in having a practice space that people love to be in will be well worth it all . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119798 @qwx979798 119792 @qwx979792 119764 @qwx979764 119767 @qwx979767 119761 @qwx979761 119797 @qwx979797 119759 @qwx979759 119766 @qwx979766 119760 @qwx979760 119788 @qwx979788 119769 @qwx979769 119791 @qwx979791 119753 @qwx979753 119752 @qwx979752 119777 @qwx979777 119756 @qwx979756 119771 @qwx979771 119794 @qwx979794 119755 @qwx979755 119803 @qwx979803

@@106599799 @1999799/ <p> We interviewed school owner Adam Spicar to learn more about his school and Kicksite 's impact on his business . <p> Tell us a little about your school . My wife Lucie and I opened our school in May 2008 in Southlake , Texas ( a suburb of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area ) to teach traditional taekwondo . We teach kids starting as young as 4 all the way through adults and currently have about 260 students . <p> Why did you decide to open a martial arts school ? I fell in love with it when I started training in 2003 . I had a job in web design and thought martial arts would be a good outlet and exercise for me . The first moment I stepped on the mats I thought Wow , this is cool ! ' Within 3 years I had become an instructor and I began to think about a career in teaching martial arts , and by my fifth year I decided it was time to try it out on my own . So I started a school and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning and managing a martial arts school ? Time management . I spend about 6 hours a day teaching class , and I try to cram as much school management work into my day as I can . But I also want to spend time with my family , my wife and 1 year-old son . With such a large school it 's not possible to do that unless I can streamline my systems to the point where things work on their own . And that was one of the reasons that we started using Kicksite . <p> How did you learn about Kicksite ? I met a representative from Kicksite in 2009 when he visited my school and introduced the software . I could immediately see that it looked good , but felt that it lacked some features that were important to me . At that time I was not ready to move forward with Kicksite , but he promised to follow up to discuss how Kicksite software could be modified to be more useful for me . I honestly did n't expect to hear back from him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we had a long conversation about the software and my school 's needs . He took some of my ideas , discussed them with his development team and came back to me and said We can get it done . ' It was very exciting to have a company that was willing to work with me to make my school better and improve their software as well . <p> Were you familiar with or using other school management software systems before you were introduced to Kicksite ? If so , was there anything that appealed or did not appeal to you about those systems ? We were using an offline database system for martial arts schools , but the company was not interested in updating or improving the software . <p> Why did you ultimately decide to go with Kicksite ? The close relationship with Kicksites representative and their commitment to work with me was very important . <p> What features have we implemented that have made your management responsibilities easier ? Targeted messaging , allowing me to filter who I send messages to , is very useful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as my instructors or just my white belts , with a few clicks and it only goes to the groups I select . I do n't have to manually sort through all my students or contacts . Another feature is belt testing events . I can quickly promote all my students that attended and passed a testing event , as well as send those results to my national association without any additional programming or legwork on my end . All I have to do is click a button , again , saving me precious time . <p> How much time do you spend on school management work now , and how does that compare to the time you spent before you began using Kicksite ? Well , I still spend about 6 hours a day managing the business , but our school has also grown significantly since we started using Kicksite . So ultimately it has allowed me to do a lot more with that time and has allowed my business to grow without increasing my workload . <p> Is your business growing ? We have been open for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning we have about as many students as our location can handle . However , we are very happy with the current size of our school and have no immediate plans to expand the business . I 'm incredibly proud of having 80 black belts and 20 instructors that are fantastic and hard working individuals . <p> Do you have any major goals for your business ? Retention is a major focus for us , as well as building our students to black belt level , higher degrees of black belt and helping them open their own schools if they so choose . <p> Just as you are looking to grow and improve so are we . On that note , is there anything you would you change or improve about Kicksite if you could ? Aside from a few minor technical issues , I am very happy with the system . <p> Service is one of our top priorities . How do you feel about the quality of training , support and customer service provided by Kicksite staff members ? Both the system and service is great . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a real person . And if not , I quickly hear back from them . <p> What would you say to others who are not using Kicksite or perhaps not using a school management system at all ? I often speak with other schools in my association and I tell them that they are missing out the benefits of using Kicksite , including not only the features , but also the excellent support . However , thanks to me there are many schools in Taekwondo America using Kicksite now . I also point out the Facebook social integration component to them , which I have n't seen with any other systems , and is incredibly useful to bring new students in and create buzz about our school . As someone who has been using Kicksite for years , I am also willing to help other school owners learn to use Kicksite , which is like more free tech support ! <p> Do you feel that Kicksite is a good value ? Yes , even with a monthly payment with Kicksite compared to the one-time cost of our previous software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the business smoothly , is well worth the cost . <p> Is there anything else you would like to say about the Kicksite system ? I 'm very excited about how far Kicksite has come and how useful it is for my school .

@@106599807 @1999807/ <p> We interviewed Owner/Manager Ann Cheon to learn more about the school her father founded and how Kicksite has modernized their business operations . <p> Tell me about your school My school is YIC Taekwondo , which stands for my father , Grandmaster Young In Cheon . He opened the school 1991 in Diamond Bar , California ( Los Angeles metropolitan area ) , and we have been teaching here for over 20 years . Our membership generally fluctuates around 250 students but we 're aiming to surpass 300 students . We focus on traditional taekwondo and Olympic-style sparring , teaching students from 3 years old through adults . I took over managing the school about six years ago . <p> Why did you decide to open a martial arts school ? My father trained in taekwondo as a child in Korea and became a well known competitive fighter . He was on taekwondo teams in high school and college , eventually coaching the ROK ( Korean national military organization ) . He moved to the U.S. and got married , eventually moving to Diamond Bar . With his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately decided to follow his passion and open his own school to teach martial arts . <p> How did you get involved in the business ? This is a family business , and both my father and brother are instructors . As the oldest daughter of a traditional Korean family I am responsible for taking of the family , whether it be my siblings or perhaps even the family finances . My father is an extremely nice guy , but probably not the strongest businessman . He knows and loves the sport and has taught at some of the highest levels , including coaching the US National Team in the 2000 Olympics . But when it comes to business , he 's just too nice . I was brought in to help with the business part-time after graduating college , but quickly fell in love with managing the school and became the full-time office manager . My degree in Communications helped me with a lot of the major aspects of running the business , and I focused on modernizing the business . We did a lot of work with paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology into the business by implementing school management software and using social media like Facebook . <p> What do you like most about your job ? I 'm really proud of our program and what we 're teaching . I 've had pushy sales jobs in the past , and with taekwondo I do n't have to do any of that . The benefits of taekwondo sell themselves . The parents love what we teach , they love what we 're about . Their children become more respectful and happy , they start bringing home good grades . I love being able to come into work and meet families and work with kids in a fun family environment . And I love coming up with creative ways to generate new prospects . <p> What does being a martial arts business owner mean to you ? Generally the average student lifespan is about 18 months . I like seeing the transformation of students during that time . I like seeing them go from being shy to being a leader . I like seeing children develop respect for their instructors , peers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their character in the developmental stages of their life is a big deal , and I 'm proud to be a part of that . When I was young , I did n't understand that . I merely saw it as exercise . Only after working at the school did I start to realize the importance of our school and the effect each student transformation has on our community . <p> What are the greatest challenges of owning and managing a martial arts school ? For me , being part of a family business is a challenge . I think managing your own business of any kind is a challenge . There 's no guaranteed paycheck . For us , getting new students in the door and retaining them is difficult . Kids get bored quickly and it is n't always easy to motivate them to aim for that black belt . From on operations standpoint , there 's just not enough time in the day to get everything done . In addition to the marketing and advertising activities ( booking demonstrations , working with school systems , planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I still have to do all the day-to-day management of existing students . <p> How did you learn about Kicksite ? I met a representative from Kicksite at an event and instantly felt like he was a very friendly , genuine person . And I could tell that he truly believes in his product . It made me more inclined to learn more about the software . <p> What do you love about Kicksite ? I am very impressed about just how much the software does to help me manage the business , like having an assistant manager . I can run reports on active and inactive students , look at financial data , and keep track of student details . It 's a great tool for me to track the daily flow of students via the reports and dashboards , which I use in staff meetings <p> I encourage all my staff to add comments on student user profile pages to get more out of the program and it helps me monitor the school whether I 'm in New York , Korea or even at home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checking in and seeing the awards they 've received , and the parents love being able to log in as well to see how their children are doing . <p> Since you focus specifically on managing the school and not teaching , how has Kicksite saved you time or positively impacted your management workload ? Kicksite has allowed me to prioritize and simplify much of my work , such as eliminating the hassle of attendance cards which easily took up an hour of my day before . The attendance report quickly tells me who has n't been attending class which is great . Sending out targeted emails by age , program or belt color in just a few clicks saves us time and allows us to keep in touch with our students better . And the automated communication tools give our school a more professional appearance to our students and their families , and it 's so easy for us to do that . <p> Is your business growing ? The business has n't been growing recently , mostly due to my other duties coordinating tournaments and state championship events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on growing the business . But my immediate focus is back on the school and I expect us to grow this year . <p> Do you have any major goals for your business ? ( Growth , expansion , retention , etc . ) Actually , we are planning to expand to a second location this year and Kicksite is a big reason for that . I 'd like to open more schools or provide career opportunities for our black belts if they want to open their own schools . I read a lot of business books that say you should n't have to be a slave to your job , and helping others achieve career independence while gaining my own financial freedom is definite long-term goal . <p> As for the future , are there immediate challenges do you believe your business will face in the next year or two ? ( Competition , economy , etc . ) We are in constant competition with other seasonal sports like soccer and football , which sometimes cause our attendance to decline . We 're surrounded by other martial arts studios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we 've been here for over 20 years and have earned a reputation for excellent service and teaching , so competitively we are doing ok . <p> Service is one of our top priorities . How do you feel about the quality of training , support and customer service provided by Kicksite staff members ? I 'm 100% pleased . Kicksites representative has been wonderful and the other members of the staff that have helped us with the initial training and walkthrough . I know that there are video tutorials available , but I did n't need them because the system was so easy to learn . <p> What would you say to others who are not using Kicksite or perhaps not using a school management system at all ? I think it is a really great program for any school owner . I know that many older school owners are technology averse , but if they only realized that Kicksite can make their lives so much easier . I think a lot of owners may also be scared to try something new , or they also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate Kicksite and try to persuade them by pointing out what they are getting in return for the price . I encourage them to visit the website and take a demo or try the trial period to get a taste of it , as it has definitely saved me a lot of time . <p> Is there anything else you would like to say about the Kicksite system ? Thanks to Kicksite , our customer service and communications have become more professional , we have a lot more time on our hands to focus on important work , we are more aware of how much money we are making thanks to reports . Overall , we are very happy with Kicksite and I look forward to seeing how the software will help us grow as we move towards a second location . 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119769 @qwx979769 119753 @qwx979753 119766 @qwx979766 119788 @qwx979788 119792 @qwx979792 119760 @qwx979760 119797 @qwx979797 119767 @qwx979767 119771 @qwx979771 119764 @qwx979764 119791 @qwx979791 119752 @qwx979752 119777 @qwx979777 119756 @qwx979756 119794 @qwx979794 119755 @qwx979755 119803 @qwx979803 119761 @qwx979761 119798 @qwx979798 119759 @qwx979759

Fortunately , martial arts are one activity that can benefit both your body and mind . Physical activity is generally great for people 's emotional states , but martial arts in particular encourage the kind of introspection and emotional control that can dramatically improve mental health . Practicing could have a marked effect on your mood and stress levels , as well as give you the tools to maintain a healthy mental perspective going forward . Here are just a few of the ways martial arts can benefit mental health : <p> Improves physical health <p> Though mental health affects how your brain thinks and feels , it can often have roots in how your body is functioning . Poor physical health can have an awful impact on your mental health . This can be direct for example , if you experience chronic pain or an illness , the symptoms of that condition can wear on your mental state . However , it can also be more subtle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chemicals that reduce stress and increase happiness . Without activity , these chemicals are n't released , and your mood drops . <p> The great thing about physical activity as a risk factor for mental health is that you can change it . Many people find that exercising more often has a significant effect on their emotional state . Picking up a physical hobby like martial arts gives you a regular source of physical activity , as well as guidance to ramp up the difficulty level at the appropriate rate . This means you do n't have to worry about potential injury from overexertion , which can discourage you from continuing . Instead , you can make healthy habits that will last . <p> Builds confidence <p> Most physical activities increase confidence in one way or another , but martial arts are built on a foundation of encouraging self-trust and self-awareness .

For example , anxiety disorders often trigger a malfunction of the fight or flight response , which releases adrenaline . Since there 's no genuine threat , there 's nowhere for that energy to go , and as a result , the sufferer can crash , and the leftover adrenaline can manifest as stress , as well as physical symptoms . Any exercise can provide an outlet for this , but because martial arts is so explosive , many find it an ideal choice . Practice makes for a great way to work through any kind of powerful emotion , be it stress , sadness , anger or fear . <p> Encourages emotional awareness <p> The most important and unique thing martial arts offer to one 's mental health is emotional awareness and control . Unlike many other sports , martial arts actively calls for introspection . Practitioners are asked to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This practice of actively checking in with one 's mental state , when done regularly , carries well beyond class time . Eventually , it becomes a habit martial artists bring with them at all times . Emotional awareness is a powerful tool , and martial artists learn to hone that tool and use it to their advantage . This is useful for anyone , but it can make a world of difference for someone dealing with mental illness . <h> Categories <h> Archive 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119777 @qwx979777 119771 @qwx979771 119760 @qwx979760 119759 @qwx979759 119764 @qwx979764 119761 @qwx979761 119767 @qwx979767 119752 @qwx979752 119803 @qwx979803 119792 @qwx979792 119798 @qwx979798 119791 @qwx979791 119753 @qwx979753 119797 @qwx979797 119756 @qwx979756 119755 @qwx979755 119794 @qwx979794 119788 @qwx979788 119766 @qwx979766 119769 @qwx979769

@@106599845 @1999845/ <p> In this Kicksite Success Story , we feature Olathe Karate Academy , owned and operated by the husband and wife team of Jamie and Ashleigh Palmer . We spoke with Jamie to learn more about what has made his business successful . <p> Tell us a little about your school . We are primarily an Okinawan-style Kenpo school , but we have a jujitsu system and a weapons system . We also do a couple of fitness classes : Power-Fit Kickboxing and Power-Fit Yoga . We teach students as young as 3 and 4 years old in our Karate Kubs program . I opened the school in 1999 with my instructor , Dean Kennedy , and bought him out and took full control of the school a year later . We currently have about 260 or 270 students , but we have been as high as 300 students . <p> Why did you decide to open a martial arts school ? Well , I have studied music and martial arts since I was a child . Since graduating college as a piano performance major I have chased the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very steady income . I looked to martial arts to bring in a more consistent paycheck , and when my instructor decided to expand we went in on this location together . As a new school , it wasn-t profitable enough income to split between two owners , so it worked out better for my instructor to focus on the first school while I took over this school . We-ve had our ups and downs , jumping way up then dropping back down in 2005 and 2006 . We moved from the middle of this shopping center to our current corner location and that helped . <p> What do you like most about your job ? Helping people , creating leaders and bringing families closer together . Obviously martial arts has both self-defense and fitness aspects , but it also teaches important values such as discipline , focus , confidence and goal setting . I try to teach in a way that sends my students out into the world more confident and positive than when they came in . And I think that is what has helped my school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me teaching every class to having a team of leaders , including my wife Ashleigh who is my second in command as well as team of 5 or 6 other instructors who are helping teach these martial arts and instilling the values in our students . <p> For families we only have two rates , so if parents are bringing their children in and realize they can train alongside them for the same price then we-re creating a shared experience . Sure you can take your kids to play soccer , but you-ll only be able to watch from the sidelines . This is something where mom and dad can get out there on the mats with their kids and do it together . <p> How did your wife become part of the business and how does that impact your ability to run the school ? My wife was a student , probably the best female I-ve ever trained , and we just clicked . She has trained for over 10 years and she brings a lot of complementary qualities to my own management style . And since martial arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a wife that cares about this as much as I do . She had the idea to start the Karate Kubs program , which I never would have done on my own . She also helped revitalize our Power-Fit program , which I don-t enjoy teaching quite as much as the traditional classes and self-defense . She-s also great for dealing with some of the younger students that may be a little more intimidated by me . <p> What are the greatest challenges of owning and managing a martial arts school ? Growing and managing the business side of things . I think that-s the part that people underestimate . People see my car here at 9:00 AM knowing that I teach until 9:00 PM and ask me what I-m doing . Well , someone-s got to pay the bills . I probably teach only 30% of the time and the other 70% of my time is focused on marketing and operations . When I talk to younger students who are considering starting their own school I tell them - " You better love it because it-s not always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes , and you can have some tough ones and you have to be ready for both sides of that coin . <p> How did you learn about Kicksite ? About 4 years ago , a representative from Kicksite stopped by my school and introduced the software to me . He had a trial offer , so we decided to give it a shot . We quickly grew to love it . We were one of the first clients , so we corresponded closely early on , discussing features and making suggestions to make it more useful . And they kept making it better and that-s why we stuck with them . For example , the attendance function now has a counter that tells me how many classes they have attended at their current rank so I know when they-re due for their next promotion . Were you familiar with or using other school management software systems before you were introduced to Kicksite ? If so , was there anything that appealed or did not appeal to you about those systems ? No , we were just using cards with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was very tedious and inefficient compared to what we do now . <p> Why did you ultimately decide to go with Kicksite ? For me it was a no-brainer . It was cheap at $99/month to start , and for the amount of time it saved me it was an easy decision . With more time I can do more private classes or spend more time at home with my family . Another reason that I liked Kicksite initially was that it was designed and developed by martial artists , and I could discuss features with them and they would understand why I would want something to function differently . <p> What elements/features of the Kicksite platform were most appealing to you in the beginning ? The attendance feature is very useful . My old instructor still uses attendance cards in a box and I laugh because I can-t imagine going back to managing attendance that way . We have classes of 40 back to back and if I had to manually take attendance I-d be losing 10 minutes per class . <p> What other features have you implemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence feature works well . For example , the automated absent student message starts a dialogue with students and families that haven-t been to class recently , and I get email responses , which I can then respond to personally . They don-t realize the first message is automated and it helps me develop my relationship with new students and families . Even the older students like receiving those automated messages , as it reminds them to reprioritize their martial arts training . <p> The prospecting follow-up reminders are also very useful because they help me keep tabs on my prospects . I-ve had prospects that I-ve worked on for years that finally came in , loved the classes and signed up the whole family for 18 months . That makes it all worth it . <p> The student user accounts are also great . Now that I have a larger teaching staff , sometimes I teach classes where I don-t know all my students . When that happens , I can quickly cycle through the students checked into the class to put a name to the face without having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . On a similar note , we can look at past correspondence or comments to quickly get caught up on a student-s history should any issues arise . It also helps me and my wife stay aware of everything that-s happening in our school without having to be there all hours of the day . And since it-s web-based I can even log in while on vacation to see who-s coming to class or what else is going on while I-m gone . <p> Is your business growing ? We-ve grown through the recession , partially due to moving to our current corner location which not only gave us more square footage but also greater visibility . My wife and my team of instructors have also played a part in our growth . Our school enrollment jumped quickly when we started using Kicksite because we started doing things differently . It allowed me to change the business model to allow for month-to-month or other short-term membership arrangements to get people in the door , and automating the renewal process to keep our retention high . I wouldn-t have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reports that help me keep track of everything and it-s definitely raised our bottom line . <p> Do you have any major goals for your business ? My push for 2013 is to get us back over 300 students . I think our school has a capacity of around 350 without sacrificing quality , so I think it-s realistic . I-d like to add a few more instructors as well . I don-t have any immediate plans to expand , as it-s not an easy business to duplicate . It-s certainly not a pizza chain where I can teach anyone to make the pizza . As for the future , are there immediate challenges do you believe your business will face in the next year or two ? I know that MMA is growing , but I-m not really worried about it affecting my business because that-s not the demographic I-m going after or the direction that I-m going with my business model . I-m focused on families . I-ve enjoyed watching a lot of taekwondo schools come and go over the last 14 years . At one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I-m still here and still growing . <p> What would you say to others who are not using Kicksite or perhaps not using a school management system at all ? Just give it a try . It really is simple to use . The hard part is convincing those that aren-t using it that it-s worth it . I know from experience that it-s worth it , but that-s the hurdle . I-d be willing to offer a 2 or even 3-month trial to get people to try it because I-m confident they won-t want to give it back after that . 119775 @qwx979775 119763 @qwx979763 119762 @qwx979762 119753 @qwx979753 119797 @qwx979797 119756 @qwx979756 119792 @qwx979792 119791 @qwx979791 119764 @qwx979764 119777 @qwx979777 119798 @qwx979798 119769 @qwx979769 119771 @qwx979771 119752 @qwx979752 119760 @qwx979760 119766 @qwx979766 119761 @qwx979761 119803 @qwx979803 119759 @qwx979759 119794 @qwx979794 119755 @qwx979755 119788 @qwx979788 119767 @qwx979767
