
 Top of US 200 Breaststroke Pile <p> The question has been asked repeatedly over the past year . With Brendan Hansen enjoying a second round of retirement , who was going to step up and carry the breaststroke mantle for the United States ? All along , Kevin Cordes ' name has been mentioned as a leading candidate . On Wednesday night at the United States National Championships , Cordes confirmed he 's the new go-to guy . <p> A few months removed from tearing up the short-course season for the University of Arizona , Cordes blasted his opposition in the 200 breaststroke , recording the fastest time in the world this year with a performance of 2:08.34 . Cordes flirted with the world record for the first 150 meters and was under the pace for a global standard heading into the final lap . However , he could n't maintain the blistering speed required for a world mark . <p> Nonetheless , Cordes was phenomenal and surely has raised eyebrows around the world , primarily those of Hungary 's Daniel Gyurta , the reigning Olympic champ , and Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games . World-record holder Akihiro Yamaguchi probably took notice as well . En route to his career-best mark , Cordes uncorked splits of 28.91 , 1:01.22 and 1:34.25 . <p> After the NCAA Championships , Cordes ' identity skyrocketed . Still , he had to drop some big-time performances in the long-course pool to cement his status as the next elite breaststroker from the United States . That obstacle has easily been cleared . Now , we can look forward to Cordes ' 100 breast , which is arguably his better event . A clocking in the realm figures to be doable . <p> Earning an individual bid to the World Champs was B.J. Johnson , who qualified for Barcelona with a time of 2:10.09 . Johnson has had a strong tuneup season and placed ahead of Nic Fink , who took third place in 2:10.97 . Olympian Clark Burckle was fourth in 2:11.70 , well off his personal best . <h> Comments <p> Bjarnason June 27 , 2013 <p> Going from 13-14-15 to 19 strokes in the last is what made that " only " very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing kick , and he can glide like no one else .

 Inky Is Back In The Swim <p> Inge de Bruijn , Sydney 2000 triple Olympic champion who doubled up twice four years on in Athens , is back in the swim : the Dutch sprint Diva has confirmed her entry in the free at the European Masters Championships set for Eindhoven . Speculation will run wild : is she back for the big fight or just to keep fit and brush up on her celebrity credentials ? Will she enter the FINA World Cup in the same pool in Eindhoven as a warm-up in early August ? The answer to the latter , as yet , is no : for that she would have had to have rejoined the anti-doping pool several months ago and signed up to a regime of answering the knock at ungodly hours of the day to provide a sample in a bottle . Perhaps not Inky 's style these days . As far as hunting down Olympic and World titles goes these days , the closest De Bruijn gets is the speed of her commentary for Dutch TV up in the media stands . Photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Exposes Post-Games Vulnerability of US <p> Olympic champion Allison Schmitt 's miss in the freestyle at World Championship trials in Indianapolis this morning represents one of those moments when the aquatic superpower feels its vulnerability in post-Games year . <p> Whatever the reason for Schmitt Photo : USA Swimming falling shy of best and ending up on a 1:59.78 in 10th place a day after missing the cut for the final , her absence from the world-title fight in Spain next month presents an opportunity for other nations . Straight and simple : yes , the USA has Missy Franklin and others capable of stepping in and up but a 1:53.61 swimmer is not easy to replace and will be significant when the women 's 4x200m free quartets take to their blocks in Barcelona . <p> Career , college and life adjustments follow Olympic season and can rip up form guides faster than Schmitt 's reaction time off her blocks this morning .

 May Be Out For The Summer <p> Cameron van der Burgh , Olympic breaststroke champion , sustained a knee injury at the Nilox Cup yesterday and may miss the World Championships in Barcelona , depending on medical advice when he gets home to South Africa . The world record holder was due to have remained in Europe throughout July and until the end of the FINA showcase in Spain but today he pulled out of the French Open in Vichy at the weekend and tweeted " hope to be back by world champs " . Hope dies last . Van der Burgh , who was to have raced in Vichy before heading down to Monte Carlo for some royal hospitality on the way to Spain , would be a big miss in Barcelona in both the 50 and , his potential absence in a season in which he had yet to break the minute making Australian Christian Sprenger 's position all the more dominant at the helm of the world rankings . <h> Sun Yang switches coach <p> After a winter of disruption and reconciliation with his coach in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world champion Sun Yang has switched coach from Zhu to former Chinese head coach Zhang Yadong in Hong Kong . " I will get rid of all distractions and go all out to prepare for the worlds , " the Olympic freestyle winner wrote on his blog . Zhang is quoted by Xinhua as saying : " He is focused and finding back his form . " Sun became the first Chinese man to win an Olympic swimming title and for good measure made it two , and in London last year . Zhang played down talk of of Sun only racing in two events at Barcelona world titles at the end of July , stating that his new charge was " fast getting in shape " . The very suggestion will surely be received with a belly laugh from the rest of the world of swimming : Sun is world No1 this season in the 200 ( 1:44.99 ) , 400 ( ) and 1500 ( ) this year . <h> Schlanger to bypass Barcelona <p> Melanie Schlanger , a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has withdrawn from the World Championships squad citing a disrupted season of illness and injury for her decision .

Her struggle was capped by a viral infection and Schlanger ( pictured , left , with fellow London 2012 relay champions Swimming Australia ) scraped onto the team but was far from being at her best . Her woe left her with " about a week of race-specific training since April " . As she put it to media Down Under : " It 's not enough .

 Speed Awaits Morozov 's Next Move <p> It can be argued that the sport is either in the middle , or on the verge , of a Golden Age of sprinting . The roster of speedsters backing up that view are stacking up nicely for a battle royal at world titles in Barcelona , the one-way free-for-all known as the splash and dash among moments awaited like the rain . Florent Manaudou . Nathan Adrian . James Magnussen . Cesar Cielo . Anthony Ervin . Fred Bousquet . It 's a pantheon of stars , all with impressive credentials and four of them will line up in Vichy this weekend . Then there 's the upstart and youngest of the group : Vladimir Morozov . <p> A standout in the American high school ranks after moving to the United States from Siberia as a 14-year-old , Morozov has long been tabbed as a future star in the sport . Really , he already holds that status , having won gold in dominant fashion in the 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle at the 2012 World Short Course Championships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual medal in long-course competition at international level , an opportunity which will present itself at the end of the month . At the World Championships in the Catalan capital , Morozov representing Russia will contest the 50 freestyle , 100 freestyle and 100 backstroke . He has a chance to raise his global standing and profile . He knows the quest will be daunting . <p> " The sprints are very stacked and what makes it even more exciting is that more than half of the swimmers in that final heat are going to have a chance to get the gold , " says Morozov . <p> As successful as Morozov has been over the past several years , the 2013 campaign has been a breakthrough season . Not only did he tear up the NCAA Championships for the University of Southern California , capturing a sprint double , he shot up the world rankings at the Russian National Championships . They were held in Kazan , site of the 2015 World Championships . Morozov menaced the best in the worlds with efforts of 21.72 in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times currently rank sixth and second in the world , respectively . <h> The Time Was Right To Race For Russia <p> Oh , how the United States would love to have had Morozov 's services , and at one time it was a possibility . As the 2012 Olympic Games in London neared , Morozov looked into the possibility of representing the United States . However , he learned it was n't possible until the next Olympiad , for which Morozov did not want to wait . As a result , he reached out to his homeland . <p> " There was n't much thinking involved , " Morozov said of his country choice . " My ultimate goal was to compete at the 2012 Olympic Games . Since I lived in the U.S. from the age of 14 , finished high school and studied at a university in the U.S. , I decided to ask whether it was possible for me to go to Trials and possible represent the U.S. <p> " After I was told that was impossible , I got in contact with my now Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made the Russian National Team to compete in the World Championships in Shanghai ... I am satisfied how everything played out . " <p> Morozov trains the majority of his time under Dave Salo , his college coach , with the Trojan Swim Club . While he 's in Russia , takes the reins of Morozov 's career . Salo , of course , has put together one of the most impressive training groups in the world , a collection of Olympic and World Championships medalists . As for , he mentored Olympic champions Denis Pankratov and Evgeni Sadovyi and was the mastermind behind the golded 1992 Russian 4x200m freestyle relay that swam under the banner of " the Commonwealth of Independent States " at a time when the Soviet bloc was breaking up . Obviously , Morozov is receiving some fine knowledge from the deck . Whether that translates to hardware in Barcelona will soon be determined . <p> As a tune-up for the World Champs , Morozov will be racing next week at the World University Games in Kazan , his efforts perhaps serving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World Championships , he 'll likely need to be 21.50 for the 50 free and in the 100 free to contend for a medal . Based on the way he 's been performing and improving , such times are not beyond reach . <h> Russian Relay Rockets <p> Then comes relay duty . Russia heads into the 4 ? 100 freestyle relay as one of four nations with a legitimate chance at the gold medal , along with France , Australia and the United States . In pursuit of that highly valued title , Morozov will unite with Nikita Lobintsev , Danila Izotov and Andrey . It 's a formidable foursome . <p> " There seems to be just about the same story in the 400 free relay as in the 50 free , " says Morozov ( pictured middle with podium placers in Istanbul , Australian Tommaso D'Orsogna and Russian teammate Evgeny Lagunov ) . " Four out of eight in the final are going to have a shot . We have a solid team going into that relay . All four are 2008 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all we are lacking is a 47.5 leadoff , but we also know how to catch up . " <p> It 's not surprising that Morozov 's name is frequently mentioned in close proximity to that of the Sprint Tsar , Alexander Popov . Discussing Morozov 's ability in the light of the greatest sprinter in history is a way of clarifying the vast potential of the rising star . Morozov was too young to idolize Popov , who had retired by the time the Trojan from Siberia became wrapped up in the sport . Instead , Morozov 's connection to and appreciation of Russian swimming is focussed on his first coach , Igor Demin . As Morozov has matured , he has also caught up and grown to appreciate the outstanding and unique achievements of Popov . <p> One day , perhaps , Morozov will also boast the Olympic crowns that Popov won four of at successive doubles in 1992 and 1996 . As for the drive and motivation it takes to reach that level , Morozov is among those at the front of the queue , tangible the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( I 've been ) motivated by time cuts , rankings , competitions and world-class swimming . I always had the drive to achieve more than my competitors . " <p> The next line-up he faces will include folk who think precisely the same thing . World-class sport at its best . <h> Comments <p> Add to those names , Cameron McEvoy , who 's actually more than two years younger than Morozov , and yet almost as fast in the 100 ( 48.0 ) . <p> You are correct , we are either in the middle of golden age of sprinting or at the dawn of it . <p> John Lohn July 5 , 2013 <p> I did n't include McEvoy because I was looking at the 50/100 guys , but your point about his 100 skill is well taken . Going to be an era to enjoy for sure . <p> Justin Thompson July 6 , 2013 <p> That 's too bad Vlad could n't represent the US , but I would n't count him out of the medals or the victory . He always seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would n't do much in the free and then he drops 47.93 earlier this season . <p> July 6 , 2013 <p> Not only men sprinting , but it 's the women sprinting too that enjoys golden age . <p> We are in the midst of great rivalry between Cate and , and not only that , but , Steffen and Halsall are also surging , while we also have younger up and coming of bronte , simone , etc.@@372351 <p> The law requires

That means that he will still be part of the anti-doping testing pool and can be called on at any stage . Given that he will remain based at an excellence centre , he should expect regular anti-doping calls like any other athlete . The alternative would be to remove himself from the anti-doping pool and retire for a second time . <p> An odd situation and one that may well give rise to speculation that his latest statement is part of a exercise .

It was just after I stopped swimming the first time , it took me around two years to recover and I have decided I am not having surgery again .

 Doping Board Issues Supps Warning <p> Cesar Cielo ( BRA ) , who in 2011 was issued a warning after a supplement contained more than the swimmer thought <p> Dr Andrew Pipe , chairman of the FINA Doping Control Review Board , issued a stark warning to all swimmers and other aquatic athletes to stop taking supplements . No athlete needed them , he suggested , while many supplements on the market were manufactured and marketed from the United States in an unregulated environment that was unsafe for elite athletes in the anti-doping pool . <p> Speaking on the eve of eight days of racing in the pool at the Palau San Jordi in Barcelona , Dr Pipe said that the anti-doping regime underway at the 15th FINA World Championships was the most comprehensive in history . " In the course of the last few days we have completed several hundred blood tests with competitors from all disciplines ( swimming , diving , water polo , synchro ) " , he noted as part of the construction of an Athlete Blood Passport scheme of longitudinal profiling of athletes . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitors any unusual deviation from normal readings , most athletes in Barcelona would be called on to take part in the scheme for the first time . The value os data increases the older a profile of an athlete becomes . Whereas the findings of analysis for two or three samples may be compared to a particular population sample of similar age , gender and cohort , there is a point at which the profile for an athlete becomes singular . Deviation from ' normal ' readings raises alarm bells and prompts further inquiry . <p> Testing during competition over the next eight days will included a random call to provide urine and/or blood , samples to be handled by the Barcelona WADA-accredited laboratory , a facility that has handled samples that turned into high-profile cases , such as that of Irish swimmer Michelle Smith , ultimately suspended from the sport for manipulating a test sample . <p> Against the backdrop of a new regime far more likely to catch rogue practices , Dr Pipe urged caution on any supplementation . He said : <p> " We want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other sports . We want to demonstrate to the world that we 're swimming in clean waters . " <p> Dr Pipe 's message reinforced that he delivered yesterday to team leaders attending the Technical Meeting at the 15th FINA World Championships .

Three of the swimmers , Cielo included , were slapped with warnings while Vinicius Waked was suspended because it was his second offence . Cielo was allowed to compete at the Shanghai 2011 World Championships in the week that followed a Court of Arbitration for Sport ruling rejecting a FINA appeal to increase the warning to a suspension . <p> Cielo claimed the freestyle and butterfly world crowns and spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazilian will defend his titles here in Barcelona . <p> In the wake of 2008 at the USA Olympic trials , Jessica Hardy was removed from the American swim team and served a suspension after a positive test that was later judged to also have been caused by a supplement that had more to it that met the eye on a label . <p> " The vast majority of supplements are produced in the USA ; there is no regulation or control of the manufacturing , the ingredients , the labelling nor distribution of these products , " warned Dr Pipe . <p> The athlete is responsible for the nutrition that ends up in his of her body under WADA 's Code and anti-doping rules . Dr Pipe urged athletes to abandon the practice all supplementation on the grounds of safety and also for the simple reason that they were paying for ' help ' that they did not need . " I emphasis that if they have any questions , they should seek answers and they should refrain from taking supplements , " he added . <p> Supplementation among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added . It was now a " religion " . He noted that coaches , federations and those guiding athletes were responsible for " the athlete being prepared to compete but not compromised " .

It was an " ongoing challenge to get the message across " , he suggested . <p> Nutrition " Gurus " tell athletes that they " require " certain supplements when in fact there is " limited evidence to suggest that that is the case " , Dr Pipe added . <h> Diving Deal For FINA World Series <p> Meanwhile , FINA announced a four-year sponsorship deal for the diving world series with Chinese UK-based firm NVC Lighting .

A year later , there was another close call . This time , however , it was Franklin who was celebrating a gold medal in the 200 freestyle at the World Championships in Barcelona . <p> Franklin took her race out with a flourish and appeared to be in a battle with France 's Camille Muffat for the title , only to have to fend off a late charge by Italian and two-time defending champion Federica Pellegrini . Ultimately , Franklin came through , posting a winning time of 1:54.81 , with Pellegrini just behind in 1:55.14 .

Edged for the bronze medal by Australian Bronte Barratt at the 2012 Olympics , Franklin knew she did n't have a lot of margin for error in moving up the global ranks to that No. 1 position . As a result , she and the American coaching staff made the critical decision of scratching the semifinals of the 50 backstroke before the final of the 200 freestyle . The move enabled Franklin to head into the final completely fresh , rather than scrambling after just a 15-minute intermission . <p> As it turned out , Franklin needed every ounce of her energy to deny Pellegrini . While Franklin was more than a second clear of Pellegrini at the and 150-meter marks , the Italian was running down Franklin over the last lap . Had Franklin contested the 50 backstroke , in which she was not guaranteed to be a medalist , perhaps Pellegrini would have gotten to the wall first . <p> " If I had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also been before the relay tomorrow night , " Franklin said . " So with it being right before this and right before the relay , we decided the risks outweighed the rewards for that race . It was fun to swim it this morning , but I think I 'm happy with the decision to scratch . " <p> Instead , Franklin added another chapter to her astounding career , a journey which is obviously still developing and could eventually go down as legendary . The 200 free marked the third gold medal of the meet for Franklin , the affable from Colorado and bound for the University of California-Berkeley in the fall . After helping the United States to gold in the 400 freestyle relay on the opening day of competition , Franklin has won the 100 backstroke and 200 free on back-to-back days . <p> With the first sub-1:55 performance of her career , Franklin equaled the seventh-fastest performance in history and managed the fourth-fastest showing ever in a textile suit . Her victory also demonstrated the growth and development she has made since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was last summer and has remained sharp despite a piling workload . <p> In 2011 , the American did not take on the solo free but leading the USA to gold in the 4x200m relay , she clocked 1:55.06 . That was swifter than the 1:55.58 in which Pellegrini claimed the solo crown . A gauntlet for the long-term had been well and truly thrown at the Italian 's feet . <p> " I knew ( Pellegrini ) was going to have a really strong second 100 , so I tried to take it out with Muffat and stay ahead of Pellegrini in the second 100 , " Franklin said . " I 'm really , really happy with my swim there . You kind of use each swim to motivate the next one . That 's a best time for me . I told myself if I go a 1:54 , I would be the happiest girl alive , so I 'm happy with the 1:54 , and it happened to be a gold medal , too , which I 'm thrilled about . " <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Franklin and Pellegrini were not expected to duel in the 200 freestyle . Pellegrini had indicated she was taking a break from the freestyle events for the year , opting to focus on the backstroke disciplines . When the start lists were released , though , Pellegrini 's name was a welcome sight . <p> The 2008 Olympic champion in the 200 free , Pellegrini along with France 's Laure Manaudou played a huge role in the event 's development . The went from a conservative approach to being dominated by athletes with the courage and confidence to attack from the start . That strategy is now the norm . <p> While Franklin and Muffat stepped on the gas immediately , Pellegrini actually went with a different setup to her race . She lurked in sixth after the first lap , then moved to fifth at the midway point and fourth at the 150-meter mark . Her closing lap was .40 quicker than anyone else in the field . Had she adopted her typical go-get-them style , who knows whether the outcome would have been similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an athlete not even expected to be in the field . <p> " I 'm really surprised with the silver medal , " Pellegrini said . " I 'm very happy with my times , both semifinals and final . It 's been a difficult year and I did n't compete in this event this season , so I 'm really surprised . This is not only a medal , but it 's great news for the future . I did n't train for this race and it means I can do it better next year . " <p> For Muffat , her bronze medal marked a strong bounce-back from the 400 freestyle on the first day of the meet . Muffat looked nothing like the swimmer who struggled mightily over eight laps and went from being a contender for the gold medal to placing seventh . Like Franklin , Muffat surged through the race , sitting first at the quarter pole and second to Franklin after the second and third laps . <p> " I am a bit disappointed because I made some mistakes , " Muffat said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end . But I 'll enjoy the medal because it is from the World Championships . In the next few years , I will remember it with more happiness . " <p> Franklin was her normally bubbly self during the awards presentation , smiling away and singing along to the Star Spangled Banner . She still has four events remaining , the 100 freestyle , 200 backstroke , 800 freestyle relay and 400 medley relay . She has the potential to win three more gold medals , the 100 freestyle the unlikely gold scenario due to the presence of Australia 's Cate Campbell . <h> Comments <p> July 31 , 2013 <p> Congratulations to Missy for her bold attack ; it was risky but paid off . <p> So Muffat admitted that she is n't pleased with the outcome , at least not yet . It 's understandable . I hope she overcomes this quicly and just have fun over the coming days . need Muffat and her marvellous freestyle just like they need Pellegrini and her speedy last 50 's . Pellegrini 's way adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blocks of the Women 's freestyle as , if there are no scratches , it 's bulging with capable names : , Ledecky , Friis , Carlin , Boyle , Muffat etc . Anything can happen . If we saw a fantastic , all the ingredients of a thriller in are standing by . <h> Moto X 10-megapixel 
 Of Raw Speed : 29.48 WR <p> Ruta Meilutyte gives thanks for her second world record of the week Photo : Aniko Kovacs <p> Take in the time : 29.48 . The shiny suit era took an axe to the clock in dash events . In women 's breaststroke the mark was faster when the ban on buoyancy bodysuits came in on January 1 , 2010 , than it had been before poly put the kettle on . It had taken almost a decade to get that margin of gain in the event before 2008 . <p> So when in heats this morning Yuliya Efimova ( RUS ) shaved off the 29.80 world record held by Trojan teammate Jessica Hardy ( USA ) , it seemed as though progress might return to being more measured . <p> Ruta ( LTU ) had other ideas : having split 29.97 on the way to a 1:04.35 world record last Tuesday , she would surely challenge her European record of 29.96 in a race without a turn . <p> The draw will had helped : after Hardy clocked 29.90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air with a knife , tension tangible as Efimova and Meilutyte photo : Aniko Kovacs rose to their blocks . <p> The 16-year-old schoolgirl based at Plymouth Leander and College had scribbled her name on to the starting block for lane 4 in the final by the time the field broke into its stroke only to find Meilutyte in a new class a head and shoulders ahead of them . If her reaction time , consistently under 0.6 and on this evening , had a distinct edge on the rest , the energy unleashed in the keenest twitch fibres in the race provided the momentum for a for our times : 29.48 . <p> " There was no extra motivation from Yuliya 's record earlier today , " insisted Meilutyte , now richer for her two world records . " I did n't swim at 100 percent in the heats this morning and I gave it my all tonight because there are only two swims left at these Championships . " <p> No world record in any event , men or women , has been broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the World Championships in 2001 . Efimova booked lane 5 for the final in 29.88 , the range of the world champion and only woman to have twice broken 2:20 amazing but unlikely to stretch to the pure predator of a sprinter now setting a pioneering pace that her rivals may struggle with for a while yet . <p> A measure of Meilutyte 's dominance can be found in the gap between 1st and 8th qualifier for events on all four strokes among women : <h> Comments <p> August 4 , 2013 <p> Great stats there . <p> One wonders how Efimova feels seeing that time ; in a way maybe she 's just glad Meilutyte held back in the heats , allowing her to get her name briefly back in the record books and of course pick up the money . <p> August 4 , 2013 <p> Gutting for Efimova , but she still has a chance of winning the final tonight ( provided Ruta messes up her start ) . <p> Now she knows how felt breaking the 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to Phelps in a matter of a couple of minutes ! At least she had several hours in the limelight ... poor Andrei ? ? <h> As the world 
 For Masterclass From Meilutyte <p> The opening session of the FINA World Junior Championships in Dubai was graced with swimming nobility in the shape of Olympic and world champion Ruta Meilutyte this morning . On 31.10 in the breaststroke , she was outside her world record yet still a class apart . <p> Over the coming six days in Dubai , Meilutyte will represent a meet within a meet : that she is so much faster than her junior peers on breaststroke simply sets a higher standard , while one of the critical things that sets her apart from the majority of rivals in junior and senior waters is a journey free of the frame of national programmes and the trials and tribulations dictated by selection and funding criteria . <p> Take the past 18 months . Meilutyte , coached , under the guidance of Jon Rudd , and schooled at Plymouth Leander and College in England , was an prospect at the start of 2012 . As a Lithuanian , she enjoyed a clear run at the Games , her schedule aimed entirely at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and racing conducted largely under the radar when it came to **28;139;TOOLONG punditry . <p> And then she went through the rounds of the breaststroke at London 2012 as though she were at her fourth Games with a career of good experience in tow . In the final , she kept Rebecca Soni ( USA ) at bay to become a household name back home and well known far and wide around the world as the who could n't believe the success staring back at her from the scoreboard as she shed tears of joy . <p> Much was made of the ' phenomenon ' at London 2012 . In fact , history is stacked with the stuff , the teen event that stood out more than any other result the last free of Ye Shiwen , 16 , in a medley final that made Olympic gender-comparative history as the Chinese double champion made world champion Elizabeth Beisel ( USA ) look like she was treading water in the first of the closing two laps on freestyle . <p> 's gains were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when viewed with hindsight this side of a World Championships in Barcelona that delivered a 1:04.35 world record photo : Patrick Kraemer in the and a debut world crown in the same range . The same thought applies to the other top teen of London 2012 , Katie Ledecky . Not so for Ye ( who was a sorry sight in Barcelona ) , though the year is young given that the National Games of China are ahead of us . <p> 's 2013 long-course season is nearing its end . The year has been stacked with staged racing : Luxembourg in January ; Brit University Champs as a guest in February ; Leeds for the British Open in March , national league racing in April ; Mare Nostrum in June ; Euro Juniors in July ; World Seniors in July/August ; and now Dubai and the World Juniors . By the time she returns to Europe next week , the young sprinter with one of the most explosive and efficient starts in world waters will have raced more than this year . <p> Part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing and visibility at the heart of preparation ? " I think its possible to race far more than some do , " coach Rudd tells SwimVortex.com . " It comes down to mental resilience . It is part of a toughening process ... that means its not as demanding when you get to the big one , the World Championships . " <p> He pointed to Yuliya Efimova , the Russian who " bounced from meet to meet " on her way to denying two world-record setters from semis in Barcelona a follow-up gold : she claimed the world crown ahead of Meilutyte and the crown ahead of Rikke Pedersen ( DEN ) . <p> The competition between the three women had a twist in the tale : just as Meilutyte 's 29.48 world mark in the semis did not convert to gold , neither was Pedersen 's 2:19.11 global standard in the semis followed by the crown . In both cases , Efimova photo : Aniko Kovacs proved the better racer on the day . <p> Rudd described each of the rivals as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exuberance ; she 's bouncing off the walls and loving every minute of it . I do n't think that even now it has dawned on her just how much she has achieved . " <p> A key ingredient in the success of Pedersen , coached by Australian Shannon Rollason , was technique , said Rudd : " On the Mare Nostrum Tour this year , I watched Rikke closely and she is arguably the all-time best when it comes to having the most economical stroke . The , range , reach , flow of her stroke is superb . " <p> Efimova , coached by Dave Salo in California , is a case apart . " With Yuliya its been something of a resurgence . She 's had a long experience and in the past couple of seasons she 's changed the manner in which she swims . Comparing her now to how she looked at Budapest 2010 European Championships , she had a far more undulating stroke back then : she was the closest thing you could get to ' fly doing breaststroke . She 's much flatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Russian 's double-gold ahead of the world-record holders came down to something that counts more than anything when the heat is on , said Rudd . " Of the three of them , Efimova is the most predatory . By that I mean that had Ruta and Rikke done what they were capable of in the final , they probably would have won but Yuliya found a way to get on terms , make the others do something that left them shy of their very best ... and having done that , say ' this is my race ' . At to go in the 50 final , Efimova 's claws came out and you could see that she sensed she could win . " <p> claimed the middle distance and was clearly the superior force and on her way to a sub 1:04 one day when she can get inside on the return . Her newfound speed a year after stepping up to take an upset Olympic gold ahead of Soni is no fluke . <p> " There are not many youngsters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , the main reasons why both men and women had been able to take on shiny suit times come down to technical aspects . That goes for men and women , with Daniel Gyurta an example of it . " <p> Rudd cites " rhythm , balance and flow " and says that there is such a thing as " Planet Breaststroke " . <p> " Freestyle , backstroke and butterfly are part of a family but breaststroke is an only child : it takes time , patience in coaching and a 24/7 approach to a stroke that when it is bad it is extremely bad . " <p> He puts Meilutyte on a freestyle program when he notices that she has lost her flow on breaststroke . " Its woeful sometimes . There are days when I feel she could n't make the district league final because something has gone wrong with her stroke . " <p> Among tipping points that can make a big difference are physical changes , such as alteration in the shape of the pelvis as a girl develops into a woman . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad habit to take hold so we back off and give it time . There is no point in flogging a dead horse , " says Rudd . <p> Physical changes require adaptation to programs to account for a difference in kick that can alter a whole stroke . Strength and conditioning and " relearning skills " are part of the process of keeping the athlete in the fast lane long-term . " It takes a lot of patience and willingness to think outside the box , " added Rudd . <p> That includes multi-event racing . " I think it is dependent , " says Rudd , noting that regular fast racing does not suit everyone . skipped the World Cups that followed tight on the back of Barcelona because her focus was World Juniors , not just for the sake of that event and more titles but as part of a long-term process . <p> 's mission photo : Patrick Kraemer in Dubai is to address the lessons learned in Barcelona . " It gives her another opportunity to get these things right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke out of the start ( tick for the way she did it on the way to the 29.48 world record ; cross for the way she did it on the way to silver in 29.59 in the final ) , maintaining balance and stroke rate throughout races and so on . <p> In the discussion about multiple racing , there is a thread of comment that talks much about rest . Rudd emphasises work , not rest , in the critical phases between meets . " You ca n't just keep resting , resting , resting . Ruta put in one of the hardest week 's of work she has done all year while on camp leading into Dubai . For the 11 months that followed a short post-London break she has worked her socks off . " <p> Unlike many others , such as her British training partners , Meilutyte is not scheduled to a trials program . " She 's largely worked through and has had much longer periods of work without taper , adaptation and so forth . Mental toughness is required to get through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrested race targets . <p> " Every meet we do is a means to an end . Each is part of a process , " says Rudd . " Each has to be better not just faster but technically superior than the one before . At each meet , cash was a bonus but it was performance that she was chasing . " <p> Rudd noted Meilutyte 's ability to swim hard through rounds and lamented that British swimmers rarely put themselves through that throughout the season . And that despite tough rounds swimming having been one of the for messages of Bill Sweetenham 's tenure as head of the program in Britain 2000-2007 . <p> Among the lessons others can learn from 's mature-beyond-her-years approach is her handling of distraction . " The phone goes off the day before racing starts , " noted Rudd . <p> " She does that herself . It was the case in London and again this year in Barcelona . She does n't read anything , no twitter , none of that ... because it is all-consuming and that 's not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what she needs to do at the competition . " <p> This evening in Dubai , Meilutyte takes on the semis of the , the final tomorrow followed the next morning by the heats of the . In the middle of it is the freestyle . Thursday then promises to deliver new experience as the world champion takes on the final of the breaststroke and , assuming she qualifies , the final of the medley in the same session . The curtain-closer will be the free . <p> That Meilutyte should bother with the World Juniors given her stature has caused some to wonder and ponder . They need n't bother . In the infancy of a journey that the Olympic champion intends to stretch to four Games , Dubai , at a time when many of her senior peers are taking time out , seems like a perfect pit stop along the way . <h> Comments <p> August 26 , 2013 <p> Very interesting article , thanks ! <p> I find it such a shame that some have been questioning Ruta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she 's earned it , simple as that . And for every rival who might be disappointed at the threat to their own chances , how many more will be inspired by swimming against a world and Olympic champion and world record holder ? <p> Craig Lord August 26 , 2013 <p> Yes ... there should be no question about her participation if she chooses to be there . Indeed , if she was n't there , we 'd all have to write ... X won because Y was n't there and no-one likes to do that if it can be avoided ... <p> If you 've 
 Meilutyte Queen , Australia Wins Meet <p> Mack Horton , of Australia , and Ruta Meilutyte , of Lithuania , were crowned king and queen of the 4th FINA World Championships with a victory apiece in the curtain-closing session of the six-day event in Dubai . If Horton 's dominant triumph in the , for a fifth gold in finals and sixth overall counting a relay heats swim , came as little surprise , then Olympic breaststroke champion Meilutyte now has another string to her bow : in 25.10 she claimed the freestyle title . <p> The meet was won by Australia with 10 golds in 18 medals , ahead of Russia , with 9 golds , 8 silvers in 26 and the USA , with 9 golds , 7 silvers in 28 . There were 47 championship records set in 41 events over six days . <p> 's victory was the first in six finals in the closing session of the meet not to produce a championship record . By the time Horton was set to walk out for a crack at an unprecedented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks had fallen to Caeleb Dressel ( USA ) in 48.97 in the freestyle ; Viktoriya ( UKR ) in 2:23.12 in the breaststroke ; Luca Mencarini ( ITA ) in 1:57.92 in the backstroke ; and Svetlana Chimrova ( RUS ) in 58.34 in the butterfly . <p> Horton was next out . That he would win the 30-lap challenge was in little doubt before the start and by the time he was seven strokes in , he had hit the front . From then on , the maintained a consistent edge on the rest , turning first at the turn with a clear advantage in 56.78 . On 58.91 at that stage , Jan Micka ( CZE ) was closest to the victor by the close , on for silver , the bronze going to Pawel Furtek ( POL ) in . <p> Horton , coached by Craig Jackson at Victoria 's Institute of Sport , missed the cut for world seniors this year by a whisker when he cracked 15mins for the first time at trials for Barcelona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold in the and 4x100m , then the and with the three trickier targets out of the way , next came the and last the in finals . In the midst of it all , Horton also raced in the mixed relay heats , the final won by Australia and therefore granting him another gold under FINA rules . Count that one or not , he was the most titled swimmer of the championships the most titled of all four championships held so far . <p> Said Horton : <p> " This week has been insane , I have set times in races that I never thought I could and it feels amazing . I guess I 'm a more confident swimmer now , if I had gone to Barcelona I would have only had the one race , whereas here I was able to test my speed and gain more experience in a number of events .

The Russian clocked 25.16 in the final , bronze going to champion Siobhan Haughey ( HKG ) , on 25.38 . Haughey later raced to 4th in the freestyle , her name unknown in international world waters before this meet . 's tally of four golds and a silver helped lift Lithuania to 4th on the medals table behind the three big hitting nations at the helm . <p> The first four finals of the evening before the also produced a championship record . The boys ' free final gave a hint of battles to come down the years at the start of a duel between Caeleb Dressel ( USA ) and Luke Percy ( AUS ) . The American took first blood in a meet mark of 48.97 , ahead of the Australian 's 49.06 , the bronze going to Evgeny Sedov ( RUS ) in 49.47 . <p> On his way to cracking a US age record , Dressel won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming home . While Percy gained ground in the hunt for the wall , a 23.21 at the turn left him needing more than the 25.85 he came home in . No others in the race cracked on the way out . Sebastian Szczepanski ( POL ) was the last boy home inside 50 , on 49.98 . <p> The ' duel ' at the helm will extend to multiple challenges the moment the best boys reach senior waters and face the likes of James Magnussen ( AUS ) , Nathan Adrian ( USA ) et al ... and close age peer Cameron McEvoy ( AUS ) , under a fingernail shy of the medals at Barcelona world titles a few weeks back as the fastest teen in history . <p> On her world senior titles debut in Barcelona , Viktoriya ( UKR ) , born in 1998 , followed up by dominating the girls ' breaststroke with a 2:23.12 meet mark off the following splits : <p> 33.67 1:11.55 ( 37.88 ) 1:48.49 ( 36.94 ) 2:23.12 ( 34.63 ) <p> had company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just away from the leader , and Italy 's Silvia Guerra on 1:12.03 .

Britain 's Molly Renshaw and Guerra turned into the last lap ahead of but the second of Ukraine 's challengers refused to be denied , fought back and took silver in , ahead of the Italian , Renshaw denied a medal by an agonising . <p> Luca Mencarini ( ITA ) was the next to restrict the mounting medals tallies of the AUS , RUS and the USA . He took the backstroke crown in 1:57.92 , a meet mark , off a split of 59.58 , well down on Connor Green ( USA ) , who turned in 57.87 , with Keita Sunama ( JPN ) on 58.86 .

The early pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him nursing bronze , Sunama on 1:58.21 for silver , Mencarini the boy made man of the moment . <p> Favourite Svetlana Chimrova ( RUS ) swam to form just shy of her Russian record in a meet mark of 58.34 for gold in the butterfly . The silver went in 58.73 to Liliana Szilagyi , the Hungarian who dedicated her medal to her late grandfather , who passed away last week .

Having the most golds does not make a country the winner IMO . Apparently , FINA agrees with that as they awarded the 3 titles to the USA on a point core . The 10 gold medals achieved by Australia was due to essentially one swimmer ( Horton ) and rightfully so you have him as the swimmer of the meet . But the Aussies were well behind the USA in medals and points and they also were well behind the Russians in medals achieved . <p> Craig Lord September 2 , 2013 <p> There are always those who take exception to the difference in counts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on how many folk you can get in the top 16 . And on the medals table , Australia wins ... the first column gold is where it is at . Australian won the meet . FINA 's points table is a good reflection of the strength of nations but the bigger count , at all world-level and regional events , is the medals table . Take Britain on points , among the top 5-6 nations consistently ... do you think that means we consider Britain stronger than Denmark , Holland , Hungary , even France ( Brits beat France on points at Olympic Games , for example ... but who would say that Britain was better than France at London 2012 in the pool ? ) ? So , the medals starting in the first column , is where it is at . In Fukuoka 2001 , Australia won the meet Don Talbot celebrated it like that , so dis his entire team and the world media : Australia had more gold that the US ( fewer medals , but more gold ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the billboard , the points a subsidiary effort to reflect the breadth and depth of programs . Best , Craig <p> Craig Lord September 2 , 2013 <p> p.s YOu can also extend the thought at several levels : i.e : who is the more successful athlete : 1 solo gold at the Olympic Games or 5 bronzes , including 3 relays . The fact is that the headline goes to the 1 gold , no question . Sport is about many things and the top line is about " winning " the gold count <p> Craig Lord September 2 , 2013 <p> Of course , we at SwimVortex , do much to reflect the strength of programs though our Swim League of Nations , which tells us that the USA and Americans need n't be too nervous about how to count strength ... even so , the database of world media shows me 99.9% of counts , graphics , overviews of Games , world champs etc , all focussed on the medals table . There is scant mention of points tables ... the wider world does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need to for another column that shows " success based on population ... " . I prefer to stick to the medals table as the top count , starting , as all medals tables do , with column one ( not the last column , total ) . Regards , Craig <p> Craig Lord September 2 , 2013 <p> ppps I also think you are being a little unfair to young Aussies beyond Mack Horton , excellent as he was . This is the AUS Vs USA count on gold count : <p> AUS 3 boys 1 relay ; 2 girls USA 3 boys ; 3 girls , 1 relay <p> Very similar ... <p> The bulk of the difference among top 3 nations was on bronze count , USA 12 , RUS 9 , AUS 2 ... but no one counts a meet based on bronze medals ... <p> best , Craig <p> Personal Best September 2 , 2013 <p> Using a point score to determine the top team also does not consider that some countries do not send a full team or their strongest team to certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Champs have the prestige yet to host the absolute strongest youth from around the world . <h> Search for event 
 Mark Shines At China Priority <p> With two days of action remaining in the pool at the All-China Games and on a day in Shenyang when Ning Zetao cracked the Asian free record with a 21.91 in heats , an undeniable picture of priorities is taking shape : one of the world 's leading swimming forces places its domestic event above World Championships and how . <p> In women 's events , the best efforts of China at Barcelona 2013 remain the best of the year , while the depth of numbers surpassing the best of China in Spain confirms a phenomenon that exists in no other country in the world : in six solo events , the best of China in Barcelona is now between 8th and 13th best performance of the year , in four other solo events , Barcelona best is 4th or 5th best . Among men , eight solo events in Shenyang have produced faster times than the best Chinese effort in Barcelona , while in six of those the best in Spain is now ranked outside the domestic 2013 top 5 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15th and 17th best performances this year ) . <p> If Ning 's time caught the eye today , a 21.99 in semis of the free was overshadowed by action in finals that produced another shuffle in the world top 10 for the year . <p> Highlights : <p> Wang Shun , of Zheijiang , took the medley in 1:57.71 to add a second medley gold to his win at the start of the meet .

 Home Of Phelps &amp; Kalisz <p> In a chat with SwimVortex.com on the cusp of a question and answer session with coaches at the American Swimming Coaches Association World Clinic in New Orleans , Bob Bowman explained why he and his team in Baltimore are in the process of rebuilding the age program that gave rise to Michael Phelps and how and why the North Baltimore Aquatic Club is a success <p> The North Baltimore Aquatic Club is in the process of rebuilding its age-group program after head coach Bob Bowman felt " embarrassed " by rates of attendance and a lack of goal-setting through the ranks of junior squads at the pool where Michael Phelps honed his skills from learner to keen 9-year-old with an abundance of energy to burn before carving out a career as the greatest Olympian of them all . <p> Beyond Phelps ' Olympic swansong in London , Bowman had a big decision to make while taking time off the deck away from coaching . He confirmed at ASCA in New Orleans that he had indeed contemplated moving on to pastures new in life and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bowman . But passion comes at a tempo more Vivacissimo than Andante with the music scholar who fund into an aquatic signature when in his boyhood h was taken by his father to a meet starring Tracy Caulkins . <p> Bowman looked around his program , saw four post-grads and the gulf between them and the youngsters coming through the ranks in physical , mental and emotional development terms and then delved a little deeper down through the stages of a pathway ( each journey unique ) once travelled by the likes of Phelps and Chase Kalisz , the silver medallist in the medley at the world-championships this summer . What he wanted was to convert more potential to swimmers who stack up well against peers , local , national and international in competition . <p> He did n't like what he saw . For a little detail on what Bowman did next and what 's happening at Baltimore , see the question and answer session below from the ASCA Clinic , at which the coach also spoke about an important aspect of safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions from coaches at the ASCA clinic was one that raised the debate about whether the US should be placing more focus on Americans . Before the session with coaches , SwimVortex.com raised a similar theme in a slightly different way . How 's Yannick Agnel ? " He 's doing great , " said Bowman of the French Olympic champion over freestyle who decided to leave his long-term coach since boyhood , Fabrice Pellerin , this spring . <p> " He 's what you seek in a swimmer , " added Bowman , explaining : " He 's a hard worker and a very kind person , great to have around . " Another of Pellerin 's recent charges , Denmark 's Lotte Friis , will spend the next few months in Baltimore as she prepares for a home European s/c Championships in Herning from December 12 to 15 , the program in Nice and Olympic free champion Camille Muffat targeting the European l/c Championships in Berlin next summer . <p> Before Agnel came along , Baltimore found it hard too recruit top US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come , " joked Bowman , noting that the presence of big international names had indeed been a catalyst for a change in thinking among some American swimmers . <p> If Phelps , whose foundation forms part of the Olympic great 's current path in life , ever decides to make a comeback , he would have Agnel to keep him company . The rumours come and go ; Bowman says " I know nothing " . And if that is genuinely the case from a man who sees his former charge regularly and dines with him from time to time these days , then we can take the constant knock-backs from Phelps when speculation puts its sneakers on as all the more meaningful . If Phelps ever makes a return , we will hear it from him . For now , golf is the club of his sport , NBAC the club of his investment , including the swim school that now bears his name and has gone national across all States United . <p> Present in all , the school has boys and girls divisions in 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals , was the " real reward " for swimming and Phelps , said Bowman . " Its what he can put back in and he has chosen to do that , " said the coach , his former charge the catalyst for health , safety , fitness , excellence and ultimately more swimming success for the US . <p> And so to the Q and A with coaches ( questions are expressed in thematic terms and are not the precise words used by the coach asking the question ) and a taste of why the ASCA clinic is well attended year in , year out : <p> Q : What makes NBAC different to other clubs in the country ? <p> BB : What makes it special is the team culture : its been cultivated over a very long time throughout the span of the club 's history . I 've been involved for 20 years and since 1996 in a pretty serious way . One of the key goals I have is to continue the club 's culture of development . We 're about the disciplined pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group programme from upwards . Its a long process . " <p> He note that to build " a Michael of a Chase " you have to take the right decisions in building the right environment and you had to be , as Baltimore was " very careful with the athletes " . <p> Some things made Baltimore unique : <p> control of own facility <p> a wide base of participants <p> a summer team with more than 300 kids on it <p> a stroke clinic with 100 kids on it at a time <p> Bowman note that Baltimore has just 200 swimmers across all ages in its competitive squads , compared to some US programs that cater for 800 and more . <p> He added : <p> " We 're our own feeder system ... we can control our program and the rates at which we move swimmers through it . We can control the environment and therefore we can be more efficient in the decisions we make . <p> His role was clear : " I 'm an educator : of parent , athlete , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're here to help people to learn and when you get people who buy into the system , that is what makes the program great . " <p> The are also strong links to programs beyond NBAC . Coach Jack Bauerle , with a string of success in his own stable , is now working with Baltimore , while the club , said Bowman , " has good relationships with college coaches to help map a better way out for swimmers " . <p> Bowman noted that he makes clear to athletes and staff what is expected of them : " They have to be accountable in practice and in meets . " As to the parents : " We coach ; we let them parent . " <p> Where the rest of the world turns to the US to lawn lessons for their own programs , Bowman notes that he looks the other way : <p> " We are constantly studying top programs around the world ; we study them and see how the things they do could fit into our program . And the foundation of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Laughter follows but there is a seriousness in the underbelly at Baltimore : the distance base will remain even as the age range of swimmers in their prime rises : around 27 for men and 22-23 for women in international waters , Bowman estimated . <p> Q : Why and how are you rebuilding the age-group program ? <p> BB : " It is all about dealing with expectations , " said Bowman . " We went through a period of time , maybe when I was at Michigan ( cue chuckle ) , when I do n't think we valued the process of age groupers . <p> " Somewhere along the way we got lost : we thought , perhaps , that swimming fast might not be good for their development . <p> " My view is that if we wait until later , we will not have national age group record breakers and the ranks of world-class seniors winning and making podiums ... are full of pool who were winning and breaking records throughout their development Phelps being a prime example . " <p> Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age ranks at Baltimore of placing great store in " being on a team " at the same time as a " disconnect in the whole process " had developed in terms of the flow from youth to senior programs . <p> " I 'm embarrassed to tell you that some groups had attendance ; now its back to , " said Bowman with a glint his eye . " They have to be there all the time if the goal is to be better . " <p> A subsidiary question from the coaching ranks focused on the mechanism for moving youngsters up through the ranks . <p> " We do n't have a set process to move from group to group , " said Bowman . " When I see that there are kids who are mentally ready to step up from one or two sessions a week , that 's when a move is made . We do n't have to make the wholesale jump whole squads at once to the next level . I do n't believe in setting standards for groups . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go 10x100m on 1:10 but may not be ready emotionally . Some kids fall behind on that type of work but they might have something that makes us believe they 're ready to move up . " <p> Q : I feel that the head coach in my program is holding back development by sticking to some rigid structures ... etc <p> BB : " You need to find a new team and a new job . " <p> Q : How do you improve attendance rates ? <p> BB : " We had to have something aimed at raising attendance . What to do is to focus on the things people like to do : they like to go to meets but they ca n't go with us unless they have attendance . " <p> Baltimore published its attendance figures so " everyone knows what people are doing " : the whole club can see where folk fit in the picture of dedication , regardless of other commitments beyond the world of swimming . <p> Bowman one gave grades 1 to 5 for attendance but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but " did n't do well " in practice . <p> " That was back when I was mean , " laughed Bowman , who moved gradually to a system in which the seniors " graded themselves as a way to get them to think about what they did in practice " . <p> Q : What emphasis do you place on nutrition ? <p> BB : " Not enough . Its something we 're trying to target systematically . We 've done a good job with the senior swimmers ... I think we need to do it more with developmental levels . " <p> Q : a question along the lines of whether the US focus ought not be all about Team(s) USA . <p> BB : What you 're basically asking is ' why are you coaching that French boy , right ? ' laughter . I do n't think there 's a concern . Colleges have been doing it forever . From a personal stand point , I learned in the last quadrennial ... that we have four professional swimmers and to train them with the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of practices ? Yes . But the social environment did n't mix . It was not motivational . " <p> Bowman noted that Baltimore 's attractiveness has risen since Agnel arrived . He smiled broadly as he said : " As soon as we got ' the French boy ' , Americans wanted to come and swim with me . " As he often does , Bowman follows humour with serious point : <p> " Yannick Agnel is No1 on attitude and preparation and work ethic . That is what fits with us : he wants to do it the way we do it . " <p> As as for having overseas athletes in the program , Bowman noted : " If everyone is getting better , we the US will get better . " <p> Q : On the subject of NBAC 's staff structure and coach interaction with Bowman <p> BB : " I am constantly putting the coaches on the spot , urging them to contradict me . We discuss all kinds of things and none are afraid to raise anything and share their opinion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual thought . " <p> And the thing that underpins it all ? " If you do n't like to hear truth do n't be on our program . Any process is only valuable if there is an honesty at the heart of it . " <p> Q : What 's your take on the state of world swimming ? <p> BB : " I did n't think we would catch up to the suits so quickly , " said Bowman . <p> For the record : <p> Men : 4 world records stand in textile suits , with 16 world marks surviving from the shiny suits era ( 2008-09 ) <p> Women : 9 world records stand in textile suits , with 11 world marks surviving from the shiny suits era <p> " And I think backstroke will get a little bit better with the ledge new starting block equipment developed by Omega that will allow toe to be hooked on to a small ledge and reduce the risk of slipping on the pad at the start , not hugely but a little . <p> " We are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way to go on training smarter and more efficiently , " added Bowman . He note the big leaps in performance and attitude in some young swimmers of late ( Ledecky , Meilutyte etc ) and added : " If some of those young swimmers keep developing in the way they are , they will even exceed our expectations . " <p> Much has been made of the storm of teenage progress of late and while swimming history is stacked with young folk exceeding the expectations of others , there has been a notable upward trend in age-group swimming at national and international level that has raised concerns such as those considered by research conducted by reporter Amy Shipley and ASCA coaches in a talk given in New Orleans by the association 's executive director John Leonard . <p> Q : How do we sell long-term development to parents ? <p> BB : " Twice a year we have a general meeting where I get to do some general talking . Every month we put out a blog and then we also hold smaller meetings at which we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of process : learn the basics , learn how to use your time well in practice ; learn how top develop physical and self-learning skills ; be engaged in everything we do . " <p> He added : " We want every level of our program to be at the top of what it is doing , for the kids and coaches to be the best at every level , whatever that is . I heard somewhere that if you look at the historic world top 10 age groupers , the No1 and the others up there have never become Olympic champions . <p> " Well , excuse me , we had two : Michael Phelps and Beth Botsford . " <p> Bowman 's view is backed up by legions of examples in swimming history where Olympic podium placers have shown their potential as podium placers at regional and continental age majors , such as European junior champs and even European senior champs ( especially since Bill Sweetenham persuaded LEN to mov to a system of four entries per country , with only two from any nation allowed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Q : What new technologies do you use ? <p> The answer was fascinating and merits a separate article some meat on the bones first ... <p> Q : How do you handle club growth and what structures do you have in place ? <p> BB : " Our approach with all kids coming in is that we have to grow gradually and slowly , " said Bowman , noting that while Baltimore is looking to build anther pool as part of its provision , " we do n't have enough space and w have to set standards high and some kids have to go . " <p> Baltimore has four main squad divisions : Discovery ; Imagination ( 9-12s or so ) ; Challenge ; and High Performance <p> " Each individual coach has free rein in what they are doing , " said Bowman . " I encourage them to experiment and within that do the core things we value but put their own spin on it . " <p> Q : And what happens if there is an issue with a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it will eventually come to my office , " said Bowman . The last word world include : <p> " We want everybody to be happy and if you ca n't be happy here , we 'd like you to be happy somewhere else . " <p> Q : What 's your personal schedule like ? <p> BB : My typical week includes a day that goes : <p> 4.45am ... up , breakfast , get myself together 5.45 ( at latest ) at the pool 5.45 ' til 7am : finalising , organising 7am coach to kinda 9ish Then workout personally I think that important and then get cleaned up and eat lunch 2pm to 4pm is the main practice for the seniors By 5pm or so I 'm out'a there <p> Q : What recommendations have you got for tapering ? <p> BB : " Tapering for me is very easy to do if you 've done the work : swimmers never miss the taper , they miss the work . The taper is something you can do and hit well if they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to only change one variable at a time . <p> " Intensity has to stay the same even when you drop the volume ( and you have to monitor that ) , " added Bowman before explaining his favoured course : " ... stay with the volume , decreasing all the way through and only drop the intensity at the last moment . " <p> In addition , he noted the difference between men and women , saying : " Certainly you see it with the older guys : our men will do much less strength training during taper . I keep the women on weights until five days out . " <p> Q : What is the age and gender breakdown in your program ? <p> BB : " Its an interesting stat : we have about 50:50 boys and girls . <p> " In Baltimore every boy thinks its cool to swim . <p> " Before Michael we had girls , boys . We 're a little heavier on seniors than i would like : the 14 and overs account for of the program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program ? <p> Robinson Director of Athlete Services at NBAC runs the strength program . " You have to have someone other than the swim coaches do that , " said Bowman , explaining that he insists in at least two coaches being on deck at any one time , every swim coach that spends time with dryland time spent off the deck . " Our dryland coach is separate and part-time . " <p> Q : How do you describe your work ? <p> " Motivating , exciting and fulfilling . Helping a kid to do something they did n't think they could do : that 's it . To make a breakthrough , gain a confidence , that 's what I like to do . " <p> Q : What is the fee structure of your program and how do you budget for it all ? <p> BB : coach Bowman ran through some rough figures that ranged from a year for a senior athlete through to at high-school level to around for the Challenge group and for the beginners in the Discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " what they 're worth " , qualifying " within the budget ... it has to add up . " <h> Comments <p> Rob F September 14 , 2013 <p> Great article , Craig , thanks . I 'll be re-reading it a couple of times and passing it on to others that I think might appreciate it . <p> A couple of comments and a question : Distance I agree that an aerobic base is vital for swimming , but there 's many a prospective swimmer that has been lost to the sport because of the drudgery of a distance-oriented program . It 's a fine line between enough and too much . I realy like the idea of linking attendance to meet participation a much better motivational approach than the more common " do it or you 're out " method . <p> On the " coaches interaction " answer , we 've all seen declarations from the boss along similar lines , when the reality is more like Reggie Perrin 's CJ . You 've met Bob many times in the past , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord September 14 , 2013 <p> Thanks for your note Rob . <p> Reggie Perrin 's CJ ... now that takes me back to some fond memories . I 'd say this : I like Bob Bowman : he 's very bright , deep thinking , fascinating to talk to ... I would also imagine that anyone who works with him would recognise very quickly that challenge would be part of daily life and that 's neither always easy nor comfortable , though it can be thrilling and greatly rewarding . I think he 's open to being challenged and open to absorbing things if he sees they have value and can work . If a coach has rein to try something out , I would imagine they would then have to show that it works/is working . I would imagine that there are some things Bob Bowman would be hard to sway on : like stuff he 's tried and knows that it works . On that score , its not hard to see that he would stick to his guns where he thinks that that is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a meeting with some marketing folk who were being more pushy and a pain in the rear than usual and talked about the need for consensus , said : ' Look , what you have to understand is that sometimes we do n't need consensus : I 'm the editor and this is a dictatorship : what I say goes . ' She then sent them packing to think again . And she was right and we ( the journalists present ) felt like putting in more effort as a result . I can imagine its a little like that ( in a different context ) with Bob Bowman . <p> One last point : while CJ was a nightmare when it came to him being a prospective dinner guest , I think Bob Bowman would be a great guest to have round any table . <p> Hope that answers the Reggie P question ( and I thank you for it ) . best , C <h> Some 20 years 
 At Helm Of AUS Youth Talent Camps <p> Leigh Nugent and Doug Frost , two coaches who have long been at the heart of Australia 's youth development program in swimming , are back at the helm of those responsible for shaping the next wave Down Under . <p> Two development camps will be held this week off the back of the State Teams Age Short Course Championships in Canberra , with a total of 58 swimmers selected to attend either the National Youth Camp or Talent Identification camp to be held at the Australian Institute of Sport ( AIS ) , Swimming Australia announced today . <p> Nugent , who stepped down as head coach to Australia in the storm over events before and during the London 2012 Olympic Games , is head coach to the junior program . He is supported by Frost , Jim Fowlie and Drew McGregor . <p> The National Youth Camp , to run until September 28 , brings together 30 of the best young swimmers from across Australia . Athletes were selected after winning a gold medal at the 2013 Georgina Hope Swimmers Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Talent I 'd camp will run alongside the National Youth Camp until Thursday this week , athletes selected on their potential to improve in the coming years . The camp schedules include educational presentations on recovery , biomechanics , psychology , social media and nutrition for the swimmers as well as specific presentations on training loads , skills and techniques for the coaches , Swimming Australia notes . <p> The aim of the camps is to give each swimmer " ample opportunities for growth and success throughout their swimming career " . The swimmers will undergo a number of capacity tests , such as critical velocity measurement , analysis to include power profiling . <p> Swimming Australia Director of High Performance Michael Scott said : " With a total of 22 meet records broken at the State Teams event over the weekend , it was exciting to see the young swimmers raise the bar and set new performance standards . It is important now that we provide the swimmers and their coaches with the necessary support and development , through camps like this , so that they can reach their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold medals to his name from the 2013 GHSF Australian Age Championships , 15-year-old Kyle Chalmers was an obvious inclusion for the National Youth Camp .

 Of The Waves , Strikes Again <p> On this day 25 years ago as the swimming at the Seoul , Vladimir Valeryevich Salnikov celebrated a golden comeback with a unique achievement : eight years after freestyle victory at him at a boycotted Moscow Games and four years beyond a boycotted Los Angeles Games access to which he was denied by his political masters , he took the crown back and silenced the doubters . Not only had Salnikov become the only man ever to win the same Olympic swimming title eight years apart but , at 28 , was the oldest champion since 28-year-old Yoshiyuki Tsuruta ( JPN ) retained the breaststroke crown in 1932 . <p> If the defining moment of Salnikov 's career unfolded when he became the first man to race the freestyle inside 15 minutes on July 22 , 1980 , winning one of three gold medals at the Olympic Games at home in Moscow , then a special plinth in the pantheon of greats was reserved for the Soviet freestyle ace eight years later . In Seoul , he defied the odds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Salnikov walked into the athletes ' dining hall in the Olympic village in Korea a little shy of midnight on September 25 , 1988 medal ceremony , drug testing , media interviews and television appearances out of the way some 300 fellow competitors , coaches and officials from a wide variety of sports spontaneously laid down their cutlery to honour the Soviet swimmer with an impromptu standing ovation . <p> It was a fitting tribute to a man who had just delivered one of the most memorable victories in swimming history : Salnikov remains the only man to win an Olympic swimming title eight years apart . He did so in . <p> Having won 61 consecutive races between 1977 and 1986 , Salnikov , who from 1984 was coached by his wife , Marina ( a former Soviet national track and field record holder for the , as well as a sports psychologist ) , finished fourth at the 1986 World Championships in Madrid and the following year failed to make the final at the European Championships .

 In Seoul Come To A Close <p> We reach the last of six days of finals in our Seoul 1988 25 Years On anniversary special ( six days of reviews of every final and profiles of some of the biggest names at the Games ) . This was the day a quarter of a century ago when Tamas Darnyi added the medley crown to his title and celebrated a second world record of the week ; when Mary T Meagher bowed out of a career as the greatest Madam Butterfly to grace the aquatic stage with bronze behind East Germans Kathleen Nord and Birte ; when Kristin Otto claimed hr record sixth gold as the last Olympic winner for the GDR before the fall of the Berlin Wall ; 14-year-old Krisztina Egerszegi stopped State Plan 14:25 in its tracks ; Vladimir Salnikov became the last Olympic swimming champion for the Soviet Union ; and Matt Biondi took his tally of medals to seven with a fifth gold as a member of the US medley relay . <p> Seoul ' 88 25 Years On : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between 1982 and 1993 , spanning the entire international career of Tamas Darnyi , the Hungarian never lost a medley race .

On butterfly , Vadim ( URS ) led the way in 25.60 , with back in fifth , on 27.06 . After backstroke , the Russian was still ahead , on 56.24 , while Darnyi had crept up to second , in 57.33 , having just passed Patrick Kuehl ( GDR ) , on 57.56 . <p> 's lead , at 1:32.20 , was cut back to just by the final turn , with Kuehl edging ahead of Darnyi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man who would become the most successful medley swimmer of the 20th Century reduced his rivals to second-class with a phenomenal homecoming split that delivered the gold and a world record of 2:00.17 , inside the standard he had set at the European Championships a year earlier . <p> Silver went to Kuehl , bronze to in the first Olympic medley final to ever to unfold without an American on the podium , and , indeed , without an American in the final at all , silver medallist Dave Wharton having missed the grade in heats . <h> Women 's 200 butterfly <p> East Germans Kathleen Nord and Birte Weigang defeated defending champion and world record holder Mary T Meagher at the American 's swansong event . After the fall of the Berlin Wall , Nord let for the US , studied and graduated from Florida Atlantic University . She married and served as a coach at Boca Raton swim club at the Meadows Park Pool . After a divorce , she late returned to Germany , where she married again and raised a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nord , then 32 , spoke to the media on the cusp of the doping trials that called to account the likes of coaches Rolf Glaeser , then 58 ; Volker Frischke , then 53 ; Dieter Lindemann , then 46 ; and Dieter Krause , then 50 ; sports doctors Dieter , then 51 , and Bernd , then 50 . All worked for the communist state 's SC Dynamo Berlin club and played a part in the distribution and in some cases the needle and pill work involved in the systematic doping regime that was State Plan 14:25 . <p> Nord had been at 6 and by 11 was placed in a sports school , where lessons were organised around the demands of swimming training . Nord said : " I never made my own decisions , " said Nord . <p> " I was always suspicious of something going on , but I never knew what . I was made to train and train and train . And , of course , there is a lot of anger . A lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time trusting people . " <p> Meanwhile , catch a glimpse of Mary T Meagher on the way to gold in 1984 in the third fastest time ever on a list that boasted Meagher in the top seven slots : <h> Women 's 50 freestyle <p> There were two novelties in the pool at the 1988 Games in Seoul : medal-winning Chinese women and the inaugural freestyle races for men and women . China had not featured in any Olympic swimming final until 1988 , when four women collected three silver and one bronze medals within fractions of East German winners . That success heralded a period of controversy for China and the sport that would see more than 40 Chinese swimmers test positive for steroids between 1994 and 2002 . <p> The inaugural event was also overshadowed by the removal of one of the favourites for the crown : Angel Myers ( USA ) tested positive for a steroid derivative found in a prescription medicine that she was taking at the time of the US Olympic trials and served a two-year suspension . <p> The pre-race favourites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Chinese woman who had broken her world record in April of Olympic year : Yang Wenyi was the first women inside , on 24.98 . Owing to the fact that the event was making its first appearance at the Olympics , the Olympic record fell seven times in heats , starting with a 29.64 for Carolina Araujo of Mozambique and ending via times of 25.91 for Leigh-Ann Fetter ( USA ) and 25.85 for Kristin Otto ( GDR ) with a 25.67 for Yang ( CHN ) . <p> In the final , it was Otto ( GDR ) who claimed the first crown and a record sixth gold medal in an Olympic record of 25.49 , ahead of Yang , with the bronze shared by Katrin Meissner ( GDR ) and Jill Sterkel ( USA ) , further back . For Sterkel who had made a comeback after helping the USA to win the bronze medal at the inaugural women 's World Championship in 1986 Seoul was the closing of a circle : she had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , in 1988 , to witness the might of the GDR . In 1976 , Sterkel was a gold medal winner in the 4x100m freestyle relay ahead of the GDR , and in 1988 claimed bronze as a heats swimmer in the same relay . <p> In the early 1990s , confirmation of a secret state-run doping programme , called State Plan 14:25 , tainted GDR results . Otto was among those named in official documents from the IOC-accredited laboratory in Kreischa , Saxony , as having produced **28;211;TOOLONG levels higher than permitted levels . No action was ever taken , the German Democratic Republic having used the laboratory at Kreischa to monitor athletes before sending to competitions beyond its borders those it knew would test negative by the time they raced . <p> Otto , born on February 7 , 1966 , in Leipzig , was a product of the East German sports school system , which selected children as a young as six for channeling into specific sports according to physiology . Her first international success on freestyle was as a silver medalist in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1984 Olympic title before the Soviet-led boycott was declared . In reunified Germany , Otto later worked for the ZDF television channel as a sports announcer .

 Of Fate Favoured Pioneering Nesty <p> We conclude our Seoul 1988 , 25 Years On , anniversary special with Anthony Nesty , a pioneer of his country , his ethnicity and his sport , a man who took gold for Suriname a quarter of a century ago and now serves as assistant coach at the Florida Gators guiding generations of swimmers from around the world at the University of Florida . <p> Never before and never since has a countryman matched the exploits of Anthony Nesty . One day , perhaps , another athlete will come along and duplicate the Olympic glory owned by Nesty in 1988 . Until that day , though , what Nesty pulled off at the Seoul Olympics remains the greatest sporting achievement in the history of Suriname . <p> In what was an Olympiad marked by Matt Biondi and Janet for the United States and Kristin Otto snaring six gold medals ( albeit under a cloud of doping suspicions that were later confirmed to be the truth of a terrible tale ) , Nesty made his own history in the 100 butterfly . Trained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now works at the University of Florida , Nesty became the first black athlete to capture a gold medal in swimming . <p> It was n't an easy feat by any means as Nesty clipped Biondi by a hundredth of a second , prevailing in an Olympic-record performance of 53.00 . Not only did Nesty become the first black gold medalist in his sport at the Olympics , he became ( and remains ) the first athlete from Suriname to win an Olympic title . Yes , Nesty became a national hero in his small South American country . <p> Having competed at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles in what was basically an experience-gathering endeavor , Nesty arrived at the 1988 Olympics as a more-prominent factor . He had made a name at the Bolles School , a scholastic superpower , and Nesty 's confidence was soaring . From a mental standpoint , he was convinced a podium position awaited . <p> " I knew I had a chance to win the race , " he said . " I knew I was going to be in the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdles to clear . Although world-record holder Pablo Morales failed to qualify for the Seoul Games at the United States Olympic Trials , the field for the final was stacked with talent . There was Biondi , who went on to win seven medals five gold . There was West German Michael Gross , the reigning Olympic champ . There was Australian Jon Sieben , the Olympic gold medalist in the 200 fly at the 1984 Games . <p> Biondi , not surprisingly , turned out to be the man to beat when Nesty and Company hit the water . The American star bolted to a sizable lead at the midway point and with just a few meters remaining , the gold medal seemed to be his . But an extraordinarily long finish by Biondi opened the door , and Nesty walked on through , by the slimmest of margins . <p> In exactly 53 seconds , Nesty achieved history for a country and a race . Prior to Nesty , the Netherlands ' Enith was the only black swimmer to medal at the Olympics . Brigitha was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the 1976 Games in Montreal and had it not been for the GDR and State Plan 14:25 may well have been the first black swimmer to claim Olympic gold . Meanwhile , Biondi was stinging from the narrow setback . <p> " I swam 99 meters like an Olympic champion , but could n't fit in another stroke in the 100th meter , " Biondi wrote in a diary he kept for Sports Illustrated during the 1988 Olympics . <p> " I was too close to the wall . I had to glide in , and Anthony Nesty of Suriname out-touched me . I had been winning the race easily the whole way . It 's been eating me up . After all , what 's a 100th of a second ? Could I have won with longer fingernails ? A slightly quicker start ? Looking at the tape of the race just makes me sick to my stomach . " <p> Come-from-behind triumphs have been a hallmark of the 100 butterfly at the Olympic Games . While Nesty wrangled his gold medal away from Biondi , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2008 Games . First , Phelps ran down American teammate Ian Crocker in the final strokes . Four years later , in what was preservation of his Great Eight , Phelps clipped Serbia 's Milorad Cavic with a late flourish . <p> For Nesty , this was no fleeting moment . A member of the International Swimming Hall of Fame , his career was thoroughly decorated . There were NCAA championships in the 100 butterfly for the University of Florida and a gold medal in his prime event at the 1991 World Championships in Perth . Four years after his Olympic triumph , Nesty added a second medal by earning bronze in the 100 fly in Barcelona , where Pablo Morales claimed gold an redemption . <p> As much as Nesty accomplished during his career in the pool , he has enjoyed a sterling career on the deck , serving as Troy 's top assistant at the University of Florida for more than a decade . It 's been a successful stretch in which numerous swimmers have captured NCAA titles and in which Ryan Lochte has emerged as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver anniversary of the Seoul Games , it is certainly time to remember Nesty for that singular swim in Seoul which produced fireworks on many levels , from status to breathtaking in its come-from-behind nature . <p> Photo Montage : courtesy of , images include Gregg Troy , head coach at the Gators and Nesty 's coach at the Bolles School in the 1980s <h> Comments <p> September 27 , 2013 <p> I was pretty young back then , but I still remember how his victory reverberated beyond the usual swimming circles in a way it would n't had he achieved it in anything other than the Olympics .

 A Year Shy Of Berlin Showcase <p> Germany 's Olympic double sprint freestyle champion of 2008 Britta Steffen announced her retirement today with less than a year to go to a home European Championships in Berlin next summer . The remains the world-record holder over 50 and freestyle from a time of shiny suits at Rome 2009 , her 23.73 and 52.07 efforts other-wordly for their time , at least two Olympic cycles ahead of their day courtesy of the boost and buoy of non-textile materials banned since January 1 , 2010 . <p> In a statement released by her management , Steffen said that in recent weeks she " doubted " whether she had the " necessary motivation and energy for one or even three more years in competition for gold medals and championship titles " . As such , Rio 2016 was a Games too far . <p> " I end my career in the knowledge that I belong to the best in the world , " Steffen added . <p> Her decision marks a change of heart since Berlin won the right to stage the continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I 'm very happy that the European championships will be staged in Berlin . It is my hometown , and following the events of 2002 when last Berlin staged the event , I may once again experience the uplifting feeling of battling for medals in front of a home crowd . " <p> She first cracked the freestyle world record in 2006 at 53.30 for the European crown in Budapest . A year after double gold at the Beijing Olympic Games , she wore an adidas suit that she said made her feel like a " hovercraft " , even a " speedboat " , she told the media . She reduced the world record to 52.85 and then 52.56 at German trials in Berlin and then in Rome axed it back to 52.22 and then 52.07 for the crown . <p> During her career , she won 19 German championship titles and was today described by DSV swimming federation 's president Christa Thiel as " exceptional " . Her Rome swims would " remain unforgotten " . Actually , Steffen 's best moments unfolded in Beijing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records in eight days . <p> Four years on at London 2012 , Steffen made the final of the freestyle but missed the podium for fourth place , leaving Germany nursing its first Games since 1932 from which the swim team returned home empty handed . Steffen raced in world waters one last time this summer past , finishing 6th in the free final won by Cate Campbell of Australia . Campbell raised the bar in textile to 52.33 leading the Australian 4x100m free quartet and then claimed the crown in 52.34 . The closest to her in textile is double Olympic champion of London 2012 , ( NED ) , on 52.75 at Dutch trials last year . The Olympic crown has never been won inside . <p> When Steffen started to date teammate Paul Biedermann , the German media described their relationship as the " most famous swim couple since Kornelia Ender and Roland Matthes " . <p> That she has decided to skip a home Europeans sets Steffen 's career apart on one more score from that of the swimmer she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neukolln teammate Franziska Van Almsick . <p> Steffen 's is a rags-to-riches story . In 1988 , as the winds of political change blew through the cracks in the Berlin Wall , the young Britta was busy dipping her toe into the baby pool for the first time in Schwedt , an industrial workers ' town dominated by the PCK chemical plant near Frankfurt Oder on the border with Poland . <p> Her first swim teacher at the SSV club , Gunter Hinze , who at 60 in 2008 , recalled " a small and dainty girl " . He told a magazine in Saxony : <p> " She was standing , very excited , on the edge of the pool and wanted to go into the water . She did n't have a costume with her so I gave her one but it was far too big and we had to tie it back with strings . Britta did n't care , she just wanted to learn how to swim . She was very independent . I taught her to swim within four weeks . " <p> Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catrin Marschalek 's squad . " Britta was very ambitious , " the then 43-year-old coach recalled in 2008 . <p> " She was small and always considered herself to be at a disadvantage but her gliding in water was superb , she had a lot of stamina and that 's why I recommended her for a place at the sports school in Potsdam . " <p> Skip through the years of development and arrive in Moscow for the European junior championships in 1999 : Steffen won six gold medals , taking the 50 , 100 and freestyle crowns ( 26.08 ; 55.66 and 2:01.32 ) and all three relays with her Germany teammates ) . A star was , well , almost born . <p> Steffen won three senior bronze medals at the German national championships in 2000 and earned herself a relay berth at the Sydney Olympic Games , where Germany swam below expectations . Her return home coincided with the physical changes that every girl goes through , a time in life when confidence can so easily be dented . <p> In the midst of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , travelling to Berlin to train under the guidance of Norbert and alongside Franziska Van Almsick , star recruit at the SG Neukoelln club . By 2004 , the pretender was enduring up to seven and more hours training a day , getting through the work by reminding herself that other world-class swimmers , such as Alexander Popov ( the Robbie Williams of swimming , she is said to have once called the great Russian ) , succeeded through tough regimes . She earned another Olympic relay berth in Athens but that fell well shy of Steffen 's dreams and the talent so many had told her she had . The upshot : she headed for the door . <p> Her old coach , Marschalek , suggested that Steffen 's problem was that she " could not handle the pressure " . However , there was a deeper problem : the swimmer had developed an eating disorder , bad enough for anyone , lethal for an athlete . kept a cool head , told Steffen that he saw in her the same qualities and talent that many had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He urged her not to take time out but to swim through but Steffen insisted on a break . In an interview with Christof Gertsch , of the Neue Z ? rcher Zeitung in Switzerland , Steffen said that the coach had " wanted me to stay in the training and not to take a break " and was most unhappy when she decided to take time away from the pool . <p> Steffen did take another piece of advice from her coach , however . During her break , she consulted psychologist Dr Frederike . Van Almsick had put her return to world-record-breaking times over in 2002 in part down to working with . She helped Steffen to view her life and herself in a different , more positive , way and gave her a plan of action to turn herself around . <p> Steffen agreed to the plan . She emerged from a fallow year healthier in heart and head , thanks to what Hanson alluded to : having good people around her . In late summer 2005 she returned to full-time training but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was enjoying it at last , " she said , describing coach as being " like a father to me " . <p> " The psychologist really helped to turn me round , " she adds . " When I swam badly before I used to think somehow I was a bad person . Now I know how to differentiate between my swimming life and my personal life . " <p> The two worlds do collide , of course , not least because her then boyfriend , German swimmer Oliver Wenzel , 25 , played a key role in helping Steffen turn herself around and view her swimming through positive , not fearful , eyes . <p> As put it : " When she had her head free she was able to motivate herself incredibly . The year 's break , psychological training and her boyfriend have done her a lot of good . " <p> An understatement as it turned out : Steffen broke the world record in the free at the 2006 European Championships in Budapest , won thed crown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world records . Of her world record over freestyle , Orjan Madsen , Germany 's new head coach at the time , said : " It was a sensational swim . She is an absolute super-talent and this is just the start of her career . <p> If the first , at 25.84 , was slower than Inge de Bruijn 's split on the way to the then 53.77 world record in 2000 , the second 50 was a display of control and assertiveness . Two years on in Beijing , she would take the by turning in 7th almost a second down on the Australian with whom she traded blows in the wake of Budapest : Libby Lenton , later Trickett before rocketing through the ranks on the way to the gold medal . <p> The " D " word was raised the moment Steffen stopped the clock in Budapest . The reactions of both Steffen and Madsen went along way to calming what could have been an unworthy storm . " We ( Germany ) have a bad history of doping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as they are . That 's just the way it is . We have to check blood , we have to make ourselves available , and will do at the start and end of each altitude camp . " said Madsen , announcing plans for a system that has potential for adoption on the international stage . That system was later threatened then cancelled by lack of funding . <p> For her part , Steffen worked with Wilhelm Schanzer , a leading drugs researcher and explained why with these words : <p> " I want to create my own anti-doping file in which I publish my tests . The implications ( in questions put to her in Budapest ) hurt me . " <p> Not too much to get in the way of double gold in Beijing . Celebrations involved a fair few hugs with Franziska van Almsick , former queen of German swimming . The two swimmers are different in many respects but the thing they have in common is the feet-on-the-ground principals instilled in them as East German children of working-class parents . Many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet her one-on-one and she is as delightful as she is down-to-earth . <p> The same could be said of Steffen . She lives in a sq student bedsit in Berlin and receives 400 euros or so a month support from her club . Not be wasted on a flash new car , rather they will go to help her parents out . Like a fifth of Germans in the former east , Steffen 's mother , Ingrid , a former shop assistant now 52 , and father , Edgar , a former electrician now 57 , are both unemployed . Such circumstance can breed hunger in those who have a mind to channel disadvantage and rise above it . <p> Raised in a high rise with brothers Sven , now 34 and a papermaker , and Maik , 24 and a chemical engineer , Steffen holds family dear . Her siblings ' names are engraved on the ring they gave her , one she wears with pride . " She 's very down to earth and modest . Success will not go to her head , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could imagine one day writing the autobiography of her fairytale , she replied : <p> " No , I 'd just like to continue my life as it is now . I do n't worry about money . I 've agreed with my body that I 'll train intensively for another two years and then we 'll see . I 'm satisfied with my whole life right now . I 've found an inner quiet . " <p> It proved to be the calm before the Beijing storm a year out from Rome , after which she was never the same swimmer again . She goes down in history as one of four women to claim the 50 and titles at the same Games , with Kristin Otto ( GDR ) and Inge De Bruijn ( NED ) before her and Kromowidjojo in London last year . <p> The mangled remains 
 : Breakout Performer of the Year <p> As the Golden Goggle Awards approach , we 're going to take a periodic look at the various honours up for grabs at the annual USA Swimming gala event . To start things off , a look at the nominees for Breakout Performer of the Year , which rewards the athlete who emerged in the biggest way over the past year . The candidates : Jimmy Feigen , Chase Kalisz , Simone Manuel and Michael McBroom . <p> Of the candidates for this award , all collected a medal at the World Championships in Barcelona , leading to the consensus that the field of options is quite strong . All but Manuel earned an individual medal at the World Champs , but Manuel managed to final in the 50 freestyle in Barcelona , placing seventh in a career-best mark of 24.80 . Only a 16-year-old , her best days figure to be ahead , and with the United States in need of a pure sprint freestyler to carry the flag in the future , Manuel is a welcome sight . <p> For McBroom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some time , what with his status as an NCAA champion for the University of Texas . But it was n't until the World Championships until McBroom lowered his shoulder and broke that door down with authority . Behind an American-record performance of 7:43.60 , McBroom earned the silver medal in the 800 freestyle , finishing behind China 's Sun Yang , the other-worldly distance phenomenon who produced a triple at the Palau Sant Jordi . <p> McBroom , though , was n't done after the 800 free and came back to finish fifth in the 1500 freestyle in , another personal best . With Connor Jaeger also on the distance scene , McBroom like Manuel in the female sprints provided an energy boost for the future of his events in the American ranks . It figures his efforts , which confirmed his ability to race shoulder to shoulder with the best in the world , have supplied a major confidence surge . <p> In the case of Feigen , his World Championships did n't start off on a high note . Handling the anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feigen did n't deliver a time he was capable of supplying and the U.S. had to settle for the silver medal behind France . However , the measure of a standout athlete is his/her ability to bounce back and not allow a sub-par moment to rattle the future . Unquestionably , Feigen rebounded . <p> In the final of the 100 freestyle , Feigen almost pulled off the biggest upset of the meet and earned the silver medal in a personal-best time of 47.82 . He placed just off the pace of reigning world champion James Magnussen of Australia , placed ahead of reigning Olympic champion Nathan Adrian and fulfilled the expectations which were placed on his shoulders as a record-setting high school swimmer . Developing in the 50 freestyle , too , Feigen is a guy who the United States will be able to rely on in international action for years to come . <p> From the same club and guided by the same coach , Kalisz has long found himself compared to Michael Phelps . Yet , based on what he has done and how he 's rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity , free of Phelps . Mentored by Bob Bowman at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club and Jack Bauerle at the University of Georgia , Kalisz had a sensational 2013 campaign . It started with an NCAA title in the 400-yard individual medley . <p> Still , the biggest breakthrough for Kalisz arrived at the World Championships when he claimed the silver medal in the 400 medley behind Japan 's Daiya Seto . En route to that medal , which was won on the final day of competition and seven days of waiting , Kalisz was timed in . Not surprising , he used an exquisite breaststroke leg to earn a podium place . <p> As he gains strength and further experience , Kalisz figures to be a factor in a variety of other events as well , including the 200 medley , 200 butterfly and 200 breaststroke . He is just tapping into his potential and seems to have a future likely to be decorated by additional medals from the World Champs and as soon as 2016 Olympic success . <p> The Pick : The final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been touted as future stars for some time , they each made the big jump at the World Championships . Feigen earns the nod by the smallest of margins as he found a way to dig deep and climb off the ground following the 400 free relay . More , he excelled in a field which featured the defending world champ , reigning Olympic champ and several other speedsters which made the 100 free arguably the marquee event of the World Champs . Still , anyone picking Kalisz could n't be criticized , such was the superb nature of his year . <h> Comments <p> Lane Four October 7 , 2013 <p> For me it is Feigen . Although both he and Kalisz won solo silvers , the men 's 100 free was absolutely STACKED from top to bottom and to come through and win silver against the studs was incredible . All of this AFTER he fell to his nerves in the 4X100 . He had something to prove to HIMSELF and he did . Congratulations ! <p> The BBC 's

 Jamaica 's Worrying Window To A World Of Meagre Testing <p> The alleged failure of Jamaica 's anti-doping agency Jadco to screen its athletes in the run-up to London 2012 has attracted an " extraordinary audit " by the World Anti-Doping Authority ( WADA ) . <p> The move is pertinent to all sports : such windows of inactivity exist in many countries with world-class swimmers , with some nations exercising no national testing program at all . Of course , most of those do not have anywhere near the level of success , fame and fortune of Usain Bolt and teammates . <p> Jamaica is fame for its track sprinters : Bolt 's double triumph topped his country 's dominance of men 's and women 's sprinting at London 2012 . They won eight of the 12 individual medals in sprint events , the kind of figures seen in swimming with th GDR , Chinese women in the 1990s and other counts that courted controversy . <p> Since the London Games , five Jamaican athletes have returned positive tests for banned substances , including Asafa Powell and Veronica Campbell-Brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former executive director of the Jamaica Anti-Doping Commission , that Jadco 's out-of-competition testing between January and July 2012 tallied just 10 visits in February and one in April . Then nothing all the way to London 2012 . <p> Shirley , who stopped down from hr role this year over the concerns she raised , also highlighted another worry : the quality of testing kits available . For highlighting such important issues , Shirley was dubbed a " Judas " and a " bit demented " by Herbert Elliott , 's chairman . <p> Wada yesterday confirmed there was a " significant gap of no testing " in Jamaica during the months preceding the Games . Byond domestic testing , the IAAF tested Bolt 12 times last year , while the UK anti-doping agency also tested Jamaican athletes during their pre-Games training camp . <p> " There was a period of and forgive me if I do n't have the number of months right but maybe five to six months during the beginning part of 2012 where there was no effective operation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an announcement yesterday .

 : Coach of the Year Award <p> As the Golden Goggle Awards approach , we 're going to periodically take a look at the various categories which will be honored at the annual gala event . In our third installment , we 'll look at the candidates for the Coach of the Year Award . The candidates : Rick DeMont , Bruce Gemmell , Dave Salo , Todd Schmitz , Gregg Troy . <p> When considering the candidates for Coach of the Year , much depends on which lens is used for analysis . Should the award be given to a coach for mentoring the greatest number of standout athletes , or to the coach who molded the best individual performances of the year ? It 's a difficult question , and the answer may vary from year to year . <p> A banned substance found in his asthma medication robbed Rick DeMont of Olympic gold at the 1972 Games in Munich , but his presence in the sport has never been questioned . A world champion athlete , DeMont has long been a top-tier coach at the University of Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title-winning efforts of Matt Grevers in the 100 backstroke at the World Championships . <p> As Bruce Gemmell watched Katie Ledecky compete at the World Champs , he saw what the rest of the world witnessed : An athlete putting together a spectacular triple in the distance-freestyle events , including world records in the 800 free and 1500 free . Meanwhile , Ledecky 's 400 free mark which was under the four-minute barrier was a textile best . Thanks to Gemmell 's guidance , the Nation 's Capital Swim Club is one of the nation 's elite developmental grounds . <p> The stable overseen by Dave Salo at Trojan Swim Club is outrageously talented , but because the Golden Goggles focus on United States Swimming , Salo 's credentials with foreign athletes have to be removed from the equation . No matter . Salo has had a huge impact on the American ranks , this past year watching Haley Anderson win a world title in the 5K and excelling in the 50 breaststroke and 100 breaststroke . <p> The rise of Missy Franklin from age-group phenom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom Franklin has praised time and again through the years for his guidance and friendship . This past year , Schmitz watched his prized pupil take gold medals at the World Champs in the 200 freestyle , 100 backstroke and 200 backstroke , along with in three relays . Although Franklin is now under the watch of Teri McKeever at Cal-Berkeley , Schmitz 's impact wo n't be forgotten . <p> Another year and more exceptional production was the name of the game for Gregg Troy . The man who has turned Ryan Lochte into an all-time great saw his main charge win the 200 individual medley and 200 backstroke at the World Championships , and also watched Elizabeth Beisel pick up a bronze medal in the 400 individual medley . The head coach at the University of Florida , Troy 's work has been wide-reaching through the years . <p> The Pick : This category was a tough call for sure , but Todd Schmitz is the selection . Why ? Well , he guided Franklin photo : Aniko Kovacs to a special performance in Barcelona , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining East Germany 's Kristin Otto from the 1988 Olympics to win six gold medals in a major international competition .

" I hope to follow the example of all the women here tonight and be a role model for all girls , " Franklin said in her acceptance speech . She topped tennis ace Serena Williams and Paralympic runner Tatyana McFadden for the award . <h> Comments <p> KeithM October 17 , 2013 <p> I do think it 's important to FINALLY recognize Schmitz . He has coached and developed her since she was seven . This scenario would have been unlikely in many other countries , including some top tier swimming nations that tend to want to centralize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of very young stars and balance that with just being a kid especially with the media profile that Missy has had the last several years . <p> October 17 , 2013 <p> Schmitz also got Jordan Mattern from juniors to Georgia scholarship before she won gold this summer in Barcelona as part of the 4 ? 200 FR prelims squad , so he 's not a one hit wonder coach . <p> Nance October 17 , 2013 <p> I agree . This is the last opportunity to recognize Schmitz as Missy completed her high school/age group portion of her swimming career this summer with the Colorado Stars . Not only did Todd coach her during a major life transition , but also during the post-Olympic year ... AND he guided her to a history-making gold haul at Barcelona . Katie Ledecky and Bruce Gemmel will doubtless be on the limelight for years to come and will , at this year 's Golden Goggles , receive accolades fitting her jaw-dropping achievement , but this is the last opportunity to honor Todd for a lifetime achievement in coaching Missy Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international swimming community . <p> I agree . I hope Todd receives honor where honor is due at the 2013 Golden Goggles Awards ! <p> Kathy October 18 , 2013 <p> Todd maybe should win coach of the quad , except we all know Bowman would win that , but Gemmel deserves coach of the year . <p> October 19 , 2013 <p> , In addition , Todd coached several other NCAA swimmers including Caroline Piehl ( Cal ) , Christine and Colleen Wixted ( Duke ) . Kelly Naze ( Cal ) was with Todd for many years . He also coached some very successful boys until a year ago or so . Clark Smith ( Texas ) , Hennessey Stuart ( NCState ) , Nathan Mueller ( Wisconsin ) all swam well with him . Todd 's energy and enthusiasm is refreshing but not for everyone .

However , we have come to realize that the problems we have had with the City since at least 2000 , and which we have been unable to resolve since , stem from the fact that our organization 's vision of the future and the City 's vision for their new Fort Lauderdale Aquatic Complex are not in alignment .

 Swimmer Fran Crippen ( 1984-2010 ) <p> Today marks the third anniversary of Fran Crippen 's death ( April 17 , 1984 October 23 , 2010 ) in a FINA World Cup Marathon race off the coast of the United Arab Emirates . He was 26 . Born in Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania , to Pete and Pat Crippen , Fran graduated from Germantown Academy in Fort Washington , Pennsylvania in 2002 and then graduated from the University of Virginia in 2006 after majoring in sociology . That year , 2006 , also marked Crippen 's transition to the world of open water swimming . <p> Crippen , a six-time American champion , over 800 m freestyle , and , died in circumstances that prompted inquiry and change in open water swimming . He was swimming in the last race of FINA 's 2010 10K series in Fujairah after having won the penultimate race in Cancun , Mexico , the weekend before . Crippen 's absence at the finish in Fujairah was first noticed by fellow USA swimmer Alex Meyer . After searching for Crippen and not finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to locate Crippen .

In our latest instalment , we 'll look at the candidates for the Male Race of the Year . The Candidates ( All from the World Championships ) : Matt Grevers ( 100 Backstroke ) ; Ryan Lochte ( 200 Backstroke ) ; Ryan Lochte ( 200 Individual Medley ) . <p> Coming off a dominant triumph in the 100 backstroke at the 2012 Olympic Games , Matt Grevers was obviously wearing a target as he headed to Barcelona for the World Championships . However , he was n't viewed as an invincible force , largely due to the fact that he finished second to David Plummer at the United States National Championships . <p> Yet , when it mattered the most , Grevers came through in his prime event . En route to the gold medal , Grevers led a one-two charge by the Americans , this time with Plummer following in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fastest time in the world and the only performance under the 53-second barrier . <p> Mathematics indicates that Ryan Lochte has a chance of winning this award when the Golden Goggles are held next month . That 's because Lochte has two of the three nominations , including one in the 200 backstroke . A year ago , Lochte was upset in the Olympic final and settled for the bronze medal while teammate Tyler Clary prevailed . Lochte bounced back at the World Champs with a time of 1:53.79 , fast enough to give him his third world title in the event in the last four versions of the World Champs . <p> Lochte 's second nomination was for his gold-medal showing in the 200 individual medley . Lochte has medaled in the 200 medley at each of the past five World Championships , taking bronze in 2005 and silver in 2007 before reeling off three straight triumphs from 2009-2013 .

 The Key Part Of The Flip That Was A Flop <p> The best ever : the term applied to Michael Phelps at London 2012 as he took his golden tally to 18 ... but not to the Games , terrific as they were in many ways ; not to any Games , in fact ... they all had their merits and downsides - and Rio 2016 will be no different Photo : Craig Lord <p> Comment : <p> On June 8 , 2006 , I broke the story that NBC and the organisers of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing planned to stage swimming finals in the morning to suit American viewers and the bottom line of the domestic broadcaster investing vast sums of money in rights for the biggest global sporting festival in the world . That much we knew . Now , courtesy of the head of USA Swimming , we also know what we suspected but what had never been confirmed . <p> My file for the late Nick Thierry 's , the precursor to our work at SwimVortex , marked the first time the world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . In the week that followed , Reuters , AFP , AP , AAP , Xinhua and a host of other agencies and newspapers across the world picked up the thread and started to ask questions . <p> One of those was critical : did US swimmers know of the likelihood of morning finals in Beijing before those from elsewhere in the world against whom they would compete in Beijing ? <p> The hint back then : no , not really . The truth , as revealed by Chuck Wielgus in the USA Swimming CEO 's latest blog under the heading ' The flip that was n't a flop ' : yes . Michael Phelps , aiming to overtake Mark Spitz , was consulted about and knew of the notion as early as March 2005 , more than a year before many ( if not all ) of his overseas rivals even got a sniff of it . <p> Important to note straight up : not the fault of Phelps , Bob Bowman and those working directly in the process of delivering the result in the pool . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said to have assisted in delivering advantage to Americans , then leaders at the IOC , FINA and , in a different sense , USA Swimming have a case to answer when it comes to their responsibility to play no part whatsoever in delivering conditions at the Games that favour some more than others . <p> We 're not talking about the right of USA Swimming to do all in its power to make sure its swimmers have the best coaching , diets , facilities , equipment and all the other legal items on the wish list of any winner . <p> We are talking about a process in which world sports leaders and the broadcaster with the big bucks entered into dialogue with Americans to make sure that ' they ' would have no issue with morning finals . I would imagine that no-one asked the Germans or the Brits or the Danes or the Dutch and did Australia know and how about Japan ? Were the key athletes and coaches of all those nations involved in the discussion ? <p> No , they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted morning finals and the only swimmers they wanted to hear from were Americans . Most specifically , Michael Phelps . The question was clear enough : would He be happy and would the move impact on His bid for seven of more gold medals ? <p> And that on an approach to an Olympics that in 2008 was affected by another move in which Americans played a leading role : the sudden arrival and approval by less than a handful of key players of a suit of polyurethane panels the Speedo LZR Racer that afforded advantage . We all know what happened next and we also know the key role played by the US in sinking suits that morphed into a crisis in 2009 when Phelps was crushed by Paul Biedermann , the German whose world records over 200 and stand to this day , having held back the way-out-front might of Yannick Agnel and Sun Yang in the past two seasons . <p> While there may well be justifiable arguments for the path taken between 2001 and 2006 on broadcast rights and the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in the mix that ought not to be among the ingredients of global sports leadership : a culture of one-eyed secrecy . <p> Wielgus writes : " While it 's important to understand that NBC , or any other broadcaster for that matter , has no say in the Olympic City selection process , the seed of an idea had been planted . " There are moments in this tale where it might well be hard to convince many out there in the world of chasing Olympic glory that the influence of NBC , or others in a similar position , is not overly great if the end result is that one nation is made aware of a specific and significant condition at the upcoming Olympics a year and more before the rest of the world at least at the coal-face of performance gets to even hear about the move . <p> That ' coal-face ' rider is placed for a specific reason . Wielgus mentions in his blog that Jacques Rogge , the IOC president , agreed " to explore the idea of morning finals with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Two years of discussions ensued , he notes , leaving open a one-year window in which FINA was supposedly involved in discussions . The question is : who is FINA ? If NBC 's idea was discussed by the ruling Bureau , then word of the plan would surely have filtered back to many nations ( including some who would later say ' we had no idea until we read it on ' ) . USA Swimming is a member of FINA . <p> Among questions left open by Wielgus 's blog is " When did what it knew filter through to the rest of the FINA membership ? <p> You might have thought that someone among leaders at IOC and FINA , as well as USA Swimming and NBC , would have thought ' to be fair , the question we 've posed to Michael are you okay with this should be put to athletes and their coaches around the world , and the perfect starting forum for that process is FINA and two commissions , Athletes and Coaches , each with a responsibility to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . That is , after all , the point of such bodies . Of course , NBC had good reason not to put its plan to the wider world : the answer might well have been ' no ' . <p> As far as we 're aware , no such wider process was even considered , never mind implemented . Democracy came down to an IOC vote , the campaigning held beyond the light of the majority of those most affected . NBC had had its answer from Michael 18 months before the vote and 15 months before the wider world of swimming got to hear about the plan . And leaders allowed it to be so . <h> According to Weilgus , here is the timeline : <p> Spring 2001 : " on the very eve of the IOC vote to select the 2008 host city , then IOC President , Juan Antonio Samaranch sent the Mayor of Beijing to meet with Dick Ebersol in his Moscow hotel room . At the meeting , Dick floated the idea of broadcasting swimming live as a means for addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's important to understand that NBC , or any other broadcaster for that matter , has no say in the Olympic City selection process , the seed of an idea had been planted . <p> " Later that summer , the new IOC President , Jacques Rogge , was in the United States and made a visit to Colorado Springs . On his way back to Europe , he stopped in Martha 's Vineyard , where he and Ebersol enjoyed a long walk and again talked about making swimming the centerpiece for the Beijing Games with a live broadcast . Rogge made no firm commitments , but agreed to explore the idea with FINA and Beijing organizers . <p> " Over the next two years the topic came up sporadically , and the quiet discussions evolved with the possibility of flipping the schedule so that preliminaries would be held at night and semi-finals and finals would take place the following morning . <p> " Sadly , tragedy struck in November of 2004 when a private plane carrying the Ebersol family crashed in Montrose , Colo . The news sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so than at the IOC headquarters in Lausanne , Switzerland , and at the USOC and NGB headquarters in Colorado Springs , where Dick Ebersol is revered within the Olympic Family . Dick 's youngest son , Teddy , was killed in the crash and Dick was seriously injured . The outpouring of sympathy from throughout the world was overwhelming . <p> " Still hobbling with a cane , Dick returned to work in March of 2005 . On his very first day back in the office he was surprised by two visitors , Michael and Debbie Phelps . Dick told them about his dream of broadcasting swimming live in Beijing , and Michael 's response was enthusiastic . He told Dick , " This is the greatest thing that could ever happen . I want to help put swimming at the forefront of sport in the U.S. and what could be better than primetime television . " <p> " Sometime later , I received a call from Dick 's assistant asking me to come to New York for a meeting . At this meeting , Dick outlined his dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both Beijing and Lausanne . Undoubtedly , Michael 's response provided Dick with the confidence that U.S. athletes would accept the flipping of the schedule . The next level of concern was what Dick shared with me , " How will the U.S. coaches react ? " <p> " I assured Dick that most of America 's top coaches would recognize the incredible opportunity that our sport would be given with the live primetime broadcasts . The key was to not surprise them at the last minute , but rather give them time to wrap their heads around a flipped schedule , and then they 'd figure out how best to prepare their athletes . <p> " When I got home from New York , I shared the news with Mark Schubert , then USA Swimming 's National Team Head Coach . Mark understood the opportunity and took on the responsibility for ensuring that our National Team coaches would all be onboard . Any fear that the IOC or NBC had that U.S. coaches would not support the plan never materialized . " <p> June 8 , 2006 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swimming world get set for morning finals . <h> Here is what I wrote at the time : <p> FINA is considering a request from the IOC and its broadcast partner the NBC television network in the United States to turn the normal run of events in the pool on its head at the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 : heats at night and finals in the morning to suit US broadcast times . <p> The ruling FINA Bureau simply noted at its recent meeting in Shanghai that " the Olympic Games is an IOC event and that FINA would like to continue the excellent relation with the IOC as stake-holder of the Games " . Mustapha , president of FINA , is to hold talks with the IOC over its request . <p> Meanwhile , someone might care to ask the coaches , swimmers , sports scientists and all those who work for years on end for what is often one moment of glory or tragedy at the Olympic Games . If they are not stakeholders , then who is ? <p> Alan Thompson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community should be involved in that discussion and believed that , with just over two years to run until Beijing , it is already too late to change the normal run of events . <p> " If the sports science tells us that we can get the best swims out of kids in the morning , fine . But there 's no indication of that . Who would a decision like that suit ? What purpose would it serve ? In many ways its already too late ... we need to rehearse these things . If it 's going to happen then every meet between now and then should be along the same lines . " <p> Thompson 's predecessor , Don Talbot , agreed with that point but suggested that conditions are always the same for all competitors at the Olympic Games . " You have to be ready for whatever comes your way . But FINA have to be fair . The whole world should know what 's happening at the same time . If one nation , say the US , were to get to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That should n't happen . If there are going to be morning finals in Beijing , coaches need to know now . " <p> Bill Sweetenham , the Australian at the helm of British Swimming , backed that view . " The sooner we know , and know all at the same time , the better we can prepare . " <p> And on and on went comments from around the world , many echoing the point of fairness raised by the Australians , who at that stage were the best part of a year shy of being among the first nations , with the US , to be made aware of and have some of their swimmers play a role in the testing of the suit that would become the LZR Racer . <p> It was August 2006 when the IOC voted and confirmed what NBC had raised with Michael Phelps almost 18 months before . The response from around the world was not pretty and some of it distinctly anti-American . Open letters from the likes of Pieter Van Den Hoogenband , the Japanese swim federation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision , USA Today quoted coach Bob Bowman as saying that morning finals would suit his charge : <p> " Finals are emotionally draining . To have that first in the day I think is an advantage ... Now he can feel free in the mornings to just really go for it . " <p> I wrote , back then : The " now " in the sentence may be indicative of where the decision has already gone , if not where it is going . With the utmost respect for Michael Phelps and Bob Bowman , the Olympic Games swimming programme , should , however , be about more than one nation , let alone one swimmer . <p> The IOC vote prompted a switch to morning finals at many events along the way to Beijing to get swimmers used to the switch . But one leading European broadcast source noted at the time : " Why should we have all our events from now to Beijing and in Beijing dictated by a US broadcaster ? We also have world-class swimmers do n't they count with FINA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the first part of the question came with a truly loud , silent answer : money . On one level , justifiable ; but never at all costs . <p> Whether there was an impact on performances of some and not others in Beijing is ( beyond ' impossible to call ' ) a mute point . The process that led to the IOC 's 2006 decision was the stuff of bygone eras , lacking in the level of transparency that the athletes of the world and those who help them have a right to expect . <p> Understandable that the head of USA Swimming should be one-eyed about the matter . We are left in no doubt about ' prime , domestic responsibility when he writes : " When I got home from New York , I shared the news with Mark Schubert , then USA Swimming 's National Team Head Coach . Mark understood the opportunity and took on the responsibility for ensuring that our National Team coaches would all be onboard . Any fear that the IOC or NBC had that U.S. coaches would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine through golden goggles . The rest of the world , meanwhile , has a right to ask the IOC whether broadcast rights come with the right to confer potential advantage on athletes from that broadcaster 's country when it comes to setting the competitive environment and conditions under which the Games will unfold . <p> Wielgus ' timeline leaves a bad taste and calls into question the prevailing decision-making processes of the IOC and FINA . That a US broadcaster wins the rights to broadcast the Games should not result in even a perception of any advantage conferred on American athletes . The two things should be divorced . <p> The bottom line when it comes to the timing of establishing race conditions beyond the norm ought not to be the dollar but the stuff of good ethics , such as transparency , inclusivity and fairness . <p> Such things are put at risk when the distance between the interests of decision makers is too close , the room for checks and balances too narrow . The responsibility of the IOC and FINA is to ensure that they speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ( some might say one swimmer , albeit through no fault of his own ) gets to be part of a decision-making process on an issue as large as flipping heats and finals more than a year , at the very least , before the rest of the world gets to hear the news on the eve of a vote , we can surely conclude that the global authorities have fallen shy of their duty to all . <h> Comments <p> Well , that 's a bag of worms is n't it ? In NZL we IMMEDIATELY flipped ALL nationals through to the Games trials and I expected every nation to do the same thing . One thing that did come out of the Beijing flip was , " Morning swim ? What morning swim ? " If Jason L could go light speed fast ( and others in the same race ) then , so what it 's morning , but , but , but .......... your point of one nation or one swimmer knowing before everyone else : NO WAY ! Is there a way of putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased font size , highlighted , repeating on/off flashing neon colored text ? ? ? ? ? ? ? NO WAY ! <p> Craig Lord November 4 , 2013 <p> done ... <p> KeithM November 4 , 2013 <p> I never liked the whole affair at the time , mainly because IOC did n't consult athletes/coaches across the globe . Cornel Marculescu said back in 2006 that while they preferred morning finals that they would not oppose the proposed move in order to maintain good relations with the IOC . Interesting that international sporting bodies admit that they do n't have equitable counsel with the big boys because they need to genuflect to remain in the good graces of their superiors . That 's not a healthy relationship . Rogge was front and center on this . He 's cultivated a positive reputation , much moreso than his predecessor , but I think people need to take a closer look at his true character . He 's much more a shrewd businessman than an advocate of democratic process or an adjudicator of fairness . That only certain athletes or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a year that far out , sets a bad precedent . Having said that , in real terms did this actually confer a tangible advantage ? That 's debatable . It 's not something you 're going to prepare for in any significant way until you know it 's definitely on the cards . Many coaches in the US said it was mainly mental and made no long term training changes . Properly trained elite athletes should already be able to swim fast in the morning and things like lactic acid tests in the morning would be old hat already . Moreover , oddly enough in the US much less was done to prepare athletes for the new competition format at the elite level than done in many other countries . There were much fewer meets with morning finals , including the 2008 US Olympic Trials which still scheduled finals in the evening . Yet none of that matters when it comes to a fair process and depriving others of the same opportunity to implement whatever preparations they feel will best prepare their athletes .@@625497 <h> Big business could 
 Inspiration of the Year Down Under <p> James Magnussen , World freestyle champion , has been voted Australian GQ Magazine 's Inspiration of the Year for overcoming the challenge of a post-Olympic season in which silver by at London 2012 was followed by inquiry and punishment . <p> At one stage , Magnussen found himself being heckled in the street by members of the public as though he 'd committed a crime . In an interview with SwimVortex.com earlier this year , The Missile reflected on events surrounding the Stilnox saga and an inquiry into pre-Games behaviour among members of the men 's 4x100m freestyle relay and said : <p> " It 's been the toughest 12 months I 've had to cope with . Its refreshing to get overseas and put that pressure behind me . There 's been a lot of negative press for such a long time . Its been hard for me and for family and friends . <p> " No parents should have to read some of the things that have been written about their son . Its been a relief to leave that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barcelona will help to put it all in the past .

 : Queen &amp; King Of 1-Hour Challenge <p> The Meeting National d'Automne in Compi ? gne had an Australian theme to it today : first up , a 1-hour non-stop challenge for distance in true Bill Sweetenham style , followed by an Aussie skins events for the sprinters . Refreshing stuff in the welter of standard championship formats . <p> The hour challenge was the pride of French coach Fred : his Spanish charges Mireia Belmonte , world record holder over 400 and fee s/c and Olympic silver medallist over freestyle , and Marc Sanchez emerged queen and king up against some open water worthies . <p> In the skins , the ' fly dash was done for Florent Manaudou before he got to the head to head : the Olympic free champion was disqualified for swimming further than underwater at the start . Three out of the four dash showdowns went to visiting Brits ( see results below ) , Adam Barrett , Georgia Davies and Rachel Kelly . <p> made up for his mistake with a 46.62 blast , for 7th in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the freestyle . France and Marseilles teammates Fabien Gilot , 48.51 , followed on , with on of the dash victors , Britain 's Barrett , third in 48.73 and Belgium and Marseilles Yoris Grandjean on 48.99 . The women 's went to Britain 's Amy Smith in 55.05 . <p> In the hour challenge for distance Sanchez , a man over , trained pride not only by winning the men 's challenge but by making sure that training partner Belmonte did not get the better of him . <p> Belmonte covered just under in the first 30mins , while Sanchez was just shy of at 30mins . <p> Bravo to all : swimmers , coaches and meet organisers , at the helm of whom is St ? phane Lecat , a former long-distance ace from France and once a European champion . In August 2003 , Lecat swam the English Channel in 8 hours 19 minutes , one of the fastest crossings ever . <p> Before the skins started in Compi ? gne , Belmonte , remarkably , then won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jeremy Stravius ( FRA and Amiens ) in 54.01 a day after his 14:55 win over free at a meet offering fresh challenge , while Giacomo Perez Dortona ( FRA and Marseilles ) clocked 58.89 to win the breaststroke . <h> The Skins Challenge <p> Women 's butterfly <p> Rachael Kelly ( GBR ) 27.25 <p> Amy Smith ( GBR ) 27.79 <p> Men 's butterfly <p> Adam Barrett ( GBR ) 23.90 <p> Benjamin Stasiulis FRA and Marseilles 24.69 <p> The rounds of the ' fly dash saw the fall of the clear favourite : on 22.81 for a place in the world top 10 this season , Florent Manaudou ( FRA , Marseilles ) was disqualified for swimming further than underwater at the start . <p> Women 's backstroke <p> J ? r ? my ( FRA and Amiens ) 23.76 <p> Rapha ? l ( LUX and Marseilles ) 26.49 <p> Men 's backstroke <p> Georgia Davies ( GBR ) 27.01 <p> Francesca Halsall ( GBR ) 27.79 <p> Having started out with a 26.95 blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world top 10 , Georgia Davies eased back to 27.88 in the ' semis ' , with Britain teammate Fran Halsall on 27.85 at the helm . The Brit showdown went to backstroke specialist Davies in 27.01 , Halsall on 27.79 . Stravius , silver medallist in the dash , took the men 's back dash crown in 23.76 , way ahead of Luxembourg and Marseilles ' Rapha ? l , on 26.49 . <p> Could n't comprehend doing that two-fold . Do we have any distance ' splits ' out of interest ? <p> Not necessarily so . November 24 , 2013 <p> Was the 1 hour S/c or l/ c ? <p> Makes a big difference cutting out the droop around 25 -40 mtres every lap . In s/c push off &amp; only swim about 15 mts . <p> Bill might give them but they used to be standard .

As for Shane Gould .. wow ! <p> Craig Lord November 24 , 2013 <p> No splits but someone will have ... I 'll ask <p> Craig Lord November 24 , 2013 <p> Paul : Belmonte covered just under in the first 30mins ( 30:02 at 2,800 ) , while Sanchez was just shy of at 30mins ( 30:07 at 2,900 ) . <p> Craig Lord November 25 , 2013 <p> Ha , ha ... I think Bobby could still go sub 15 if he wanted it But on the distance theme , perhaps Australia needs to find some folk who will do it and gain from it ... no AUS woman got inside Tracy Wickham 's best over free this year , at a time when the battle is faster than Tracy was back in 1978 when doing stuff like swims with Sweetenham . Ledecky , Friis , Belmonte , and across the water from AUS , Lauren Boyle , working with , are all examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never work for all but some ' old ' things are just as relevant today for some big winners as they were many years ago . <p> TSS AQUATIC ( AUS ) November 28 , 2013 <p> We have been smashing the for times this season and had the whole club on the 1 hour for time for the second season running just a few months ago . 4 swimmers got over the in the hour .

 Rulers Of The Racing League On Distance <p> In the midst of a 2012-13 short-course season in which Katinka Hosszu picked up the FINA World Cup prize as best woman in the circuit and more than in rewards overall , the Hungarian delivered new meaning to the term ' race practice ' : she raced 133 times and covered 36,550 metres in her hunt for the perfect performance come the summer long-course showcase . <p> The long-course part of that marathon rush to late summer from Hosszu was breathtaking . By the time she had left Barcelona with the world 200 and medley titles in her treasury , the had set a race record with a difference : 122 long-course races over a combined total of in 15 different events on all four strokes and medley . If that marked a record number of races in a single season and topped the race-distance league cup among world champions ( see table below ) , one of Hosszu 's closest rivals , Mireia Belmonte ( ESP ) outdid every top pool swimmer you could ever think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo races she covered 44,750 metres in 2013 . <p> The world 400 , 800 and free champion among men , China 's Sun Yang pictured below , covered in racing , the distances interesting but hardly comparable , the purpose and plan and training regime of each swimmer the pertinent factor . <p> If the riot of racing wrote new lines in swimming history , the quality of performance in the mix , including six world short-course records at the first two rounds of the 2013 World Cup in Eindhoven and Berlin on the back of peak form in Barcelona , raised a few bold questions , including : <p> Could and should swimmers be racing more often than many do ? <p> And if so , can they swim at or close to top pace more often ? <p> And if so , what does that mean for the future of formats and showcase events for the sport ? <p> While many in the world of swimming have good reason to believe that swimmers would benefit from facing race situations more often , far fewer believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for all in a new-look sport to come . The common thread in the answers you get when asking coaches " could and should your swimmers race far more like Katinka " are summed up in this response from ASCA executive director John Leonard : <p> " Despite the Hosszu model , the vast majority of world class athletes have been unable to race at a high level of quality and not have it negatively affect their ' Culmination Meet Experience ' . This is a fifty year history . USA College swimming is not the same thing , as actual performance levels are typically not very high level at all relative to their ultimate season-ending performances ; they typically race tired . " He adds : <p> " The USA has largely not had wide-spread participation in these events World Cup , particularly in the year of the Olympic Games . And according to Forbes Carlile 's analysis , no major swimming nation on earth has experienced anything close to the level of improvement from USA Trials to the Olympic Games Performances , dating back 3 decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a widening gap . " <p> For more on that theme and the views of some of swimming 's leading figures , read my article in the latest Aquatics World digital magazine from FINA . <p> The accompanying graphic shows just where Hosszu 's long-course race marathon , before she embarked on the short-course FINA World Cup , fits in the context of race schedules for a range of individual world champions from Barcelona this year across all four strokes and medley . <p> The closest to Hosszu on distance covered in racing among world champions is Katie Ledecky ( USA ) , winner of the 400 , 800 and freestyle who by the time she left in Barcelona in early August had covered in racing in 2013 . Those who excel in distance events , naturally , accumulate the biggest race distances tallies . <p> The top man ? Ryan Lochte ( USA ) : of racing . <h> Some season comparisons ( l/c , full years ) with the past : <p> Brooke Bennett ( USA ) 1996 : 13,200 <p> Alexander Popov ( RUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 : 17,600 <p> Ian Thorpe ( AUS ) 2001 : 12,300 <p> Michael Phelps ( USA ) 2004 : 9,850 <p> I once asked coach Bob Bowman whether there was always a specific purpose to every race , whatever the time of year or circumstance , that Phelps swam . He replied : " Absolutely otherwise there 's no point . " <h> Comments <p> Interesting . Are there any stats for the legends of the past by comparison ? It would be interesting to see how much Hackett , Evans , Thorpe and Phelps raced compared to modern racers . <p> I believe the rise of racing is a good thing for swimming , or at least for swimming fans . Debate it how you want but there really only are about 5-10 weeks of interesting swimming in a given year , and only a few of those REALLY matter or settle anything on the grander scale . Compare that to the NFL , which has a 5 week playoff finale which is preceded by a 17 week qualifier season that in many ways is just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another few weeks of training camp . On the NBA where they have an , 16 team , 70-100 game battle royale for the title . <p> Craig Lord November 28 , 2013 <p> : A few examples added no time to do more right now <p> November 28 , 2013 <p> What about Belmonte Garcia . Probably closer to Hosszu than the others <p> Not necessarily so . November 29 , 2013 <p> I know of a world class swimmer who races less than one kilometre a year . <p> But it seems 
 Legacy : New Life For London Aquatics Centre <p> The London Aquatics Centre , after being veiled in scaffolding ( as engineers and builders clipped its temporary seating wings ) for a while since the Olympic Games last year , will be open for business in its legacy shape next year . The first to take the plunge will be leaping from the boards at the FINA/NVC Diving World Series . <p> The event will be staged from April 25 to 27 after the rescaling of the building and a process of partnership between British Swimming , UK Sport , London and Partners , London Legacy Development Corporation and charitable social enterprise GLL . <p> UK Sport today confirmed that an investment of up to ? 100,000 from its National Lottery backed Gold Event Series , which aims to bring up to 70 world-class events to the UK by 2019 , will be made towards hosting the Diving World Series in London . <p> Simon Morton , Director of Major Events at UK Sport , said : " The Diving World Series will be the first world class sporting event to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is another example of great legacy use of one of the iconic sporting venues from the Olympic and Paralympic Games . <p> " I am delighted that through the National Lottery funded Gold Event Series we continue to attract prestigious events to the UK . The combination of outstanding venues , technical know-how , passionate fans and thousands of experienced volunteers mean the UK is recognised as one of the best places in the world to stage international sport . " <p> A man and mayor much in focus in London and Britain today following controversial comments on themes covering greed , aspiration and wealth generation , Boris Johnson reflected on the legacy of the Olympics when he said : " The 2012 Games continue to change lives in the capital and I hope news that the world 's diving elite will return to our amazing Aquatics Centre next year will inspire even more Londoners to take to the pool . An increase in sporting activity should be one of the great legacies of the Games and hosting the Diving World Series will contribute to that aim . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discipline , determination and dedication , the sort of folk who may inspire young folk to aspire to the spirit of Olympism . London Mayor Johnson , away from the sporting platform , chose to emphasise the ' spirit of envy ' as a force for good in a speech that made headlines far and wide in Britain today . <p> Mounting a defence of inequality and greed , Johnson said that both are needed to push forward the ' spirit of envy ' . Speaking at the annual Margaret Thatcher lecture at the Centre for Policy Studies last night , Johnson mocked those with a low IQ and took a swipe at the " persecution of the rich " . He asserted : " ... greed is a valuable spur to economic activity " . <p> In the speech , he said : " I stress I do n't believe that economic equality is possible ; indeed some measure of inequality is essential for the spirit of envy and keeping up with the Joneses that is , like greed , a valuable spur to economic activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical approach to finance and banking : " I hope there is no return to the spirit of loadsamoney heartlessness ... figuratively riffling banknotes under the noses of the homeless ... and I hope that this time the Gordon Gekkos a character and caricature of greed in the film Wall Street of London are conspicuous not just for their greed valid motivator though greed may be for economic progress as for what they give and do for the rest of the population , many of whom have experienced real falls in their incomes over the last five years , ' he said . <p> Johnson went on in a call for more help to be offered to the two per cent of the population with an IQ above 130 , saying : " It is surely relevant to a conversation about equality that as many as 16 per cent of our species have an IQ below 85 . " <p> The speech was entitled ' What would Thatcher do ? ' . Back in the realms of a world that asks " What would Ryan Do ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge amount of hard work and dedication before the prospect of reward rears its head ( and even when it does would not stir a Gordon Gekko from his Chateaux Cheval 1947 ) , Johnson 's take is that " an increase in sporting activity should be one of the great legacies of the Games and hosting the Diving World Series will contribute to that aim " . <p> Will it Boris many may well ask . The papers in Britain are full of pool closures and holes in budgets that no longer stretch to maintaining pools , never mind world-class facilities for world-class divers . Two swimming excellence centres have bitten the dust since London 2012 , coaches and swimmers have been told to move on and some have retired from sport altogether citing the need to move on because they no longer have the required financial support for their careers . <p> Will the spirit of envy help turn it all around ? Is it the spirit of envy that wins gold medals in sports where the stars can consider themselves blessed if their funding stretches to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that transcends economics is likely to deliver change at the hands of those who have rolled their sleeves up each morning long before the spirit of envy has even thought of pulling its pants on . <p> Politicians sporting ( including those who are not voted into power and can not be voted out by a wide constituency and often manage to survive all storms when lifelines are in short supply for coaches , centres and swimmers ) and otherwise meanwhile , point us to all-but incalculable things that they will never have to account for , like inspiration , aspiration , the spirit of envy , legacy and the like . Back in the sporting arena , where the measure of things matters , some things are still quantifiable . <h> Track and Field Cut <p> Track and field has had the number of competitors allowed at the Rio 2016 Olympics chopped back by more than 200 . A record 2,231 competed at London 2012 but the International Olympic Committee wants no more than 2,000 in Brazil com 2016 , a demand that makes athletics the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio 's track and field presence the smallest in athlete numbers since Barclona 1992 . <p> Most in athletics understand the need for the cap and accept that London numbers were overly generous on the scale of Olympic quotas . Since then , swimming has also stepped up in the funding stakes as a member of a new categorisation , in terms of sharing the IOC treasury , that places it alongside athletics . <p> Christine Ohuruogu has

' if that is seriously the tone that Swimming World finds appropriate when dealing with a crime against women who as girls of 13 and 14 became the victims of the sporting crime of the 20th century and choices protagonists in a chapter so dark in swimming history that it transcends the sport and all sport . <p> Let 's be clear : there are few apologists for State Plan 14:25 and all that followed and we all know that not a single GDR women 's result ( and very few men 's results ) was achieved between 1973 and 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've suspected it since 1973 , known it since 1991 and seen it written in law since 1998-99 . <p> We all know and feel very moved by the stories of those deprived of their rightful place in the truly sorry saga of the GDR , from Shirley Babashoff to the many others from many countries affected , folk who , like Nancy Garapick of Canada at home in Montreal in 1976 , may well have travelled a different path as national heroes beyond their real experience of having to hear ' o yeah , did n't she win bronze at the Olympics some time ... ' . <p> We all know that bodies such as the IOC , FINA , the DSV in Germany , USA Swimming and many others who could have made a stand of one sort or another , have lacked the will and the way to best right a complex wrong and have opted to look the other way and do nothing . <p> Swimming World , much good work in the archive to its credit down the years , has also sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmers of the year not only there for the past two months , two seasons , two years but for two whole decades and more before the American publication decided to remove the names from its historic roll of honour . There 's nothing like meeting a deadline but deadline would that be in late 2013 ? <p> Hard to say what has changed and why now but whatever the reasons , the only plaster available to SW for this particular open wound may only serve to do more harm as it seeks to have " Stripped ! " extended to the where it would be truly felt : in the focus of a wider world and in the world of those , understandably , providing supportive statements for the case for justice . <p> Here is what Swimming as a statement from USA Swimming : <p> " The issues surrounding the alleged drug use of the East German swimmers have been extremely complex . This is a sensitive topic that has affected our swimming community , especially the athletes competing during that time period . USA Swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean from illegal drug use . If there was doping involved in the achievement of past Olympic medals or records , we believe that the medals should be stripped and the records should be invalidated . " <p> Not quite as far as agreeing with SW stance . " Alleged " and " If there was doping " ? We assume its an over-cautious lawyer talking there . There is no " if " of " alleged " about it . And if you go for " Stripped ! " in the case of the GDR , you must do it , too , for all cases that would have to be backdated beyond the scope of the WADA Code . <p> Many sports institutions have chosen to look the other way to avoid complication and even the obvious risk of being accused as compliant as guardians who at the very best could be said to have reacted to the strength of argument at a pace not even worthy of the heats at the age-group swim meet at a pool near you . <p> The definitions of cheating in sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from country to country in a world of sport that signs up to a single WADA Code has made that the case . For Americans among others they might well ask what sets apart an athlete suspended because of taking a supplement that had more in it than it said it had in it on the tin no deliberate act by the athlete and a GDR swimmer who at 13 and 14 was regularly taken into a side room at a pool , had injections stuck in her butt , blue pills placed in her mouth ( the coach or doctor standing there to make sure she swallowed ) and told that such things were to help her to recuperate from hard training but she need n't worry her family about it or in other words you better shut up , or else no deliberate act by the athlete . <p> Still . Stripped ! is what we want , is n't it ? <h> Let 's go back <p> The story " broke " long before any niche swimming publication got to it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research to Deceit was published . It confirmed in part through Stasi and other documents saved from the shredders by people , since deceased , working with the authors Prof. Werner Franke and his wife Brigitte Berendonk the existence and nauseating detail of a stat plan , complete with the dosages of Oral Turinabol administered to specific athletes , swimmers included . <p> On 26 August 1993 , after the former GDR had disbanded itself to accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990 , records were opened and State Plan 14:25 confirmed : the Stasi , the GDR state secret police , supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in 1990 . Doping existed in other countries but the GDR was officially unique in so far as having a state plan designed to win in international sport as a way of saying ' look how great our democratic republic and socialist/communist state is ' . <p> The body and bulk of what was discovered is now held in places public and private in several countries , safe from the long arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . Some of that evidence was used in legal cases against coaches , doctors and others in the German doping trials of the late 1990s and subsequent compensation claims by athletes who suffered a spectrum of woes , from personal health , physical and psychological problems to the horrors of inheritance in the form of children born with club feet and a variety of other disabilities . <p> Oral Turinabol was just part of the poisonous cocktail of substances administered not only to medal-winning ' ambassadors in tracksuits ' but to many who were never destined to make it beyond the Berlin Wall . Like the bulk of good but not world-class swimmers in the world , they were club swimmers but with a dark difference ; they served as human guinea pigs to test the effectiveness of substances that had never been clinically trailed in labs before bing administered to the athletes . <p> If The Times in London carried the first post-reunification interview with Kornelia Ender in December 1991 , penned by me and revealing her recollection of regular injections and pills that she now knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be performance-enhancing substances , then news agencies , broadcasters and news publications galore from around the world revealed similar cases after cases , many confirming the shocking depth , width , malice aforethought and criminality of State Plan 14:25 . <p> In the late 1990s , German and international media ran regular reports from the doping trials , while Nick Thierry 's , courtesy of the work of Karin , ran almost daily reports in the infancy of online , that revealed the crimes committed . <p> A special page on the internet was created by doping victims trying to gain justice and compensation , listing people involved in State Plan 14:25 . Those people included Dr Lothar Kipke , who remains on the FINA list of " Pins " , the awards given to those who have graced swimming with good service and upheld all the best of values . I stand to be corrected but I am not aware of any official proposal from the USA to have Kipke and our convicted criminals removed from the FINA honours list and for that to be officially recorded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stripped ! " <p> That word and tone is not appropriate for the swimmers , however , no matter how much we agree with the need to address and face up to The Big Lie that was . As SW presses on with what would be a surface solution to a much wide problem , let 's take another plunge into a depth of dark players , those who truly deserved being " Stripped ! " , some punished some not ( and the names below are the tip of an iceberg that goes well beyond the GDR right up to this day ) and an alternative way of dealing with the past . <h> State Plan 14:25 <p> State Plan 14:25 held that children ( for many of those doped , particularly in sports such as swimming , were under age ) would be doped with substances such as anabolic steroids , some never clinically tested on animals before human guinea pigs were plied with them , and without the knowledge or consent of their parents . The 1966 blueprint refers to the drugs as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be signed as official policy until 1974 but experimentation on athletes started much earlier certainly from 1971 with research for the plan dating back to the mid 1960s . It was the biggest pharmacological experiment in sports history . <p> The drugs , administered by doctors and coaches , included Oral-Turinabol , a synthetic anabolic agent developed for cancer patients ; testosterone derivatives ; and " STS 646 " , a drug considered too dangerous to licence inside the GDR but given to teenagers before being tested on lab rats . " The pills came in a box of chocolates , " Catherine would say in court in 1999 . You are unlikely to know here name . By the time she spoke she had suffered seven miscarriages in the years after quitting the sport in which she was fed a diet of drugs but not for international glory . " I was a guinea-pig . I was used to test drugs for better athletes so they could win for the GDR . " <p> The masterminds behind the plan were Manfred Ewald and Dr Manfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Berlin , doping HQ , the hub of State Plan 14:25 if you like . The room is just 3 metres square . In it he penned his reports for his Stasi ( secret police ) overlords on a fold-down table he had installed because there was no room for a proper table . The room was all taken up by boxes of steroids ready for shipping to sports programmes around the country . Hoeppner filed some 1,000 reports to his Stasi contact . Ewald was always in the loop as chief political player at the scene of the crime . In 2000 , Ewald , then 74 , was found guilty on 20 counts of contributing to bodily harm , the tip of an iceberg of his involvement in a terrible crime . <p> Ewald , who started off his court case a confident and robust man but ended it with a ruling that his health would only allow him the fact that they had criminal convictions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties . Together they had faced 142 counts of assisting grievous bodily harm . On grounds of time , the judge heard just 22 cases before coming to his conclusion that the men before him were as guilty as sin . <p> Ewald was not handed a financial penalty , as so many others were , for his part in State Plan 14:25 , on the grounds that much time had past since he had been up to his eyeballs in guilt . It took German authorities the best part of 10 years to get cases to court , even though the same evidence as produced in 1998-2000 had been available in 1992-93 . <p> At Hoeppner 's right-hand was Dr Lothar Kipke , member of the medical commission of FINA . In that capacity he bangs the anti-doping drum but back home he is one of the worst offenders in the sporting crime of the century . A former member of the Nazi party , Kipke was described in a German court in Berlin in 2000 as " the Joseph Mengele of GDR sport " . He will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation for team travel to the US , Dr Kipke forced ... athletes to be given testosterone injections . Dr Kipke is brutal in giving the injections . He does n't consider any pain it causes to the athlete and almost rams the into the body . " Hoeppner 's notes to his Stasi liaison officer . <p> Hoeppner and Kipke sat at the helm of a covert network that coerced and corrupted doctors , coaches , scientists , chemists and swimmers , among others athletes . He keeps a tight ship : beyond issuing " supporting means guidelines " with specific instructions on dosages , he orders abortions : <p> " Should a pregnancy occur while anabolic steroids are being taken then it is recommended in all cases that an abortion is carried out . " Children born to athletes who had taken steroids are to be delivered in a Stasi clinic so that " a decision could be taken as to what to do " in the event of " complications " . <p> Hoeppner later got cold feet as the monster he created got out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their girls ( and boys ) . Most victims were teenage girls . Carola Nitschke and Antje Stille were 13 when they were put on a steroid regime , court cases would reveal in 1999 and 2000 . In his trial , Kipke adopted the role of Nazi concentration camp guard : " I was only following orders ... " . There to hear him was former swimmer Martina , who urged her abuser to " look my 15-year-old son in the eyes and tell him you were just following orders " . Her son , Daniel , sat beside her , his clubfoot swinging under the bench . <p> The network headed by Hoeppner and Kipke extended to beyond Berlin HQ . In Leipzig , Prof Dr Helga Pfeifer is among those rolling out State Plan 14:25 . As she confessed me in 2005 during a reflection of her GDR days and in the days after it was revealed that she had been selling flume equipment for Chinese swim programmes in Shanghai : <p> " Yes , I was involved . I knew about the doping ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't want to risk 35 years of sports science work and I do n't feel I have to apologise for that . I know which system I had to live and grow up in . No-one at the time knew how long that system would be in place . " <p> Pfeifer handles the sports science data at the heart some of the biggest Olympic sports , swimming included . It is unfair , she told me , to taint " brilliant " work with the doping that was a part of something bigger . Many beg to differ , if only because neither she nor we can say how good GDR swimmers might have been had fair play been the watchword of a rotten regime . Two months after the Berlin Wall fell , Pfeifer , with official government permission Down Under , was invited to the Australian Institute of Sport . Her scientific papers were still to be found in the library of the AIS in recent years . <p> Pfeifer , along with many others steeped in the task of rolling out State Plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Among coaches , national team coaches Juergen Tanneberger and Wolfgang Richter and the East German swimming federation general secretary Egon Muller were among those who received one-year suspended jail sentences after being found guilty grievous bodily harm for having distributed steroids to under-age athletes without their knowledge . Several other national team coaches who had continued to coach Olympic , world and European champions throughout the 1990s , also had their careers brought to a halt after being convicted in trials in 1999 and 2000 . <p> If their guilt was weighty it paled by comparison to that of Kipke , of whom one lawyer for victims said : <p> " He gave injections , he initiated experiments , and did n't care about the individuals . He knew exactly what he was doing . " <p> Kipke , 76 and retired in Leipzig the last we heard , provided a packed courtroom in Berlin in 2000 with this explanation : " At 14 the girls were biologically adult . That 's why we could give them the stuff . They were n't considered minors anymore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found guilty on 58 counts of grievous bodily harm to underage female athletes , was served a 15-month suspended sentence and ordered to pay a fine . That was January 2000 . By October 3 that year , time would run out on the GDR doping court cases under a statute of limitations and all those not already called would walk free . was among seven GDR officials to receive honours from FINA . He received his in 1985 , the year in which Stasi documents show that those who were spying on a spy reported back to Stasi bosses that Kipke appeared to relish administering doping in a " brutal " way . The rotten regime itself saw in Kipke a man who ought to be reined in . Dark irony indeed . <p> Among doctors called to court to account for their role in a massive deception was Dr Dorit Rosler . She would set up a surgery in Strasse in post GDR days with the very purpose of helping victims of the GDR doping system . In court , Rosler broke down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " I should have shown more courage . In Nazi Germany we did what we were told to do . The GDR doping machine was no different ; we were just carrying out medical orders ... have we not learned anything ? " <p> No such level of remorse from Dr Dieter , Dr Ulrich Sunder ( sounds like S ? nde , ' sin ' in German ) and Dr Horst Tausch . They all broke the Hippocratic oath and indeed the law when they administered drugs to swimmers . They were convicted of bodily harm . They continued to practice as doctors years after the doping factory their talents were put to use in had ceased to produce dark results . Among others working in the system was Dr Eberhard Koehler , who sought an injunction to try to prevent publication of a book on GDR doping in which he was named . <p> He was not alone among those wishing to keep the past a secret and denying that events took place in the way that Stasi documents clearly suggested that they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tested and their urine samples sent to the IOC-accredited laboratory at Kreischa , a place charged by the Olympic movement with the task of catch cheats . In fact , what Kreischa did was to make sure the world would never catch the GDR cheating . Sportsmen and women found positive for drugs simply stayed at home , many after serious attempts had been made to wash their bodies of damning evidence . Little wonder that not a single GDR swimmer was ever caught , even though Stasi documents would later reveal the names , with specific doses of drugs administered , of generations of Olympic and world and European swimming champions . <p> In my archive is a copy of a Stasi document that shows tests taken on four women three already Olympic champions by then at Kreischa . The tests were conducted two weeks before racing at the 1989 European championships in Bonn . All four were massively over the allowable **28;533;TOOLONG limit . Between them they claimed six solo medals , four gold , a silver and a bronze , while all four women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the GDR . Between 1970 and 1989 , no other nation claimed a gold medal in women 's relays at the European championships . <p> Many a success was built on a little blue pill made in Jena at the eponymous drugs company Jenapharm . Its representative sat at the table when State Plan 14:25 was discussed and honed , according to Stasi papers . None was ever called to account for their role in the mass abuse of large numbers of young athletes . <p> " If the treatment with anabolics is long-term , or at high dosages , real possibility for androgenic side effects exists . Skin conditions such as acne will develop , virilisation effects such as deeping of the voice , growth of facial hair , masculine habits , increased sexual appetite , and clitoral hypertrophy will all occur . " Jenapharm ( drug company ) paper , 1965 . <p> In 2003 , , beyond its GDR days , won Germany 's Golden Pill Award for services to womanhood . Two years on the company was named in a law suit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent companies denied any wrongdoing . In a statement , Jenapharm acknowledged that the company was obliged to " collaborate in the GDR ' 14.25 ' , but that it was not a driving force behind the national GDR doping programme " . The blame rested with politicians , sports doctors and coaches . The athletes ' claims were unfounded , the company said . <p> Ultimately , an out-of-court settlement was reached and victims compensated by the pharmaceutical industry in Germany and by the German Olympic Committee , which assumed the responsibilities of the GDR Olympic body after reunification . <p> Among the victims were swimmers who in their 30s and 40s suffered defects to heart , liver , gallbladder , chronic back pain , damaged spines and reproductive organs , tumours , had endured multiple miscarriages and given birth to disabled children . <p> Some of those stories may only be told alongside revelations found in Stasi documents confirming the sporting crime of the century because of Prof Werner Franke , a cell biologist and cancer expert in Heidelberg , his wife Brigitte Berendonk and their lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have spoken eloquently in public about her plight is Rica Reinisch , who at the age of 15 won three gold medals at the Olympic Games of Moscow in 1980 , each win producing a world record . " The worst thing was that I did n't know I was being doped , " she told The Guardian years later . <p> " I was lied to and deceived . Whenever I asked my coach what the tablets were I was told they were vitamins and preparations . " <p> Years on and Prof Franke would say : " There was no medical reason to give steroids . It was against the law of the German Democratic Republic . It was against medical ethics . Everybody knew these drugs were not allowed . The people who participated in this clandestine operation knew that they would lose privileges if they refused to take part . <p> " But they also knew they would n't be executed . Some of the arguments now resemble those brought forward in the Third Reich . Those involved disapproved of what they were doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a matter of national prestige , and was good for their careers . The Jesuits have a saying : ' For the greater glory of God . ' This is what happened here . " <p> God and goodness , of course , had nothing to do with the abomination of the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 . <p> It was from 1990 that the many who spoke out against the massive deception on which GDR sport was built felt truly free to do so . Two decades on from reunification , there are those who prefer to stay silent rather than tell the truth that unfolded at the expense of others who were robbed of their rightful claim to history . And there are former athletes who can not lead normal lives , who live in pain , who take daily medication to help them to cope with the fallout of the poison pumped into their bodies . <p> In 2009 , on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , Deutsche Welle reported the case of Berlin resident Birgit Boese , for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Noted the report : The 48-year-old former athlete depends on crutches to get around , and she and her husband have to forego visits together to the theater , movies or local swimming pool . " Because of the pain , we ca n't really take part in public life , " she told DW . <p> Once groomed to show the world that the GDR was best at shot put , Boese now suffers from an irregular heartbeat , high-blood pressure , diabetes , nerve damage , kidney problems , " and a list of other ailments that have made her all but an invalid " . Her journey through a nightmare started when she was just 11 , when she started at sports school and was told to take the little blue pills that fed the East German medals machine . <p> Boese and 183 other victims of State Plan 14:25 were awarded compensation in 2006 from the German Olympic Sports Organisation ( DOSB ) and the drug company Jenapharm . Each received 9,250 euros from the pharmaceutical company in an out-of-court settlement and 170 of the plaintiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boese : <p> " It helped , sure . But for those with chronic illnesses and who have to pay out of pocket for medications , the money did n't go that far . " <p> Just how the above , all in world media reports and official court documents in Germany , could be framed in terms of " alleged " is a matter for USA Swimming to reflect on . <p> What should have come to pass long ago and can still happen is for USA Swimming , through weighty representation in FINA , on the Bureau as well as the Technical Swimming Committee , to call for the pins of Kipke and his cronies to be removed . There is no " alleged " in the way : Kipke is a convicted criminal , his crime specifically related to swimming and doping as a former FINA official . Case closed . So far , the international federation has taken the ' ' approach . That will always be the case unless a case is made and brought by serious players with influence . <h> Different Perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14-year-old victims as thieves , cheats and deceivers . They were no such thing . They grew up in a time and a place and in circumstances that put a torch to suggestions that they had a choice , could have objected , could have told someone , could have gone home told their parents and expected their parents to step in . This was a country , at the political level and beyond sport , in which , some objectors who later developed cancer believe that they were deliberately exposed to radiation while waiting to be called for interrogation ; a country in which many were shot dead while trying to escape to a place of choice through barbed-wire barricades . <p> Down the years , I have met many of the GDR 's swim champions and medallists . In two cases , I detected a troubling tone of self-justification and defence of an indefensible system . In the vast bulk of cases , the swimmers , polite , pleasant , well-educated and getting on with what might be described as " ordinary lives " beyond the pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak with dignity and patience about painful episodes in their lives . <p> Some of them may well have gold medals but they are all victims to one degree of another . <p> Should the bitter gust now , yet again , blow in the face of victims ? No . The truth of their story should surely be acknowledged but not rammed in their faces with the same vigour as it took Kipke and his cronies to ram needles in their butts . <h> History Can not Be Rewritten But Retold With The Truth <p> We can not and should not wipe out history , clear the books of the names of those who touched the wall first . It happened . And we know how . Swimming World voted for those people and that , too , should always be on the record and remembered . <p> What you can do is adjust the books , place an asterisk where an explanation is required . What the IOC , FINA and others can do is honour those who followed the asterisk . Every federation in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up with special honours within the realms of their country 's system of rewarding achievement in recognition of the status denied to them not by the human in the next lane but by the vehicle and victim of organised crime in the next lane . <p> Give Garapick and Co honorary honours and medals that say " this is what I was really worth " ( and recognise , too , that the new lists will surely leave some very troubling results in place from a time when the GDR was highly unlikely to have been the only ' beneficiary ' of illicit means ) . <p> But let the record stand alongside every footnote necessary to make sport an honest place for future generations while treating victims on all sides with the dignity and recognition that they deserve . <p> Craig , this is FANTASTIC . Years ago , I was lucky to purchase a video documentary ( which I no longer have ) called The Swim Wonder . It was nothing more than a propaganda piece put out by the DDR government following the Berlin Dynamo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as successful as the team was in June of 1978 , they were about to be destroyed at the World Championships by Caulkins and Company . After that debacle , the DDR team was never challenged again until the Wall came down . Many times I read through old Swimming Worlds and look at the results from worlds and Olympics and remove ALL of the DDR names from the medal placings and insert the true winners ( as well as the Chinese names from 1988 to 1998 ) . Your article brought back so many memories of talks I had with American and British swimmers who were victimized by the DDR doping system . I will never give up hope that the swimmers who lost their absolute and true placings will be vindicated . But a friend reminded me of the expression , " Live in hope , die in despair . " I hope it does not come to that . Again , thank you for this masterpiece ! Bravo , my friend . Bravo ! <p> mister clive December 6 , 2013 <p> " Every federation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Absolutely . I wonder why none have done so ? Just one federation taking this step may start a trend and they could each do it independently of the " I see no ships , " stance of their international governing bodies . There are many representatives on those international bodies from countries directly affected by the skewed medal tables . I wonder why they have never stood up and spoken out for national recognition for those athletes ? <p> Craig Lord December 6 , 2013 <p> Clive I think that in some cases , at least , it is a case of not wanting to rock political boats on their own voyage through a system that often rewards the easy nod and rejects challenge . Disappointing that there has been such a shortage of best leadership qualities . <p> December 6 , 2013 <p> As you point out , individual swimmers were not the only ones affected . Consider the impact that this had on the Canadian programme being the only country to host a summer Olympics and not win a single gold medal ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Now imagine what a difference it would have made to future results had the swimming team won 3 Gold , 7 silver and 5 Bronze medals as opposed to the record books which show just 2 silvers and 6 bronze . Funding , self esteem and coaching confidence would all have been vastly different . Clearly the ensuing results were also greatly tainted by the Soviet Union and other prominent iron curtain countries not to mention China and you only have to look at the results of Michelle Smith to realize the incredible effect that doping can have with ( no offense ) ordinary swimmers . I just wish we could be confident that it no longer part of the equation . <p> JMAN December 9 , 2013 <p> Thanks Craig . Very nice . I feel sorry for the other countries swimmers who were cheated and for the GDR women . I definitely do n't feel sorry for those who administered the PEDs and think they should have paid a higher penalty . However , for those of us who think it should have been easy to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just wonder if put in the same circumstance who of us might have been able to do so at the risk of losing a lot in a place that was as horrible as East Germany ? Not justifying at all what they did ... just wondering what it was like . When i read about people who did this , who went against the status quo at their own peril ( Mandela , Rosa Parks , Schindler , etc. ) you realize they were the few who were extraordinary . Most of us are not extraordinary . Just wondering . <p> I also wonder why they never did the same with their men ? <p> Rob December 9 , 2013 <p> Spare a thought for some of the women in international athletics , they still have the records standing . Valery Adams virtually unbeaten since 2007 in shot put and still only about the 30th best of all time . <p> There would be issues in obtaining medals for the 4th plus place getters . I know NZ bike rider Bruce Biddle finished 4th in Munich road race only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not and never will be promoted to 3rd as he was not required to submit to a drug test as fourth place finisher . Despite heavy lobbying the IOC refuses to upgrade this medal . I imagine the same would be of swimming . <p> Craig Lord December 9 , 2013 <p> Rob , yes , It is the same ... and even when on GDR swimmer sat in front of Samaranch , pushed her medals across the table , said ' these do n't belong to me ... only to see him push them back and say words to the effect ' you were n't the only ones ' . <p> Craig Lord December 9 , 2013 <p> Thanks ... <p> Fear ( as well as cultural ' education ' ) was a big factor : there are a lot of cases where athletes would be threatened , families visited by the stasi and so on , to make the point that if you did chose to do a runner ( let alone ' tell all ' ) , those closest to you would pay a price @@@2015668 <h> Our observer soon 
 Four Corners Of World Swimming in 2014 <p> The year that takes us to the middle of the Olympic cycle is unique : the only 12 months that does not bring the world of swimming together for global long-course battle . <p> The 2014 season will end with many of the world 's best gathered at the FINA World Short-Course Championships , beyond the s/c World Cup Season . <p> Along the way , the four main long-course targets are the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow July 24-29 , in August the European Championships in Berlin ( ) and a Gold Coast Pan Pacific Championships Down Under ( 21-24th ) , and the Asian Games , in Incheon , South Korea from September 19 to October 4 . <p> Australia , in the midst of summer , will be the first nation to host a showcase battle this year , the BHP Billiton Aquatic Super Series looming on the Perth horizon . The event will be staged at the Challenge Stadium ( swimming , water polo ) and on The Swan ( Open Water ) from January 31 to February 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Australian swimming team led by an overseas head coach , Dutchman Jacco Verhaeren set to take up the reins this month .

As the only key target of 2014 for Americans in the long-course pool , the Pan Pacs will not end without a fight at every turn as the USA , with Missy Franklin , Katie Ledecky , Matt Grevers and Co , seeks to maintain its status as Aquatic Superpower . The championship environment holds one of the best-kept secret weapons in the American treasury of success . <p> The world knows much about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world is the exchange of knowledge more open , through direct experience of coaches and swimmers through to such forums as ASCA 's World Clinic coaching clinics to the openness of grass-roots programs that provide the birthing pool for so much success years down the elite stream . <p> Come the spill into the ocean , come the crunch of challenge , however , the United States finds its way to the top of the food chain time and time and time again . There is tradition and expectation at play , not to mention cultural issues and team dynamics that are part of the alchemy of success . You will often here others say ' what works for the US would n't work for us ' . Maybe so but it would be equally true to say that no other model , beyond the long road that led to Don Talbot and team celebrating an Aussie victory at Fukuoka world titles in 2001 , has found a way to get past the USA when it comes down to team and table . <p> Berlin will host the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be said of others , such as Britain , to some extent ) is less about 2014 or even 2015 as it is 2016 : German and British swimmers have proved themselves worthy in abundance at European and Commonwealth levels and you can expect them to do so again this year . Fulfilling Olympic potential remains an elusive mission for both national programs . <p> The 2013 season ended with the Duel in the Pool and a 1-point tie-breaker victory for the USA over a team of European All-Stars in a terrific showcase for swimming . Things could be much better still . Imagine if Katinka Hosszu , among others , had opted in for Europe instead of opting for the soft challenge and commitment to St Petersburg and Reunion . She and her American coach Shane Tusup may well reply : imagine if the US , among others , had opted into the World Cup and made it the best challenge it could have been .

They were not and could not be , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of it by the close of 2013 . <p> Choices , commitments to self , nation , college , then costs and calendars : all come in to play and all mould swimming into the sport it is . Best potential from the missing might at this meet or that right through to the slim prospect of a world championships that would see the best 20 30 in the world , from whichever nation they may hail , in battle for a true ' world-title chase of the best ' is often locked in the virtual world of rankings . <p> In the real world , there is no doubting which nation continues to set the pace in world waters : the USA , both in terms of its own swiftest shoals and the aid provided to other nations who have swimmers based in the United States ( and we will soon bring you our Swim League of Nations count for 2013 as a measure of who has gone up and who has gone down ) . <p> Meanwhile , the thrill of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtual world to consider where strength lies on the back of a bygone season , an exercise that enables us to note the missing might preparing to reappear in 2014 and shake-up the order of things once more , such as Paul Biedermann , for Germany , and Park Taehwan , for South Korea on freestyle , and those who made it up there on the clock in 2013 but could not back up come the podium chase , their potential still ahead of them . <p> We will return to prospects and form guides for the major meets as the season unfolds . For now , we can turn to the times and players ( both will remain as fluid as they ever were , of course ) at the helm of the 2013 world rankings for an overview of standards required for podium status at world level and see how those fit in the puzzle of strength split in parcels relevant to the 2014 season ahead . <p> That exercise grants us the following medal tables ( across all Olympic events ) by major international meet blocks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , with some swimmers counted in two competitions ) . It provides a view of which leading players are heading to which meets and how that translates to global strength at each of our virtual meets ahead of reality . <p> On this basis , the toughest podium chase of all rests with those heading to the Pan Pacs , though a detailed event-by-event study reveals the tantalising prospects in all four major internationals , including Park Taehwan vs Sun Yang in Asia and the return match of Yuliya Efimova photo : Patrick B. Kraemer , Ruta Meilutyte and Rikke Pedersen in Europe . Few rules apply in such exercises but key among those that must be applied is this : take nothing for granted and expect the form guide to be turned on its head by someone , somewhere , somehow , in the next year of progress for newt wavers Mack Horton , Cameron McEvoy and many more . <h> Comments <p> Asif Shariff January 2 , 2014 <p> It 'll be interesting to see if any world records are broken in the long course meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofcourse rio2016 ...

 History Denied To Dutch Ace Enith <p> This year marks the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall . Following our joint open letter and petition with Swimming World asking FINA to recognise the victims on both sides of the GDR 's systematic doping State Plan 14:25 , John Lohn asks : is n't it time Enith took her rightful place in thee pantheon and the International Swimming Hall of Fame ? <p> As he made up ground in rapid fashion in the closing strokes , ultimately prevailing by the slimmest margin in the sport , Suriname 's Anthony Nesty was lauded for a pair of breakthroughs . By edging American Matt Biondi by a mere .01 in the 100 butterfly final at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul , Nesty became the first athlete from Suriname to capture an Olympic medal . More , he became the first black swimmer to win Olympic gold . <p> It was truly a great accomplishment and continues to stand out as such , but was Nesty actually beaten to the achievement ? Well , that depends on the pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be the first black swimmer to win an Olympic crown . Still , an argument can be made that the Netherlands ' Enith got there first Main image , courtesy of USA Swimming <p> While the East German drug machine was humming along in the 1970s , Oral Turinabol the fuel of choice by doctors and coaches overseeing the program , enjoyed a decade as a bona fide star . She gained her first Olympic experience at the 1972 Games in Munich , qualifying for the championship final in three events . But this was just the start of her success . <p> continued to surge following the Munich Games , claiming a silver medal in the 200 backstroke and a bronze medal in the 100 freestyle at the inaugural World Championships in 1973 . A year later , she was a five-time medalist ( four individual ) at the European Championships and in 1975 , she added three bronze medals at the World Champs , including individual pieces of hardware from the 100 freestyle and 200 freestyle . <p> With the 1976 Olympics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there were questions whether she was a gold-medal hope , what with East German athletes basically plowing through the opposition . Indeed , was denied a gold medal , as she earned bronze medals in both the 100 freestyle and 200 freestyle . <p> The 100 freestyle is where the focus belongs , for the only athletes who finished ahead of the Dutchwoman were East Germans Kornelia Ender ( gold ) and Petra Priemer ( silver ) , both later revealed to be part of although unknowingly their country 's doping program . What does it mean ? On a level playing field , could have been the first black Olympic swimming champion , beating Nesty to the top of the podium by 12 years . <p> The tale Photo : courtesy of , however , goes beyond the possibility of her being the first of her race to win Olympic swimming gold .

How can that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals in major international competition , and on 10 of those occasions , it was an East German woman who was the gold medalist . <p> To be a multi-time Olympic medalist , a multi-time medalist at the World Championships and a multi-time medalist at the European Championships should be enough to garner Hall of Fame accolades , even if none of the medals were of the golden variety . In 's case , there is the need to look deeper and understand that without the evil of doping , some of her medals could have been golden . <p> One of the most-used clich ? s is better late than never , and while should have been inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame years ago , it 's never too late to right a wrong . That 's what the ISHOF committee can do in the future , and give Enith the recognition she and her career truly deserve . <p> Craig Lord notes : <p> If the GDR results carried an asterisk* in recognition that the performance was enhanced by the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognising those who might well have had a different standing in swimming history , here is where fits :@@2208188 <h> Paedophile who used 
 League Of Suspensions in 2013 <p> FINA imposed or reported the imposition of just 30 anti-doping penalties in 2013 , across all aquatic sports . Swimming accounted for 23 of the cases while in only one case was a coach or any other associated with the athlete suspended served a parallel suspension . The numbers compared to 78 suspensions in track and field last year . <p> At a time when we recall the damage done by the GDR era , important to note that while the days of state systematic doping may be done , the scourge of cheating and illicit means is alive and kicking . Not all who ended up on the list intended to cheat , of course , nor is it likely that all who cheated got caught . <p> Russia topped the table of positives with five swimmers added to the list of athletes who have fallen foul of anti-doping rules , with Poland , on 3 cases ( all swimmers ) , and China , Colombia , Denmark , Estonia , France and Romania next on the table with two suspensions each . Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports in recent years : a brief ahead , then , for the 1980 and 1988 Olympic freestyle champion Vladimir Salnikov at the helm of the Russian swimming federation that reported there five cases after several other disturbing cases in 2012 . <p> The Estonian affair was the one case in which the athlete suspension was reduced to reflect the guilt of the coach . Anita Stepanenko had her drink spiked with Stanozolol by then coach now former coach Nikolai Borzov . He was suspended for life , Stepanenko barred for a year . <p> Inconsistency was alive and kicking regardless of a WADA Code intended to treat all in equal measure . While Indian swimmer Arjun Muralidharan and Australian swimmer Calum Timms were barred for two years after testing positive for Methylhexaneamine ( Class Specified Stimulants ) , Vladislav ( KGZ ) and Mikhail ( RUS ) each received a suspension of a year from their respective federations , Kyrgyz Republic and Russian , for the same category of offence ( and in three cases precisely the same substance ) . <p> The case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconsistencies . The swimmer tested positive for Bromantan ( Class Non-specified Stimulants ) and was barred for a year . Back in 1996 at the Atlanta Olympic Games , Nick Gillingham ( GBR ) , after silver in 1988 and bronze in 1992 over breaststroke , finished fourth in that race . European champion Andrei Korneyev , alongside teammate Nina , were among Russians who tested positive for , a substance used by astronauts to help to combat dehydration . FINA announced that the bronze would go to Gillingham but a CAS hearing lifted the ban on and the Russians were reinstated . Later , 's " banned substance " status was reintroduced and reinforced . <p> France ended 2013 , meanwhile , with two minor suspensions in swimming , Lise Grenier barred for a month after testing positive for Prednisone and Prednisolone ( Class S.9 Glucocorticosteroids ) and Lisa Ferreira given a warning after she tested positive for Terbutaline ( Class S.3 Beta-2-Agonists ) . <h> In 2013 , all sports were also alerted by WADA to the dangers of GW501516 <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention that the black market substance GW501516 is being sold to and used by some athletes. ? ? The side effect of this chemical compound is so serious that WADA is taking the rare step of warning " cheats " to ensure that there is complete awareness of the possible health risks to athletes who succumb to the temptation of using GW501516 for performance enhancement . " <p> GW501516 ( also known as GW-501,516 , GW1516 , GSK-516 and Endurobol ) is a PPARd receptor agonist that was previously investigated for drug use by GlaxoSmithKline . The drug was discovered to cause cancer in rats and GlaxoSmithKline has ceased development . Investigated as a potential treatment for obesity , diabetes , dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease , the substance activates the same pathways activated through exercise . GW501516 is said to have a synergistic effect when combined with AICAR ( **30;610;TOOLONG ribonucleotide is an intermediate in the generation of inosine monophosphate ; inosinic acid is important in metabolism ) : the combination has been shown to significantly increase exercise endurance in animal studies more than either compound alone , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2008 Beijing Olympics that GW501516 could be used by athletes as an ergogenic performance enhancing drug that was not currently controlled by regulations or detected by standard tests . The World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) has conducted research ( ongoing ) on a test for GW501516 and other related PPARd modulators , added to the prohibited list from 2009 onwards . In 2012 , WADA GW501516 from a gene doping compound to a " hormone and metabolic modulator " . <p> GW501516 has been promoted on bodybuilding and athletics websites and has been available for some time on the black market .

And on January 7 , 2014 , Franklin added a mythical gold medal to her collection for the characteristics of kindness , inspiration and good will , among the other positive attributes she possesses . <p> Where is this piece going ? Hang in there . <p> Since leaving the world of sports journalism on a full-time basis at the end of 2009 , I 've spent the past four years working as a media specialist in the field of education . After three years in one district , I 've settled into a new district this year , one which I hope to be a part of until retirement knocks . Being surrounded by tremendous colleagues and energetic and hard-working students ( kindergarten through fourth grade ) makes going to work each day an easy task . And stories like the following only add to enjoyment . <p> A little more than a month ago , a fourth-grade student named Lily Hughes took part in an after-school program called the Fearless Dragons Writing Club . It was overseen by Andrea and exposed to the students to different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing skills . In one of the final assignments , students were challenged to craft the start of a story in which they time-traveled to meet one of their idols . <p> Hughes , a 10-and-under swimmer who has qualified for the New Jersey State Championships , wrote about racing Franklin at the 2012 Games . ( Her story can be read below in its entirety ) . Throughout the story , Hughes had positive experiences with Franklin , and even defeated her for a gold medal . At the end , Hughes indicated it was all a dream , until she turned and saw an Olympic medal on her pillow . <p> While Hughes ' story was well-written and creative , it also exhibited a passion and sense for how she idolizes Franklin . For that reason , I decided to send the story to D.A . Franklin , Missy 's mom . Once the story was in the hands of D.A . Franklin , everything took off . First , she forwarded the story to Missy , who is in the middle of her freshman year at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin family offered to send Hughes an autographed picture . Then , Missy took things a step further when she decided to mail Hughes a medal she won as an 18-and-under at the AT&amp;T Short Course Nationals . Matching the event from Hughes ' story , it was a medal from the 200 individual medley . <p> When the package arrived at school , smiles abounded in the main office . First , there was appreciation for Franklin 's kindness and the way her gesture spoke volumes about her character . Second , we knew the package was going to a deserving student . After lunch , McGinn 's principal , Dr. Sasha Slocum , arranged for a presentation in Hughes ' classroom . The fourth-grader was thrilled to first open the autographed picture . When she then opened the box on her desk , her look of disbelief was priceless . Her classmates , too , were thrilled . <p> Since breaking onto the national and international stages as one of swimming 's rising stars , Missy Franklin 's effervescent smile and bubbly personality have been a calling card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done from an athletic standpoint , she 's equally competent at giving back to her fans ( in a big way in Hughes ' case ) and providing inspiration to youngsters who envision competing on a global stage at some point in the future . <p> The fact that D.A . Franklin coordinated the generous gesture provides a pretty clear picture of the household in which Missy was raised . Simply , D.A . and Dick Franklin raised a daughter who was taught to be caring , humble and giving . How else can you explain one of the world 's finest female athletes regardless of sport taking the time to reach out to a fourth-grader across the country ? <p> The future for Missy Franklin figures to be filled with many more medals , Olympic and otherwise . She 's one of the biggest talents to ever come through the sport on the women 's side and there is no reason to believe she 'll be slowing down any time soon . But going forward , I have a feeling that when Missy Franklin 's name comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look on a student 's face when she was treated to an amazing surprise by one of her heroes . <p> It 's a safe bet Lily Hughes will remember the day , too . <p> **28;445;TOOLONG <p> Here is the story by McGinn Elementary School fourth-grade student Lily Hughes about meeting her idol , Missy Franklin . <p> " Are you getting ready ? " asked mom . Lily had a big meet that day . She was going to swim her favorite event , the I.M. , in the state championships . " Yes , I am getting my cap on ! " yelled Lily . Just as her mom was coming up the stairs , Lily 's room started to spin . " What is happening ? " screamed Lily . When the room stopped swimming Lily was so confused . Lily looked around and she could not figure out where she was . <p> " Are you swimming today ? " asked a man who was all dressed in white . Lily looked down and saw that she had on a bathing suit . " Umm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what you are swimming ? " " Umm , I 'm not sure where I am so I am not sure what I am swimming , " said Lily . " OK , let 's find out , " answered the man in white . <p> Together they looked through the program . Then they found it . It was on the very last page . " That event is coming up soon , " said the man in white . " Great ! Before you leave , can I ask a question ? " Sure , " said the man . " Where am I ? " asked Lily . " Look up , " said the man . Lily looked up and saw the viewing seats were filled with excited spectators holding signs . Then she heard a familiar voice , a voice she had heard many times on TV . Lily 's mouth fell open . <p> Lily was in shock . Standing right in front of her was the person she could not take her eyes off for an entire week in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was her idol Missy Franklin . " Are you swimming in this race ? " asked Missy . " Umm , yes , " Lily said , with her voice shaking . " Well then let 's get going ! " replied Missy . <p> " Take your mark ... beep . " Lily 's heart was beating fast . Missy as usual had a great start , but Lily was right there with her . Missy 's streamline was like a torpedo and Lily stayed with her . Another stroke and a great turn . Lily could see that she was not very far behind Missy . The third part of the race was breaststroke and that was Lily 's favorite stroke . Lily managed to catch up to the best swimmer in the world ! If she could just hang on through the freestyle . <p> The last two laps went by in a blur . Lily was so excited she thought her heart would burst . Lily reached for the wall at the end of the race and just as she touched she started to feel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was back in her room hugging her swim team towel . " Wow , that was a great dream ! But I wonder who won ? " Lily rolled over to get out of bed . Lying on her pillow beside her was a gold medal and a note that said , " Great race . Keep swimming , " signed Missy Franklin . <h> Comments <p> Nance January 8 , 2014 <p> Thank you for this wonderful article ! There is a transcendence about the Franklin family : utterly grounded , and tremendously gifted , graced to encourage the next generation at the heart level . I timed at a meet with an age grouper who , because of her mom 's position with a charity , spent a day with Missy last year . As we timed , she related the was Missy was personally interested in her , asking questions , and was very encouraging . More recently , I commented on a post in Missy 's Facebook page . D.A . responded personally to me as though I were a friend of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looks from here they are not just talkin ' the talk , they are being graced with a world stage to " walk the walk " of Love in action . <p> great stories like this that will inspire people to get out into the pool ! Super <p> Bryan Ramona January 8 , 2014 <p> John , <p> That 's a terrific article and great account of two exceptional young women . As a proud Cal alum , after a miserable football season jaded us all , it 's fantastic to see the impact Missy is making both in and out of the pool . As a long-time Delaware County resident , I 'm sad to read this , only because I miss reading this caliber of work in the Delco Daily Times ! Best of luck in your future endeavors helping mold young people into exceptional adults there in the shadow of the Big Apple ! <p> Moving Liquid January 9 , 2014 <p> That was beautiful . I 'm so grateful you shared this event with us . <p> Bill Bell January 9 , 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come true . Like the man sez : " Ya got ta believe ! " The " Miracle Mets " did it .

 Thinkers Light Up A Pathfinding Day In Lund <p> When Professor Joan Duda stood up to speak at the World Aquatic Development Conference here in Lund , Sweden , she said : " We 've heard the good the bad and , quite frankly , the ugly , here today . " Just before she sat down at the end of a world-class presentation that challenged swimming to find a better way of being , she concluded : " I never want to see this kind of thing happen ever again . " was there to hear the outstanding presentations of American swimmers Allison Wagner , Dana Vollmer and Caitlin that triggered her comments and we will report on those soon alongside the pathway set out by Prof. Duda beyond a leading research project by seven European Universities that aims to transform the environment of youth sport and athlete wellbeing . <p> Rarely , if ever , do you sit through four presentations at a swim conference ( any conference for that matter ) in one afternoon without being overwhelmed by a need for coffee and fresh air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day of four at WADC went far further than marking one of those rare occasions : if in the years ahead ( and the sooner the better ) , the words spoken by a sorority of thinkers in Lund do not influence change for the better in sport , if they are not held up as building blocks for a culture to aspire to and act upon , we will all have to hang our heads in shame . <p> Of the four presentations , that of Vollmer and Leverenz marked the only deliberate collaboration and interaction , yet there was no denying the thread that wove all themes neatly together by coincidence on a day that started with the swimmers in the water at the Swedish Center for Aquatic Research demonstrating and advocating the work of the man on the deck , Milt Nelms ( more on that over the weekend ) . The ethical and performance issues raised , opinion based heavily on experience , facts and research , are as challenging to the sport as a whole and those who govern it as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How to be Good <p> Context was set from go . Coaches were asked to think outside the box from the starting blocks , the day 1- heat 1 presentation from Dr. Fiona McLachlan a call for the guardians of swimming youth to consider " How to be Good " . <p> Her opening shot , one that would frame all that was to follow on a day stacked high with thoughts , facts , experience and research broad and deep , offered four signposts . The pathway did not come with a set of directions demeaning ' take this route to the light ' , rather this was about " the beginning of a conversation " , and " the start of a process " designed to empower and to deliver a better environment and understanding than that which prevails . <p> The journey set out by McLachlan , academic adviser to Shane Gould as the 1972 triple Olympic champion embarks on PHD studies , took in the cultural shock of the Australian review that judged culture at the heart of the sport Down Under to be " toxic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she described as " the mismatch of expectations ( nation ) and what they ( swimmers ) did " . <p> McLachlan listed her four-step process as follows : <p> Big-picture thinking ( philosophy ) <p> Contextualisation ( sociology , history , cultural studies ) <p> Critique ( social and cultural analyses of power ) <p> Transformation ( professional experience + research = performance ) <p> Her work is centred in the realms of bringing meaning and fostering integrity to sport . There were , as told it , two key pillars : <p> a. understand swimming , its embodiment and performance , including an invitation to travel the road down which Milt Nelms has led : " unlearn the cognitive and go back to the sensation of being in water " . <p> Technical and tactical efficiency is the aim of most performance-led programs and clinics and that comes with the pursuit of the latest and best knowledge with which coaches can help their athlete to get the best out of themselves . <p> How does that fit into the four-step process of the scientist , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting go of taken-for-granted assumptions , engaging in experiment , asking why and thinking about possibilities for practice . The need to question should be a daily , integral part of the coaching role , she suggested , big-picture thinking as important as the technical and the tactical . <p> Asking the question what do we want sport to be about , she listed an environment " exclusive , progressive , healthy , one that promotes good practice , diversity and enables people to live fulfilling lives " . The question came down to " how do we use sport in society ? " . The theme is an ethical one , including this range of thought put to coaches by McLachlan : <p> " ... what swimmers do , what they should do , what they are made to do , what you make them do , what you do to them in making them good " . Thought extended to " what coaches should do and how they can be good " . <p> In swimming , the answer to the question " how to be good " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also " being human " . Said McLachlan : " Being good is about both of these things . " She then challenged coaches to send to the conference app five quick-fire answers to the question " what makes a good swimmer ? " <p> The replies spoke often to the theme of the three D 's that Debbie Meyer once cited to me as the mantra of her illustrious achievement : <p> and Vollmer offered : a competitive drive , a continual desire to learn . <p> One coach wrote : A good swimmer wins ! Another offered : being coachable . The latter is among those thoughts that invite further questions on a day that raised issues of power and control , of task-led approaches versus ego-led approaches and the directions in which such journeys lead athlete and coach . What does it mean to be coachable ? Presentations by Leverenz , Vollmer and Allison Wagner would she 'd light on answers from the book of deeper understanding . <p> Coaches , meanwhile , were invited to discuss their answers with throughout the conference and its workshops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coaching is something that happens in Fiji , Sweden , the USA , Australia , Japan and many other countries every day . The word describing the job may be the same but each situation comes with its own environment and circumstances : context . Neither was coaching now what it was 50 years ago , nor what it will be 50 years from now . <p> " It is important to understand the context in which you are working , to understand changes and trends and meet prevailing challenges in ethically responsive ways , " McLachlan told coaches . Doping , suits and a number of other topics sprang to mind , all apt to mould the coaching profession , the sport , the governance of it and the environment in which young folk grow up on the way to a wider world . <p> , from New , had arrived in Australia not too long before the fall out of the Australian review into the events of 2012 , lead-up and London 2012 Olympic Games . She felt the cultural shock of it all through media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Abuse of a system designed to assist preparation <p> Not attending competition to support teammates <p> acting in a manner detrimental to team and elevating themselves above teammates <p> expecting special treatment <p> being satisfied simply with selection rather than performance in Olympic waters <p> having an attitude of what 's in it for me <p> bullying <p> The end result was one of a sport that had not lived up to what the media ( supposedly reflecting the views or a nation and a culture ) expected of ' good swimmers ' . There had been a mismatch of expectation and what unfolded . <p> Though much coverage was focussed on the ' Stilnox Six ' and carried a tone that left " appalled " , the subsequent review came to conclusions that spilled well beyond the individual athlete , including : <p> lack of leadership <p> generational shift challenges <p> lack of proper induction processes <p> team not enforcing consequences for poor behaviour <p> failure to create the right environment <p> abrogating responsibility <p> The challenge to coaches was not only to list the things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what environment they created but to do so regularly in equal measure to the attention paid to the technical and the tactical . <h> Critique <p> This is where we raise problems , ask questions , including those that challenge the status quo . It was , suggested McLachlan , hard for those " outside the sport " to do this but it was crucial to do so . Much more difficult for many within the sport to raise hot topics , from discrimination to sexual misconduct , doping , other bad practice and much else . <p> Many within the sport would find it difficult to engage in the ' critique ' part of the process because : <p> a . They have vested interest in keeping the status quo : it is not in their best interest to challenge or annoy the organisations that employ or control them in some way <p> b. when practices become entrenched and part of the culture of the sport , being a part of that culture " obscures from us the negative context of what we do and criticism of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of critique was not focused on the individual athlete but the big picture . Convention often limits us from thinking outside the box , she suggested , with careful , moral judgment not always within easy reach . <h> Transformation <p> There is , said McLachlan , no point in points 1 to 3 if you do n't close the deal : transformation was the where you change for the better , rid the status quo of the problematic and dangerous . <p> The process of finding areas for potential problems , working through solutions and finding a way to change for the better required " ethical engagement ' . It was not simply a process of fact accumulation . Instead , coaches needed to think about it as an ongoing critical reflection , updating knowledge and responding to context in an ethical manner . The effects on swimming could be potent . <h> Comments <p> i tried to wade through the New Zealanders points but find them non indigent . ( I might re read it if they let us beat the All Blacks ) <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some parallels to the English cricket team ? Believed their own publicity , were not as good as they though , got gongs ( MBEs ) for a lacklustre Ashes 2013 win &amp; got their end result ? They are in shock &amp; the comments in the British media are brutal . <p> Aust Cricket &amp; swimming have been there . One thing about Australia is we are a straight forward people . We know we stunk . We did something about it . it has nothing about being a ' good ' person . Most champions are awful people I suspect . it is about an investment in all things ( in this case swimming ) &amp; getting a worthwhile return . <p> Craig Lord January 12 , 2014 <p> not nec so : the lecture was not headed " how to b a good person " ... it was " How to be good " ... big difference . As for cricket , there are many parallels in world sport that you might draw on . Few of them are helpful . The underlying reasons for falling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which good culture can thrive are more important than the poor behaviour of individual athletes if the aim is to make sure you change things for the better . And in my experience , most champions are not awful people ... in fact in swimming I would say that 's very rare . <p> Not necessarily so . January 13 , 2014 <p> Swimming is not a religion or a philosophy . It is firstly a survival skill &amp; from then on whatever you want . <p> One thing that is disturbing is the focus on coaches . I am very much for swim coaches but they deserve their own lives &amp; family time also . They ca n't be expected to do all &amp; be all these thiNgs especially at 5am . <p> I admit I do n't really know what this person was on about or you . I hate these things . Why ca n't we just swim &amp; be thankful . life is pretty good if you can swim. : ) <p> Not necessarily so . January 13 , 2014 <p> On rethink I would add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all waterways . Why leave it to a few OW swimmers to promote. ? ( btw congrats to Britain for having the cleanest waterways since the industrial revolution ) . <p> Craig Lord January 13 , 2014 <p> Not nec so . It was a coaching conference , the emphasis on how they can get better , those attending ( 300 or so coaches and teachers from 18 countries keen to learn ) choosing to be there and not at all disturbed by the prospect of improving themselves and considering a wider range of skills for their toolboxes . <p> On your other points , as we roll out the reports on Lund this week , I will let the words of three Olympic podium placers explain why , nice as the thought is , we can not ( and do not ) " just swim &amp; be thankful " ... life is pretty good for you in your circumstance , it seems . As you will read this week , that is far from always being the case for others . <p> And those who have had good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference ... we should listen ... stay tuned . <p> mini bus January 14 , 2014 <p> I hope one day this conference gets the publicity it needs &amp; deserves . Unfortuntaley this kind of thinking is too risky in Australia , the factory leaders talk of improvement but little changes year to year . We hope that our 1 or 2 swimming heroes change the public 's mind , while thousands of kids are being flogged 10 sessions a week to satisfying the bottom line , egos and the <h> Family mourning death 
 At The Edge Of Enhancement <p> Research has shown that " brain doping " has become a popular part of amateur sport . The work , important to note , includes " recreational competitors " , folk who are not necessarily affiliated to sports federations in a way that would make it obligatory to be a part of the anti-doping testing pool ( similar to masters swimmers in some cases ) . <p> Swimming was not a part of the study but the findings , which speak to attitudes , are of interest in the wider anti-doping debate . Researchers in Germany , whose findings have been publicised in the journal Plos One , found that 15 per cent of recreational triathletes admit to taking prescription medicines that increase attention , compared to 13 per cent of the same sample who confessed to taking steroids , human growth hormone and other performance-enhancing substances banned in elite sport . <p> Within a 15.1% sample that admitted to taking amphetamines , or medicines such as modafinil and methylphenidate , more men than women said that they took both brain-enhancers and physical enhancement products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " There seems to be a certain proportion of our society that is willing to take a bit more of a risk to gain an advantage , " <p> Prof Simon told the BBC 's environment Matt McGrath that the question of whether brain doping could be seen in a similar way to physical doping was as yet unanswered : " On the cognitive level , we do n't know enough about these substances . Is there is a hyper performance effect ? " <p> " What we know is that if you are a patient you are going to perform better than before , but if you are already a high-level performer we do n't know if there is an effect . That 's the big question . " <p> The study asked almost 3,000 triathletes competing in Germany in an effort to widen the discussion about the widespread use of brain enhancers among students and others . So called smart drugs that can improve concentration , memory , cognition and attention , are becoming ever more popular . <p> They include : <p> Modafinil : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people stay awake , be alert and concentrate for longer periods of time <p> Methylphenidate : ( Ritalin and Concerta brands , among others ) a psychostimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , the condition for which Michael Phelps was prescribed drugs for as a boy before he threw them in the trash and churned his energy into the water . <h> The Research and How to Define Doping <p> The authors of the research asked this : <p> Physical doping : Have you used substances which can only be prescribed by a doctor , are available in a pharmacy , or can be bought on the black market ( such as anabolic steroids , erythropoietin , stimulants , growth hormones ) to enhance your physical performance during the last 12 months ? <p> Cognitive doping : Have you used substances which can only be prescribed by a doctor , are available in a pharmacy , or can be bought on the black market ( such as caffeine tablets , stimulants , cocaine , methylphenidate , modafinil , beta-blockers ) to enhance your cognitive performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided they concluded that athletes are aware that physical doping is forbidden but that the use of cognitive substances is not associated with sanctions . Abuse was therefore more acceptable in the minds of those being asked , reflecting wider attitudes in society to such things .@@2232034 <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> 
 Caitlin Leverenz , left , and Dana Vollmer , of CAL and the USA <p> When reflecting , some years ago , on an Olympic campaign at which he ended up on the podium but some of his women teammates fell shy of potential , David Davies told me that the difference in approach between genders was important to understanding what might have gone wrong . He was not suggesting that he understood the issues just simply that he recognised that there were important differences to be understood and understood they must be if the point of the exercise was to ensure that all got the best out of themselves in the water on the biggest occasion of all . It is what they 'd worked for . <p> With a bemused smile on his face , he recalled arriving in the Olympic village , putting his bags down on his bed and settling fast on the notion of ' I 'm home , I feel fine , I know what I have to do " . He " could n't quite believe " what he heard stage left among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the comfort of beds , what was and was not in the bathroom , how long it took to get to the dining hall , what kind of food was there , was not there , what view could be had from different rooms , who might have a better room than someone else , the colour of the curtains and much else along a spectrum of stuff more fitting to a shopping trip or a holiday than an Olympic campaign . <p> The themes of goal-setting , process , purpose and focus on task at hand , as well as how best to create harmony on teams , whether all male , all female or all together with what is often a largely male staff on most teams , are ever with us . No-one dies if team dynamics are wrong in swimming but you can kiss goodbye to the best possible outcome , be that at Olympic , college or just about any other level you care to think about . <p> At London 2012 , the US women 's team celebrated a towering rate of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the athlete and the work done with the coach , we heard from many of the American women in London . It also came down , they said , to the leadership of head women 's coach Teri McKeever . <h> Females need healthy emotional expression <p> Caitlin Leverenz and Dana Vollmer <p> So read one of the headings on a two-day double act from the American Olympic podium placers , Vollmer the butterfly champion in world-record time , the bronze medallist in the medley in London . <p> Yes , it is about the difference between men and women . It is also about the difference between women and women . And about awareness that can be helpful to those who want the best out of their charges but may go about the task in a way that will leave coach and athlete shy of target . <p> " We can all bottle up emotions but sometimes that happens because of the responses we get when we do explain how we 're feeling , " said Vollmer . " I 've had so many coaches who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm nervous ' and they 've said cue military tone and brace yourself for a hearty slap on the arm or back ' do n't be nervous , forget about it and just swim ' . The reality is that its not going to happen like that . " We will look later at tips for handling nerves . For now , back to emotions . said : <p> " Expressing your emotion is a part of life . Sometimes , I just need a good cry and I need to get it out . It does n't mean to say I wo n't swim well . It is about allowing myself to express emotions . It is important to me , to who I am and how I perform . " <p> Important to how a whole team performs , too , sometimes . There is , added Leverenz , " a time and a place to express emotions " . She noted that when a college team of 20 to 25 women get together and a race goes badly , " that 's no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not an appropriate time and place to do that " . One of the first reactions she feels after a bad swim is anger but true angry person as much as the emotional wreck is not going to be the athlete who stands up and races well . <p> Managing such things must be done well before race day and has been part of the learning curve for Leverenz and Vollmer . In their two joint presentations , they spoke of team culture , creating safe environments and shared their views on honing women athletes in a way helpful not only to world-class performance : their eyes were always on much more than the medal and the clock . <p> Good health , physical and mental , a safe place , one that works for women in particular ways , a rounded life beyond racing days and much else pertinent to performance formed part of a constant focus on wellbeing as the foundation to any success , one critical to the process that may one day lead to prizes . The gold in all they had to say was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success also measured by and made possible through relationships and friendships built in what might have been a hopeless place but for best practice . <h> From Rocky Start To Respect <p> " I can honestly say I did n't like her , " said Vollmer to nervous laughter from the audience while standing in the lights next to a national and program teammate and friend . The Olympic ' fly champion 's delivery and stance hinted at the meekness in her nature ( I hate shouting , I do n't do confrontation ) , one that stands in stark contrast to the boldness in Leverenz , who , come her turn to recall their early days together at CAL Berkley , the University of California , said : " For my first two to three years at CAL , Dana and I were not friends at all . I 'm bold , aggressive , I swim 400IM , I call people out . " <p> " I swam 100 , I 'm sensitive to other people 's feelings , " Vollmer recalled . " To be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that it was a real growing experience as well ... to now know we are good friends is a great thing . She has a different way of swimming and competing and that works for her and I learned to respect that that was her way and that it worked for her . " <p> Vollmer admitted that come the big day , she wants attention , reassurance and presence of the coach on her way to the starting blocks . A tricky situation , perhaps , when a day at the Olympics brings the 400IM and ' fly rounds on the same day and McKeever is the USA women 's team head coach and personal mentor to both Vollmer and Leverenz . <p> It was actually easier than the surface suggests . " I almost pride myself on being independent , " said Leverenz through infectious smile . " She McKeever gives me a hug and says ' you 've done the work , you 're in great shape , go get ' em " . In contrast , Vollmer notes : <p> " I like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also want her to walk with me to the ready room because I get so nervous . " <p> added : " Everyone has their own situation ... we learned to accept that another way is not the wrong way . Its just different . " Whereas she wanted to be alone on the way to the blocks ( and should be approached with caution if she messes up in any way " I do get angry if people say ' good job ' when its not " ) , Vollmer is happy to tell anyone and does tell her coaches : " I like having someone there " . Which is why McKeever , left , went all the way to the call-room in difficult circumstances at Barcelona world titles last summer and offered last-minute words of comfort such as ' its ok if you 'd do n't get a medal , I love you anyway and we 'll work it out ' . <p> Impossible not to notice the emphasis on " I " when Vollmer and Leverenz speak . It is deliberate , encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team and what they call ' community ' when referring to the sporting sorority of upwards of 20 swimmers on coach McKeever 's CAL squad . Getting women to get on and work together in a large group without allowing perennial problems to take root is the work of a good gardener , effort not just for one season , one team , but repeated each passing season as freshers arrive and others move up the ranks and at some stage move on . <p> Those dynamics can only happen " through a lot of growth and individual work with coaches , " said Leverenz , with a nod to Vollmer . " We were forced to work together , we both had input in a lot of way ... we were with each other in the same environment and it took a lot of growth to get to a place where we can celebrate our differences . When it comes down to it , we 've ended up working really well together . " <h> Winning Culture <p> They spoke to the things that athletes and coaches needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> an ability to have hard conversations <p> an ability to be honest with yourself and others <p> the creation of a safe environment for conversation <p> the ability to deal with drama head on in that safe environment <p> recognise that every athlete is different and that coaching is a hard job <h> Community <p> and Vollmer told the audience that a college swim team , with all its diversity and difference in personalities and performance standards , is " a community of different people who come together for a common cause " . The purpose was to function effectively and give of their best in the water . <p> " Community is a better word than team , " said Leverenz . " A community is stronger when it draws on its weaknesses and strengths together and works in unison . Not everyone is going to be on the national team but that does n't mean they are not making valuable contribution to scoring and the team . " <p> That the thought extended to the USA Olympic squad . highlighted the role of Natalie Coughlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another McKeever charge at London 2012 : a relay heats swim then " an amazing role ... helping teammates to do better ... getting water , checking in before people raced ... team USA was good in London because we had people like Natalie willing to accept a different role beyond her own swimming " . <h> The Safe Room <p> Vollmer recalled women 's teams before the London Olympics as " a group of individuals " whereas in 2012 " it was the first national team I 'd been on in which every girl took the team concept on board ... yes , you there to swim on your own but that also means that you can behave as a team " . <p> She explained : " The team concept makes CAL and the USA so good at relays . I personally get so much energy from knowing why our combined success might mean so much for Caitlin or another teammate , knowing about her ups and downs along the way to the Olympics and what it means to her . <p> " Rather than focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into those desires in the others , about fighting for each other , leaning on each other . " <p> Both CAL charges reached the ultimate podium . Both had also felt the bitter sting of disappointment along the way , neither making the cut at the 2008 Olympic trials when both looked like they would make it . Vollmer was four years on from the who made it to Athens 2004 , where she won relay gold three years after starting her collection of international treasures at 13 with a towel signed for her by Susie O'Neill in 2001 . <p> The long journey transcends swimming for Vollmer , Leverenz and others lucky enough to pass through CAL . At the heart of good communication beyond the one-on-one sessions that coach holds with athlete , are the " safe environment " of team meetings . <p> All are encouraged to say how they feel in a way that speaks to that important ' I ' as opposed to " she did that and she said this " and allows people to express their concerns , emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will stay in the room . It is within that safe environment that the women can ask for advice , listen and tap into the experience of others should they chose to do so . <p> " As a group , it allows you to say ' I 'm sick ' , or ' I 'm sad ' , " said Leverenz as a way of explaining why she may not be wearing her brightest smile in training one day . " It does n't mean that I need someone to hold my hand , just that that 's how it is . As women , we want to help people and give guidance ... the power of listening is amazing . Just being with a person and telling them what you have to tell them and expect a nod is often enough . " <h> This Is A Woman 's World <p> Asked if they would mind if a man was there , both swimmers believed there were moments when that would not matter and noted that on national teams there are almost always men there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as those held at CAL was priceless . It was not simply about matters women may feel more comfortable talking about with other women , there were certain approaches and ways of doing things that women felt more comfortable with than men would and being comfortable with things was part of the exercise in cohesion and team spirit . <p> Vollmer explained how group activities that are " impactful on team cohesiveness " include moments when she will have just 30 seconds to express her feelings on a particular situation at hand that may involve two points of view . " During this I say what I have to say ; she then has her say in 30 seconds and we move on . " The aim is not to make everyone the same but to accept and even celebrate difference and make sure that what might have had a negative impact on the group is at worst neutralised . The deal is : that 's how we feel and this is where it ends . <p> McKeever employed a similar approach for the London 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more connected " to her teammates : " I knew what to say to teammates and what not to say to teammates . " As part of the exercise in building such understanding , McKeever had the swimmers write down on stickers how they perceived and what they knew of another member of the team . Positive message flowed backwards and forwards . <p> A male coach present , unnamed by the swimmers , rolled his eyes at some point . What was all this about . Later , after he had seen the impact of the exercise , the male coach was enthusiastic . Important to note that several leading male coaches I know have used similar exercises to build respect on squads , such things part of the story of the impact of the early years of Bill Sweetenham in Britain , for example . <p> Even so , there are places that men can go but may not quite get it . As Milt Nelms photo , with Leverenz and Vollmer in Lund , who works with the CAL group and McKeever , put it after witnessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hardly a word spoken : <p> " It was like the thing with a dog whistle you know they can all hear it but you ca n't hear a damn thing . " <p> Call it what you will : a deeper understanding , drama aversion ... the language of celebrating difference . <p> In the next part of the double act with Leverenz and Vollmer , who delivered two informative , entertaining and eloquent joint presentations in Lund , we pick up where we left off , with drama , drama , drama and consider how to handle stress and nerves , imagining outcomes , setting goals and why it is important for a coach to choose words carefully in a world full of impressionable young folk on the road to finding themselves . <h> Comments <p> Bill Bell January 17 , 2014 <p> Wonder if the world **27;949;TOOLONG Champ in 200 ever told her coach she felt nervous before mounting the blocks and similarly wonder if the GOAT ever told his coach HE had butterflies before a race ? <p> I think I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouting match Chevoor in the locker room @ Munich because he did n't want to swim one final individual race and the coach would have none of it . <p> And speaking of nerves , if Missy is say five for five heading into the 200 back finals @ NCAAs in a couple of months and in qualifying champ Elizabeth Pelton is tops a/ het record will she ( Franklin ) feel any pressure ? <h> You are here 
 Language and Clarity In The Rule Book <p> Contributor Clive Rushton attended the FINA World Swimming Officials Seminar ( FINA 's version of a Techie Convention ) in Singapore some years ago . After reading the latest advice to officials on breaststroke and butterfly rules , he dusts down his notes , written immediately after the convention , and finds that the principles of obscuration underlying his concerns " have obviously not been addressed " <p> A few years ago I ventured behind ' enemy lines ' and attended the FINA World Swimming Officials Seminar ( FINA 's version of a Techie Convention ) in Singapore . These are excerpts from my notes written immediately after the convention . Some of the comments may have been superseded by rule changes in the intervening years but the principles of obscuration underlying my concerns have obviously not been addressed . <p> From my notes : <p> There were over 200 delegates from 70+ countries . I found it a real eye-opening experience which should give rise for serious concern amongst the FINA hierarchy . At least seven things struck me : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An even wider spread lack of understanding of the rules . <p> An almost total lack of definition of terminology ( e.g. what is ' butterfly kick ' ? It is not defined anywhere in the rules ) <p> ' ' is very much akin to ' ' ; frequently confusing , ambiguous , contradictory and inaccurate . <p> A cavalier approach to random substitution of words in place of the actual wording of a rule ( e.g. substituting ' pull ' for ' stroke ' ; they are not exactly the same thing in conventional swimming terminology ) . <p> Assumptions that rules ' meant ' certain things when they contained no reference whatsoever to the ' certain things ' . <p> Disagreements amongst even the FINA ' top table ' delegates as to the interpretation of rules when asked a simple question regarding kicking into the wall during a butterfly finish , one FINA Technical Swimming Committee ( TSC ) member said it was a DQ , whereas another TSC member gave exactly the opposite decision and said it was OK . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given of a young swimmer turning over on the last stroke into the wall , finding themselves too close and merely touching then pushing onto the back for a legal push-off ; one TSC member was insistent that the turn had to be completed using a front somersault ( he kept saying ' tumble ' but that is not defined anywhere ) whereas nowhere in the rules does it actually say that . The Chair of the TSC later clarified that the hand touch and ' roll back ' for the push was , indeed , legal and there was no need to ' tumble ' but it is a major concern if the TSC members themselves are assuming inclusions in the Rules which are not actually there . <p> I think the problem lies with the longevity of the existence of the Rules ( 100+ years ! ) and the longevity of the involvement of the various TSC members . This is not meant as a personal attack because they are all honourable , intelligent , dedicated servants of the sport , rather it is an observation that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years at FINA Congress , the TSC members remember : <p> a ) the previous Rules and all their iterations and , <p> b ) the discussions surrounding the adaptations and changes , especially the parts where the intent of a Rule change was discussed . At the conclusion of the discussions when TSC had wordsmith 'd a satisfactory recommendation they would each assume they had clearly captured the intent and crafted it in a clear , unambiguous manner . It was obvious throughout the weekend that this is indeed not the case . <h> Back to the present day : <p> From your post on the breaststroke touch rule , it is obvious that it is still not the case . <p> Following the convention I wrote to the Chair and the Secretary of the FINA TSC outlining my observations and suggesting some ways of addressing the problem , as well as some succinct to my mind re-wording of quite a few of the existing rules , in an attempt to simplify and clarify for the benefit of both competitors and officials . <p> The response ? Zip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Olympic Coach Clive Rushton , currently de-stressing in Bali and completing a Master 's degree in Leading Innovation and Change . <p> Author of ' : Understanding the Effects of Biomechanics on Physiology . ' <h> Related Articles <h> Comments <p> mister clive January 17 , 2014 <p> Just read over some more extended notes on the Singapore Seminar . Craig 's original article concerned the hand touch in breaststroke and the clarification , interpretation and adjudication regarding adjacent or overlapping hands . This was my suggestion way back then : SW 7.7 At the end of each lap both hands must touch the pool end wall simultaneously . It 's not rocket science , is it ? <p> Lawrie Cox January 22 , 2014 <p> As an official who attended the same meeting i asked a similar question regarding totally submerged at the backstroke finish . To put in context an inspector of turn is looking at the touch not the feet so a competitor say around 6 foot when touching the wall you can not see the whole body . Yet the latest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ridiculous as showing pictures of ' separated ' hands overlapping . <p> The pair met

The image spoke of serenity and symbiosis , not only between swimmers but with the element that lends them that status . It was taken by the third swimmer present , Shane Gould .

January 21 , 2014 <p> Again somewhere in the Pacific I stayed seated &amp; silent when the MC announced Allison as a silver medallist . ( I wanted to get up &amp; say hell no she is the true gold medallist ! ) . <p> I spoke to Allison later saying the girls from the DdR &amp; PRC had no say in it but her case was even worse because it was an individual 's decision . I relayed the fact that DeBruin was now a barrister &amp; how bizarre that was . I also acknowledged the extra painful stab having your president swoon over DeBruin &amp; publicly humiliate Janet Evans particularly . &amp; by extension herself . ( ok I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . How could she or Janet go against her president who was beloved by all . The answer is they just had to shut up &amp; bear it . Thus I understand her returning to that training situation because she was not allowed to question . Any actions after that are understandable . <p> Just prior to this meeting Allison had swum a fine mid 55 sec 100 freestyle . I think her going back into the pool &amp; testing herself again on her own terms did much to make Allison the non bitter gracious person I remember . <p> But really I think she was maybe the best 200 imer till the latest batch .

 Tales From Swimming History <p> From the archive ( top left clockwise ) : Ragnhild ( also inset ) lifts weights off the bottom of the pool on her way to swimming greatness ; Atie Voorbij , Sybil Bauer and the stone that marks her grave ; and Satoko Tanaka Images : from youtube video archive and courtesy of ISHOF <p> Stories sorrowful and strange form a part of the February tale of swimming history . It was the month in which world records were established by four women whose careers were either brought to an untimely end or blighted by events and circumstances beyond their control . <p> Today we consider the careers of Sybil Bauer ( USA ) , Ragnhild ( DEN ) , Atie Voorbij ( NED ) and Satoko Tanaka ( JPN ) , four women who set the pace in the pool but whose careers ended before they realised their full potential as candidates for entry into the pantheon , not only as pathfinders but greats . <h> Sybil Bauer ( 1903-1927 ) <p> In 1922 Sybil Bauer ( USA ) swam the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done at the time . To be fair , the men were not focussing on the vent at the time and there was no such race at the Games in Paris in 1924 . In France , Bauer , the first woman to set records using an alternate-arm action instead of a double-arm action on backstroke , won the title in , down on her own world record . <p> Half-way to what would have been her next Games and a record holder still , Bauer was diagnosed with cancer . At the age of 23 in 1927 , the Olympic champion passed away . The world record of that she set over 220y backstroke in Miami on february 9 , 1924 was still on the books and remains a part of her legacy . <p> At her funeral , Ed Sullivan , her fianc ? , joined six world-class swimmers who served as pall bearers : Olympic champions Johnny Weissmuller and Bob Skelton , as well as Hugo Miller , Weston Kimball , Ralph Breyer and Dick Howell . <p> In an obituary for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained with coach Bill Bachrach , it was written of Bauer : <p> " Sybil 's early passing is saddening beyond human expression ; but had she lived a hundred years , she could hardly have added anything important to her glorious athletic career , nor strengthened her hold upon the hearts of all who knew her . She was champion of women swimmers , the greatest of all in her field , and as such she will always be remembered . " <p> In her time , Bauer won every backstroke race she entered at domestic and international level , swimming into uncharted waters from 100 yards to 440 yards . Counting all distance , in yards and metres , she set 23 world records , including two in the and two in the . Bauer also excelled in basketball and field hockey while at Northwestern University and was president of the Women 's Athletic Association and a member of the student council in her senior year at the time of her death . <h> Ragnhild ( 1920 2011 ) <p> One swimming career that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands above all others in the aquatics history file labelled " what might have been " : Ragnhild ( DEN ) was the greatest swimming record breaker never to have been crowned Olympic champion . <p> At 15 , won a surprise silver over freestyle at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin , just behind Dutch distance ace Rie Mastenbroek . Ironically dubbed " Denmark 's Golden Torpedo " , set 42 individual freestyle world records , including yard swims from 100 yards to 1 mile , and three on backstroke between 1936 and 1942 . Those efforts included a global standard over freestyle ( ) that would survive 20 years from 1938 until the dawn of Dawn Fraser in 1956 . broke the record eight times from to ( 1937-1940 ) , her last mark broken only 16 years later by Lorraine Crapp , Australia teammate that beat Fraser for the 1956 Olympic title . <p> The date of that 5mins swim , September 15 , coincided with the dates of what would have been a 1940 Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world marks made her the first woman to race inside 11mins , while the last of three records over made her the first woman inside 21mins . <p> Beyond the speed of her best days , a mark of 's athletic prowess was her longevity : ten years after her last world record and seven years after retiring in 1945 , she made a comeback and managed to finish fifth over freestyle , just behind the champion Valeria Gyenge ( HUN ) at the 1952 Olympic Games . was 32 . <p> Her finest competitive tally was a haul ( 100 , 400 and 4x100m freestyle ) at the 1938 European Championships in London : her victory by in over set a championship record that would survive three challenges before being broken in 1958 , while her championship record in , would survive two assault before being broken in 1954 .

Satoko Tanaka , born in 1942 , lived in another time .

I am too young to have ever seen them swim but my grandparents told me stories of them . <p> It 's unfortunate that in Ragnhild 's case her wartime associations overshadowed many of her achievements but she was voted the sportsperson of the century in Denmark a few years ago so she has been belatedly rehabilitated . <p> As a person from the Danish island of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbours in Zealand and Jutland , it 's also a source of pride that Ragnhild was born in Nyborg , although she grew up and learned to swim in Helsing ? r .

So sad for those that missed out on competing . <p> Not necessarily so .

What will they be thinking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2001 &amp; they do n't see a boycott of Salt Lake City in 2002 ? <p> It is not enough to say oh its politics . Boycotts ca n't be done without the backing of the population eg GB &amp; Australia in 1980 who went against the politician 's wishes . <p> In the age of historical apologies for that has gone before by people totally not even there , maybe Jacco will give us an apology . ( its a joke ) . <p> Not necessarily so . February 6 , 2014 <p> Found it . During the bloody battle for Indonesian independence ( with the Dutch every bit as brutal as the soviets in Hungary ) Australia sided with the Indonesians including a mass waterside workers boycott . <p> It was simple payback . <p> There is always areal reason behind the ' politics ' . <p> Craig Lord February 6 , 2014 <p> Not Nec so , I see your point but disagree that no one remembers or that history will only recall the winners and those who were there .... impossible for swimming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to ignore the likes of Mary T Meagher and Tracy Caulkins ... missed Moscow will always be a line not only in their history but in the history of those who did go to Moscow and win medals .

It matters little to me if others choose to look no deeper than the surface . That 's not why I 'm here .

Australia did side with Indonesia when the Netherlands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the help of the Brits . <p> The europeans sit high on their horses ( is that the right wording of the phrase ? ) whenever it suit them . Not even a discussion about boycotting 2002 Salt Lake after US invasion of Afghanistan , and yet there were threatening to boycott 2014 just because Russia had internal politics which did not suit the taste of the western world . <p> Hypocrites . <p> February 8 , 2014 <p> Even if the dutch ladies had been present in Melbourne they would have been thrashed and left in the dust by Fraser , , et al . <p> Craig Lord February 9 , 2014 <p> : generalisation of peoples and nations falls well shy of the truth and is best avoided , in my opinion .

 Out Of Miami Pro Venture ; Cites Trust <p> The new pro-group of international swimmers set up by Miami coaches Aaron Ciarla and Andy De Angulo last month has suffered its first set back : South African sprinter Roland Schoeman has pulled out of the venture . <p> A tweet from the sprinter who includes crowns Olympic and world in his treasury , told media and his fans today : <p> " Regret I must formally withdraw my name as candidate of pro group . Unfortunately I can not work with someone I can not trust . " <p> The sprinter is yet to elaborate . Ciarlo and De Angulo spearhead the Miami Swimming group . The team is coached by both men in shifts , Ciarla usually taking morning sessions at a time when he is focussing on work beyond the world of swimming . Ciarla has coached as an assistant with Auburn and Miami . <p> At the time of the launch of the new group , Schoeman was named alongside Americans Lara Jackson and Zach McGinnis , Elvis Burrows of the Bahamas and Venezuelan Roberto Gomez . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pot calling the kettle black . Schoeman has had more coaches in the last 8 years than I can remember . This guy is notorious for blaming other people when swimming slow and taking ALL the credit when having a good swim . Good luck to the new coach . <p> Steven February 17 , 2014 <p> Rick unfortunately your statement lacks any form of real insight . From my understanding Roland had an incredibly successful year under Aaron . I 've read the articles and he credits Aaron with his success last year at world champs and at the World Cup circuit . Your statement says very little if anything actually . Are you aware of what happened ? If you know why these two have parted ways ? If so please share with us so we can all know . <p> Markee February 17 , 2014 <p> What ever happened should have been kept between Roland and Aaron . Roland has a big mouth and feels it necessary to vent his frustration publicly every time he feels slighted . <p> I have no personal knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But I will note for the record that Sr. Schoeman " ai n't getting any younger " and turns 35 in a few moons old for a competitive swimmer ( unless your name is Dara Torres ! ) His glory days have long since passed and if he thinks he 's gon na beat the Aussies and/or Limeys and/or Kiwis @ Glasgow this summer he 's living in a world of delusion and fantasy ! <p> Hang ' em up , Roland . <p> You 've had a great career , won Olympic-World Games golds , won NCAA titles and set NCAA records , now gracefully step aside and let the younger generation get its chance . <p> Steven February 18 , 2014 <p> surely that decision should be his and his alone ! ! He swam a PR in Barcelona in the 50free , had a succesful world swimming cup circuit . Certainly seems like he continues to perform at his best . Let him make the decision when he is good and ready Bill . Each has their own motivations . Rather a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is due as opposed to heaping criticism . <p> Patrick February 18 , 2014 <p> Funny how the haters crawl out of the woodwork and use this to attack the man . Schoeman has been very vocal about the fact that Ciarla was a good fit for him as coach . And certainly he has delivered and remains a remarkable classic . Ciarla must have screwed it up real bad for Schoeman to pull out at this stage . We all know Ciarla already has a black cloud or so career wise . Just mosey around and sniff at sudden departures from past coaching positions . Truth is whatever happened it broke trust . You got ta trust your coach to act right by you . If he or she does n't then youve got to man up and say " Im outta here " . Schoeman had the guts and did . End of story . It couldnt have been easy specially at this stage . <p> Swimming Mom February 18 , 2014 <p> @Patrick . You 're quite correct . But I still think celebrities Tweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they have parted ways and nobody would question it or scrutinize him . <p> Don February 18 , 2014 <p> Schoeman has no class . He 's been complaining about xyz since he started swimming on the world stage 100 years ago ( ok maybe closer to 20 ) . <p> Coaches and swimmers find it difficult to be around him because he is ultra critical and negative . Roland had great success with his previous coach ( s ) but always found an excuse to throw them under the bus despite good performances . <p> Ciarla is a good guy and we do n't know the details of what happened . The funniest part about this whole thing is that Roland has never actually swam with Ciarla . sent him some workouts on occasion and Roland would cut and paste as he saw fit . <p> Time for Schoeman to move on and call it a career . <p> PSC Parent February 19 , 2014 <p> @Don Gezin <p> Roland spent over a week last year training with Aaron in Miami at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron resigned from UM . PSC Coach Takahisa Ide worked with Roland everyday while doing Coach Aaron 's workouts . <p> If according to you Aaron sent " some workouts on occasion " my question is . Were you in contact with them daily ? Did you watch Roland 's workouts daily ? Ask Coach Taco or Roland himself what the involvement and workouts were like . You do n't strike me as someone that knows any of the people you claim so much about . <p> As a parent at Phoenix Swim club I have seen Roland daily interact with my children and the other swimmers at PSC . He has even gone as far as to assist coach Garrett for some of the senior groups workouts . <p> Unfortunately Don you seem to be the ultra critical and negative person here . Sad that you see fit to troll the internet and give borderline slanderous testament to something you clearly know nothing about . <p> Go PSC <p> Sim February 19 , 2014 <p> Over the course of the past year or two , swimming with a coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes as ' training ' with the coach . Is sending workouts via Internet and having another coach give the practice considered coaching even in the most basic sense ? To me , a coach needs to be present on deck for the majority of the practices . <p> Sounds like Roland was doing style workouts on his own ( which I applaud him for ) and got some input from others along the way . I 'm not sure there is much out there that is new to him and Roland knows best what he needs . <p> As far as Roland 's public comment goes , he should have kept this private as he has a tendency to be very outspoken on his ' issues . ' <p> February 20 , 2014 <p> Rick .... I do n't recall Roland swimming ' slow ' over the past 15 years . And Bill Bell what a load of dribble . If anyone wants to be swimming at age 35 whether they are a winger or not that is their decision and has nothing to do with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the planet and only Morozov has the all round ability over the strokes that he has . Roland swam very well last year and if you think any Kiwis are going to beat him in Glasgow then you must think he is going to swim a because that ai n't  happening over 50 ...... <p> BUENOS AIRES ,

Best , C <p> Mark March 2 , 2014 <p> Granted ( Not meant as a pun ) .

 Baumann Set The Last Of His Six World Records <p> Alex Baumann , one of the greats of medley swimming Photo compilation : depicted on a Canadian bus ; in a poster ; in action , the Prague astronomical clock ; and with coach <p> On a walk through Prague and past the city 's medieval astronomical clock that dates back to 1410 and is now the oldest of its kind still working , I was reminded of Alex Baumann , the Canadian medley ace born in the Czech capital , and the passing of time . <p> Today marks the 28th anniversary of the last world record set by one of the all-time greats of medley swimming and the passing of Dr Jeno Tihanyi , a fitting moment to recall a soaring partnership in swimming . In Montreal this day in 1986 , Baumann , reigning double Olympic champion and on course to seeing the future that summer as a young Hungarian called Tamas Darnyi claimed maiden world medley titles ahead of him , clocked 2:01.42 in the medley . That equalled his own world mark and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Baumann was a pathfinder . Born in Prague on born April 21 , 1964 , he became a Canadian after his parents fled communist Czechoslovakia in 1968 . At 9 , he started to swim under the guidance of Dr Tihanyi , the Hungarian coach who helped to turn Baumann into a man capable of claiming those six world medley records , four over and two over , and the first man to win both the Olympic 200 and medley titles , at Los Angeles in 1984 . Baumann also won five Commonwealth titles . When Tihanyi died on this day in 2007 , Baumann said : <p> " That I 'm the person I am today is largely responsible to him , particularly in terms of the discipline required to achieve and to focus on excellence and the setting of goals . All the workouts were meticulously planned . " <p> That planning led to Baumann becoming the first Canadian to win two Olympic titles at one Games . A native of Hungary , Tihanyi had a PhD in early childhood development , skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1984 Games when Baumann 's father died . At 14 , Baumann won two silver medal at winter nationals and repeated the success at summer nationals the same year but boycott locked him out of Moscow 1980 . <p> Between 1981 and the end of his retirement announcement in January 1988 , Baumann won 22 consecutive national medley crowns but those were the tip of an iceberg of talent and versatility : Baumann raced , freestyle ( sprint and distance ) , backstroke , breaststroke and butterfly , winning 34 national medals across all disciplines and holding 32 Canadian records in sprint and distance freestyle and medley . <p> The " we " in almost all quotes from the archive of Alex Baumann 's career refers to the brain behind one of the most versatile performers in the sport 's history : Dr Tihanyi , who passed away in 2007 . <p> Their 's was a partnership in which no stone was left unturned , one in which the aim was " never a wasted stroke " . The discipline was immense , the care taken inspiring . <p> Baumann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw each stroke in training as a rehearsal for getting the very best out of his charge come the big occasion . <p> A full-time professor at Laurentian University on top of holding down full-time coaching duties , Tihanyi demanded more than most of his swimmers but led by example , setting himself pioneering standards . " He was so detailed , " said Baumann . " All the workouts were meticulously planned . " <p> Tihanyi 's coaching achievements included 16 world records , being named Canadian swim coach of the year four times and induction to the Canadian Hall of Fame . <p> The late Nick Thierry , founder of Swim Canada and and a former coach , said back in 2007 that Baumann and Tihanyi formed " the greatest athlete/coach relationship that I 've known . <p> " He ( Tihanyi ) was a hard-driving , take-no-prisoners kind of a guy . Baumann was also a driven guy who believed in his coach and who had enormous talent . Put them together and it was just fireworks . " <p> began to teach the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two medley gold medals in world-record times at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics . <h> The 1984 Olympic 400IM final : <p> A native of Hungary , Tihanyi had a PhD in early childhood development , skills that proved valuable beyond the pool the year before the 1984 Olympic Games when Baumann 's father died . <p> " He was a great friend , and certainly after my father passed away in 1983 , he became like a second father to me , " Baumann told Canadian reporters in 2007 . <p> empathised , perhaps , with Baumann 's past , the swimmer 's family having fled communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1968 . Baumann 's father also worked as a professor at Laurentian University in Sudbury , 350 miles north of Toronto . Alex Baumann studied there , majoring in political science . <p> Archive footage showing on the Sudbury pool deck and in the gym with Baumann and other squad members hints at the intensity of work and the high level of discipline . As the coach gathers his team around a blackboard to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's physiology , there is a sense of study about proceedings . There is room for play too , however . At one point , the coach turns to the camera and says of Baumann : <p> " He 's a regular clown . He likes to pull stunts . I sometimes wonder how he dreams these things ( up ) . It 's early in morning here and he 's screaming as Tarzan used to do to break the monotony of it all . That 's not a weakness , it 's a diversion . " <p> Baumann needed diversion at that time in life : his brother committed suicide in 1981 and his father died a little over a year later . During a stint at Indiana in the US , the swimmer sustained a serious shoulder injury . Unable to continue training , he returned home Sudbury . was waiting with a special strenthening programme for the swimmer that he had designed to build up the lose muscle around the joints and minimise the pain in the long-term . <p> At the time , the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build life skills that would stand him in good stead " for the Olympics , or wherever , anything in life " . <p> believed in steady , constant and consistent development of his charges and understood the need for a stable world beyond the pool if success was to be forthcoming in it . <p> At age 13 , Baumann reached his first senior national final in Canada , finishing sixth over medley . At 14 , he won two silver medals at winter nationals and repeated the success at summer nationals the same year . It was 1979 , and Canada , having hosted the 1976 Olympic Games , was about to be locked out of the 1980 party by political boycott . <p> Between 1981 and the end of his retirement announcement in January 1988 , Baumann won 22 consecutive national medley crowns but those were the tip of an iceberg of talent and versatility : at a time when the world knew him for medley , Baumann raced , freestyle ( sprint and distance ) , backstroke , breaststroke and butterfly , winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records in sprint and distance freestyle and medley . He was a freestyler , a 3:56 and 15:39 man , a 2:19 breaststroker , a 2:02 flyer . <p> Above and beyond all of that was Baumann 's soaring medley success in global waters . Dr. Tihanyi 's induction into the Canadian Olympic Committee Hall of Fame came in April 2004 . The following is part of the nomination paper for Jeno Tihanyi right with Bauman , image : NT archive : <p> " Dr. Jeno Tihanyi 's coaching career in Canadian swimming spans a remarkable 44 years . Well known for his popular coaching philosophy not to push performance , but rather push improvement , Dr. Tihanyi has been part of the successful development of numerous elite swimmers in Canada . <p> " Born in Hungary in 1936 , Dr. Tihanyi 's lifelong interests in child development and physiology introduced him to coaching in swimming . He is a level three certified swim coach with a doctorate from the University of Alberta . <p> " Dr. Tihanyi began his coaching career with the Vancouver Amateur Swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Head Coach . By 1979 Dr. Tihanyi was coaching for Canada at international events including Tour teams , Pan Pacific Championships , and the Commonwealth Games . <p> " The relationship Dr. Tihanyi forged in the early 1970 's with a then nine-year-old Alex Baumann , however , proved to be an exceptional and winning combination . Baumann went on to become one of Canada 's greatest swimmers , winning two Olympic gold medals in Los Angeles in 1984 . <p> " Dr. Tihanyi 's coaching achievements include 16 world swimming records . He has earned numerous coaching accolades including being named Canadian Swim Coach of the Year four times and 12 provincial and national Awards of Excellence . Dr. Tihanyi 's work at Laurentian University earned him recognition as OUA Coach of the Year in 1990 , and OWIAA Coach of the Year in 1994 .

A fine return at 45 : a world record of 2:12.01 in the medley in the 45-49 age group category . <p> Not long after , he had his prostate removed after a blood test revealed that he was suffering from cancer . The early diagnosis helped catch the cancer early . Baumann wanted his experience to help others . " One of the reasons I wanted to go public is they picked it up with a PSA test , " he explained at the time . <p> " It was a PSA test that led me to the biopsy stage and ultimately detecting that I had cancer . It was the PSA test that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 , Baumann , quit his top job in Canadian sport to take up a role as CEO for High Performance Sport New Zealand from January 2012 . In response to a flood of thank you notes and good wishes from Canadians , the former medley ace told the Toronto Sun : " In a sense , it 's been very nice . No one is saying , ' Thank God we got rid of that ' . " <p> Baumann is married to Tracey Taggart , an Australian swimmer he met during the Brisbane 1982 Commonwealth Games , and the couple have two children , Tabitha and Ashton , both swimmers . In 2012 , Baumann received the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal . <p> When Baumann received the IMPACT award at the 2011 Big Splash awards gala of Swim Canada in Toronto , the then CEO of the federation Pierre Lafontaine said : <p> " Alex Baumann is a true Canadian hero .

 Choice Of Start Block Style At Euro Trials <p> In readiness for choice at the European Championships in Berlin come August , Russian swimmers will be allowed to chose whether to include a launching wedge designed to prevent slipping on their blocks or not at nationals and trials in Moscow in May when a domestic version of the new equipment is put to the test . <p> Russians got to test prototype platforms at nationals a year ago before a vote was taken at FINA Congress last summer in favour of allowing removable wedges to be used at the back of starting platforms at competitions run by the international federation . The wedges include a strip of non-slip material and allow better traction , some swimmers say . The additional feature to additional blocks , which bring a touch of track and field to swimming starts , is removable . <p> So far , Omega and Myrtha Pools have led the way in the market but Russia has developed its own version , made by a St. Petersburg company , that meets FINA standard , according to Vladimir Salnikov , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold in 1980 and 1988 , the Moscow victory marked by the first swim over 30 laps at the boycotted Games that year . <p> International politics heavy in the air once more in 2014 , Russian swimmers are a year away from trials that will select a national team for a home FINA World Championships in Kazan , to be staged in July 2015 . <p> Salnikov , meanwhile , has spoken in favour of the use of the flexible block , saying that the " device has several advantages it affords a stable position on the platform , delivers force at the push of the foot and allows the swimmer jump more powerfully , thus improving water-entry trajectory " He added : <p> " As a result the output speed of the athlete will be a few tenths of meters per second more .

Australia , meanwhile , will be looking to select a slightly larger shoal for a battle in Glasgow this July , the significance of which Verhaeren is fast coming to terms with . <p> In an interview with SwimVortex , the Dutchman smiled broadly when asked about the moment Aussie swimmers get to remind Old England and the land of Monty Python @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanky pinching convicts to a golden state fit to makes others green with envy ( for those feeling the urge to reach for a club , stay calm and listen to Waltzing Matilda while thinking of the southern stars , Kylie Minogue , The Ashes or even Russell Crowe as The Gladiator ) . <p> " Coming from a non-Commonwealth country , until I arrived in Australia I did n't understand anything about the Commonwealth Games , " Verhaeren acknowledges . " But in this culture it is an important meet . I 've also come to see it as a great meet full of potential that puts swimming into the public perception . The organisation of a multi-sports event makes the Commonwealth Games the closest thing to the feeling of an Olympic Games . " <p> The rider is critical : " For me , they Olympics and Commonwealth are not the same but to be able to have a meet like that and practice strategies and behaviour and how you deal with the sort of village atmosphere you get at the Olympics is a great opportunity for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enables wider exposure to developers on the up , comparable to the system in use in Europe ( four per nation with two allowed through to finals at the continental championships ) since it was suggested by an Aussie abroad , Bill Sweetenham . <p> The latter has never been shy to note the importance , nature and ownership of leadership if success is what you want in the furnace of world-class competition . How then does Verhaeren define leadership ? He tells SwimVortex : <p> " A good leader is a good listener , That 's first . The definition of leadership for me would be ' listening , inspiring , informing ' , those are the most important things I have to do here . " <p> He notes the tricky task of getting some of the work done when compared to the ease of access to programs back home : " When I wanted to visit the training centres in The Netherlands I could do it all in a day if I needed to . Here I am in Canberra , Adelaide , Melbourne , Sydney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds with a smile : <p> " It feels like being the head coach of the whole of Europe travel wise . There 's a lot of variety in programs . My first job is to get to know the culture not to change it because this is a sporting nation that knows sport and then to inspire them with new and fresh ideas . " <p> Early days yet but had he found folk open to listening and learning back ? " Very much , even better that I expected , " he replies . " They are even waiting for that information to arrive , totally open to new ideas and influences . That does n't mean they will change overnight and they do n't have to but they are very keen to know ideas from coaches from other countries and not just my ideas . " <p> Trials this coming week kill three birds with one stone : national titles are up for grabs , plus selection to Glasgow 2014 and a home Pan Pacific Championships on the Gold Coast in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of Europe battle for honours at the continent 's summer showcase in Berlin . <p> Having arrived in Australia in January in time for a fine show at the Aquatic Super Series in Perth followed by a couple of months on the road taking in programs split by a geography as vast as Europe , Verhaeren 's role in Brisbane will be one of keen observation . How are the Australians handling the process , who 's getting it right , who 's not and what can be done to make things better ? <p> Verhaeren will take a back seat at trials , the moment all about what the swimmers and their home coaches have to bring in pursuit of their goals . And whatever those may be for each individual , the common goal is clear to the head coach : <p> " There will be no holding back this year . There are two major meets and both are as important as the other for the swimmers and the coaches ... in the process , you have to travel , handle jet lag , deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to some , there is pressure and there is the urge to perform and everything that goes along with that . The outcome is the process : if they are capable of handling this process well , preparing for it and racing like they want to when it counts then that will be a good step to the next World Championships and Olympics . " He adds : <p> " The Commonwealth Games and Pan Pacs are the most important events this year and we want to maximise performance there . There will be no holding back . " <h> The Goal : Why World No 1 ? <p> In one of Verhaeren 's first interviews Down Under , he was clear that Australia 's mission is to be World No 1 swim nation . The SwimVortex.com Swim League of Nations count for 2013 ( to be published with long-term trends in the near future ) leaves no doubt that on medals , on places in top 16 at major international championships , on rankings and records , the United States is king and queen of the pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slot , its gold-medal count and absence from the podium challenge in a number of events obvious rooms for improvement in terms of the measures by which one might assess what it means to be World No 1 . <h> How does Verhaeren measure it ? <p> Comparing the cultures and the systems and structures in place in the US and Australia , schools upwards , " it is of course a big , big challenge to be world No1 but if you 're supposed to be No 2 , then the only goal is to be No1 ? . So , in short , winning and winning more than anyone else is what makes you World No 1 ? <p> " I read that 's what sport is about , " he replies through a grin , before explaining : <p> " The outcome ... is not to have your eye on the medals . There are short and long-term goals . In the short-term we have to maximise the performances of the athletes we have right now ... like Cate , James , Christian world champions Campbell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , make sure they have the full benefits of the system and that they are receiving all the best possible support . <p> " These are people who already have great coaches in Simon Cusack , Brant Best , Michael Bohl , Denis Cotterell and others . Australia already has a big potential of swimmers who can make a final at World and Olympic level and possibly medal . <p> One of the keys to world-class coaching is to take care of the people you have . It would not be good in our stride to getting to world No 1 to forget about the potential and possible medal winners and dreams and hopes of World champions . " <p> Behind those who have already known the highest honours , Australia has obvious potential in the likes of Mack Horton , Jordan Harrison , Madeline Groves photo : Swimming Australia , Taylor McKeown , Emma McKeon and a fair few others and while Verhaeren is happy to acknowledge those he is keen to avoid singling any out , careful not steal limelight or cast shadow . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under , Verhaeren notes : " If you see them in competition , at events like the BHP Super Series , you know that they are capable of stepping up . I was impressed with the way many handled themselves : that 's what we 're looking for . It is not only about feel for water and swimming fast but about what you have in your mind and how you deal with things . What I 've seen makes me excited for the future of the country in swimming . " <p> He adds : <p> " I am a firm believer in the process of what we do every day , the habits we form . I never speak about outcomes , medals , gold , silver , bronze , finals , PBs . Ownership of those things and the success that comes with it is for the athlete and the athlete only . The one who comes closest to that is their personal coach and the people who support the swimmer on a daily basis . I would not want to take away ownership from the athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> In other words , he would not do what a fair few blazers , funders and others can be found doing in programs the world over . Verhaeren further rationalises his thought with this : " If three or four swimmers do really well , set records , win medals , it would be devastating to transform that into a medal tally a story of that would not be understood , that would take away from those who did achieve . " Again , look around the world at programs far and wide and that is precisely what you see in the mix . <p> The focus , he emphasises , is simple enough , his message one that you can find in the archive of cuts from US coaches galore , Bob Bowman , Gregg Troy , Eddie Reese , Denis Pursley , as well as Australians Don Talbot , Bill Sweetenham and in one guise or another right back through time to another time , of the likes of Americans Don Gambril , Doc Counsilman Forbes Carlile . <p> Says Verhaeren : " Maximising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hygiene ... we have to be the smartest and best at everything you have an influence over . <p> " The makers of success are those who practice these things every day : the athletes and the coaches . My job is to provide the environment in which that can happen : it would be a nightmare if the moment it success needs to happen , for me to be in focus and not the swimmer-coach unit claiming their success . We are all , in the end , dependent on their level of commitment , their work . " <p> Environment is the key word , letting those charged with environment handle it while those in blazers do all they can to make sure what is required to make it happen is actually delivered ( so the outcome can match the expectation of public and purse where such things are closely linked to politics , power and sporting ambition ) . <p> Verhaeren is concerned with providing the best environment for the likes of Magnussen and Best to work in and reach for full potential . Magnussen , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Magnussen 's at 47.10 , the world record from a time of shiny suits 46.91 , by Cesar Cielo , of Brazil . It would be monumental to take that down . But best times at trials even as phenomenal as that one would be are not where it is at , simply a bonus along the way . <p> Which takes us back to measures and medal counts . " Yes , " Verhaeren said emphatically , " to be the best you have to be that on the medal tally , the count . " However he added : <p> " I believe that an elite swimmer does n't care about the medal tally : an elite swimmer is dreaming about Olympic success or success at whatever meet it is , dreaming of becoming the best they can be , the best swimmer in the world and it is their right to do so and our duty to carry them along to that level and support it . <p> " But as a country we are looking at having more depth in all events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need the talent to take up those events , we need more strength there . " <p> As such , the " more long-term , thinking to 2020 and 2024 is to create a system in which more swimmers chose those longer events and the 200 ' fly and so on than they do now . Those two things , short and long-thinking , are two different parts of the plan . " He paused and added : <p> " Whether you achieve that in the end or not , the dream goal is for Rio , but especially for 2020 and definitely for 2024 , to have finalists in every Olympic final . That means we have to work on more depth in the team while maximising the performances of those who can win medals . " Australia is not far off : 5 events shy of a full house in 2008 and 8 events shy in 2012 . The point of a full house is what it affords in terms of podium potential . <p> Turning from virtual to real World No1 and the challenge of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Verhaeren said : " If you want to become an American champion or qualify for a US team you have to become the equivalent of a European champion . The natural base level of achievement on the US team is higher but at the same time as saying that we have to admit that coaches and swimmers there do a very good job at peak performing at the very big event . " <p> The figures at major meets going back almost as far as records go back prove the case , while in the last 20 years as the numbers of potential podium placing nations have grown the US has often celebrated step-up rates from trials to main event of 65 to , while many a rival is left lamenting levels of around . <p> " At the AIS Australian Institute of Sport , there is an enormous amount of data . You can see that often 80 to of a US team steps up at a big meet , while only of Australians and swimmers from various other countries step up . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vs AUS and they have the advantage of numbers but we do n't want to make any excuse in the numbers . We have all the population we need to create that level of swimmer . " <h> Playing to Australian Strengths <p> Australia has a long swimming history , it has skilled coaches , great facilities , a fine flow of talent . It punches above its weight but has the potential to do that more effectively than it has been doing of late , its new head coach believes . <p> " The big difference when you look at Australia and similar sized populations ( AUS : ; NED , in other countries is the flow of talent from learn-to-swim and school swimming to performance sport . That flow is a lot higher than we are used to or that I am used to in The Netherlands , for example . <p> " In The Netherlands , children go to learn to swim , or go to learn not to drown , then at the age of 6 or 7 they stop swimming . Here it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at least 12 or 13 because of things like school swim carnivals and the beach lifestyle that goes with it in leisure time . Out of that system a lot more talent comes to the pool and is available to the sport . " <p> He reached for the obvious opposite for comparison : <p> " Look at the Winter Olympic Games : The Netherlands out of 30 medals available won 21 in speed skating because speed skating is in the DNA of the country : its in the culture . It is easier to find a speed skate track in The Netherlands than it is in Australia ... in fact , I think there are none here . " <p> Switching the emphasis from ice to water once more , Verhaeren noted : " Its the same on the Gold Coast where we have our house now : If I drive around in a circle of the house I can find as many pools as there are in the whole of The Netherlands . <p> " It is not only about numbers but the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Every college , just about , has a pool near where we are and the facilities and the sports culture is a bit bigger than we are used to in The Netherlands . " <p> Even so , look back to that soaring moment for Aussie swimming at a home Games in Sydney 2000 and we find Verhaeren in the headlines with Pieter Van Den Hoogenband , Inge de Bruijn , their five gold medals and a slew of world records . Similar pattern at London 2012 with Ranomi Kromowidjojo photo : CAL : small numbers , big impact . Says Verhaeren : <p> " If we have just 1 or 2 talents who could win a medal , we were good at maximising that performance . That 's what we need to do in Australia . " Maximising 10 , 15 and more talents to produce a serious challenge that speaks to the ultimate goal of World No1 . <p> Verhaeren believes that Australia has all the tools and talent it needs : <p> " What impresses me is the diversity of programs ... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that adapts best . Diversity is an enormous asset that Australia should never lose : programs , coaching styles and swimmers can have the best pick of a coach in a particular program that suits them best . " <p> Verhaeren was unsure what it came down to , education , culture or A Another but the quality of coaches Down Under was a power to be harnessed , " their passion for swimming , their commitment and their craftsmanship ... the way they work on intuition is fantastic . " He adds : <p> " I would say they are great artists . As coaches we are helped by science but we are not scientists . On feel , on intuition , on craftsmanship , they do a very good job . When I see in programs how they work things out on a personal and professional level this is really great to see . " <p> In his tour of coaches and programs , Verhaeren says he had the " enormous privilege " of sitting down with Forbes Carlile photo : ABC still , once head coach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the most prolific winner of solo medals at one Games in the history of swimming , an achievement topped by gold in the and free and medley in 1972 , each victory earned in world-record time . <p> " Speaking with him really is enormous , given everything he achieved and what 's best is that he is still ( in his 90s ) open to new ideas and developing his thoughts . He is the example of what I see here : always seeking to develop thought , improve , find better ways of doing things , every single day . It was an honour to meet him and great to share time and thoughts with him . " <p> In Carlile 's day , Australia to the Netherlands was another planet . These days , with social media , technology , Skype and a smaller world when it comes to travel real and virtual ( we sat next to each other for this interview courtesy of Skype and it felt like he was in my office and I in his hotel ) Verhaeren is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Did he miss anything from home ? " What you miss is on a human level : friends , contacts , your social environment but nothing in terms of food and material things , " he says with a nod to regular contact with Van den Hoogenband back in Eindhoven . " I really believe that moving these days is easier than it was even 15 to 20 years ago . " <h> Living in the Land Down Under <p> There is much to love about life in Australia , notes the head coach : <p> " Living on the Gold Coast , the beach lifestyle ... before I came here I never knew what that meant : it is laid back here . Within 10 minutes I am on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world and 20 minutes the other way is the rainforest ; we found great schools for our kids and life here is really fantastic . I say that without any exaggeration . " <p> A nature loving family , the had a permanent smile on their faces each morning at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first days were amazing : " Cockatoos , parrots lorikeets in garden : it is like you arrived in paradise . " <p> The travel distances that come with the head coach job take some getting used to , while the 100 points bureaucracy for new arrivals in the country was a cultural surprise for the laid-back Dutchman . <p> " Compared to where I come from there are an enormous amount of rules in this country . If you move here there is a 100 points system to get anything done : if want a telephone or internet connection , you can only do it with the 100 points , a passport , proof that you live in Australia ; you have to get a Medicare card ; in the first week we arrived here , I do n't think I ever had to sign so many documents in my whole life before . <p> " The funny thing is that that is all very formal in a place where it is generally not formal at all but nothing happens without the 100 points and that bureaucracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being laid back . " <p> It reminded me of a scene in a German film documenting the experience of a Turkish family in the country : a few of decades into their stay in Germany they received a letter to tell them that their citizenship papers had come through . The man and wife , now around retirement age , go to meet the bureaucrat who will hand over the papers : a big Bavarian-style chap indicates that they should sit in the two seats in front of him and then he sets to with his stamp set , branding documents galore with the print of officialdom . The silent bureaucrat then hands over the certificates to the bemused couple with the only three words he speaks : Willkommen in Deutschland ! <p> " Yes , " laughs Verhaeren , " It was a bit like that ! " But no-one checked to see if he was actually capable of driving on the " wrong " side of the road , he said with another chuckle . <h> One trial over with , the next one begins ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the performance and the execution " of athletes : " What they have in mind in the racing process and strategy and do they actually do that " . <p> Having witnessed what the shoal is capable of in training , he is keen to see what happens when they are rested : " Some of them have been racing at a high level . Are they able to equal that level and drop from there ? I will be watching and then going back with the coaches to talk through what they did to achieve that trials performance and see where we can add support to go to the next level . Its different than being the hands on coach yourself but after 24 years on the deck it still excites me to go to a trials . " <p> Much focus has been trained on the men 's 4x100m free , the London 2012 drop and the " toxic culture " report that followed for all and the so-called Stilnox Six . " I think last year and during the Olympics , the men 's 4 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the execution was n't the world 's best , " said Verhaeren . " We have to get that right . I 'm looking forward to watching them at trials , how they face up to the challenge . " <p> It was time for Verhaeren to go but before he did , he disappeared off the screen for a moment to reach out to his bedside table . " I think you know this , " he said holding up a book . The beaming smile said ' here 's what we need ' . <p> 1500 : the story of Australia 's race by Mike Coleman <p> Verhaeren is lapping it up the literature and lore of success , Australian swimming at its very best and most thrilling . There was just time to relate my experience on that great Hackett Vs Perkins day in Sydney back in 2000 : The Times ran its news desk operation from the Games not the office back in London for the first time , the internet age and timezone gap dictating a shift in working habits . Great news can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening . <p> The sports editor , David Chappell , announced at morning conference that he was off that evening and would be going to dinner with his wife down by the Harbour , it being a relatively quiet evening in the midst of the storm of many sports . <p> " Get there early , its the 1500 tonight , " I said . He scoffed , the swim corr trying to big up his sport again ... " No , I mean it . It 'll be huge here . " He did n't listen and he and his wife did n't get a table either . The next morning he was gracious enough to acknowledge an aspect of sport and swimming that took him completely by surprise , with Aussies hanging out of bar and restaurant windows to catch a glimpse of any screen they could lean to as Grant and Kieren thrilled not just swimming fans but a whole nation . <p> That 's the spirit and might that Jacco Verhaeren hopes to harness if Australia is to have a shot at that World No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles team led by Don Talbot did back in Fukuoka 45 years after the last time the Aussies won the biggest global long-course meet of the year in world waters at a home Melbourne Olympic Games . <h> Comments <p> Bill Bell March 29 , 2014 <p> You could NEVER duplicate all those high rises along the coast in California .

 In The Complex Life Of The Late Charles Keating <p> Charles H. Keating Jr . has died . He was a swimming philanthropist who in another world went to prison and came to symbolize the billion savings-and-loan crisis in the United States in the 1990s after he was alleged to have fleeced thousands of depositors with regulatory help from a group of United States senators known as the Keating Five . <p> He was 90 at his passing . <p> The significance in the world of swimming is that he was Gary Hall Jr 's grandfather . He watched his grandson take silver medals at Atlanta 1996 from the confines of jail . <p> The significance to me was that I met him and spent four hours interviewing him in Arizona the day after he was let out of jail . Phil Whitten , then editor of Swimming World , arranged the meeting for me . <p> Charles Humphrey Keating Jr . was born in Cincinnati on Dec. 4 , 1923 . He attended Catholic schools and was a fine swimmer , an All-American . In World War II he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active combat . In peacetime , he enrolled in law school at the University of Cincinnati , graduating in 1948 , he received a law degree and began practice in Cincinnati . In the 1950s , he organized Catholic men 's groups to fight pornography and founded Citizens for Decent Literature . In 1969 , he was named by Richard M. Nixon to the President 's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography . <p> What he will always be associated with , however , is the US Savings and Loans scandal of the 1980s and 1990s . That 's what is making headlines in the US as Keating 's family mourn his passing . <p> His first day of liberty made for a fascinating first interview beyond bars . I wrote a full page profile for the Business section of The Times newspaper in London at the end of a day I shall never forget . Keating protested his innocence on many matters and explained why he felt that the system had let down the many folk who lost their savings and investments . The talk back in the office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while certain practices had not been in the best interests of many who invested money , the system itself often seemed just as guilty as any individual in a crisis that blew through the lives of normal folk with a vengeance . The issues , involving political favours granted for campaigns funded , were highly complex . <p> What was clear to me ( without any disrespect intended to those who felt that Keating , and all those considered in the same light as he was in the savings and loans crisis , had done them harm ) was that I liked him . He was bright , he was sharp , he was humble and the opposite within the space of moments , he was polite , witty and very good company . We met at a seven-star golf resort that was in the mix of places he had a hand in before things took a wrong turn . <p> The hissing of summer lawns in a landscape of man-made greenery was the front to high-end luxury that came with a comic edge for this Brit abroad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' swimming correspondent ' who happened to work on the business desk ( I think the paper saw it the other way round ) . <p> I arrived early for the interview , which was just as well . It took 10mins to get past the gate a mile back from the hotel building , the English language dividing me and the aged porter . Given that there were three or four roads to take ahead of me inside the grounds , I 'd asked ' where do I park the car ' . ' Say what ? ' summed up the reply that kept coming back no matter how I tried to phrase it . I adopted a form of sign language , hands and arms trying to express what it was that I wanted to convey . " Ah ! he replied . I . " Eureka ! " You mean self-parking ! " <p> I informed him that I did n't want to park myself , I wanted to park the car . He stuck a finger in the air , pointing the way forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ) . <p> Once inside the resort , it took another 15 minutes to buy a newspaper and some mints . Having asked for what I wanted , I noticed that the lady serving at the counter had adopted a catatonic stance . Eventually , without moving her head , she spoke , not to me but to " Janet " . As in ( cue accent , which one , I could n't say , but ... ) " Janet , come out here and listen to this guy talk . " Janet came out . They stared , they waited . " Go on , say som'in " , said Janet 's friend . <p> " Well , what do you want me to say ? " <p> " Oh , God , did ya hear that . Say som'in else . " And so it went on . <p> Keating caught the tail end of it and , standing at a distance , was all but laughing out loud . He said something to the effect of " They 're not used to you folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was distinct . <p> Charles Keating 's death was confirmed by his son-in-law Gary Hall , former world record holder of the 1960s and 70s and one of the most versatile swimmers in history . <h> The obituaries focus on one theme above all Savings and Loans <p> The Savings and Loans debacle of the 1980s and 90s , when hundreds upon hundreds of institutions collapsed through reckless investments gone wrong , has long been synonymous , probably unfairly , with Keating . He was the man held up as villain of a crisis in which depositors lost life savings they had placed in hometown thrifts that they thought were safe . <p> Keating would plead guilty to fraud charges . In 1984 , the then a 61-year-old Phoenix real estate millionaire bought Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan , of Irvine , California , for million , double its net worth . Lincoln made small profits on home loans , but new state and federal rules allowed it to make riskier investments . Keating placed a great deal of depositors ' savings into real estate ventures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , Lincoln 's assets had soared to billion , the personal cut from which made Keating and even richer man than he had already been . <p> But the Federal Home Loan Bank Board , fearing sector collapse , eventually imposed a limit on " risky " S &amp; L investments . By 1987 , its investigators found that Lincoln had million of unreported losses and was more than million over the allowable risk level . <p> Keating hired Alan Greenspan , on his way to becoming chairman of the Federal Reserve . Greenspan compiled a report : Lincoln 's depositors faced " no foreseeable risk " , it concluded . Political intrigue followed , with politicians whose campaigns had been funded by Keating called on to help ease the risk quota and bring an end to inquiry . <p> It worked and conditions were relaxed to devastating effect for depositors and investors . In the two further years in which Lincoln survived , its asset book ballooned to billion , much of that in what turned out to be speculative investments . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial and sentence for fraud , racketeering and conspiracy following economic collapse and a banking crisis . And then all of that was followed by verdicts overturned on appeal , release from jail after more than four years and a retrial called off in 1999 when Keating pleaded guilty to lesser charges and was ruled to have served enough punishment . He was finally free to go , free to watch his grandson race to Olympic gold at Sydney 2000 , this time at liberty . <p> Authoritative studies put the cost of the S&amp;L crisis at billion for taxpayers . <p> " Charlie Keating built things , and , at some level that haunts anyone who looks over his records , he thought his schemes would work . He did not simply rob a bank . He broke a bank with his dreams . If he is simply a thief , why did he put the money into deals and projects instead of into his own pocket ? If he is just a hardworking businessman simply trying to make a profit and create jobs , why the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ? If he is such a devout communicant of his faith , why did he peddle hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of junk bonds to old people when he knew his empire was in serious jeopardy ? " <p> Keating steadfastly maintained that it was not his mistakes or criminal deeds but regulators ' actions that were responsible for the major losses .

 during which he topped the world rankings with sizzling times over 50 and breaststroke at Australian trials , Christian Sprenger has revealed one of the secrets to his success : the Corsuit , a training device that straps on like a belt , keeping spine straight and body streamlined . <p> One of the most notable things that shiny suits sunk on January 1 , 2010 , did was to ease the need for world-class core strength , non-textile material buoying and supporting when the heat was on and fatigue might normally have set in . The ban having returned swimming to swimmers , coaching core strength and understanding angles of buoyancy and how to optimise them in individuals built with unique proportions and skills was back up top on the list of prep priorities . <p> In the hunt for what helps , an Australian former swimmer has developed the " Corsuit " , a training device that straps on like a belt , keeping a swimmer 's spine straight and body streamlined . <p> Lungs lower and hips higher in the water , the swimmer gains a mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minimum drag , the makers claim . <p> Developed and prototyped in 2010 by Sam James , right , while studying industrial design at Queensland University of Technology , the Corsuit has now been developed commercially with hep from the university 's innovation arm , bluebox . <p> James spent three years researching and refining the Corsuit , including countless hours of underwater filming . A handful of international-level coaches and swimmers have trialled the product , including Olympic champion coach Stephan Widmer and World Champion and Olympic medallist Sprenger , who said : <p> " I really liked how the Corsuit streamlined my body in the water . It helped me flatten my angle of attack in breaststroke , which helped me maintain momentum there 's nothing like it out there . " <p> Noting that times ( as opposed to swimmers ) got slower in 2010 for many , James explains : " I wanted to design something that would support and strengthen a swimmer 's core muscles and posture , instead of artificially bracing them like the bodysuits ' in-built corsets did . The Corsuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so swimmers can build their strength and experience what position their body should be in you can really feel the difference in your posture when you use it . <p> " But it 's most valuable when worn during a pre-race warm-up , where that timely feedback on body position can help shave a little extra off your time . " <p> Swim squads in and around Brisbane are already using the lightweight , low-profile device in training , while the Corsuit was to be seen during warm-up at Aussie nationals last week in the city where it was developed . <p> The Corsuit is designed for all swimmers from age 12 up .

In the final , guess who was closest for silver ? Stravius . <p> Lacourt has put a bit of distance between them of late : by moving to Australia , where he has been training with coach Ian Pope at the Melbourne Unit .

 saw who might make the England team for the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this summer . We know that 36 slots are up for grabs and we know what the target times are but after that decisions will be based on who is where on the world rankings and who has a shot at what when the heat is on . <p> Nothing is certain but there is a strong likelihood that Roberto Pavoni booked his ticket for a return to the Tollcross International Pool in Glasgow this summer ashen he established an English record of and a British standard in the medley . <p> Coached by Kevin Renshaw at Loughborough , Pavoni set the pace from go to gold , leaving Lewis Smith ( 4:15. 76 ) and Max Litchfield ( 4:16.61 ) in his wake on the way to the third best effort in the world so far this year . <p> Pavoni 's Pace : 57.51 ; 2:02.83 ; ; <p> The global ranks , as of this morning in Tokyo , are led by an outstanding 4:07.88 from Olympic bronze medallist Kosuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

No Commonwealth swimmer has ever raced inside 4:10 . The one who can , come Glasgow , may well be the champion . In the hunt with Pavoni is Chad le Clos , the South African who pipped Michael Phelps for butterfly gold at London 2012 . <p> On 4:14 in Durban on yesterday , Le Clos added two more solo events to his Commonwealth roster last night with world top 4 times in both the butterfly , for which he is World champion , and the medley in a time a fraction behind the best two Australians so far this year .

 Lotte Friis take in the enormity of their battle at Barcelona 2013 world titles Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The countdown to the return of Michael Phelps is in full effect , the world of swimming keen to see the greatest Olympian in history in action for the first time since he upped his medal tally to 22 at the London Games in 2012 . It was supposed to be Phelps ' farewell , but it looks like the tug of competition has lured the sport 's version of Poseidon into a 2016 Olympic pursuit . <p> Although Phelps will be the main attraction at this weekend 's United States Grand Prix event in Mesa , Arizona , the field for the event is filled with Olympic medalists and rising stars . Following up on Part One of our Grand Prix preview , here 's a glimpse at some of the other things to watch over the next few days . <h> Katie Ledecky &amp; Lotte Friis rejoin battle <p> The duels between American Katie Ledecky and Denmark 's Lote last summer 's World Championships were among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals in the 800 and 1500 freestyle events , each in world-record time , Friis deserves credit for challenging her teenage foe and pushing her to heights never previously seen . <p> However , the 400 freestyle might be a bit more entertaining , with the added presence of Allison Schmitt Photo : USA Swimming to the docket . While Ledecky is the reigning world champion in the 400 free and the only woman to crack the four-minute barrier in a textile suit , Schmitt was the silver medalist in the event at the 2012 Olympics . As for Friis , the 400 free might be the weakest of her distance events , but she still rates among the elite performers in the world . The top time in the world this year belongs to Spain 's Mireia Belmonte at 4:03.84 . <p> The Mesa Grand Prix will be Schmitt 's latest opportunity to show she has returned to elite form after missing out on the World Champs in Barcelona . Schmitt has opened 2014 in solid fashion and is definitely finding herself challenge at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yannick Agnel and American Conor Dwyer , among others . <p> Because the Mesa stop is a mid-season event , expectations over times must be tempered . But in a setting like the 400 free , where big names are set to clash , it will be interesting to see just how quick the women will be . <h> How will Kevin Cordes follow up latest gains in little pool ? <p> A couple of guys with spectacular short-course resumes will try to continue their progression in the long-course pool . A month after winning the 100-yard breaststroke and 200-yard breaststroke for the University of Arizona at the NCAA Championships , Kevin : right , by Aniko Kovacs will be the heavy favorite to take titles in Mesa in both breaststroke events . <p> Long tabbed to be the heir apparent to Brendan Hansen as the elite breaststroker in the United States , Cordes finished seventh last summer at the World Championships , but did not advance out of the semifinals of the 200 breast . This summer will be a defining moment for Cordes , as he needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes of Christian Sprenger , Cameron van der Burgh and Daniel Gyurta , among others . A strong showing in Mesa could go a long way toward a successful summer campaign . <p> Meanwhile , Tom Shields will chase his first major international berth ( Olympics , World Championships , Pan Pacific Championships ) in the long-course pool this summer , his best chance coming in the 100 butterfly . While Shields has shown himself to be one of the better American performers in the 100 fly , he has n't had that breakthrough yet , and in order to deliver , he 'll have to defeat the likes of Ryan Michael Phelps . Like Cordes , this Grand Prix stop can provide momentum heading into the big months ahead . <h> Next Challenge for Natalie Coughlin <p> Continuing her adaptation from a multi-event standout to a sprint freestyler , Natalie Coughlin Photo : Speedo will be closely watched . The 11-time Olympic medalist , now 31 , is set to race the 50 free and 100 free , events which have grown considerably deeper on the global stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25-second mark in the 50 free and 11 have dipped under the 54-second barrier in the 100 free . <p> At this point in the American season , Coughlin will not be expected to turn in some of her top times , but efforts within sniffing distance of the top-10 in the world would supply confidence that Coughlin can add additional accomplishments to her storied career . <h> So , How Fast Do You Think Michael Phelps Will Go ? <p> Since there was some discussion on the topic , let 's throw out some questions to the readership to weigh its thoughts on the return of Michael Phelps photo : Speedo . How fast will Phelps go this weekend in the 100 freestyle ? How fast will Phelps go in the 100 butterfly ? <p> It 's difficult to gauge what types of times Phelps will produce in his return , but we 'll have the answer soon enough . One thing , however , is worth stating . Regardless of what the clock says , it is too early to get either overly excited or overly bummed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona is just a step in what will be a process , and it is important to remember that fact .@@2451007 <h> Liverpool Champions League

 good reason to smile , on 1:56 in April Photo : Aniko Kovacs <h> USA Grand Prix , Mesa <h> Day 2 Finals <p> Most fans of the sport will know her name , but for the casual or younger follower , a brief history lesson seems appropriate before delving into what unfolded on Friday night at the Mesa stop of the United States Swimming Grand Prix circuit . So , sit back for a moment as we take a trip to Australia in the early 1970s . <p> While Mark Spitz geared up for his pursuit of seven gold medals at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich , something special was also taking place Down Under . With Forbes Carlile calling the shots , a teenager with never-before-seen talent was dominating the freestyle events . Her name was Shane Gould and at one point during her career , she simultaneously held every world record from the 100 freestyle through the 1500 freestyle . <p> Gould Photo : on tour spreading the word on the betterment of swimming in 2012 was equal parts impressive as a sprinter as she was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual medals at the 1972 Games ( gold , 200 , free , medley , all in wold records ; silver , free ; bronze , free ) , a feat still unmatched by a female swimmer . But intense pressure was among reasons why , as a teenager , Gould retired shortly after the Munich Games , leaving many to wonder what could have been if the young Aussie had wanted to stay in swimming . <p> Why the brief lesson on Gould ? Well , four decades after the Australian superstar demonstrated incredible range , American teenager Katie Ledecky is proving herself to be one of the most-complete freestylers in history . Already the reigning Olympic champion in the 800 freestyle and the world titlist in the 400 free , 800 free and 1500 free from Barcelona last summer , Ledecky dropped a bombshell in the 200 freestyle in Grand Prix action . <p> Racing against Olympic champion Allison Schmitt , Ledecky enjoyed a wire-to-wire triumph in the four-lap event , touching the wall in a career-best time of 1:56.27 . Schmitt was right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Ledecky was the difference in her midseason outing . The time produced by Ledecky was slightly quicker than the 1:56.32 she posted on the leadoff leg of the American 800 freestyle relay in Barcelona , that mark delivered at peak performance . <p> Adding further context to the performance is the fact that Ledecky 's time ranks fourth in the world this year , not bad considering she is unrested and the event ranks as her fourth-best discipline . Schmitt also made the top 10 this season : <p> While Ledecky has clearly maintained her endurance , she continues to develop greater speed , a scary scenario for the rest of the world . <p> The comparison to Gould is not to suggest that Ledecky will one day own world records in the same range , but to emphasize just how rare it is to see an athlete excel over such a wide spectrum . On the first night of action in Mesa , Ledecky even uncorked an effort of 55.22 and has the wheels turning as to whether she could be a future member of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like more and more of a possibility . <p> While Ledecky earned the title , Schmitt 's performance was a positive , too . After running away with the 200 free crown at the London Games , Schmitt endured a rough campaign in 2013 , including the failure to qualify for the World Championships . But Schmitt Photo : with Missy Franklin after a golden 4x200m free relay at London 2012 is looking rejuvenated in 2014 , something she needs while training alongside the stars corralled to the North Baltimore Aquatic Club under the watch of Bob Bowman . <p> By touching the wall in 1:56.90 for the 200 freestyle , Schmitt notched the eighth-fastest time of the year and followed up a strong showing in the 100 free . On the opening night of action in Mesa , Schmitt prevailed in the two-lapper with a mark of 54.46 . Should Schmitt continue on her current arc , she could be primed for a big summer at the Pan Pacific Championships . <h> Nathan Adrian Blazes 21.73 En Route to 50 Free Triumph <p> A couple of days after Brazilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) unloaded the top times in the world in the 50 freestyle at the Maria Lenk Trophy , American Nathan Adrian Photo : Speedo fired an answer . Although the Cal Aquatics star did n't go quite as quickly as Cielo and Fratus , the 21.73 of Adrian was good for fifth in the world rankings and an impressive marker for this stage of his season . <p> Adrian faced little resistance , claiming victory by nearly a half-second over South African Roland Schoeman ( 22.19 ) , who is chasing a fifth Olympic berth . was third in 22.24 , with Jimmy Feigen ( 22.55 ) and Anthony Ervin ( 22.57 ) following . Adrian 's time improved his previous season best of 21.89 , posted at the Austin Grand Prix earlier in the year . <p> One of the difficult parts of dissecting the global scene at this point in the year is the fact that athletes are all at different stages of training . Some have already taken part in their national championships while others , like Adrian , have yet to race at full power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state until later in the summer bodes well for what is to come . <h> Phelps ' Comeback Debut in the Books <p> The evening session lacked the presence of Michael Phelps , whose second day of his comeback was a short one . A day after a sharp performance in the 100 butterfly slotted the 22-time Olympic medalist in a tie for fifth in the world rankings at 52.13 , Phelps Photo courtesy of USA Swimming raced the 50 freestyle in Mesa , opting to cover his lap via the butterfly . <p> Far from a sprinter , Phelps posted a time of 24.06 for his one lap of butterfly . But the time is of no consequence in the scheme of Phelps ' return to the sport . What matters is the fact that Phelps is back in the competitive flow , clearly enjoying himself and building toward the summer , when the times will matter and determine his path toward the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro . <p> Phelps ' stint in Mesa was a success in many ways . For one , he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his time in the 100 fly . More , Phelps brought significant attention to the sport , to the point where his results were covered by mainstream media . Any time Phelps is in the water , it means greater attention and that can only be viewed as a plus for the sport . Of his first meet back , he said : <p> " I felt like a kid and that was the coolest part about it . It 's a good starting point , being able to get some races back under my belt . " <p> Phelps is set to spend three weeks at high-altitude training in Colorado Springs next month and is preliminarily entered in the two remaining Grand Prix competitions , stops in Charlotte early next month and Santa Clara in June . <h> In Other Action : <p> There have been 10 faster times this season , but given the heavy training she 's endured under Gregg Troy since the end of the NCAA Championships last month , Elizabeth Beisel has to be pleased with the 4:39.68 she posted for a win in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce quick times in the middle of the season , but Beisel was able to churn out a sub-4:40 mark . <p> Beisel has n't been off the podium in the 400 medley in the major event since 2009 and she is on the right track for the summer and the Pan Pacific Championships . Beisel was followed in second place by Becca Mann in 4:42.78 . <p> Ryan Lochte followed his win over Michael Phelps in the 100 butterfly from Thursday with a victory in the 200 freestyle . Lochte was one of two men to break 1:50 , edging South African Darian Townsend , 1:49.48 to 1:49.94 . Meanwhile , Tyler Clary topped the field in the 400 individual medley in 4:19.00 , ahead of the 4:22.26 of Conor Dwyer . <p> Clary was back later in the night to finish second in the 200 backstroke , won by Arkady Vyatchanin in 1:58.04 , 18th in the world rankings . Clary touched the wall in 1:59.26 , with rising star Ryan Murphy next in 2:00.27 . The women 's 200 back went to Clara Smiddy in 2:12.53 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won in 25.16 , comfortably ahead of the 25.45 of Amanda Weir and the 25.54 of Natalie Coughlin . Another Olympian , Jessica Hardy , was fourth in 25.71 . <h> Comments <p> April 26 , 2014 <p> Gould also held 200 IM WR . <p> However , I do n't any swimmer , female or male , will ever again hold all freestyle WRs simultaneously , unless USA Russia or China developed a genetically engineered human being specifically designed to be fast swimmer . And I think it will happen . Some elite top swimmers will resort to gene therapy and gene doping to get faster . <p> April 26 , 2014 <p> I am super impressed with Ledecky. it is stunning that at least one of Missy , Ledecky and Schmitt will not represent USA in Kazan and Rio . <p> But there is only one priority and task for Ledecky this summer : break 400 free WR ! <p> April 26 , 2014 <p> I 'd say two priorities . A USA 4 ? 200 of Ledecky , Schmitt , Franklin and either Vreeland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> April 26 , 2014 <p> Hoff may not be ready yet . I think Vreeland is more ready . <p> April 26 , 2014 <p> As long as 2013 was n't a fluke , I could see Vreeland settling in to a Ricky Berens role on the USA international teams- does n't always get a ton of individual swims because of a logjam ahead of her , but very necessary and key as a 3rd or 4th swimmer on the free relays .@@2458202 <h> A scathing attack 
 who claimed a controversial bronze medal for Russia in the breaststroke at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta , has died after a battle against stomach cancer .

 producing the very best performance in each of England 's charges at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow this July is the only way to navigate through a channel bordered by hope and despair but awash with opportunity , head coach Jon Rudd tells SwimVortex today . <p> The England squad was named today at Bath 's Intensive Training Centre , home to the likes of Chris Walker-Hebborn and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor Photo : SWPix.com : 39 swimmers made the selectors ' cut see the foot of this file for the team in full . <p> Fran Halsall ( 50 ' fly ) , Sophie Taylor ( 100 breaststroke ) , and Aimee Willmott ( 400IM ) , all with a No1 Commonwealth ranking this year in their respective events , and O'Connor , world No2 over medley behind Australia 's Alicia Coutts inside 2:10 , top the list of title hopes . <p> The detail of where the selection axe falls and what possibilities emerge provide a story line or two .

Take England history alone : the last time a home country hosted the Commonwealth Games , in Manchester in 2002 , Australian swimming was riding the crest of a wave , success at a home Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 having been followed by the defeat of the mighty USA on gold count at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka . <p> On paper , at least two thirds of all medals in Manchester had Australia stamped on them .

A magnificent turnaround for a team just two years beyond the woe of a national squad that returned from Sydney without a single Olympic medal in the pool for the first time since 1948 . <p> Rudd , the England head coach for 2014 and a man who celebrated gold in the pool at London 2012 but was not a part of the Britain team , wants Glasgow to be a " new beginning " , an experience that " puts the memories of a home Olympics to bed " . <p> As mentor at Plymouth Leander to Olympic champion Ruta Meilutyte , of Lithuania , his personal recollection of London 2012 , is a happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaststroke one of the highlights of eight days of racing that was , without question in terms of home team-wide results , disappointing though not nearly as disastrous as some have painted . <p> Rudd tells SwimVortex : " London 2012 may well still be the moment people have in mind when they think of Britain and swimming . I was n't involved in the Britain team ; I had an athlete on the team and that was extent of the relationship . For me , its long gone . It would be nice to put those kind of memories to bed . " <p> He noted the fine line between " disappointing " and " being two medals shy of a tremendous performance " in the eyes of those who judge the meaning of success and decide the sums for the next cycle of funding . That applied not only to Britain but to many nations ( Australia 's London 2012 , with the women 's 4x100m free gold the only win in the pool , also deemed ' disappointing ' Down Under ) . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but even with Ruta it all feels like 100 years ago . Even her world title and world record a year ago in Barcelona feels like a long time ago . I 'm a forward-thinking man and its the future we have to focus on . <p> " In many ways , this is a new group of swimmers heading into the Commonwealth Games . For me this is the beginning : if we get this right , it will be a great springboard into Kazan ( 2015 world titles ) and the Rio Olympic Games . It is the perfect time to get something right and if our athletes step up on the day , take on the opposition and do well they will take resilience and pride with them into the future . " <p> Rudd 's role is to lead and " work with coaches , support staff , athletes ... and get the very best performances out of them on the day , " he says . " The last thing we want to worry about is how many medals we might get . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance if that brings medals , great . " <p> There is , of course , a Britain/UK Sport medals target to consider when it comes to funding and support levels for all sports . That , said Rudd , " is not going to distract me in slightest ... we will be working on best performance and that alone . <p> " The medals table will be what it will be . That 's where there is a difference in the mindset of coaches and officials and officers . No-one loves a medal more than a coach and an athlete but that is the last thing we have on out minds at that moment approaching a race . " <p> " We have to ensure that swimmers are in tip-top condition going into competition and when a backstroker drops into the water for the start , for example , we all know that nothing more could have been done ... that 's the moment that they have to do it for themselves . " <p> Rudd will aim to have every England team member harness the spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world title and world record to her treasury in Barcelona last Spanish summer Photo : Meilutyte and Rudd , by Patrick B. Kraemer . " Her focus , " says Rudd , " was and is just on the job that she has to do : getting each performance right through the rounds , knowing she has done all she can to get the best out of herself and then putting that into practice with each passing race . " Adds Rudd : <p> " In London , we just concentrated on what we had to do do ; you have to let others make their own mistakes and errors . We only talked about things that could improve her performance . That 's what I will be reinforcing with the coaches . It is the way we 'll get the best out of the swimmers . The moment we start worrying about other things is when fear , trepidation and so on start to step in ; we 'll be celebrating best times and great swim regardless of medals . " <p> That , he says , " adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor for me . Yes , we 've got to be focussed on and mindful of the challenge in front of us but at the same time there has too be a calmness and relaxation about the team : we have to be at ease with the fact that we are ready to go the when gun fires alongside the feel-good factor and the ability to come together as a team . " <p> He note the special nature of the Games when he said : " It only happens once every four years that an England swim squad assembles for racing a great chance to come together and harness the strength in that . " <p> Rudd said he had " looked at the rankings fairly carefully " and there was no question that Australia " will be force decisive force " . Even so , it would come down to the day . On the side of advantages , England could look at all the positives that come with " home meet " , and although he acknowledged that " we heard all that before with London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home and having gone through the ropes : " We 've had the opportunity to test lot of things , to get the fabric of the team right , how we operate ; we 've talked through situations and our day-to-day procedures are in place " . <p> The team announced today represents a " changing of the guard " to some extent , Rudd suggested , without naming any individuals shy of official revelation . " We 've got swimmers who are ready to step up ... we 've got fresh , exciting , new blood coming through and I think that spirit of youth and a little bit of innocence about senior racing is going to bring something fresh across all the home nation teams " . <p> A fine example is another Plymouth Leander charge , Ben Proud , who raced inside target time at nationals but showed his sharper hand this week past with a 21.86 blast at county championships . <p> The Games were not so much " a challenge as more of an opportunity " , he added . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twilight of careers but are hungry for a big hurrah in Rio and see this year as a big step into that . Then , for others , it will be their first senior international cap and for even more the first time they have swum for England , 2010 having been the last chance . That will ; bring a vibrance and excitement to the team . A great balance .

For Rudd ' awe ' is there to " remind us that we need to know how to deal with this " ; and among the answers are facts such as " they are flesh and blood with two arms and two legs and they can be beaten . They are on top of the world and have everything to lose .

 Kristin Otto , winner of what remains a record six Olympic gold medals among women ( at the 1988 Games for the GDR ) , as long-time TV sports presenter in Germany has been called into question by a television ombudsman . <p> The former swimmer is not , for once , in the spotlight because her results stemmed from State Plan 14:25 and doping but because she stood as a political candidate and her image and words were used in a 1989 voting campaign for the ruling regime shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall back in 1989 . <p> It was 25 years ago that Otto stood in support of what was called the " National Front " in municipal elections under the slogan " a New Germany " , according to German reports . The campaign was part of a propaganda exercise by the Socialist Unity Party of Germany . The election results were subsequently , after reunification and the unearthing of Stasi ( state secret police ) documents , proven to have been falsified , German newspapers report . <p> Otto has long presented TV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has rarely answered questions on doping beyond saying that she was unaware of having been administered with Oral Turinabol , the principal steroid at the heart of State Plan 14:25 . <p> Otto 's TV contract places her position under potential threat only if it were ever proven that she knowingly took doping , according to TV industry sources in Germany . Her position on the Today Heute sports show is now questioned because of her role in politics back in GDR days . The timing of the ' news ' coincides with media build-up to the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall later this year . <p> Bild , the red-top paper , cites Hugo Diederich , for the ZDF Television Council , which plays an ombudsman 's role , as saying that Otto was not a fit person to present news because she had not owned up to her past . <p> Otto replied through the media by saying that she wished to remind that " I have often spoken in public about my life in the GDR " . <p> ZDF , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on doping , noting that " the political manifesto of 1989 has no impact on Otto 's employment " . In the current climate , ZDF 's stand is likely to find favour . Germany has other problems . <p> The news comes at a time when the country faces European and regional elections this month . That the calling into question of Otto 's ' national socialist ' past is making front page and lead headlines in Germany looks somewhat comical against a backdrop of relatively little national news coverage of the extreme right-wing NPD party and its plastering of Saxony and other former GDR states with what many see as racist and hateful slogans . <p> While ignoring a group of people that represent a very small minority may well have merit , some commentators say , ignoring the messages that are impossible to ignore in some parts of Germany is not so easy . <p> Anyone arriving at Dresden airport this week might well think , on a taxi ride into the centre , that the 1930s were about to make a comeback , dozens upon dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things such as " Foreigners Out " ( the word criminal is so small you can hardly see it ) ; Maria not Sharia ; Money for " Oma not Roma " ( grandma not gypsies ) ; Europe 's turning Right ; and bring back the D-Mark . <p> The NPD is an official party in Germany however , German states are in the process of building a case to ban the organisation . <h> Comments <p> In today 's Los Angeles Times ( ) a former Times staffer and later a U.S. State Department official and now a Senior Fellow @ Human Rights First describes a trip she recently made to several European states , primarily Greece and Hungary , " Where the neofascist movements are strongest .

Indeed , I visited a new Sorb cultural centre and museum paid for from state funds . I also know that the Czech language and other Slav languages are offered at local grammar and secondary schools around Dresden and in many of the towns around the Saxon capital . I 've attended cultural exchange events in Dresden at which sorb , Czech and other minority interests are at the heart of efforts to encourage better understanding . I 'm sure there are those who would get rid of all that at a shot ( just as there are some in Australia who think any efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I see scant evidence of anyone being ' crushed ' , really not . <p> it ai n't necessarily so May 10 , 2014 <p> Cultural exchange programs in their own land along with other minority interests .

Huge amounts of good work is being done in all sorts of ways to keep languages and cultures alive in Europe ... popular culture and the choices of youth are just as likely , if not more , to ' crush ' such things as any supposed attempt to do so by a state , unless you 're talking military takeover , genocide and so forth , of course .

It has much to do with the EU / NATO in Kiev &amp; the backlash in the eastern Ukraine &amp; the mining regions . <p> I am in contact with Sorbs who have their whole villages dug up , including grave sites &amp; relocated by the coal industry . The German government approves because it also weakens the Sorbs . I read Mein Kampf in German &amp; I recognised the hatred he had , not primarily for Jewish but the Slavs . You can not argue it did not hit a sweet spot with the German people . <p> So hence , people have a right to have real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected by the Von in Brussels . . <p> I have to admit I do n't get the EU thing yet you want national teams for sport . <p> All up &amp; I think I speak for all former colonies America included , do not drag us into more wars . Sport we can just about manage nations vs nations though I am beginning to think is too much . <p> PS Rupert trained you well . <p> Craig Lord May 10 , 2014 <p> On the coal issue , that is correct but it is absolutely untrue to suggest this is just happening in Sorb lands . Many near us are affected and they are not Sorbs ... graveyards , lakes , even whole villages have been affected ... it is dreadful and something I wholeheartedly disagree with but ethnic cleansing is not what anyone has in mind .... money , energy .... and it is geography and geology decides where the coal industry makes its next move with state approval . On the rest : the mistake you make is to read into the present that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave driver because I 'm British , just as I would imagine you , simply by being from the land Down Under , are not into abusing children taken from their parents and placed into care under what we now consider to be criminal circumstances , just as you are unlikely to be into wishing your indigenous population dead or confined to barracks ( avalanches of other examples of dreadful practice in nations far and wide , of course ) . As for hatred , I do n't read it in degrees : it is hugely unhelpful to all concerned to suggest one ethnic group might have been ' more hated than the Jews ' , as you seem to suggest ( judging hatred and minorities and many other aspects of life by such degrees is indeed the calculated work of folk like UKIP and the NPD ... I 'd rather avoid it ) .

The panel noted : " The FINA DP recognises that this is a strong sanction that will cause Ms. Efimova to be denied a world record as well as to sit out more than an entire season while at the height of her competitive career . However , Ms. Efimova is a role model and an elite swimmer at the very top of her profession and so must be held to a high standard . " <p> Efimova told the panel that she was more inclined to question the qualifications of individuals selling supplements in Russia than in the United States . Many may well see that as an error of judgement , the warning about supplementation far and wide . <p> She had been looking for " L-carnitine " , which she had used " for many years without incident " . She was told that the Cellucor CK product contained that and did not question the salesperson further . The product was not sold as a " performance enhancer " . <p> However , DHEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the product " , the FINA DP noted . <p> Efimova told the panel that she had taken the Cellucor product for just a week , one that happened to coincide with the out-of-competition test , because she had had a stomach upset after taking the product , which came in pill form . <p> She reverted to taking a liquid form of L-carnitine after the stomach upset . Efimova noted during her hearing that coach Salo was " adamantly opposed to the use of supplements of any kind " . The panel notes that Trojan is also the home of Jessica Hardy , who served a ban for a substance she took inadvertently in a supplement : " She Efimova said her coach frequently tells his swimmers that can get all the nutrition they need through a well balanced diet and that supplements are unnecessary . " <p> Efimova told TASS that all supplements , even vitamins , would go up in flames . She urged younger swimmers : <p> " I hope youngsters are now cautious and recall my troubles " <p> President of the Russian swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free champion , told his home media : <p> " It 's hard to say now whether the athlete or her lawyer will appeal .

I also hope that it , her negligence , which resulted in a banned substance entering her body , will serve as an example and a warning to young athletes . " <p> The Judgment : <h> FINA Doping Panel Decision Yuliya Efimova ( RUS ) <p> On October 31 , 2013 a swimmer Yuliya Efimova ( RUS ) was tested positive to the substance ( Class Endogenous Anabolic Androgenic Steroids ) with the occasion of the FINA out-of-competition doping control test in Los Angeles ( USA ) . <p> The FINA Doping Panel decided according to the FINA DC Rule 10.5.2 to impose on the athlete a period of sixteen ( 16 ) months ineligibility , starting on October 31 , 2013 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first anti-doping rule violation . <p> The ruling includes the cancellation of results after the positive finding . Thus , the relevant podiums at the European s/c Championships in Herning last December are adjusted , leaving Ruta Meilutyte ( LTU ) with gold in the 50 and and Rikke Pedersen ( DEN ) with gold in the breaststroke .

Taken from the report : <p> " 5.4.3.2 L-carnitine is a nutrient found in many dietary supplements and Ms. Efimova presented evidence indications that there is not substantial scientific evidence indicating it is performance enhancing . " <p> Then why take it ! ! ? <p> " 5.18 According to Ms Efimova , her coach at the Trojan Swim Club , David Salo , is adamantly opposed to the use of supplements of any kind . She said her coach frequently tells his swimmers that can get all the nutrition they need through a well balanced diet and that supplements are unnecessary . " <p> Why ignore your coach ! ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of L-carnitine to enhance athletic performance , Ms Efimova believed L-carnitine would aid her athletic performance as she testified that she used it to increase her energy and reduce weight prior to competitions . " <p> Contradicts previous statement obviously , but this L-carnitine had clearly become a psychological comfort blanket for her and she 'd never had problems previously , so why stop she probably thought ? That bit I sympathise with . But when she started getting it from another source as it transpires a tainted one common sense should have kicked in . <p> Craig Lord May 13 , 2014 <p> Quite so , Paul . She 's paid a price but she is also lucky to have been treated with leniency that allows her to race at Russian trials next year . <p> Kim May 13 , 2014 <p> Rikke Pedersen was also on the medley relay from Denmark <p> Craig Lord May 13 , 2014 <p> Yes .. mentioned twice in copy <p> Dave May 13 , 2014 <p> Kicker Vencill , Jessica Hardy and now Efimova . Apparently , it bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from suppliments . In fact , stay away from GNC in general . <p> Will May 14 , 2014 <p> DHEA in the supplement = DHEA tested in her sample ? You ca n't prove that unless you tag isotope or other identifier with DHEA to make it traceable . If not , whatever the swimmer said , in my opinion , is only presumptive . <p> kaypee May 14 , 2014 <p> This looks to be the first instance where a panel applies reduction in the sanction of an athlete even after finding that she used a product that contained a banned steroid and the product label clearly stated that it contained that banned substance ( DHEA ) . This was clearly not a case of ' supplement contamination ' unknown to the athlete . When an athlete finds that a banned substance is listed as an ingredient and still uses it to test positive , then there should be no question of not being negligent . The degree of fault decides the sanctions in such cases and normally , even if a panel believes the argument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American athlete Torri Edwards in 2004 is a classic example where she and her phyiso ignore the label of a glucose tablet which contained a banned substance ( nikethamide ) and stated it , and pays the price with a two-year sanction that forces her to miss the Athens Olympics . The IAAF did lift her suspension prematurely when the WADA changed the categorisation of nikethamide . Just a salesman or a physio or a doctor telling an athlete that a particular medicine or supplement did not contain a banned substance is no defence in an anti-doping rule violation case . <p> Craig Lord May 14 , 2014 <p> Will , a complex subject ... and we do n't have the full details of the findings to lean on , of course ... but I understand that what you say depends on levels and ratios . Here 's something that alludes to what you speak of:http : **40;976;TOOLONG <p> kaypee May 14 , 2014 <p> Here 's the full FINA panel : The panel found " no significant fault of negligence " on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ label , contained a prohibited drug ( DHEA ) . Even if it is established that she was not using the substance ( DHEA ) to enhance performance , the question to ask is ' was she negligent " ? And the other one " was her negligence significant enough ? " All other arguments , like the salesman recommending another product , like her English being not so perfect , like she having not used the stuff immediately etc become more or less irrelevant once it is established that she took a substance which had a label that mentioned the stuff contained DHEA . " I did n't know DHEA was banned " does not constitute a valid defence in anti-doping parlance . Here 's the Torri Edwards linkhttp : And if FINA is saying that a subsequent test proved negative , then they better check up on the Jerome Young ( USA ) case of 2004 where CAS ruled against him despite the fact that two tests , on either side of the positive test , had returned ' negative ' . <p> Craig Lord May 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fina ruling in full link has been in the article since it was launched yesterday morning . the DP also finds that she was " negligent " , just to a degree ... <p> kaypee May 14 , 2014 <p> I missed the ' judgement ' link . Sorry . Yes , the DP also found she was " negligent " , but up to what degree . That is what decides the quantum of punishment . Even if we presume that she did not take it to enhance performance since she thought the store was giving her a substitute for L-carnitine , which she had used for many years and was not in the banned list , the fact that she was only getting an alternative , the salesman had told her that it was better , and she had never used the stuff , makes it obligatory for a world holder athlete to check that out before using it . " Oh , I forgot to check the label ' is equivalent to suggesting that any one can take any type of steroid and come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that this was sufficient to reduce her suspension , so be it . But it sets a precedent . Unless WADA appeals and CAS throws out DP 's verdict .@@2494879 <p> ' My main

 Festival is underway in Norway this weekend , a shoal of world-class swimmers from around the world not only there to tune up for summer but , far more significantly , to honour the memory of Alexander Dale Oen . <p> The meet is held short-course ( a wrap of action will follow after the weekend ) while Bergen builds a pool and the performances , particularly until the meet moves beyond the little pool in the midst of the long-course season , are secondary to the significance of a gathering that includes fellow breaststroke competitors and friends in world waters , the Olympic champions of 2012 Cameron Van Der Burgh ( RSA ) who celebrates his 26th birthday today and Daniel Gyurta ( HUN ) . <p> Both those men dedicated their successes in London to Dale Oen , a man much missed after he passed away on a training camp in spring 2012 . <p> Why do we ( beyond those who knew him best as a son , a brother ) recall Alex Dale Oen ? You can read this on the Dale Oen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer and he claimed swimming gold at a time of great sorrow for Norway* . <p> Those who govern world sport write into their constitutions that politics has no part to play in sport . There are excellent reasons why that should be the case , though one could hardly say that sport , particularly at the governance end of business , is void of politics . <p> In the case of Dale Oen , there was an unavoidable reason why sport and politics became embroiled for a moment . This Sunday , as much of Europe votes in EU elections and the far right is on the move ( and making gains where warnings appear to have fallen on the deaf ears of Eurocrats accused of complacency and being out of touch ) across a continent ripped to shreds by the Nazis in the 1930s and 1940s , is a good one to recall just why the Norwegian swimmer 's story ought to be recalled not just for the dedication , commitment and excellence shown by the athlete but for the dignity and significance in the message he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we mark the Bergen Festival and the memory of Alex Dale Oen by recalling with articles published in 2011 and 2012 his reaction to the tragic events in Norway in 2011 that coincided with a world title won over breaststroke in Shanghai , plus the hopes and dreams of a man who would never see the end of the things he was working on but whose influence lives on in the work of the Dale Oen Experience . <p> The latter came into being prematurely . It was the dream of Alexander and brother Robin : " ... to show you that you can do what you want just as long as you want it enough " . Beyond the swimmer 's shot at gold at London 2012 , they planned to work on the " Experience " project . Alex Dale Oen never got that chance but he will long show others how to take theirs . <h> In Honour of Alex Dale Oen and the Flag He Flew May , 2012 <p> In Memoriam : <p> A week ago this Sunday , Alex Dale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the light out for the last time in his life . I do n't make the point to be morbid , hurtful , callous , obvious . The last time for anything ( even if only , as a consequence , that means doing something for the first time ) , is meaningful to all our lives . <p> Dale Oen 's passing was tragic , his youth , his dedication to the pursuit of excellence , the goal he had this summer , the success he achieved over several years in the pool , the thoughtfulness of a man who saw beauty in the silent reflection of the photographs he took of the natural world he thrilled at being a part of . <p> His world-title victory over breaststroke in Shanghai last year unfolded against the backdrop of tragic events back home in Norway , where insanity , hatred , intolerance and a deep ignorance of the world and the human condition , claimed the lives of 77 innocent people . <p> Anders Behring is now on trial in Norway and each day brings another excruciating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that flushed through his mind the day he decided to take 77 lives ( he has confessed to that but not to mass murder , claiming that his was an act of self-protection , the majority of Norwegians clearly out of their minds for allowing their population to be infected by Swedes , Poles , Danes , Germans , British and Pakistanis ) . <p> The latter cuts to the chase . Alongside a hatred of " pure Norwegians " , Breivik despised the 106,000 or so people in his country registered as belonging to those following Islam . I 'm not sure what he felt about the 800 plus people in Norway registered under Judaism but the farcical , ludicrous mantra of purity that led to the deaths of 18 million people and more at a time when the Nazis held sway , surely counts him among the relatively tiny band of neo-Nazis that like to march up and down Germany ( and elsewhere in Europe ) to this day . <p> Three of their number in Germany made massive headlines this past year after two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested . They had been on the run for a decade and during that time they had embarked on a killing spree of German citizens of Turkish origin and descent as well as a young police woman who got in the way . The three were caught on video marching in a rally with the folk currently at the helm of the German National Party ( NPD ) . <p> This summer , a cruise liner will leave a German port bound for Bergen , the beloved home of Dale Oen . It will deliver tourists to the shores of Norway at regular intervals , as it has for many a summer . One sailing set to carry supporters of the NPD and related organisations . I have no idea whether their purpose in Bergen is anything other than the simple need to take a break and take in the beauty of the world beyond the routine of life , all that hating doubtless a little tiring . <p> Among the symbols they have attached themselves to is the Thor Steinar clothing brand now owned by International Brands General Trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the official religion of the state . <p> The brand has used two logos , one which caused a rumpus because of its proximity to the swastika the Nazis borrowed from ancient history . In Germany , Thor Steiner clothes have been banned by a variety of authorities , including the German Bundestag ( parliament ) , the Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern ( regional government ) , and several football clubs , including Borussia Dortmund , Werder Bremen and Hertha BSC . <p> Some Thor Steinar designs have used the Norwegian flag and and Norwegian names , such as Trondheim , Nordfjord , Nordstrand and Bergen . Stores selling the clothes have been named after Norwegian cities . The Norwegian government took the original owner of the brand to court ( before the company passed into current ownership ) in an effort to stop its national flag being associated with neo-Nazis . It lost the case but the clothes brand agreed in 2007 not to use the Norwegian flag in future designs . <p> In February this year , the Thor Steinar brand was central to a store opening in Chemnitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was " Brevik " , a Norwegian town but obviously uncomfortably close to " Breivik " . There was a public outcry and local authorities are in the process of seeking to have the store closed down . <p> All a very far cry from the high achievement of a man with friends from all corners of the globe , as moving tributes from swimmers across the world over attest to , and a far cry the lives of those he competed against . <p> " The key now is to try to get back to normal life and do n't let this guy ruin any more days for us , " said Dale One in the wake of the mass murders in Norway last year . " It 's a tragic event and we need to keep those who lost their lives in memory and in our hearts and truly not forget them . So right now , its important just to grieve together and support each other . " <p> The IOC an organisation with much to think about when it comes to its past and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tolerate women in sport and build their sporting structures in dubious ways that speak nothing of the fair play at the heart of the Olympic spirit demands that athletes keep politics out of Olympic sport during the two weeks of any Games . <p> There are sound arguments for that , yet there are times when the quiet adoption by role-model world-class athletes of a symbol , such as a cancer ribbon or coloured armband , can serve to bond the world together in common sentiment . Perhaps a small Norwegian flag and " Bergen " might appear on a ribbon in the pool this summer as a way of honouring Dale Oen in a way that claims back his flag and the name of his city in the light he shone on them . <p> Let his passing mark the last time the good symbols and names of Norway are used for darkness . <p> This Sunday as you say a prayer or spare a thought for Alex , world champion , cherished son , brother and teammate and the loved ones he left behind , extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man blind to the brotherhood of men and the human condition that binds us all , regardless of colour , creed , gender , preference and choice in life . <p> Spare a thought too next Tuesday for the Norway team , staff and swimmers , as they attend a memorial for their departed teammate in a service to be held by the Norwegian Seamen 's Church at the start of a long and painful wait to know the official cause of death . <h> Alex Dale Oen This Shall Not Ruin Our Days July 2011 <p> Those who died in tragic events in Norway may never know that Alex Dale Oen is a world champion who raced with compassion in his heart to honour those lost with a sports title across the world in Shanghai but those who remain to grieve and pick up the pieces back home will surely come to celebrate the swimmer as the true image of their country : dedicated , determined , hard-working and open to the challenges and wonders of this world . <p> Smart and likeable too .

In April she addressed the Labour Party conference and spoke about the right of people to aspire to a bright future . " We want the right to live in the best possible world , " she told delegates in a front of a slogan reading " Everybody Shall Come Together " . " We want openness , better work conditions and a better deal for pensioners , " she added . <p> One of Kristine 's last acts was to post a comment on the internet using her phone at 6pm on Friday evening before she set out to swim across the lake in what would turn out to be a futile bid to escape from Breivik .

It would have been easier to get the world record then but today I swam with my heart and not as strategically as I should have swum it . Sometimes you just need to let it go flat out .

Was there a psychological advantage to be had doing in achieving against the odds ? " Yes , definitely . Swimming in Norway is not a normal thing . It 's not common , " he laughs . <p> " We 're into skiing and winter sports . I definitely feel like the underdog and have to rise above it , " he added .

I did weights and gained a little muscle , a little too much . I was over back then . That 's a little bit heavy for breaststroke . " <p> It was March this year before he could do breaststroke again and get back into the water with all skills burning at his new programme in Oslo . " I think where we are now is pretty good considering the time we had . We Sondre been working really well together . If I can stay in good shape and not get sick in the next 12 months I 'll have a clear shot at it the Olympic crown . " <p> Sondre sees the champion in his charge , telling me : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really excellent . No matter what sport you talk about , across all sport , he is probably one of the most serious of athletes in the world and really works very hard , whether dry land or water . His ability to go into the box and focus and have triggers is really strong and good . For us as coaches he is a demanding guy . He makes us good . At the same time he 's a nice guy it does n't matter if you 're a great athlete if you 're not a nice person . " <p> Dale Oen does a hefty portion of his work on dry land when home in Oslo and even on race day . " Even now here we like to work on land 45mins in morning and before the competition for 20 minutes he does core strength work exercises and stretching , " says Sondre . " He will do weights right up to two days before the start of competition . Of course , not really hard or heavy but keeping it going . Normally , every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two with weights and does stretching after all his workouts . There is nothing magic about it but he 's not really fond of swimming a real lot all year so we try to mix it up but when he is in the water he does a lot of work and when we 're on training camps he is in the water a lot . " <p> Petter L ? , the performance head for Norway , notes that his team will travel to camps for two reasons : warm weather training in facilities and to harness the benefits of altitude preparation in places such as Flagstaff in the States . <p> Asked to name the strengths of the breaststroke ace , Solberg says : " Both in competition and training his ability to really keep himself highly motivated , really fired up but at the same time stay really relaxed . Technically , even though here he swam a little too much with his heart but we 're not going to talk to that right now he is really good . The other one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself when he 's supposed to . He 's a lot better than most athletes . " <p> Impossible to look away and ignore what Norway is dealing with , so how to handle emotion and distraction when there is a job to be done on the other side of the world ? <p> " We talk about it and when we are not in the pool we are on the internet and we talk to people at home and we watch TV a little bit , " said Solberg the turmoil in him more than tangible . " It 's an emotional roller-coaster . We 're so used to living in the safest country in the world . This kind of thing does n't happen . " <p> Dale Oen , like other members of his entourage , had handled himself with professional aplomb . " For him and for everybody its been really emotional , " said Solberg . " Its like when you 're at work , athletes have to be narrow-minded and go into a box when you have to work . He 's been using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something even stronger that the ability to focus . But its been really emotional for everybody . " <p> The coach broke the news to his family back home because he happened to be watching live news on the internet when the story broke and the first images of the bomb blast in downtown Oslo came through . <p> Our talk drifts back to the pool and Dale Oen 's voice drifts over the seat in front of us , Norwegian incomprehensible to me . The coach laughs and says : " He said ' do n't tell him everything ' . " Was he surprised that a world-class line up like that alongside Dale Oen in Shanghai today had been unable to cope , apparently stunned by the Norwegian 's opening speed ? Even Kitajima , a quadruple Olympic champion of 2004 and 2009 , was thrown off . <p> " Kosuke , yes , probably , " said . " Cameron Van Der Burgh and Fabio went faster than I thought they would . But yes , we certainly thought that Alex 's speed affected how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that Dale Oen did had told his rivals all they need to know about the potential of a man who can do even more damage as he aims to go one better than his 2008 silver come London 2012 . <p> Dale Oen and Van Der Burgh are good friends and have spent training and down time together . They 've shared some close calls too when out ion the wild of the wave . " I was on a rubber tube , being towed by a boat , and an orca killer whale came flying out of the water about away , " Van Der Burgh said describing one adventure the breaststroke aces shared . " It was close to us , and it was huge . I thought , ' this is it ' . " The competitive spirit in the pair lives on well beyond the pool , Van der Burgh topping the shark tale with another scary moment : in the Kruger Park with his family when he was 11 , a baboon jumped in through the car window and sat next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was huge . I remember it opening Tupperware and eating licorice . My dad eventually chased it out the car . " <p> Not used to chasing after the first , the South African found himself doing just that yesterday , Dale Oen a class apart from go to gold . There is another title on the horizon , of course . Could Solberg list the boxes that now need to be ticked on the way to another big race almost a year to the day ahead ? <p> " First of all , the perfect race : we know he can improve his start he lost three or four tenths on the start , his turns can improve , the pace can be better but then also making sure he has no injury and stays healthy and next year can probably be a better one than this one . " <p> To make sure that happen , down time away from the max intensity sets of the past four pause-less months of post-injury catch-up will be built into the blocks of work to be be endured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intensity of the past four months for a whole year , " said Solberg . " We want him to arrive in London in perfect shape . " <h> The Trial <p> * On 22 July 2011 , Anders Behring Breivik bombed government buildings in Oslo , killing eight people .

 will take place on October 17 , at the Greek Orthodox Church Conference Center in Oakland , California . <p> Coughlin has won 12 Olympic medals , including three gold and the 2004 and 2008 crowns over backstroke . She wrote an immortal line in swimming history in 2002 when she became the first women ever to swim inside over backstroke . In 2008 , she also became the first US woman swimmer to win six medals in the pool at one Olympic Games . <p> Coughlin photo : courtesy of Speedo has a total of forty-nine medals in major international competition , 22 gold , 17 silver , and 10 bronze spanning the Olympics , World and Pan Pacific Championships . <p> Beyond her own success in the pool , Coughlin was held up as a role model and queen motivator by members of a hugely successful US women 's team at the London 2012 Olympic Games . That role was highlighted by CAL teammates Dana Vollmer and Caitlin Leverenz when they spoke at the World Aquatics Development Conference in Sweden this year . <p> Ervin is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following a soaring shooting-star success as a teen Olympic champion at Sydney 2000 , the sprinter remains among the best in the world . <p> Joint Olympic free champion at 19 in Sydney back in 2000 and world and champion in 2001 , Ervin walked away from racing at 22 in February 2004 , his decision in Olympic season one of those that leaves question marks hanging heavy in the air . He said at the time : " I feel like that part of my life-as a over . I 'm moving on to new things , new goals , new ambitions . " <p> At 31 , he made good his comeback with a place on the 2012 US Olympic team for London . Ervin 's has been a fabulous journey of self-discovery . In an interview with AP 's Paul Newberry in 2012 , we learned that during his time out of the sport Ervin did n't live in any one place for more than nine months ; paid bills with swimming lessons and promoting concerts ; smoked and played guitar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to raise the money to pay the two months rent he owed . <p> Well-documented was Ervin 's 2004 auction of his Olympic gold medal : it raised for a tsunami disaster relief fund . <p> " At the time , I was very much in a mystical phase . I was kind of looking at my own accomplishments in swimming in a lot of ways as hubris , as some excessive pride , " Ervin told Newberry . <p> " It was right after Christmas when ( the tsunami ) happened . I was just watching on the news , at how many people died , just crushed by that element . I knew if I had the unfortunate luck of being there , no gold medal for swimming one lap would 've spared my life . I wanted to do something to reflect my own remorse , a way to kind of letting go of something for myself and , hopefully , through the process , trying to help in some way . But it was definitely a purging , like a cleansing for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he noted : " I was convinced the grass would be greener somewhere else . Or , at the least , if I did make the journey , that I would see the other side of that horizon , whatever was there . I think everybody 's got that to a certain degree . But I certainly had a lot of angst and resistance toward being pushed in the direction I had always been going . I really just needed freedom , so I took it . " <p> A gift for the profound was not granted to Ervin along his journey . He already had it . As Newberry notes : " Even now , he 's far more likely to bring up his favourite poets , or a parable in the Bible , than to discuss the finer points of his marvellous stroke . " <p> There are moments along the journalistic trail that stand out because of an act , a response , a deed or word that spill well beyond the sports arena and prompt deeper understanding . <p> Ervin can lay claim to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraction race for the United States , the first to win an Olympic swimming title and the first man , with teammate and Sydney 2000 roommate Gary Hall Jr. , to share one . <p> Racial stereotyping was thumped into context when Ervin , born of a three-quarters African-American father and a white Jewish mother , spoke beyond his years to say : <p> " I feel the labels , in a way , belittle who I am . I 'm proud to be black . I 'm proud of my Jewish heritage . I 'm proud of everything that makes me who I am . All of that makes me a unique person , just like anyone else . " <p> His uniqueness in a world where many are moulded by expectation and circumstance is reinforced by the journey that led him back to the elite , race pool . <p> " I think there was something quite distinct about the approach of my 30th birthday that made me come to terms with things , " Ervin told Newberry . <p> " Maybe , I thought , the cement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who I am and what I am and just try to just move forward . If I was wet cement before , now it 's dry and I 'm a boulder and I 'm going to start rolling downhill . " <p> Now an ambassador for FINIS , Ervin 's comeback has been about more than the 4x100m free silver he won in Barcelona last year or the two relay golds he claimed at World S/C Championships in 2012 , when his count included bronze in the free . A glimpse of the gold in his role in swimming could be seen on World Cup Tour last year , when Ervin served as mentor to the US junior squad as the next wave picked up valuable experience in international waters . <h> Why ' none

Kraemer <p> A little over 19,000 kilometres keep Barcelona and Auckland apart that 's around the distance covered in water over the past five years by two of the biggest names in women 's distance freestyle swimming . <p> The challenge between them is often as remote as the geography of their lives but when Spain 's Mireia Belmonte and New Zealand 's Lauren Boyle take to their blocks on Mare Nostrum week , starting in Monaco tomorrow , the challenge in the next lane will be closer than ever . <p> The two are embroiled in a 10-week pact of pain in Spain , at the CAR centre of excellence in Barcelona and up on high in the Sierra Nevada with coach Fred Vergnoux and teammates from a Catalan unit that includes Marc Sanchez , whose pace is another hare for Belmonte and Boyle to chase . <p> Belmonte Photo : Patrick B Kraemer and Boyle Photo : Ian Macnicol trained together last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to and their results at the World Championships in Barcelona suggesting that it might well be a good idea to repeat the exercise . <p> Smart move : in a world in which Katie Ledecky sets a sizzling , global all-time pace on distance freestyle at the infancy of a speed curve showing no signs of levelling off any time soon , finding ways to raise the bar on a daily basis is the only way to go . <p> tells SwimVortex : " Lauren came last year to train with us in altitude and this year she wanted to repeat the experience and extend her stay . The idea is to train together here at the national training centre , compete together , and then go to altitude together . It 's a longer phase of preparation that she wanted to do with us leading into the summer meets , and both parties agreed to arrange this long training camp .

The day Lauren arrived the training level went one step higher which is great for both of them and for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge involves a small step up in metres covered and " probably a lot more weights lifting " , noted . Asked how the daily head-to-head would help Belmonte and Boyle , the French coach said : <p> " I think in swimming we are still very conservative , certainly here we try to change this mentality and put the best swimmers training head to head on a regular basis . <p> " Having a swimmer like Lauren makes things even better . Raising the level of each training session , bringing positive attitude into the group , learning from each other in and out of the water , this should be done more often . " <p> Both will race Mare Nostrum in Monaco , Canet and Barcelona in the week ahead . Both will race in the full flight of training .

" <p> Not all situations in which world leaders are joined together for daily intensity will work but in this case , both swimmers are lapping it up . Belmonte says : <p> " I think her level of training is very good and this brings more competition to the daily routine . She is very professional and fits well into our program . " <p> Boyle , a class apart back home in training , adds : <p> " For me , it 's good to train with a group of high-class distance swimmers because they push me to do better in training and in return I also help them .

That 's a plus as far as the daily test goes , say the training partners , Belmonte noting : " It 's does n't affect me because we have each one a specific preparation for this summer . I would like to race Lauren in a main meet but at least we do it every day in training ! " <p> Boyle agrees : " I guess things are not as intense as it could be in training if we would race together this summer . " <p> And how do they communicate : , etc. , ? Says Vergnoux : <p> " A combo of everything ! But we make sure Lauren is working on her Spanish !

 Monaco <h> Day 1 finals <p> Germany 's Marco Koch , with a 2:08.43 national textile record in the breaststroke , and Japan 's Daiya Seto , with a 1:54.70 best in the butterfly produced efforts ahead of the season world No 1s in their respective events . Both were dominant and both left the pool this evening with world ranked No 2 swims under their belt . <p> On the first day of a tour that will take in Canet and then Barcelona by Sunday next week , Hungarian double medley World champion Katinka Hosszu was another who will dine with a smile on her face this evening in Monte Carlo . A 4:33.80 victory in the medley marked her season best on another day of multiple racing , with Britain 's Hannah Miley closest and near season best , on 4:35.73 . <p> There were also solid wins for Jeanette ( DEN ) , on a meet mark of 57.46 in the butterfly as Britain 's Jemma Lowe entered the world top 20 not far behind ; Ryosuke Irie ( JPN ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teammate Kanako Watanabe , on 1:07.28 just ahead of Rikke Pedersen ( DEN ) in the breaststroke ; a 48.67 from Olympic champion Nathan Adrian ( USA ) in the freestyle on a day of celebration for the Popov family ; Elizabeth Simmonds ( GBR ) , on 2:10.17 in the backstroke ; Laszlo Cseh ( HUN ) , on 1:59.87 in the medley ; and Myles Brown ( RSA ) , on in the freestyle . <p> The tour of three two-day events is a warm-up for the international long-course season showdowns , the times on the clock reflecting the different stages in which swimmers find themselves en route to the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow next month and the European Championships and Pan Pacific Championships , respectively in Berlin and the Gold Coast in Australia , in August . <p> Race reports <h> Men 's breaststroke Koch cooking up a cracking season <p> Marco Koch 's dominant 2:08.43 fell just shy of the German record he established back in shiny suit 2009 and ranks him 8th best all-time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards almost every time he races . This year alone he has produced three 2:08s , a 2:09 and three 2:12s . All in readiness for a home European Championships in Berlin come August . <p> Koch 's presence there is assured , while Michael Jamieson , the Olympic silver medallist for Britain at a home Olympics in 2012 , is likely to be there too , Britain set on taking a relatively small team of 12 elite medal hopes alongside a development squad to the German capital in the wake of Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games . <p> Given the gap in the preparation stages of Koch and Jamieson , not much point in reading too much into the result today . Nonetheless , much can be read into Koch 's 2:08.43 off splits of 29.56 ; 1:01.98 and 1:34.93 . There was clears intent and determination to lodge yet more consistent speed way ahead of the pace in his wake . <p> Jamieson , who leads the world rankings this year with the sole 2:08 effort , split 29.73 ; 1:03.02 and 1:37.02 on his way to silver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:12.78 , and Kohinata , on .

There were also sweets and other rubbish . " <p> Now , he eats nothing that does n't fuel athletic performance . Having been based at a national centre , Koch return to Darmstadt on the way to Barcelona 2013 world titles , exchanging perfect conditions and water temperatures for a keener challenge in terms of environment , one that he feels makes him tougher come the big occasion .

Out in 25.86 and on 56.23 at , Seto still had the company of Chad Le Clos ( RSA ) but that was as far as the race went . Down the third lap , Seto left those with heaviness in their arms behind .

On 1:56.91 in morning heats , she clocked 1:57.30 , which left her shy of the winning 1:57.17 of South Africa 's Karin Prinsloo .

I 'd love to see those progressions , but I wonder how much of the progression of the other strokes is in clean swimming speed , and how much must be attributed to turning and underwater skill improvement and rule changes . The increasing depth of field should push the times lower , but someone is going to need to break through on technique to overcome the inherit challenges resistance poses for the stroke . <p> June 22 , 2014 <p> He could be thinking short course .

 Vichy For French Open In Search Of Speed And A New Start <p> Roll up , roll up , place your bids : up for grabs , a Russian backstroke ace in prime condition and looking for a new nation to race for . This week offers a last chance to see Arkady Vyatchanin race in peak condition at the French Open in Vichy , the meet the highlight of one more summer in which the Olympic medallist is locked out of international championship waters because he called a halt to racing for Russia in a row with the federation there after the London 2012 Olympic Games . <p> trains with the Gators in Florida under the guidance of coach Gregg Troy but races for the New York Athletic Club , the club that sponsors him and the colours of which he will wear in Vichy from Friday to Sunday this week at one of the aquatic highlights of the summer . <p> Standing tall , Vyatchanin cuts an impressive figure on the deck . He 's no less impressive when he hits the water , his treasury including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as world and European honours galore . <p> At the start of this season , despite one potential switch of country not having worked out , had not abandoned hopes of racing for a new country come the World s/c Championships in doha in December but so far that looks like a remote possibility , the process of communication required between swim nations old and new not yet having started . <p> is determined to race at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games , while the 2015 World Championships in Kazan , Russia , in 2015 would be an obvious starting point for any championship start under a new flag in long-course racing given that this summer is already lost . <p> As his time at the gators started to pay dividends some months ago , told SwimVortex in an interview with John Lohn : " Since I 've started to feel that ( I was getting ) back in shape , I became more confident about what I 'm doing as an athlete . Now is the time when I am just enjoying the whole process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder than ever . <p> " And I 'm pretty sure that all the work I 'm doing now will pay off at the end of the season , and , of course , in Rio . " <p> Vichy may not mark the literal end of Vyatchanin 's 2014 long-course season but in terms of peak moments against weighty international opposition , the French Open will be the highlight and the last showcase for the Russian to show just why he would be a useful aquatic asset for any nation . <p> In the US , he has no shortage of competition from those vying for places on a national team that boasts a backstroke score among men second to none in international waters . In Vichy , Vyatchanin will have for company French aces Camille Lacourt and Jeremy Stravius , both men with world titles in their treasuries , over 50 and , and Germany 's Jan-Philip and Christian Diener , Britain 's Joe Patching over . Russia has a team in Vichy that includes Ol ; silver medallist in the butterfly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists are there to take on Vyatchanin . <p> Nations with solid strength in the backstroke this year ( the US 's show of strength yet to come ) : Japan , China , Australia , Hungary and Poland all have men inside 1:57 , Russia with two , 's 1:55.30 season best comparing with a 1:56.97 from Andrey Shabasov at the helm of Russians still racing for Russia . Italy , Germany , Lithuania all have men this season , while Chad le Clos is first among South Africans in that club . <p> That leaves a vast number of nations with good reason to wish to tap into the benefits Vyatchanin could bring . Alternatively , Vladimir Salnikov , he of towering free status in the 1980s with two Olympic golds and an historic first swim to his name forever more , might polish his fed president 's badge , pop round the deck , say the hardest word and suggest a new start with mutual respect as the guiding light to doing the right thing , regardless of where fault may rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to play a key role in ensuring that Vyatchanin finds a new aquatic home . <p> If there is one thing the guardians of the sport can do to serve it is to be bigger than the barrier before them and take such things in their stride knowing that the only thing that matters in such situations is seeing a world-class athlete back in action . <h> Comments <p> deserves the last two paragraphs become true . He is such a great person in the life and an amazing athlete in the pool that it 's not fair to him and people miss his best years . <p> Cayley Guimar ? es July 1 , 2014 <p> It is a shameful situation that has been going on way too long ! Mr. is the nicest person . He is also a swimmer of incredible technique and valor : he should not be forced into such awful predicament . <p> I disagree : his situation should not be resolved " ... regardless of where fault may rest " . Mechanisms should be put in place in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albeit the most important ones : THE ATHLETES . <p> We owe it to Mr. , and each and every athlete who has been , in any sort of way , disrespected by governing bodies . And yes , I am saying that the fault lies with the russian federation , as it is often the case around the world and throughout history that of federations which do not have the athlete 's best interest in their actions . <p> Mr. is being made to pay the price for being honest , and for speaking up and stand for his rights ! This oppression should not be tolerated . <p> I apologize for my excessive " pamphlet " in this forum not for nothing , mostly because , as of right now , I do n't have any suggestions to make on how to go about changing this situation . <p> But I strongly believe that it is way past time that we spoke against this , and took some actions ! <p> Craig Lord July 1 , 2014 <p> Cayley , I understand your frustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be what is called for if Arkady is to enjoy a good outcome . The revolution you suggest is one in which other federations and people who carry weight in the sport would have to raise the issue , take it to the Russian federation and call for a solution to be found , asap . That has not happened and will not happen . I think ' fan power ' a limited force in swimming when it comes to changing the sport for the better . Olympic sports are run , to some extent , as closed shops . Pressure from athletes and coaches and media ( and federations when they find the courage to find their voice not often these days have often been the more effective tool when it comes to forcing change and halting bad practice . Your last two sentences sum it up well : many feel that something ought to happen ... but what and how and how to make it happen at a time when , beyond doping ( and even then there is a weakness of response ) , few if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to speak out as Russia prepares to host the world in Kazan . The best course would be to do what Arkady is doing : searching for a way to return to intl waters . Who is out there to give this world-class athlete a home ? There are more than 200 FINA member nations . It ca n't be that hard ( for someone to step forward ... ) . <p> July 1 , 2014 <p> I think if Arkady wants to , one of those rich persian gulf countries would be willing to offer him nationality to represent . <p> July 1 , 2014 <p> Seems like he 's been wanting to go to a competitive swim power and not just take a Gulf-style paycheck , hence the interest in gaining US citizenship even though that can be a pretty painful and long process . <p> If he 's willing to meet residency requirements , Australia as a whole has a pretty reasonable two year process ( six months physically spent in Australia ) for elite athletes to gain a passport there . IIRC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . <p> I 've seen speculation for him to go to South Africa because he 'd fill a hole in their program , but their federation and its financial difficulties ca n't really afford him unless his got picked up by a private company . <p> rafael July 1 , 2014 <p> Beach Brazil would need him for a gap and the federation has the money for it <p> Cayley Guimar ? es July 1 , 2014 <p> Thank you Craig . I just needed to " vent out " my frustration . <p> Craig Lord July 1 , 2014 <p> I can well understand how you feel , Cayley <p> Dave July 1 , 2014 <p> Someone get this man American citizenship , stat . Probably not going to happen , but we 'd be honored to have him . By all accounts a class act and clearly one hell of a backstroker . <p> July 1 , 2014 <p> Alas , it would take a literal act of Congress , and while that used to be possible for figure skaters ( pairs &amp; dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much put a stop to rush American citizenship for elite athletes . IIRC , they tried for Vlad Morozov before London 2012 but it got nowhere in DC . <p> Josh July 1 , 2014 <p> I know he 's looking for the US or a European country . He 's looking beyond his swimming career at someplace he can live and safely raise children when he and his wife are ready to start a family . <p> I think he should look at Malta . They were at one point trying to sell EU citizenship to virtually anyone who wanted it for 650k Euros , so they obviously have a fast track procedure , and we 're talking about an athlete who is on the fringe of Olympic medals again and would bring swimming acclaim to a small island nation in the Mediterranean , so they might be willing to part with one of those passports for free . <p> I also told him that even though he 's looking at Europe and the US mainly , that he should also look at Costa Rica .

Unfortunately , they would not speed up the process ( even though there were quite a few Senators and Representatives who did their best . Once the bid failed , he went to the normal process and eventually gained his citizenship . One can only wonder how much faster his 49.4 world record set in a horrible pool in Philadelphia , would have been in the state-of-the-art Montreal pool . Arkady only has so much left in his body and NOW would be the most opportune time to give him every opportunity to show what he can do . I hope the best for him .

 the French Open in Vichy on Saturday evening is an obvious draw : France 's 2012 Olympic champion Florent Manaudou versus Brazil 's 2008 Olympic champion and reigning World champion Cesar Cielo . Out of the smoke and mirrors of a mid-season race that will surely have a touch of end-season about it ( given the timing of events for the top two protagonists in a year without a global long-course gathering ) , we can expect statements from both speedsters . <p> This season , the virtual gap is 21.39 to 21.70 in Cielo 's favour , while efforts of 21.32 for the Brazilian and 21.34 for the Frenchman 's triumph in 2012 mark the best two times ever . <p> It is down that way they may go at the weekend but before they do , they have a fight of a different nature on their plates come Friday evening at a meet that boasts a galaxy of stars . Among them is Australia 's James Magnussen Photo : arena , testing himself for a last time before rejoining battle with teammate Cameron McEvoy at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world record over at 46.91 but , with all due respect , we can set that aside , the reality of two-lap speed in 2008 and all the more so 2009 part of a book of statistics that blows to smithereens any suggestion of a sport rapidly catching up with the artificial fast-forward driven by shiny suits banned from January 1 , 2010 . <p> Take this lot : <p> half of the top 20 all-time swims ( one entry per swimmer , the performances stats grimmer still ) are from 2009 <p> three-quarters of the top 20 all-time swims are from 2008-09 <p> of the top 50 all-time swims belong to 2009 <p> of the top 100 all-time swims belong to 2008-09 <p> For those tempted to say ' so what ' , here are the percentages of swims that remained in the all-time 100 three and four years on over each passing Olympic cycle in the past quarter of a century : <p> 1988 ; 89 1992 : <p> 1992 ; 93 1996 : <p> 1996 ; 97 2000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 01 2004 : <p> 2004 ; 05 2008 : ( another blip as the LZR kicked in ) <p> 2008 ' 09 2012 : ( the bomb drops ) <h> The A Game Of Two Halves In Vichy <p> So , back to Vichy and the thrill of a in which the man who has made by far the greatest impact on shiny suit dominance on the all-time rankings : James Magnussen . <p> On a list of the best 100 performances ever , shiny stuff included , that ends at 47.92 , the Australian world champion has 15 entries . Strip away what is no longer allowed and you get a stronger sense of the bombastic nature of a Missile on a Mission : 12 of the best 20 all-time are his three of them from this year and topped by the 47.59 at which he heads the current world rankings . <p> Magnussen has set a pioneering pathway down which others are determined to follow and , if they can , catch him and even pass him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted most is American Nathan Adrian , on 47.52 when Magnussen came home inn 47.53 in the fight in London , both efforts majestic . This year , Cameron McEvoy stepped off the frame and into the picture with a 47.65 at Aussie nationals that kept Magnussen at bay for the first time in home waters in battle proper since 2010 on the cusp of a breakthrough for a towering teenage prospect . <p> Of the top three in Vichy , Magnussen takes to his blocks favourite but he is also the only man who faces a big championship test within the month , the Commonwealth Games and McEvoy looming on the Glasgow horizon . <p> For Manaudou photo : Speedo , the French Open offers a chance to show where his workload has taken him over the past several months , with almost two months to go before he faces his top test of the year at the European Championships in Berlin . <p> For Cielo Photo : Craig Lord , Vichy is the big blast of his long-course season this year , making the show ahead all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave France on top in the free and ' fly , his two world-title events . Those are clearly his priorities . There is much talk of the being more about the Brazil 4x100m come Rio and while that target is undoubtedly a big one , personal pride as world-record holder may contribute to his first drive into the 47s since 2012 . <p> Any such swim will challenge the might of Magnussen , part of the suspense the way in which any race between men of soaring but quite different sprint skills will pan out . Cielo and Manaudou have the sharpest opening speed , Magnussen the back end fit to mow then down , in the balance a subtle realm in which the sprinter must be at one with the water for best effect . <p> Magnussen , coached by Brant Best at SOPAC in Sydney , has a magnificent 18 efforts to his credit , each swim a dress rehearsal and most of those swims a reminder of just how stunning that 47.10 from 2012 truly was and is . <p> Vichy this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blocks with him in Glasgow towards the end of the month . Last month , he told reporters : <p> " The French Open probably got me through worlds last year . I bombed out again in relays at worlds but the confidence I got from the French Open gave me self-belief for the rest of the week at worlds . " <p> At the time , he noted that he would like to get a half-second off the 47.83 he swam at nationals come the European summer . Summer is here . Says Magnussen : <h> Comments <p> I will be surprised if Cielo does a 47 in will put James first with Florent second . I am curious to see if Florent can go to the same shape when he made that 45.0 in SCM last year.That was a serious speed much better than his 48.4 in LCM . <p> Jaki July 1 , 2014 <p> I do n't expect to see such a battle ... <p> My pronostics : <p> 1 Magnussen 47.4 ( as always , his best coming when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manaudou 48.8 ( probably still preparing the European champs ) ... 7 Cielo 49.6 ( because he will focus on the 50 free and give a blasting 21.4 ! ! ! ? ? <p> I hope i 'll be wrong and that we 'll have an epic battle ! ? ? <p> rafael July 2 , 2014 <p> cielo went 21.39 already and on the same meet went 48.1 <p> Craig Lord July 2 , 2014 <p> Jaki , I think you 'll be somewhat wide of the mark , one way or another <p> Jaki July 2 , 2014 <p> Rafael , i know , i just feel like he was more focused on his Brasil champs than on the French open ... <p> Craig , yeah that 's kind of a crazy anti-logic 50-100 perf , so i 'll change my bet and say he will go 49.2 and 21.8 , to be more realistic <p> But still expecting a high lead from Magnussen on the 100 ...

 56.50 over two laps ' fly and now 53.03 on freestyle in Boras this week , raced in a range we have come to associate with her excellence . <p> Talking to Maria Wallberg of STV Sports , coach Carl Jenner said that Sjostrom 's " was very good ... but she was tired both mentally and physically . She 's only been under three times " . <p> He noted that Sjostrom had watched the film of her world-record butterfly a few times . It 's not every day you break a world record , he added with a smile . <p> The coming week would be intense , not least of all because of the publicity and interest generated by a world mark but Jenner was hoping to keep things on track in readiness for Sjostrom 's next challenge , at the Portuguese Open in Jamor from July 23 to July 27 , coinciding with the Commonwealth Games and Australian Cate Campbell 's first big international stand of the season . <h> Sarah Sjostrom In Her Own Words <p> From the Swedish Nationals 2014 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader Marcus : <p> J : The in Bor ? s is over and Sarah Sj ? str ? m , you finish the week as you started it with yet another gold medal , this time in freestyle .

I have to do it in the semi-finals as the fly is just after the freestyle and there you have a little of the problem as there is less than 10 minutes between the races .

Not almost a second at play , of course . <p> The truth is , we must take all such speculation with a pinch of salt for we have no idea where reason rests . We can say for sure that the Swedish sprinter , clearly in the form of her life , benefited hugely from a head-down no-breath dash , a fabulously flat technique and a high rate of stroke turnover yesterday . We can also say that she is well known for world-class speed in mid-season meets , and that her 53 flat victory today confirmed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25.92 , Sjostrom , S ? dert ? rns Sims ? , came home in 27.11 .

As in the realm of the best men , balance is key .

The bronze went to Josefin Lindkvist , V ? sby Sims ? , in 56.38 . <p> Sjostrom , meanwhile , is enjoying the fastest and most diverse season of her life , with bests in five events : <p> 23.98 free world textile record <p> 52.73 free <p> free <p> 4:06.04 free <p> 24.43 butterfly <p> The one that is still to be cracked is the 56.06 in shiny suit for the world record and gold at the Rome 2009 shiny suits circus , two efforts of 56.50 from Sjostrom this year at the helm of the world rankings so far .

A review of the coach 's suitability to work with children by the Queensland Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian led to him being issued a negative notice in 2009 . <p> Volkers was subsequently offered the role of head coach with Swimming Queensland and appealed the commission 's decision to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal in April 2010 , the commission heard . <p> A month later the tribunal ruled that it " is satisfied the applicant conducted himself inappropriately and not protectively with young women ... and he poses an unacceptable risk to children " . <p> The commission subsequently wrote to Swimming Queensland notifying the swimming body that it had received reports that Volkers had continued to work with young swimmers on overseas trips . <p> Some months later , The Australian reports , Swimming Queensland 's then-executive director , Kevin Hasemann , wrote to the coach to notify him that he wanted to " ensure that we comply fully with the commission 's advice at all times ...

 , on his way to a home Commonwealth Games in Glasgow and a shot at gold in the breaststroke that would mark one of the highlights of the next two weeks of competition , Michael Jamieson has been sending out tweets backing his belief that cheating in swimming is rife . <p> The Olympic silver medallist spoke openly to reporters in Glasgow yesterday and when asked if he believed it possible to say that all alongside him this week would be racing clean replied : " I do n't think anyone can . " <p> Jamieson , 25 , has tweeted the names of some substances such as thyroxine that he believes are being prescribed by doctors for particular conditions even when the athlete does not need the substance for a medical complaint . The drugs are developed for sick people not all of whom can then get access to the medicine but then used by some to enhance performance in sport . <p> Jamieson labelled swimming " the new track and field " and has raged against the Russian programme and its 16 positives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championships in Kazan next year provided that one more of its swimmers is not caught cheating by FINA testers , if two pending cases lead to suspensions . If four cases are caught by FINA or agents of the international federation in a calendar year , that nation must be suspended for two years under FINA rules . <p> Suspension comes with the requirement of other members not to engage with the suspended nation . The World Championships would have to be moved . Of the 14 Russian cases on the books , just one that of Yulia Efimova , the biggest case of all fits the category of " caught by FINA " . Cases reported by RUSADA , the Russian anti-doping agency , do not count towards the " " rule . <p> Jamieson has highlighted the number of athletes diagnosed with thyroid deficiencies : for genuine patients is also being used to cheat in sport , he claims . <p> Go back 15 years and Jamieson would not have been rare , outspoken coaches and swimmers to be found at every meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its most obvious from China back then and in the wake of the woe of the GDR and subsequent revelations and cases such as that of Michelle Smith , the Irish swimmer suspended for manipulating a doping test sample . <p> Today , is relatively rare , coaches and swimmers often shy of saying anything that might suggest that fellow competitors are cheating . Jamieson will " not stop shouting for the rest of my career " if that is what it takes to clean up the mess , he says , telling reporters : <p> " So many people avoid talking about it and I do n't know why because it 's an issue that affects all sports . I do n't know the count for Russia but it 's something like 16 swimmers serving bans and that speaks for itself . I 'm one of the few who tries to make people aware of it because I 'm not uncomfortable speaking about it . " <p> Jamieson did not believe that swimming was at the level of cheating to be found in some other sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing in the towel was the only appropriate action : <p> " I do n't think swimming is at that level yet , although some other sports may be . It 's not something in my mind constantly . When I leave this room I wo n't go away thinking , ' I hope everyone in my race is clean ' . It 's just an underlying aspect not enough athletes are willing to talk about . " <h> World Record In Sights <p> Jamieson , coached by Dave McNulty in Bath , told the media on the eve of the Games that the world mark of 2:07.01 set by Japan 's Akihiro Yamaguchi in the autumn of 2012 at a low-key moment in domestic waters , is , with gold , his target in Glasgow . Said Jamieson : <p> " I 've woken up for training every morning with the world-record time on my alarm clock.It 's the first thing I see when I wake up . Psychologically , that 's what I 'm aiming for . It 's a target and I hope I get there this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on doping <p> All of this on a day when David Millar , the cyclist once done for doping and turned advocate for anti-doping , talks to WADA of his moral obligation to pay back on the eve of racing at the Commonwealth Games among these athlete testimonials in support of anti-doping , including one from Frankie Frederiks who says : " ... as athletes we really have to come together and make sure our voices are ... " : <p> Comment : Bravo Michael Jamieson , who calls it right when he says that not enough athletes are prepared to speak out when they see obvious problems and let those cheating know that they are not welcome in the pool . The issue goes well beyond the athlete , of course : athletes are told by federations and team officials not to get involved in controversy and to ' only speak to their own races ' . <p> The lessons learned through a sour history , including doping soaked days of the GDR and China , appear to have fallen on deaf ears among those who lead teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have no connection to the consequences : only pressure from coaches and athletes through the media forced change for the better in the past . Change will not come through silence among those who truly own the sport , coaches in it for life and athletes passing through , a few either for themselves or under the control of others prepared not only to make sure they win at all costs but also ensure that you lose , no matter how hard you work , no matter how talented you may be . <h> Comments <p> Mike Whittaker July 28 , 2014 <p> Michael Jamieson does n't know what he is talking about . Taking thyroxine or liothyronine when you have normal thyroid function is detrimental to performance . The hormone level that gives maximum performance is that provided by a normal healthy thyroid .

 Of Mourning In The Netherlands , A Time Of Deep Sorrow <p> The first tranche of victims from Flight MH17 , shot down by a missile , lands in The Netherlands today in a city well know to the world of swimming for very different reasons . <p> Forty bodies in two aircraft arrive in Eindhoven . The world turns and on a day of celebrations elsewhere as Scotland welcomes the Commonwealth to their Games at at Opening Ceremony and swimmers prepare for racing tomorrow , a part of the wider aquatic family , so many of them associated with or living in Eindhoven , face a very different day . <p> Swimming and the Commonwealth Games is many worlds apart from the woeful , sorrowful loss of life aboard a flight that set out to deliver happy folk to holiday destinations . It is a small world , however , and from head coach to Australia , Jacco Verhaeren , to the people he knows and worked with back at home in Eindhoven , this day is one of deep sorrow . The Australian team has already held a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In The Netherlands , the country with the highest number of casualties , including whole families of mother , father and children , this is a national day of mourning . <p> Members of the Dutch swimming community will be among those mourning today . Our thoughts are with them . Wherever you are , stop for a moment to pay respect for those lost and those left to bear the pain . Pray , too , that beyond those directly responsible , those who sell such weapons in the world work hard to close their own market in recognition of their role in the passing of lives we mourn today . <p> We extend our deepest sympathies . <p> It is , under such circumstances , easy to offend without intending to . As such , in the coming days we will avoid referring to nicknames given to sprinters such as James Magnussen in our coverage of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow <p> US author Joshua 
 Glasgow <h> Day 2 Finals <h> Women 's breaststroke <p> The second dash final of the evening , the women 's breaststroke , saw Australian Leiston Pickett keep the crown she won in Delhi four years ago . Her 30.59 pipped a 30.67 by Jamaican Alia Atkinson , Corrie Scott , of Scotland , taking bronze in 30.75 , fighting all the way to the wall . <p> Atkinson had a tangible edge for much of the way but in the last of the race tightened a touch as Pickett continued to flow . The Australian champion once more said : <p> " It has certainly been an interesting 12 months , missing the team last year was a pretty big blow but I learned a lot from it . It 's really good to get back on the top . " <p> Asked if she had expected to win , Pickett replied : " Definitely not seeing how quick Alia went in that semi ( a Games record of 30.49 ) . One of the biggest things I learned in London was that it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semis , it is the race it comes down to . That is what I have been thinking in the last 24 hours , it is what you do on the day that counts . " <h> Atkinson The Pathfinder <p> Silver for Atkinson made her a pathfinder not only for Jamaica but for black women as the most successful woman for her nation and colour since it all started back in 1934 at the Empire Games . <p> Atkinson 's presence in the pool transcends her athletic excellence . The will feature in documentary being made by the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Florida , where she works as a Special Projects Director . The work is aimed at promoting swimming to parents and children . Atkinson is the poster girl for a colouring book " Water Safety for Kids " by artist Kimberly Peterson . <p> " Drowning accidents occur too frequently , " said Atkinson . " They are always tragic and the grief we experience through the loss of a loved one is barely diminished by the passing of time . Whether the victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact on family and relatives is devastating . " <p> She added : " Growing up on the island of Jamaica , surrounded by some of the most beautiful beaches in the world , my parents felt that not only was learning to swim important for keeping me safe from drowning , but that the ability to swim would also provide me a lifelong passport to a world of recreational pleasures and employment possibilities on a planet that is mostly made of water . " <p> Atkinson tied with her namesake , Janelle Atkinson ( no relation ) , as the best-placed Jamaican swimmer by finishing fourth just beyond the medals at London 2012 in the breaststroke . Four years ago in Delhi , her ambition was " just to make final " . Now she has overtaken Janelle Atkinson , who claimed two bronze medals on freestyle in 2002 , in Commonwealth waters .

 of the swimming at the Commonwealth Games and Australia are starting to build up the solid advantage expected of them . Even so , today was a struggle for the powerhouse , England panning for gold in two events that had a green and gold stamp all over them coming into the meet . <p> In one it was a case of exit Christian Sprenger via the knock of an injury . But in both case it was also very much a case of enter Fran Halsall and Adam Peaty . Here are two sprinters coached by former athletes who excelled for Britain and England within the last decade but have since found a vocation in shaping the next wave . <p> Halsall is guided at Loughborough by world breaststroke champion of 2003 James Gibson , while Peaty is thriving in the program run in Derby by Mel Marshall , a seven-times medal winner at Melbourne 2007 and , like Gibson , familiar with what it feels like to race in an Olympic final . <p> The link with the past is strong : both Gibson and Marshall learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and presence of Australian Bill Sweetenham , who also formed the Smart Track squad of young talent that included Halsall from the get-go . Marshall and Gibson swam on the same Olympic and World Championship teams and have lived through highs and lows along the way , their careers just overlapping with the days when Halsall was a thrilling teen prospect on her way to the big pond . Peaty knows his coach only as that a coach . <p> If the five girls chosen back in 2004 for Smart Track and who remain in the world top 20 to this day Halsall atop the lot today speak fondly of Sweetenham , then Gibson , too , is happy to note the steer than helped and the things he thinks might be done better . <p> He has learned from a variety of different people , approaches and angles and believes he has drawn on the most helpful aspects of a number of programs to improve his ability as a coach . His time in France and Marseilles was invaluable . <p> When head coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , it was a mantra that both Gibson and Marshall could happily subscribe to one helpful to their hard-working charges . <p> Take this little gem from Halsall today : <p> " I was talking to my coach before hand it 's the first time in a while that I felt I had a really good preparation going into a major competition and that really helped with my confidence . And he said before I went to the call room : ' Fran , it 's a choice whether you want to win or not in those last five metres . You 've got to choose the right decision and I think I made the right decision tonight . " <p> Part of the approach to building sprinters in France , says Gibson , is to take a steady , long-term line , honing skills , building the beast . Halsall in some regards has been dismantled and rebuilt , the excellent grounding she had left in place , the baggage of knuckles and bruises along the way discarded in the process . <p> On an evening that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ability and potential , she was invited to explain some of the things that up to difference and replied to Liz Byrnes of SwimVortex : <p> " I 've been doing a hell of a lot of gym this year . My strength gains have been the best they have ever been this year so I am putting a lot more power through the water so I knew I should be capable of swimming faster and I need to keep on that route . " <p> There is also psychology . On her parade around the pool , a lady breezed down to the barrier , exchanged a few words with Halsall , smiled , hugged and then melted back into the crowd . <p> " I work with a lady called Sarah from Steve Peters ' group and she is really good with me , " explained Halsall . " She helps me get in the right places of being because I am not the sort of person who shies away from a race , I am someone who gets over-excited and wants to over-try rather than be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . <p> " Sarah reels me back in a bit and makes sure I am in the right mental place before I race to not get over-excited . She has sorted me out over the last couple of years . " <p> As Gibson would have it : block by block , step by step . <p> Not an easy journey , sometimes . " It was really tough , " said Halsall . " Last year going into Worlds I wanted to prove to myself that I can compete with the best in the world and that was a real challenge for me . That was really very tiring for me mentally that summer . " She claimed Britain 's only medal at Barcelona , a bronze in the freestyle . <p> " This year I have a lot more confidence going into this meet . James has been fantastic with me . Everything he has done , he gets me understands me very well . When we talk , we discuss things very well , I give my angle , he gives his , he usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way ! " <p> And she would n't have it any other way : " This is a great stepping stone . " <p> The victory ceremony for the freestyle was delayed so that Halsall could get ready for the semi of the butterfly , in which she set another Games record in yet another British record 25.36 . <p> It might have been better but for the fact that her hot pants had failed her : <p> " My heated pants switched off so I was a bit chilly so it was all a bit to go . I 've got a nice pair of heated pants to keep me warm and toasty . " <p> She added : " So , yes , it was a bit chaotic but two best times in an evening , I ca n't ask much more than that . And how special the crowd were getting behind me , cheering and that . It 's been an amazing evening , one that will definitely stay with me for a very long time . " <p> " Excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freestyle . With free I have to get a bit more aggressive and work it a bit more . With fly I 've got to stay relaxed . The more I relax and enjoy it , the faster I seem to swim on fly . I 've got to make sure I chill out , enjoy the 100 freestyle in the morning first and after that see how the 50 fly goes .

 of a controversy over entries to the Para-sports events in Glasgow , Scotland 's First Minister Alex Salmond sent the nation 's best wishes to the Commonwealth Games host country on Twitter when he wrote : " Congrats to Scotland 's youngest-ever Commonwealth Games competitor Davies winning a brilliant Bronze . " <p> Davies is 13 . Her coach at Dolphins , Lorraine Gifford , believes the race in the Para-Sport breaststroke SB9 will serve as a stepping stone for making the cut for the Paralympic Games in Rio in 2016 . <p> Gifford told PA : " I was screaming at the telly . I 'm known for being pretty loud but I 'm sure she could hear me . I started coaching when she was eight . I did some lessons with her before . She still does a lot of able-bodied meeting for us .

 star in her own right : Bronte Campbell matched the program of sister 's Cate Photo : Craig Lord <p> At shortly before 11.20 this morning Bronte Campbell 's hand touched the wall as she ensured Australia booked their spot in the final of the 4x100m medley relay . The split : 53.47 . <p> It concluded her maiden Commonwealth Games campaign while also underlining Australia 's abundance of riches in women 's freestyle . For most teams , a Bronte is a talent that comes along rarely , one that if she were to sneeze , the country would shudder . However , Australia are in the other-worldly position of being able to swim Bronte in a heat because they can race the freestyle world champion in the final . In the shape of older sister Cate . <p> Bronte has long been in Cate 's shadow , which the elder alluded to last night after they made more history by claiming gold and silver in the freestyle . <p> Cate paid tribute when she acknowledged that when the pair were growing up , Campbell the younger was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sister . " <p> When Cate made the Olympic team in 2008 , it was double-edged for Bronte . On the one hand there was immense pride in her sister , who at 15 was two years her senior . On the other hand , she was marginalised by some who overlooked her while heaping praise on Cate . Insensitive at the best of times but exacerbated when Bronte had just entered her early teens with everything that entails . She too was in training as intense as her sister 's . <p> In an interview for Arena Water Instinct , Bronte said : " Definitely Cate got a lot faster a lot younger than I did : I made my first team at 17 which was two years later than Cate had made her first team . <p> " There were people who would look at that and compare the two and say if Bronte has n't made it by the time she is 15 she is probably not going to make it . Luckily I had my family and my coach ( Simon Cusack ) was adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share some genetic material we are completely different . " <h> The Need To Pin Success On Self Not Sister <p> Said Bronte Photo , with Cate , left , by Patrick B. Kraemer : " With the help of my coach I managed to separate the two of us and not try and pin my success on what Cate 's done . Which is a very good thing because people now ask me are you ever going to beat Cate ? I have come second to her so many times . The answer is I do n't know whether I am going to beat her and it does n't matter whether I do or do n't . " <p> Cate has long tipped Bronte to be the one to go on to long-term success and last night was a step forward in the freestyle . She came back in the final with each stroke , finishing just 0.18 adrift in 52.86 although she has yet to watch the race back . It was her maiden voyage under the mark with the pair embracing over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Excitedly , she rang home to Queensland but her mother was out coaching her swimming squad . A reminder of the ongoing commitment of the woman who the pair have referred to as " Superwoman " . <p> It was Bronte 's third medal of the meet so far . There was a gold medal and world record in the 4x100m freestyle relay on the opening night , third behind Fran Halsall and Cate in the freestyle as well as last night 's silver . If Australia win tonight , she will get another gold as a member of the quartet who made it possible . <p> Tonight , Bronte will don the war paint and shout on the team from the stands before taking a little time to digest what has happened in Glasgow : <p> " It has been a great meet : I did n't expect to be doing PBs pretty much event I 've been in . It started out with a world record and I 've been doing PBs since then . I definitely did n't expect that and I am going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , savour the moment while it 's there and then get ready for Pan Pacs . " <p> Team spirit had been important to her , a return to a mantra of all for one and one for all from the days of Grant Hackett , an approach that will go a long way to exorcising the ghosts of 2012 . " It 's been really relaxed , a lovely team environment , the most relaxed I 've been in an international meet and that has shown , " said Bronte Photo : with Aussie media officer Lachlan Searle in Glasgow today , by Craig Lord <p> There is a long way to go in this story . While the Games have been a personal triumph for Bronte , there are bigger ships on the horizon . She echoes what has often been heard from Cate , coach Simon Cusack and Australia head coach Jacco Verhaeren : this is about striving for perfection and squeezing out every single drop of potential until there can be no more improvement . Says Bronte : <p> " That is why we race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always this illusion of perfection you are chasing and you always believe there is something better and that is why you race , that is why you train . If I did n't believe I could get better then I 'd stop . As soon as I believe I ca n't be better I 'm going to stop racing . " <p> She unknowingly deferred to her sister this morning when she described Cate 's programme as " much bigger than mine " . When questioned why that would be the case given they had the same programme she took a moment before pointing to Cate 's burden of expectation : <p> " We are doing the same events but Cate has a lot more pressure on her . She also had a spectacular swim in the relay and she did a spectacular 50 as well . So she has definitely had a huge week , a lot to deal with for her . It 's a lot easier to be the hunted than the hunter . Everyone 's watching Cate and I get to fly under the radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the same time , Bronte is still learning from her big sister , benefiting from what Cate had to find out for herself , an advantage of being a younger sibling . <p> " Cate is very professional . Everything she does is to prepare for the next race and just take it one step at a time , that is something I have really learned from her , " says Bronte . " To focus on the next one and then the next one and the next one : just go through the rounds and see how far you can go . It 's been really great to watch her . She helps me out , she reminds me to take food with me , that 's a big thing remembering to eat enough food , so she has been really great helping me out . " <h> Under the Wing Of Cate <p> " She definitely is very protective , " says Bronte of Cate when asked about sibling relationships .

 raced his last Commonwealth race and how much easier to handle pain when driven by the knowledge that there would never be another moment quite like this , no more a time when he would be able to seize the day in quite the same way wherever he may go when his racing days are done . <p> Glasgow glory will be something to look back on , count the blessings of being a member of a Canada team on the rise once more , and know he could have given no more : " When it started to get hard at about I kept telling myself this is one of your last chances to have a kick at this race . It could be really hard or shocking when you start to count down the races you have left . That said I think I used it to my benefit this time . " <p> Cochrane , coached by Randy Bennett , is not done yet , his target Rio , an Olympic rising up the aerial via the 2015 World Championships . By the time he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him a model of consistency . What did that mean to him ? <p> " Consistency is always wanting to be the best in the world and I think I 've been chasing that dream for a lot of years . I 've been really proud of my results here to show I can keep getting better even though I am in my mid-20s . I know when I started getting on the national team they said ' at 21 that is pretty much where you 'll peak ' and so it is exciting to see how far the event has gone in the past six years and how much further I can go with my career . " <h> The Art Of Keeping Pace With The Next Wave <p> There is no gain in trying to control what happens in the next lane not going to happen . The only thing left is to focus on getting better yourself for as long the zeal remains . Even then , impossible not to be conscious of the challenge heading the way of the man who was once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Patrick B. Kraemer : <p> " You never know what the younger kids are going to do and I think that 's exciting about where our event is going . You get a lot of 17 to and they can take off five to 10 seconds . I know I did . They always have you on your feet . I would have liked to have gone for that record tonight but I am happy with the swim , there were a lot of really great things about it and I think I can carry that going forward . " <p> Events unfolded in what Cochrane described as a challenging environment . Not Delhi challenging but big meet challenging . He said : " We 've had a long week and a lot of these athletes it 's their first major six-day competition and there are a lot of things to get used to . <p> " Used to village life , used to racing multiple times over an extended process so I was just happy to put together a really good race and I think those guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't be too long until there are multiple at that time . " <p> As time goes by , the old routines may no longer work with quite the same gusto as they once did . How to cope ? <p> " We could have kept doing what we 'd done for the past six to eight years and it would have been good , we would have got the results we wanted but maybe not quite the next step , " said Cochrane . " So I was so excited to do some things that were different this year . My times are a little bit faster or similar to where we 'd been but it was so much better racing . I am going to take that as a huge benefit going into the next two years . <p> " We fly home at 7am tomorrow morning and it 's back to training . I had a long break last summer where I got to enjoy a lot of time out but it 's funny how quickly you want to get back into it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co over at Pan Pacs on the Gold Coast . Was there enough time to come down , get back up ? <p> " We 've never really gone through this process before so I think it 's a good practice before next summer when the Pan Am Games and World Championships are about two and a half weeks apart , " says Cochrane Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer . " We get back to a pretty big work session for about a week or two which will probably be shocking but I think that is what it takes to shock your body back into work and then you can taper out of that and into racing mode again . It might be difficult but it 's a good practice at the end . " <p> And all of this in a year that was supposed to be " quiet " . <p> " It 's funny how quickly you can get talked into things ! I think it 's exciting . I said school was my focus this year : with that said I think I like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as at the pool . " <p> On leaving the Tollcross pool heading for a hotel and a short night before a long flight , Cochrane 's thoughts turned homeward . His grandmother passed away two weeks before the Games . Fond memories of a time now gone : " It 's been a good experience : she was a really big swim fan . " <p> Cristiano Ronaldo is 
 count is minus the para-sport events for the sake of historical comparison <p> Day 6 Cochrane ( CAN ) , in the free tonight , and Jazz Carlin ( WAL ) in the free this morning , have a shot at distance doubles on day . Men 's medley and Chad Le Clos is in the hunt once more and the 4x100m medley relays . This evening brings a chance for English teenager Ben Proud to do a sprint double after 50 ' fly victory and a 21.76 British record in the 50 free semis . <p> The last session of heats action in the pool is done all major podium chasers safely through , no upsets , stage set for great finale . <p> 11:14 : tight 200IM qualification Daniel Tranter makes it to lane 4 on 1:59.05 for a Daniel Vs Daniel .

Wallace into world top 20 at 16 with season best . <p> 10:51 : Last heat of the a at some ease from Lauren Boyle ( NZL ) set the pace and books a ticket to lane 4 for the world champs bronze medallist . Next through , two Aussies clue by 4:07.35 from Remy Fairweather and a from Bronte Barratt <p> 10:43 : Three of those in the free final last night raced hard in the first fast heat of the women 's freestyle : Hannah Miley ( SCO ) was determined to make the final and in lane 2 set the pace for much of the way , with Brittany MacLean ( CAN ) at her side and Jazz Carlin , the champ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:09.30 ; Carlin : 4:09.76 . For Miley , a lifetime best matched last morning of action at the end of a mega program . Steely . <h> Comments <p> July 29 , 2014 <p> : Most major players looked to be keeping powder dry for main event . For mine it 's Carlin v Boyle . McLean can not be discounted . Barrett was she foxing or is she running out of gas at the end of the meet ? Hard to know as she is a v enigmatic performer in intl competition . Fairweather can she back up from an impressive heat swim ? <p> : F-H &amp; LeClos played " silly " and nearly paid the price of not qualifying . VERY stupid habit to get into intl competition ! Tranter faster QF and has to be considered given he at last year 's Worlds but not convinced he 's intl top level . Wallace has the advantage of a partisan home crowd to push him along psychologically . He 's having a stormer of a meet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Expect a diff Le Clos in final <p> : CAN 2nd fastest QF but they really do n't have the " cattle " to step it up to another level in the final . RSA fielded VDB in heats but will sub in LeClos &amp; Shankland for final . Expect them to medal but their opening back leg will most likely consign them to bronze . AUS fastest QF but essentially meaningless as ENG will field 3 gold medallists on 3 of their legs . Back &amp; fly look advantage ENG , at best 0.5 on each but not inconceivable that they could be much closer . The issue will be whether a lame Sprenger can hold the BRS deficit to something like 1.5 which is a conservative view of the AUS FS advantage . Money has to be w ENG . <p> : CAN will be competitive on &amp; to a degree BRS but they are giving up to AUS &amp; to ENG on FS which really consigns them to bronze . AUS should be clear favourites but it may be closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best part of a second but she can be erratic in relays and can throw in an ordinary one at times . This should decide whether the race is close or not . A good leg should nullify the potential ENG BRS advantage . Fly is a small advantage to ENG via O'C but McK is having a similar sort of meet . ENG could be going into FS with a lead of around a second but C1 has FH covered by around 1,5 . Not inconceivable ENG COULD provide an upset but have to favour AUS. <p> The challenges of 
 <p> As the Commonwealth Games draws to a close this weekend , we review the top performers , starting with Australia plenty of swims to celebrate and plenty of room for improvement too , including a need to swim up not down at major meets ( coming up , England and Scotland ) <p> It was an odd thing to read the headline " Australian swimming head coach Jacco Verhaeren cautions against overconfidence after great meet " . <p> At the foot of a fine review of Australia 's Glaswegian adventure by reporter Todd was this line of our times in the Herald Sunin a digital age that demands updates and revisions to breaking news penned and filed as events unfold : originally published as " Bigger tests lie ahead but swim squad happy " . <p> The latter reflects the Australian picture of Glasgow 2014 more accurately than the headline that replaced it . Over-confidence sits uncomfortably not only with ambitions to become " world No 1 ? but with the outcome in Glasgow . Let 's be clear : <p> Australia won the meet , no question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all cylinders to win the meet <p> Australia had a few big hitters down on best through injury and illness <p> Australia has another target ahead of it , at home against the USA and others in Pan Pacs racing that for the likes of James Magnussen and Cameron McEvoy presents a far steeper challenge than that they faced from any other-team rivals in Glasgow . <p> Even so , wherever the line came from Down Under that Australia is stronger now in Commonwealth waters than it was at some time in the past , it is a touch shy of the truth . <p> The overall numbers , in fact , have hardly shifted and where they have , Australia 's tally has weakened a touch compared to a home Games at Melbourne 2006 when cast against combined tallies ' GBR ' and ' rest ' . The shift is small overall but very significant in the detail of two meets , some good news in the mix , the 2006 and 2014 shake showing just how far the recovery of Australia 's men from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Melbourne 2006 <p> AUS <p> 17 <p> 18 <p> 16 <p> 51 <p> GBR <p> 15 <p> 14 <p> 7 <p> 36 <p> Rest <p> 6 <p> 6 <p> 16 <p> 28 <p> Glasgow 2014 <p> AUS <p> 16 <p> 16 <p> 14 <p> 46 <p> GBR <p> 16 <p> 13 <p> 14 <p> 43 <p> Rest <p> 8 <p> 8 <p> 10 <p> 26 <p> Where Australia made significant gains within all of that is obvious . Melbourne 2006 produced one of the most startling stats in the sport : with Thorpe gone and Hackett out through post-injury/illness rehab , the 4x100m medley was the only title won by Australian men at a home Games . <p> At Melbourne 2006 , Australian women won 16 titles . This time , it was nine , including three relays that speak to the depth and breadth of strength in the Australian programme . That shift reflects the ebb and flow in relative strengths and weaknesses in particular events ( not easy to find a replacement for Leisel Jones and the impact she had , for example ) as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was no question who won the meet in Glasgow and while any GBR count must be regarded as virtual at the only major meet every four years at which the home nations compete in the parts of the sum of the Union Flag ( Jack only when flown on a ship ) , there was plenty to be cheerful about in the ranks of British coaches and swimmers in an area of worry for Australia : swimming up to the big meet not down from trials . <p> The impact of Glasgow 2014 on the world top 5 rankings is telling . It reflects the moment : who stepped up , who did not manage season best when the heat was on . It speaks to Britain 's woe at a home 2012 Olympic Games in London , where the majority could not match their season best come the drop . How heartening then the Glasgow figures for the Brits where for Australia there is cause for concern : <p> The number of performances that made the world top 5 so far this year ( at Glasgow 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> GBR <p> 10 <p> 13 <p> 23 <p> AUS <p> 2 <p> 6 <p> 8 <p> Rest <p> 5 <p> 4 <p> 9 <p> In Australia , it was written up as the easy job having been done , the hard slog ahead and that is correct in terms of what lies ahead , the Pan Pacs against the USA and in the virtual world of the Asian Games in Incheon , Korea , come September , with the likes of home hero Park Tae-hwan , China and Japan . The real world returns in Kazan world titles next year . <p> The counts being at used Down Under that stretch to 57 medals mask the truth : para-sports events have burgeoned and have no relevance to the able-bodied swimming picture and historical comparisons that had only a couple of para-sports events at Melbourne 2006 and none at the majority of Games before that . <p> Head coach Jacco Verhaeren must know it , though he presented the rosiest view when he told the Australian media in Glasgow this past week : " I think we can all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we missed a lot of opportunities , some , but this is part of the process of learning . It 's a big step forwards but still a step in the process of what we want to achieve in the end . " He noted the long-term aim and the journey ahead when saying : <p> " We are trying to create a performance culture and I think we made a massive step in that . I think the sense of reality is there , this is not a world championships . " <p> Nor an Olympic Games and counting only Olympic events , the picture is : <p> AUS <p> 14 <p> 17 <p> 13 <p> 44 <p> GBR <p> 10 <p> 11 <p> 11 <p> 32 <p> Rest <p> 8 <p> 6 <p> 8 <p> 22 <p> There were three sweeps for Australia in Scotland and 15 podiums with one Australia and 6 podiums with no Australians in solo events . <p> Skipping Delhi and the skew of sickness , Verhaeren leapt back to Melbourne 2006 for a view of current standing but did point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mix : " I think we should memorise 2006 in Melbourne , not many wins for men and I believe 2008 was a great Olympics for Australia . " <p> Beyond the thread of the then and now , there were plenty of fine views in the current Australian picture in Scotland . On their own , Emma McKeon , Cate Campbell , Bronte Campell , and then with Mel Schlanger for the relay , the 4x100m free quartet produced the highlight of the Games in the pool with a world record inside 3:31 for the first time in a race against the clock that suggested further room for improvement . <p> The potential in any waters of James Magnussen , who raced with a back strain , Cameron McEvoy and Mack Horton is formidable , and there 's more to come , too , from the likes of Taylor McKeown , Mitch Larkin , Daniel Tranter and Jordan Harrison , among others two years out from Rio 2016 . <p> Magnussen and Sprenger face MRI scans this week before confirmation of racing at Pan Pacs on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the Brits who excelled in Glasgow will be in the midst of another battle at European Championships in Berlin . <p> There 's a three-line whip on athlete health in Australia , performance director Michael Scott and newly appointed Dr Peter Fricker , former AIS director and Olympic team doctor , now the swim team 's chief medical officer . <p> " Keeping athletes healthy is one of the major topics in Swimming Australia at this moment which is going to be very important because keeping athletes healthy and fit will in the end pay off , " Verhaeren told Australian reporters in Glasgow . <p> All the more so for a team that travels further and more often than any other in the world in pursuit of excellent challenge . That changes this month at a home Pan Pacs , which , on a number of levels and in specific places , presents a very different kind of challenge to that in Glasgow , one that will tell Australia whether it has yet left the foothills of its ambitious journey to world No1 . <h> Comments <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Scott are being " reality based " regarding the situation . Comm Games WAS an incredibly variable meet with regards to the depth in specific events and the times that won medals agst the " intl measuring stick " . Craig is right to highlight the legitimately outstanding performances but there were still some events where people medalled with times that would n't make World/Olympic finals . <p> Concern areas that seem to be improving are : post Rice gap in . McMaster 's 4.36 is at least somewhere around " finals " the post Hackett gap in 1500 . Horton &amp; Harrison may not become dominant but are at least competitive . some positive signs in M back . Not quite there at the moment but nudging close to " finals times " . Emma McKeon 's overall performance &amp; overall potential . May 've superceded Barrett as premier where she looks " medal contender " . Potential to fill Coutts ' spot as premier McKeown in <p> Still major concerns : Mens BRS beyond Sprenger looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2.11. Men 's fly esp over 100 . Ashwood 's failure to replicate domestic performance along the line of many before her . Bowles ' swim pleasing but need to see it followed through . . The leading performers are both NOT internationally competitive and close to end of career . This gap threatens medal competitiveness of historically strong depth in both M &amp; W 400IM &amp; . <p> Personal Best August 2 , 2014 <p> I think Horton has shown great maturity and focus ; I think he 's looking to be very competitive . <p> Some of the male swimmers who have been inconsistent seem to have become a bit more reliable as well ( as you mentioned in the 100 back , 200 back , but also 200 free , 400 free ) . <p> I think Pan Pacs will be the clearer test of results as it seems to have been the focus for some . Interesting times ahead for sure . <p> This was , for the most par , swimming against the JV squad or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far they ( the Oz girl and boys ) when they go up against the " mightiest " swim power the world has ever seen ( No , NOT New Zealand ! ) @ the Pan-Pacs in tees semanas . <p> Then afterwards Jacco may still have a job . <p> August 3 , 2014 <p> Due to its unparalleled incredible depth ( and obviously a few swimming mega stars as well ) , USA will steamroller over the competition at the pan pacs . <p> The less countries participating , the more obvious USA dominance is . Even at the height of Australian swimming in 2002 after Australia beat USA in the 2001 worlds , USA still handily beat Australia 21 golds to 11 golds . <p> Just Me August 3 , 2014 <p> I think the Aussies will come crashing back to reality after the Pan Pacs . This story highlights that the number of performances that would have made an impact on the world stage are few and far between . <p> I can only see W50 free , W100 free , &amp; free being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few events where Aussies will be competitive , namely : W200 free , W100 back will be a tight tussle with Missy as will the if Aus can sort out their appalling selection decisions from Glasgow . Coutts out of form at Comms but may be a chance in the if she can improve . <p> On the mens side the M400 free could go the way of McKeon but reports out of Aus are than Magnussen and Sprenger will await MRI results on injury but even if they swim wo n't be at their best . McEvoy may cause an upset in the M100 free if he can improve back to his best from Glasgow , but outside of this I do n't see any other Gold medal prospects against the USA . <p> In short it will be USA by a landslide and the very sugarcoated , wrapped up in a pink bow positive results out of Glasgow will be relaxed with a harsh reality . Swimming Australia would be wise to lower public expectation prior to the event to better manage the fall out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2014 <p> And what with Christopher Wright always swimming faster at the trials than at majors ? In contrast to her girlfriend who always swimming her best at the majors . <p> Poto Slater August 4 , 2014 <p> Hi Craig <p> Once again I very insightful article . I believe the biggest factor for the AUS team coming out of the Games was the that public perception of the team has come back around to a positive . Credit here must go to Michael Scott . What I do n't believe has happened , was that the AUS team " dominated in pool " as many news articles have stated . Although the team won 47 medals , we had a team of 47 swimmers , the largest since Melbourne in 2006 ( 46 medals won ) when compared to the combined results of the GBR team the picture does n't look as good . What the games did show was some major holes ( and depth ) in the AUS swim team , ( men 's Fly , Breast , IM womens breast , Fly IM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Age of some of the AUS members . 9 swimmers will be over come Rio , with a possibilites of 16 if all age up this year ( apologies in did n't look up athletes DOB ) <p> If you look at times the AUS team recorded at the 2014 AUS Titles only 23 swims were faster than achieved in Glasgow , 75 swims were Slower than trials . From my understanding this was a major concern from London , and a big goal for Glasgow . If you just look at times achieved at the 2014 AUS titles , the AUS team gave away a possible 2 Gold , 3 Silver and 6 Bronze medals with also the opportunity to turn 1 Silver into Gold , 3 Bronze into Gold and 1 Bronze into Silver . If AUS is to achieve its goal of becoming the Number 1 swimming nations , they can not leave any medals on the table . We will all get a better understanding of where all Commonwealth nations sit in 3 day time ( US Trials ) ...... the bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Craig Lord August 4 , 2014 <p> Good points Poto <p> August 4 , 2014 <p> Can concur with Poto re summation of CG results . <p> WILL be very interesting to see who/how many DO back up at Pan Pacs ; whether some will actually perform better .... and who does n't . Pan Pacs IS N'T Worlds or the Olympics but anytime you 're coming up against what is generally a full strength US team is going to be very strong gauge on just where you actually stand internationally in most events . It should certainly be a test of many swimmers maturity with regards to how they handle the " come down " from CG hype to international realities . <p> Any golds are likely to be hard won ; I tend to agree with JM 's calls . AUS likely favourites in , 100FS , 4X100 . Good chances in , &amp; maybe 1500 ( if Cochrane does n't show up ) . Close relay in both 4 ? 200 . IF Magnussen is fit then both 100fs &amp; 4X100 on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other events where the US swimmer IS the current " gold standard " , they should be looking at how " close " they are to them , whether they 've closed the gap ... and where they may still be deficient . <p> Due to sheer weight of numbers , the US is always likely to be the superpower of the sport . However , despite Bill 's " " , it is rare that they are all powerful and there are usually some gaps in both men 's and women 's sides . Men 's BRS needs someone to step up and distance FS is good but not dominant . Same could be said for W BRS and W sprint FS is lagging behind AUS . <p> Poto Slater August 4 , 2014 <p> British import Ellen Gandy has pulled out of the Australian swimming team for personal reasons ahead of their Pan Pacs showdown with the United States on the Gold Coast . <p> Gandy who contested the London Olympics for Great Britain made her Australian debut at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver medallist when they come up against the might of the United States , Canada and Japan from August 21-24 . <p> Nine swimmers were injected into the initial Pan Pacs squad named in April after the Glasgow Games . <p> Matthew Abood , Alanna Bowles , Jayden Hadler , Sally Hunter , Travis Mahoney , Keryn McMaster , Lorna Tonks and Chris Wright will join Australia A recruit Jake Packard and the rest of the team when they assemble on the Gold Coast on August 17 . <p> National coach Jacco Verhaeren said it would be a challenge to back up from their Glasgow heroics . <p> " It 's not usual for us to have two chances to race so quickly together and it something that we 've been preparing for all year and will learn a lot from , " he said . <p> Simon Huitenga , Rhys Mainstone , Jarrod Poort , Chelsea Gubecka , Kareena Lee and Jessica Walker will also join the team for a August 25 open water race that follows the Pan Pacs pool action . <h> Tottenham Confirm Arrival 
 her claws out in the sprint events in Glasgow Gian Mattia D'Alberto / <p> When Melanie Marshall , a woman who knows a thing or two about podium chasing in Commonwealth waters , tweeted " Great to be part of the staff thanks Team England we pulled it off " , she summed up the position very nicely . <p> While the Games in Glasgow are , of course , about the swimmers and their performances , the coaching staff was just as much under scrutiny . The promise of summer after fine spring has long been a part of the picture in the pool in Britain . <p> What has been lacking is the alchemy to swim up to the big meet not down from trials , to convert qualification in heats to speedier moments in semis and finals worthy of podium places . Important these two views , then , from head coach Jon Rudd : <p> On the eve of racing : <p> " As coaches it is our responsibility to do anything we can when we arrive in Glasgow to convert some of those positions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not something the athlete can control . We 're trying to get guys to arrive at their blocks and hope the opposition is on the day . Those are the differences you need . " <p> And when , post-racing , we asked , with good reason to savour and celebrate the moment , if he thought Britain could now match that conversion rate in global waters : <p> " We have n't got any excuses to get it wrong . The swimmers are there , they 're fast , they 're talented , they 're world-class . Now , there is a difference between the Commonwealth Games , a worlds and an Olympic Games . <p> He adds : " There is a chasm of difference . Maybe not so much in the 200s and 400s here , where it was tougher to make the men 's 400 free final here than it was to make it at worlds last year ( last in 3:47.5 and 3:47.8 ) but for 50s and 100s , you do n't have to be there at that speed in heats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's totally different at world and Olympic levels . We have to make sure we get a second swim . We have two years to get that right . " <h> Getting It Right In Glasgow Via London <p> Many did get it right in Glasgow , among supreme examples Fran Halsall , who grew with the same **25;317;TOOLONG philosophy ringing in her ears courtesy of the mantra brought to Britain by Bill Sweetenham at a time when the man who is now Halsall 's coach at Loughborough , James Gibson , was hearing it too . <p> Keeping the most significant memories of and lessons from the Australian has been crucial , just as the things that Rudd , Gibson and others have brought to the table from their own experiences out in the back waters of longs days of prep and then on the burning deck have been significant . A sort of ' take of the best , scrap the rest ' approach . <p> Marshall heard Sweetenham 's mantra on mastering the rounds , too and guess what , her charge at Derby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen through the rounds if the biggest moment of all is to unfold with at least some of the challenge in the moment stored in a box marked " habit : instant access " . <p> On her way to thumping victories in 23.96 , world textile best , in the free and 25.20 in the ' fly , Halsall was a metronomic role model in . <p> Rudd 's charge in Plymouth , Ben Proud , 19 , is now Commonwealth free and ' fly champion after following a curve that his training partner Ruta Meilutyte will have surely recognised from her own varying outcomes of gathering storm , including step-up progression to Olympic gold , world-record semis and gold and world-record semis and silver . <p> Siobhan-Marie O'Connor photo : Ian MacNicol , and Bath teammate under the guidance of coach Dave McNulty , Hebborn photo : SWPix.com ; Aimee Willmott under the guidance of coach Lisa Bates , Georgia Davies for Wales and training with Gibson , and Jazz Carlin of Wales and following yet the programs of Bud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , faster in the final with world top 5 times . <p> The meet was made because of it and it turned out like that , Rudd believes , because every single member of the squad ( and England and Wales shared camp and approach ) took responsibility . <p> " We had no medal targets , " Rudd tells SwimVortex . " Our aim was just to come along and swim as best as we could each and every day . <p> " Our concept is that a swim team is a collection of individuals and each has a responsibility to do the job on the day . If each one does that , you get a team performance . " <p> " Thrilled , " he was to be able to count success by the measure of records that spoke to swimmers stepping up not only this season but in their careers when the heat was on : 15 Games records , 17 British , ( 21 English ) records was what he cited along with a slate of personal bests in the bargain . <h> Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sixteen days ago , we got together in London and we started talking about a philosophy for the team and how we were going to go about our business , we talked about what our priorities were , what we would focus on , some thing were were going to speak about and things were not going to mention or focus on . <p> " We talked about how important it was to find an identity , how easy it was for Scots to feel Scottish , Welsh to feel Welsh and how easy it was for the English to feel British . It says ' We Are England ' on our T-shirts but it needed to be more than a badge . It needed to be something we felt . I was conscious about pushing that England button too hard because you do n't always get the best performances that way . " He adds : <p> " The point was to bring some kind of collective responsibility to what we were trying to do and that meant the coaches feeling it , the support staff feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , a really calm and productive environment on that camp . " <p> That is how Rudd runs Plymouth Leander in partnership with College and University schemes that speak not only to the continuity of excellence but a culture of individual responsibility that contributes to collective good . No coincidence that articles on Ruta Meilutyte , on Ben Proud , on others in the shame result in a high rate of read , tweet , Facebook and so on : the folk around them clearly care about what 's happening with a passion and are more than happy to show it . Further , we saw no reluctance from Rudd to engage , explain , express his thoughts and feelings . This was not a coach cut off from the world . <p> " We did n't have too many three-line whips . If the professionalism is apparent , you will do what you need to do , " adds Rudd centre , with England staff . Was the memory of how it unfolded , what worked , why it was good , ingrained and accessible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that you always do as part of a process and there are things that you think you could have done a little bit better , " says Rudd . " I think that on this occasion there 's not an awful lot we could have done better . Most of the things are as we would have wanted them done and in fact turned out to be better than we 'd expected in some cases . " He adds : <p> " When we debrief , hopefully others will take on some of our philosophies and methodology about how we wanted to prepare the team . " <p> The approach that Rudd , his six coaches and the athletes had taken at the camp in London had provided " a great grounding ... and we just continued that here " , says the head coach . " We did n't worry about what the opposition could do , we just focussed on what we could do . If we got everything right , success would follow . " <p> At camp , Rudd spoke to each and every one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how do you see your week working out for you " ? Rudd recalls : <p> " They started to talk about what could happen and opened their minds a bit to the idea that just because it says something on paper does n't mean its going to end up that way . " <p> Spot on : the form guide suggested no golds for England , for example . Even when the chips were down , it seemed , this was a team of individuals who , with the support of coaches and team staff , had the ability to take a knock and get back up again . <p> Sophie Taylor , who wiped .7sec off the national breaststroke record for gold in the , was a case in point . Down on best her best in the , she crashed out of the on 2:30 and was seen in floods of tears . The came last and between wipeout and gold much confidence-building work was undertaken back at base . <p> Though confidence was the key , Rudd believes , he also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor , who will move to London and the new excellence program to be run by coach Bates come the end of the summer , came for the . <p> " I think she came here to win the , " says Rudd turning to a three-bears and porridge analogy when he added : " The 50 was a bit too short , the 200 was a bit too long . It was a combination of something we did to help and something that told her that the 100 was her swim . " <p> The schedule , with finals starting at 7pm , led to late evenings that did not lend themselves to a team meeting at every turn . Just as well : Rudd is not a meetings man . " We 've really trimmed back on meetings . In fact we 've had hardly any at all . When we do have them we want them to have an impact , " he says . <p> The reduction in the forced herd approach meant that , come the one meeting planned for before the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together " and rallying for the final push past the post . <p> The mode spilled into the pool in that last session with victory for Proud in the freestyle , several career bests and then the best possible : victory in the 4x100m medley ahead of Australia . Mel Marshall was the coach in charge of the foursome on the day . They were swifter than the time in which Australia took Olympic bronze at London 2012 . Pulled it off indeed . At the heart of that result was a 51 flat on ' fly , the best split in the race ahead of Chad le Clos , for Adam Barrett , the soar he found in himself surely confirming an exciting margin of room for improvement in another of the new wave of names making it to the helm of the senior Britain ranks . <p> Barrett is coached by Gibson at Loughborough . Back at Melbourne 2006 , Gibson was still competing and he shared a room with Liam Tancock , who is still competing and in Glasgow shook of two years of woe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sprint backstroke four years after double gold in Delhi . <p> " We never had a sprint programme , " said Tancock . " They set it up after the Olympics ... and James came in . I roomed with him at Melbourne , now he 's my coach . It was a fantastic partnership in the pool back then , we were both world champions and he 's done amazing things since by coaching Florent Manaudou and having a fantastic Olympics as a coach . " Added Tancock : <p> " The team at Loughborough has gone from strength to strength with James . Look at Adam Barrett , he 's done a fantastic job , not just for himself but for the relay . We 're two years out from Rio we have to stay on that track . " <p> That track , Rudd believes , requires more work in the junior-senior transition : " What we 've got to do as a country is to convert those European junior results into world senior waters and show we can come through . " He adds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right is that age is no barrier , only attitude is a barrier : belief and confidence and having that ability to just black out whatever else is going on around you . ' It 's my lane , I 've got two lane lines that separate me from everybody else and a stretch of water that I own and I 'm going to do my job in it ; what 's going on around me is fairly inconsequential ' . " <h> Thoughts turn to Berlin <p> When the best of British arrive for heats on the first morning at the German capital on August 18 , continental title contenders from other countries will struggle to recognise some of the new challengers in the lanes alongside them . <p> Ranked world No 1 this year , USA nationals pending , with their winning times at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow over the past week , Siobhan-Marie O'Connor , Georgia Davies , Ross Murdoch , 20 , and Benjamin Proud , 19 , have never raced at European long-course level before . The same goes for Adam Peaty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaststroke . <p> Indeed , Murdoch has never represented Britain in championship waters but will arrive in Berlin an unknown global pace-setter and title favourite with a best time more than a second faster than anyone else in the hunt . <p> Michael Jamieson , the Scotland teammate and Olympic silver medallist he defeated at home in Glasgow , is taking a break , while the Olympic champion who pipped Jamieson in London , Daniel Gyurta , of Hungary , has opted out of the 200 while nursing an injury . The way was clear for Marco Koch to celebrate a home win in Germany until Murdoch wiped off his best in Glasgow . <p> The 20-year-old Murdoch , based at the University of Stirling , produced the best male performance of the Games in Glasgow , his 2mins 07.30 victory in the breaststroke just away from the world record . <p> O'Connor , Proud , Davies and Peaty are joined on the list of title hopes in Berlin by more experienced champions in Glasgow Fran Halsall , Chris Walker-Hebborn , Jazmin Carlin and Hannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the freestyle , became the first Welsh champion among women since 1974 , while Georgia her into the club in the backstroke. <h> 2006 to 2014 : <p> The number of performances that made the world top 5 so far this year ( at Glasgow 2014 ) : <p> Nation <p> Men <p> Women <p> Tot <p> GBR <p> 10 <p> 13 <p> 23 <p> AUS <p> 2 <p> 6 <p> 8 <p> Rest <p> 5 <p> 4 <p> 9 <p> Olympic events only table : <p> AUS <p> 14 <p> 17 <p> 13 <p> 44 <p> GBR <p> 10 <p> 11 <p> 11 <p> 32 <p> Rest <p> 8 <p> 6 <p> 8 <p> 22 <p> Of course it does n't work like this ... but superimpose Brit results in Glasgow over London 2012 and you come to a team looking at a couple of golds , a couple of silvers and five bronzes . Another day and not a thought , as Rudd and Co made sure was the case that any swimmer should have in mind as they approach the lane they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glasgow has exorcised the ghosts of London 2012 , not just because of a record haul : <p> " The memory of the London pool is a good one now ... the Commonwealth Games has been a tremendous experience for all concerned . " <h> Comments <p> Are you only counting each event once for British record purposes ? there were definitely more than 17 British Record swims ( albeit some events saw more than one record over the week ) I made it 21 <p> Craig Lord August 2 , 2014 <p> Hi Steve ... I 'm not counting at all in that article ... I ' cited ' Jon , who was speaking before the last session of finals when he ran down his tally ... I think you 're right , it is more ... will get to count at some stage ... but not know , just finished another mega day of filing at the Games ... on other sports ( almost done <p> mister clive August 3 , 2014 <p> Very nice summation . Lessons to be learned by everyone challenged with a pinnacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even twice-daily , team meetings in the heat of a multi-day championship have been a key factor in the suppression of exuberant and exhilarating competitive peaks . The swimmers with great performances know they 've done well , and so does everyone else on the team ; the ones who have fallen short also know it and their turn-around is best done one-on-one rather than in a manufactured , group , rah-rah session . <p> The whole approach indicated a common purpose and trust in the ability ( and the focused determination ) to get the job done ( Scotland , Wales and England ) GBR is in good hands . <p> W-A-R footing for Rio ? Willing , Able , Ready . <p> Jon is correct in his identification of the next important steps converting the GB Euro Junior results into senior performances a clear program weakness identified by Tim Jones . <p> There has visibly been a profound culture change within the British swimming environment and it is a good thing . <p> And of course Jon is only talking about England , whereupon he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Wales and Scotland <p> Craig Lord August 3 , 2014 <p> Yes to the conversion jun to sen Clive , and much good work underway on that in Britain already , with Tim and others ... though I also read that Tim had referred to Smart Track as ' PR ' ... if he did say it , and apologies to him if he did n't ... I think that would be a little disingenuous .... Fran , Jazz , Jemma , Ellen , Lizzie all world top 10 a decade on .... and Fran the best there has ever been 50 free textile , Jazz among the biggest 800 contenders at last . The exercise should have been repeated . There are other programs and other fine talent coming through , of course , but sometimes it seems that folk like to throw babies out with bath water to ' make a point ' . I do n't think that 's smart . <p> Mardi August 3 , 2014 <p> It was a great swim , but taking into consideration the Aussie breaststroker had a torn shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost caught the boys . Was n't quite a level playing field ! <p> Craig Lord August 3 , 2014 <p> Mardi : unfair to say it was not a level playing field . That was purely a matter of choice . If an injury is that bad , you should n't be getting in the water and making it worse . The fact that they did get in the water made it a level playing field ... their choice , same condition for all ... it is the race environment that makes it a level playing field , not the clean swimmer . You could just as easily note that Adam Brown became a dad while he was away and might have been an emotional wreck who blew it at the last ... he did n't ... he kept his focus and did the best job he could . So did James and Christian on the day .... and I did n't hear any of them moaning one way or the other . The result was fair , the playing field level on the day ... and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Craig Lord August 3 , 2014 <p> Thanks Steve . <p> Dave August 3 , 2014 <p> Great article , so good to see us doing well after the disappointment of 2012 . Really important what Tim Jones and Jon say about converting European Junior results into senior results . <p> Craig it would be a great article to read on what they are doing about that ...... <p> John August 4 , 2014 <p> " We had no medal targets , " Rudd tells SwimVortex <p> Well said Jon Rudd ! The first boss to speak common sense in ages ! <p> Craig Lord August 4 , 2014 <p> John , quite so ... but important to note too that other ' bosses ' said similar on medals ... and Jon acknowledged in a previous piece that medal targets are part of the mix , not by choice of coach and athlete , but because they are a key criteria of funding ( not something the athlete or coach should be dragging with them to the blocks , of course ) . <p> August 6 , 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what your level of responsibility is . As Craig said , they are important for funding . They 're a measuring stick for national federations or at least elite programmes . Those who work full time on the big picture have to take responsibility for the big picture result . Jon Rudd 's job for the Commonwealth games is much more like the head coach for a USA championship team , than what the British are used in terms of performance director and head coach . Rudd can try to get swimmers peaking at the right time and improving through the rounds , but if they arrive at him completely uncompetitive there 's not much he can do . England could set a medal target and miss it woefully despite all athletes setting best times if they just were n't good enough when they arrived with him in such a case the championship coaches could be fairly said to have performed their role well . <h> Boy , 2 
 Big Back Half Lifts Tyler Clary to Head of the Field in 200 Backstroke <p> The chatter surrounding the 200 backstroke as the United States Nationals approached largely focused on two guys . While some discussion focused on how would recover from a knee injury , additional attention was placed on Ryan Murphy , the up-and-coming star who had a superb NCAA season at Cal-Berkeley . <p> What about Tyler Clary ? <p> Despite being the reigning Olympic champion , Clary received more attention over the past few months for his auto racing ambitions than for his skill in the pool . Yet , when it came time to get the job done in the water , Clary showed Lochte and Murphy that he was the man to beat . Storming through the last 100 meters , Clary had no problem erasing an early deficit and won the 200 back in 1:54.73 , the third-fastest time in the world this year . <p> Lochte set the pace during the first three laps , but the 2008 Olympic champion struggled mightily over the last 50 meters and faded to third place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The junior records were introduced by FINA on April 1 this year , with no backdating . The best ever by a junior in textile is a 1:55.74 from Kosuke Hagino ( JPN ) in 2012 , the best including shiny suits a 1:54.77 by Ryosuke Irie ( JPN ) in 2008 . <h> Men Backstroke <p> 1 <p> <p> Ryosuke Irie JPN , 25 <p> Asian Games KOR , Incheon <p> 2 <p> <p> Kosuke Hagino JPN , 21 <p> Japanese National Championships JPN , Tokyo <p> 3 <p> <p> Tyler Clary USA , 26 <p> US National Championships USA , Irvine <p> 4 <p> <p> Xu CHN , 20 <p> Asian Games KOR , Incheon <p> 5 <p> <p> Mitchell Larkin AUS , 22 <p> Australian National Championships AUS , Brisbane <p> 6 <p> <p> Arkady Vyatchanin RUS , 31 <p> USA GP Santa Clara USA , Santa Clara <p> 7 <p> <p> Ryan Murphy USA , 20 <p> Pan Pacific Championships AUS , Gold Coast <p> For Clary , the first two days of Nationals have unfolded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday night with a second-place finish in the 200 butterfly , a career performance from Tom Shields the only thing that kept Clary from victory . He then followed with his victory in the 200 backstroke , a win that obviously meant a great deal considering the way he expressed his satisfaction after the race . Clary celebrated with some fist pumps and a look of determination , as if to say , " This event is still mine . " <p> For a guy who is a reigning Olympic champion , Clary really has n't received the credit he deserves . It 's taken his auto-racing hobby to receive headlines and when action in the pool is discussed , Lochte is typically the first person mentioned , with the upside of Murphy following soon after . So , how does Clary respond ? Easy . He let 's his performances speak loudly . <p> Given the way Clary has performed in his two events , his confidence for the 400 individual medley has to be brimming . Heading into that event , the talk has surrounded Chase Kalisz , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounding into form , Lochte tried to get out ahead of the field and hold on , and for 150 meters , the plan worked out . But Lochte paid for the tactic down the stretch as Clary went cruising by , along with Murphy . Still , Lochte has qualified for two individual events for Pan Pacs , the 100 free done on Wednesday . As for Murphy , an age-group record holder and pegged as a future star long ago , he nailed down his trip to Australia and alleviated the pressure which would have built had he finished out of the top three . <h> Comments <p> Bad Anon August 8 , 2014 <p> Lochte can still swim @ pan pacs since he already qualified for the 100free <p> Bad Anon August 8 , 2014 <p> On swimming in an outside lane , Lochte is yet to master the art of being an outside smoker . He could get a few tips from teamate who has won multiple world and olympic medals in outside lanes ; 100back silver ( athens ' 04 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ montreal ' 05 ) 400IM silver ( beijing ' 08 ) .

He simply has n't had enough training to be able to pull that off this year . <p> Clary versus Larkin and the guys plus the Chinese kid if he wants to make so go of it could be mist interesting . Irie 's bound to get so cord before he ' do done but I guess all the guys will . Be concentrating on Asian Games and use Pan-Pacs as a . <p> I noticed bill , I also noticed that in London lochte is technically not good enough to beat clary . Clary will absolutely punish Larkin at pan pacs in the second 100 <p> Anthony August 8 , 2014 <p> What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he beat him at every major meet apart from the 2012 olympics and his pb is faster than Clary <p> Bad Anon August 8 , 2014 <p> At SwimMac Lochte in his own words was very apprecitive of coach Marsh 's emphasis on technique . The lingering knee problem has prevented him from doing the work he usually does but i reckon we 'll see his best swim of the year @ pan pacs . Swimming in lane1 was unfamiliar territiry for a backstroker of his caliber ... I think he do enough work in the next fortnight to get to 1.54 @ least <p> Lennart van Haaften August 8 , 2014 <p> Talking about Lochte , I 'm wondering why he has n't swum the 100 back in years , while he has been successful in the 100 fly and occasionally also the 100 free . The backstroke was originally his best stroke ( 2007-2008 ) , though mostly the 200 . Since he 's going down in distance , it would seem natural to take on the 100 back instead of the 200 back . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any events on the 4th day ( when the 100 back is contested ) while has had the tough 200 free/200 back double on the 2nd day ( resulting in him dropping out of the 200 free final ) . <p> ant August 8 , 2014 <p> He has n't swam the 100 back much because it is always on the same day as the 200 free at the worlds and olympics . He swam the 100 back at the 08 trials instead of the 200 free and finished 3rd <h> State Bank of 
 Fogg dashed the hopes of the hosts Germany with a stunning victory for the European title at Berlin 's Gr ? nau open-water course in the south-east of the German capital today . <p> England may be in the doldrums when it comes to the football pitch up against the might of World Cup champions Germany but after the success of home-nation swimmers at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in open water Fogg further restored British pride by sweeping past three German racers for the crown in the second half of battle . <p> At half-way , the hosts were contemplating a podium sweep , as Thomas Lurz , a world champion seven times ( four at the FINA showcase aquatics world titles of all disciplines ) led teammates Soren Meissner and Rob through in 27mins 07.1 ( to and ) , with Fogg closest on 27:15.8 . <p> The time-trial format , in which the competitors race against the clock not so much each other , made added to the tension . In fifth at the turn on was Russian Kirill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race leaders before Meissner came home in . <p> He was then supplanted by Italy 's Simone Ercoli , on before stopped the clock at . was next home but could not get past his teammate : . There was just Fogg to come home . <p> It looked as though he could make the podium given the gap to Ercoli in third among those finished . In fact , Fogg , coached by Kevin Renshaw at Loughborough Photo : swimmer and coach , by Craig Lord , had much more than a podium place in mind and body : in he claimed the crown just shy of ahead of . <p> Fogg got the better of a quality field , the time-trial format helping to put on show his own quality as the best man in the race . The new champion , who won gold in the World Cup in Mexico in 2013 , said : <p> " I 've never done a time trial before . It was a bit weird not knowing where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own race and tried to time it so that I was faster at the end . " <p> Fogg has taken knocks and bounced back to best before . It takes a great deal to be able to do that , as coach Renshaw noted in a Facebook post celebrating the win : <p> " This is the most resilient athlete I have ever had the pleasure of working with . He just keeps bouncing back when other people write him off ! Well done Dan Fogg . " <p> Fogg said : " I knew I had a good chance if I swam well and starting near the end probably helped , but as I had never done it before I did n't know how it would go so am really pleased with the gold . <p> " After the disappointment of the at the Commonwealth Games , to come out here and end the season on a high is really positive and puts me in good stead for next season .

This dream came true today . In the beginning I was n't on the perfect curve on the course but at least it went better than expected . " <p> was also happy though things were not quite as perfect as he painted : " It was a good beginning for the German team in the main events . It 's a great success and it could n't get any better ... " Well , yes , to be honest , it could as Fogg came to know today . <p> The race also featured Pal Joensen , of the Faroes , his first major international championship open water race ending in disqualification . <h> Comments <p> August 13 , 2014 <p> Time trial format , really ? As a triathlete I think open water swimming is all about the packs , the tactics the racing , strategy , getting hit . I 'm not saying a tt would benefit a strong pool swimmer but surely someone very strong in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without others around him and being in a group race <p> Craig Lord August 13 , 2014 <p> ... just as he might have a disadvantage in a heap and scrum . LEN are testing the format in the 5k after a lot of discussion about the brawl that some races have become , swimming skills sometimes sunk by the scrap . <p> Darren fogg August 13 , 2014 <p> Fantastic news for Daniel , a race alone that he had never done , before IN A FIELD OF ELITE SEASONED OPEN WATER SWIMMERS ! ! ! to win by 20 seconds is awesome news ! Way to come back son keep up the great work . <p> Probably not ... though she still has to do it and what she and others do , like the men today , will be the stuff of towering athleticism . One of the ideas behind this was to make it more of a spectator sport ( not only to remove the handbags at dawn element of the sport which often spills over the top without official intervention by people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can pick up , for e.g. ) . Is the ' race ' somehow ' lost ' in a time trial ? No taking away the speed of the key protagonists , though ... amazingly swift swimming . <p> Jorge August 13 , 2014 <p> Craig , but one way or another is very boring . Fogg has this year the better performance in 1.500 and he has won today ... No surprise ... any emotion ... Its better to eliminate <p> Jorge August 13 , 2014 <p> Sorry , better european performance 1.500 of participants ... : ) <p> Darren fogg August 13 , 2014 <p> It was an awesome format and was televised superbly , coverage was brilliant , if you saw it you would n't believe how exciting it was , all on the same level plain , and Thomas the obvious Home favourite , with immense open water experience was beaten on his home turf , all that after a poor 1500 in the commonwealth from Daniel , has put him back where he belongs , Craig you are so right on everything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 <p> Debate is healthy . I do not like this format , open water lose its essence . is the favorite to win tomorrow , not today . Best <p> Zali August 14 , 2014 <p> I do n't  have any objection to this format for the . I think it 's equally interesting . Having in time trial and as a is a great idea . <p> August 14 , 2014 <p> I think the relay time trial format worked well for open water , pretty much a team time trial . But open water swimming should be a brawl , and it should be about who best can handle the conditions thrown at them and execute a great swim while being in a pack <p> Craig Lord August 14 , 2014 <p> and all : looking at comment far and wide it looks like opinion is split on the format . Wherever people stand I think it fair to note that in this particular swimming race , the fastest swimmer won . <p> Cayley Guimar ? es August 14 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same for everyone , and Mr. Fogg won . Congratulations . <p> What is clear by the comments and my own opion is that I really do n't know much about open water swimming .. <p> Lennart van Haaften August 14 , 2014 <p> It 's great to see that they use a time trial for the but still swim in packs in the and . It 's always good to have variation and serve multiple swimmers . I do n't get why people are against using a time trial format in just 1 out of 3 individual races it 's a bit unfair to want of races done in the format of your own preference , while neglecting other wishes . <p> As for the comment that meter swimmers have an advantage here , I 'd like to point out that the 1500 meter pool and time trial are more different than the pack and the pack used to be . <p> I have never understood why in track they run in packs in most events , even races as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the race ) That totally changes the event physiologically ; often championship finals are run at a slow pace and decided by who has the best final lap , rather than who can actually cover the distance the fastest . <p> Craig Lord August 14 , 2014 <p> Good points Lennart . <p> Jorge August 14 , 2014 <p> Mmmm .... I am already a fan of time trial <p> August 14 , 2014 <p> Lennart <p> I claim to no expert in track , but here 's my two cents : in track people work together on your teams . The Kenyans or Ethiopians will inevitably run as a mini pack . This helps them share the wind resistance and keep fresher . Any one individual trying to break away will have to run faster than three Kenyans who systematically draft off of each other . <p> Wind resistance is n't THAT much compared to water resistance in swimming or wind in cycling , but I think it makes enough difference in how people get tired , mentally and physically , that people are loathe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @@@2703316 <h> This one-off evening 
 at the impeding Pan Pacific Championships , aquatic superpower the United States will hold sway but there are pockets of weakness : there 's women 's sprint freestyle and butterfly and then there 's the freestyle realm of Park , Kosuke Hagino , David Mckeon , Tom Fraser-Holmes , Cameron McEvoy , Ryan Cochrane and Mack Horton from 200 to 1500 . <p> All are supreme talents , multi-tasking a mindset in their midst but on freestyle no denying the biggest ranger of them all : Park , the Korean ace with Olympic and world titles as jewels in a crown that extends from 48.42 over free to 14:47.38 over . It is the most impressive range in the history of men 's freestyle swimming . <p> Park is down to race the 100 , 200 , and 400 at Pan Pacs ( as well as the 200 and medley ) . If he will be competitive in the , he will be among favourites for victory in the searing heat of extremely competitive 200 and waters . Consider the Commonwealth Games free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to make the final in Glasgow than it did to make the world-title chase in Barcelona a year ago . <p> Soft waters , the Commonwealth ? Hardly . The top two home in the final at U.S. Nationals would barely have made it through in Glasgow ( and would have been nowhere near the necessary pace with their heats times ) . The Pan Pacs may well be tougher still . <p> The class of 2014 so far includes Ryan Cochrane ( CAN , photo : Ian MacNicol ) , champion in Glasgow on 3:43.46 , the man he pipped , David McKeon ( AUS ) , on at nationals and a fraction away from that in Glasgow , Kosuke Hagino , on 3:43.90 at Japan nationals , Park , on 3:43.96 at NSW titles earlier this year . <p> Then there 's Mack Horton ( AUS ) on 3:44.60 . You then get to the first American , a reflecting the better news for the USA , Connor Jaeger among those not at best at nationals in a standard transition year but bound for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McBroom and Matt McLean will need to drop a second each to enter the fray . <p> Back down to the and the US has in its ranks better to call on than the 1:46.90 so far this year : the heats time of McLean at nationals . Much more will be needed . The Commonwealth crown went in 1:45.08 to Fraser-Holmes , a 1:45.25 took the Korean crown for Park , 1:45.46 the Aussie crown for McEvoy , 1:45.89 the Japanese crown for Hagino . Enter , too , the somewhat unknown capacity of a certain Michael Phelps , who bypassed the at U.S. Nationals but appears on the Pan Pacs psyche sheet . <p> Shift up to the and it is Jaeger once more who stands the best chance of granting the USA a place on a freestyle podium on any distance beyond . Cochrane is the man to beat , a superb effort for Glasgow gold topping the world rankings ( as did his win ) and keeping at bay a fine world junior record for Horton , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaeger 's Photo : Peter Bick comes next in Pan Pacs waters this season , with a from Kohei Yamamoto ( JPN ) and a from Jordan Harrison ( AUS ) at Glasgow , just shy of the podium completed by Welsh teenager Daniel Jervis , topping a 14:56.17 from McBroom . <p> Will we see the first podium of the year ? Possibly not , if only because Wednesday August 20 brings the European title chase . The meet is always where it is at but the virtual clash across the continents is fascinating , all the more so when you throw into the pot the Asian Games in September and the much anticipated clash of Park and Sun Yang ( CHN ) over 200 and Hagino heading for that same battle , too . <p> Of late , Park claimed six South Korean national titles in Gimcheon , including wins over 200 and medley . He is not a serious contender in those events when up against the likes of Ryan Lochte , Michael Phelps , Hagino and Daiya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by coach Michael Bohl 's Korean charge indicates a pace-setting southern winter ahead . <p> The 2008 Olympic freestyle champion 's tally of triumphs in Gimcheon stretched to ( 48.68 ) , ( world-leading 1:45.25 ) , free ( ) , the 200 ( 2:00.31 ) and medley ( 4:23 ) and as a member of his club 4x200m free relay . He was named swimmer of the meet as nationals came to an end . Could he yet be swimmer of the Pan Pacs and swimmer of the Asian Games ? He will surely be among candidates on at least one of those occasions . <p> Park 's choices will not be fully obvious to those beyond his inner circle until the deed and season is done . Hagino , too , faces choices : freestyle , backstroke , butterfly , medley all world-class ... and all a touch too much , perhaps , if gold is what you want when facing a different adversary at every turn . <p> Park gave a hint of the top change ahead this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If I keep preparing well for the Asian Games , I think I may even set my personal bests . I think these races here gave me the opportunity to address some of the problems I had . " <p> The is the interface between the extremes of freestyle distance and as such is the place where difference in approach can often be at its greatest . <h> Take the splits of the fastest favourites : <p> 53.80 ; 1:49.49 ; ; 3:41.53 Park 2010 <p> 54.71 ; 1:51.35 ; ; 3:43.46 Cochrane 2014 <p> 53.80 ; 1:50.93 ; ; McKeon 2013 <p> 53.66 ; 1:51.50 ; 2:48.47 ; 3:43.90 Hagino 2014 <p> 53.75 ; 1:50.26 ; 2:47.72 ; 3:44.60 Horton 2014 <h> What makes Pathfinder Park the man to beat ? <p> There 's the splits above and then a top five on a list of 15 swims of 3:45 flat or better , seven of them inside 3:44 , that are faster than anyone else in the race has swum so far : <p> 3:41.53 2010 <p> 3:41.86 2008 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer , a household name at home , is the only swimmer in history ever to crack 48.5 over and 15mins over . Ryk Neethling , of South Africa , was among others with a broad stretch of quality across the distances , from 48.34 in the to in the . Hard to maintain those kind of ranges simultaneously , Neethling 's best speed coming long after his best 1500 speed . Park , his best from 2012 and his best from this year , dropped the free from his program at nationals this year . <p> In Incheon come September , Park faces China 's double Olympic ( 400 , 1500 ) and triple World champion ( 400 , 800 , 1500 ) Sun Yang . The Korean 's record at Asian Games includes the 200 , 400 and 1500 golds in 2006 and 100 , 200 and 400 title in 2010 . <p> At London 2012 , Park took silver in both the , behind France 's Yannick Agnel , and free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shanghai .

Park can swim around 1.45.0 and 3.43.5 at Pan Pacs and probably 1.44.6 and 3.42.0 at Asian Games . <p> Steve Thomas August 15 , 2014 <p> I noticed that dual Olympic gold medallist Tunisia Ous Mellouli is also slated to swim the free and 400IM but not the here on the Gold Coast too although not aware of any significant times posted in 2014 <p> Craig Lord August 15 , 2014 <p> Steve : Ous has 2014 times of 1:50.13 , 3:50.85 and , 200 , 400 and 1500 . <p> August 15 , 2014 <p> I love watching Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact to Park 's impressive range , he swam 22.74 and 14:47.38 in the same night at the Sydney titles in February 2010 . <p> The 200 free final in Gold Coast will be crazy though . The prelims will also be very fast as the americans will fight it out among themselves to secure the place in the finals , and thus a step closer to the worlds berth . <p> Bad Anon August 15 , 2014 <p> The heats @ the pan pacs are particularly important for Americans . That 's how Phelps lost out on a chance to swim 400IM in shanghai ; though he eventually made the olympic team he did n't  medal in the 400IM .... Americans will be well aware of how those heat swims could ultimately affect their rio2016 dreams <p> August 16 , 2014 <p> Tend to agree with BA on this one , but am not just restricting it to the Americans . It will tell the tale on just how much " shadow-boxing " really went on at US Nats ... and whether the AUS have backed up physically and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back that was having visa issues . <p> lion August 16 , 2014 <p> PARK TAE I LOVE YOU ! ! <p> August 17 , 2014 <p> I wonder how much Park Tae Hwan will be fully tapered in Pan Pacs , since the Asian Games in Incheon , South Korea a month from now . <p> Ridley Scott 's 
 1999 , LEN , the European Swimming League , switched its Continental showcase event to even years to avoid a clash with a changing World Championships schedule . FINA moved from holding its global event every four to every two years and by doing so , the world body had to host in uneven years to avoid a class with the Olympic Games . <p> That clash moved onto LEN 's plate . So these days , every four years in Olympic cycles , the continental event has become a lottery when it comes to whether the very best across all events as it once was is the show we get . <p> The cycle is a touch different , the European showcase the highlight of the long-course year for all but the Brits , who this year have already excelled at the Commonwealth Games . Berlin will be a second boiling battle . <p> But for a case of illness here ( Siobhan-Marie O'Connor , GBR ) and a rescheduling of programme there ( Ranomi Kromowidjojo , NED ) , an injury here ( Daniel Gyurta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choice at a time of needing to adjust there ( Michael Jamieson , GBR ) , the vast majority of big guns will be in the water and out to win . <p> Two years ago in Debrecen , the hosts , Hungary , emerged top of the medals table with 9 gold , 10 silver and 7 bronze for 26 in all , with Germany next home ( 8 gold , 17 medals in all ) , then Italy ( 6 , 18 ) , France with a more bountiful moment in mind come London 2012 ( 4 , 11 ) , Spain ( 3 , 7 ) and Sweden ( 2 , 8 ) . Britain took two silvers , down in 14th , a silver and a bronze for Russia in 16th , one silver for the Dutch and Denmark not even at the meet as far as its big hitters went . <p> The picture will be somewhat different this time round as the bulk of the 900 athletes from 44 nations do battle beyond a great week for the Dutch in Open Water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chasing in the pool after two golds on the lake in the temporary pool sunk into the underground velodrome at the Europa-Park complex . <p> Action is on live webcast for all but those actually in Germany : unless people here actually watch it live on TV ( and not all will be ale to do that , especially for heats , they they are locked out , the webcast geo-restricted to suit broadcast rights . An anomaly of the modern age . Thankfully , we 'll be there to witness it real-time . <p> Meanwhile , here 's a quick trawl of some of the national teams gunning for a show towards the top of the medals table tomorrow : a day-by-day trawl of the stars of the show , the events and the podium pretenders . <h> The Danish Divas <p> Under the guidance of Australian coach Shannon and British performance manager Nick Juba , the Danish women 's program is going from strength to strength . Not easy in a nation of Denmark 's size to keep several world-class acts firing all at once . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Jeanette Ottesen entertains the coaches by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Jeanette Ottesen , Lotte Friis , Rikke Moeller Pedersen , Mie Nielsen and Pernille Blume all have the capacity to travel with a gold medal in their pockets back across the border shared with their neighbour when Berlin business is done . Ottesen , over freestyle in 2011 and butterfly in 2013 , is the one with the world l/c titles , the rest not far off , Blume courtesy of the firepower she shares with her medley teammates , minus Friis , the distance ace who claim silver in epic battles over 800 and free with Katie Ledecky in Barcelona last year , and Pedersen a world record holder . <p> Ottesen 's top chances : dash ' fly and free with Sarah Sjostrom and Fran Halsall ( among others , which goes for the rest of the list ahead ) ; Friis , the 800 and with Mireia Belmonte and Britain 's Jazz Carlin ; Nielsen in the 50 and backstroke ; Pedersen in all three breaststroke challenges , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the raw speed of Ruta Meilutyte back from a Youth Olympics quest in Nanjing and Blume in the the medley relay beyond her solo efforts . <p> For Pedersen Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer , the meet offers a chance to celebrate what she was denied at a home European s/c Championships in Herning last December : that moment when gold means you get to acknowledge the admiration of the crowd as the winner rather than have to wait for Yuliya Efimova 's positive test to come in and grant a victory far from the thrill of a championship crowd more marvellous in the moment than madding . ( See the foot of this article for more on Russia ) . <h> The Challenge for France <p> The two Camilles are gone , retired , Lacourt injured . No Fred Bousquet either . France , Europe 's top swimming nation on the strength of London 2012 and Barcelona 2013 , has had weakness in it 's front line added to enduring weakness in its ranks when taking in the whole spectrum and death of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair this year . <p> All is far from lost , of course . Olympic champions Florent Manaudou Photo : Speedo and Yannick Agnel , from 50 to , are clear title hopes and the men 's relays remain strong : they will be joined by Mehdy Metella and Fabien Gilot in the 4 ? 100 free , while Jeremy Stravius is at hand to take on backstroke in the medley relay , in which France is reigning world champion ( courtesy of USA disqualification on a last day of action in Barcelona that delivered two golds for Lacourt after his 50 back victory ) . On the women 's side , the picture is fairly bleak , best medal hopes with Charlotte Bonnet and Lara Grangeon . <p> If there is a year for anyone to take stock and keep the focus on the 2016 prize , this is it . Perhaps France has a plan ... <h> The Return Of Britain <p> And talking of plans , Britain has not really figured in a full-team European meet since 1999 . It is not as though they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone in 2010 taking a record haul for a Brit of five medals , including two crowns . Even so , the 21-strong Berlin-bound shoal ( two are gone , Siobhan-Marie O'Connor through illness and Robbie Renwick for ' personal reasons ' ) is the first from GBR in 15 years to take on a serious team-wide European campaign , relationships having soured somewhat when Berlin last hosted the continental showcase in 2002 . <p> Late in the day , Germany agreed to a switch in dates to avoid a broadcasting clash with the World Athletics Championships and in so doing held the swim event on the same dates as Manchester was set to stage the Commonwealth Games . <p> I recall asking Christa Thiel , then and now head of the DSV ( German swim fed ) , whether she regretted that one of LEN 's founder members would not be able to attend the continental championships for the first time since it all began in 1926 . Her reply : " All are welcome " . A politician 's answer if ever there was one . <p> Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Berlin flushed with confidence , no fewer than eight Commonwealth champions making up almost half of its squad . It says much for the progress of the national team that nine of their number enter the European fray at the helm of the continental rankings even when Olympic silver medallist Michael Jamieson and Commonwealth and World Short-Course champion Hannah Miley have chosen to bypass Berlin . <p> Just how two peak moments within a month will play out for British swimmers remains to be seen . Bill Furniss , Britain head coach , notes : <p> " There is no doubt that the effort and professionalism we have just witnessed in Glasgow will be of the same , very high standard but the challenge will be to see if we can bounce from one competition to another and keep that quality of performance . " <p> Commonwealth gold will not be enough for a match in Berlin in some events and rankings reflect the fact that Britain and no others have raced in international championship waters at peak already this year . Even so , it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength among boys just turning men . If James Guy ( left ) , 18 , has an advantage of almost over the next best in Europe this year over freestyle , then breaststroke champions of Glasgow , Adam Peaty , 19 , and Ross Murdoch ( right , photo : Ian MacNicol ) , 20 , are a class apart on the clock . <p> Then there 's Ben Proud , 19 , Chris Walker-Hebborn ( left ) and Liam Tancock at the helm of the Europen backstroke ranks , and Roberto Pavoni , with the top 400IM time going into a battle that will require a test to 4:10 and better in Berlin for those with gold in mind . Among women , top hopes rest with Fran Halsall in the freestyle , Jazmin Carlin in the freestyle and Georgia Davies in the backstroke . <p> Furniss noted the Commonwealth priority for British swimmers because of funding models before he added that " ... everyone else in Berlin will be focused solely on the European Championships " . Which takes us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> German swimmers and coaches attended a press conference at their base in Potsdam last Wednesday . The only health issue was a sprained knee for head coach Henning Lambertz , his injury sustained on camp in Sardinia . . The limping coach , who twisted his knee during the training camp in Sardinia , is the only one injured . <p> Team and sprinter Dorothea Brandt Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer , gunning for honours in the freestyle and breaststroke at the top of her list , noted that team bonding had been strong because of camp and the gathering of the squad in Potsdam . Defending champion in the 200 and freestyle and on the German quartet that claimed 4x200m gold in 2012 , Paul Biedermann leads the gold chase . <p> Britta Steffen was a triple gold medal winner last time round . Now retired , her speed will be missed on relays . The other two German champions back at Debrecen 2012 were Jenny Mensing ( backstroke ) and Sarah ( breaststroke ) . The pace of things will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freestyle and butterfly , his brother Markus , top of the pile in the medley , and Marco Koch on breaststroke stand alongside in the club of best title shots on the team . All men 's relays are podium chasers , too . <h> Hungary More Than Triple defenders Hosszu &amp; Cseh <p> Hosts of the last two outings , Hungary will be hoisted by the haul of Katinka Hosszu . Beyond the Iron Lady of the pool , Gergo Kis will defend the freestyle crown , L ? szl ? Cseh Photo : Aniko Kovacs the butterfly and both medley titles , while D ? niel Gyurta has opted out of the breaststroke defence . <p> The multi-talented siblings , Evelyn and David , also feature high on the list of Magyar targets , both medal hopes over 400IM . <p> Among other medal hopes among men are Gergely Gyurta on distance freestyle , Bence ? on butterfly and backstroke specialist Peter Bernek .

Teenage ' fly aces in the making , Tamas will not race in Berlin but at the Youth Olympics in Nanjing . <h> Italy Distances Aces To The Fore <p> Gregorio Paltrinieri Photo : arena and Gabrielle Detti stand out on the world rankings over and respectively this year . They lead Italy 's charge , Paltrinieri , over 30 laps , one of six title defences for Italy . Two years ago , Filippo Magnini claimed the free crown in 48.77 . It may take a touch more this time round , while Fabio won the breaststroke and both he and Magnini shared a second gold as members of the winning 4x100m medley quartet . Among women , Federica Pellegrini claimed the freestyle title on the way to disappointment at London 2012 . She remains among title favourites for the 200 and freestyle , her silver behind Missy Franklin over at world titles last year confirming that even in a " " year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia In The Spotlight <p> There once was a time not that long ago when China was the pariah of world swimming , so soaked in doping had its program become . The abuse of athletes back home , the airport seizures , the large number of positives tests at the tip of an iceberg of woe and beyond all of that the role as a nation that others looked upon as one would look upon a thief : they were out to steal what was rightfully someone else 's . <p> Russian is not quite there on numbers and those who arrive in Berlin may well be clean athletes who have worked hard for what they are about to receive . And yet , the world trains its spotlight on Russian swimming with ever greater focus . And quite rightly so : the nation , if we are to believe its sport minister , is one FINA , LEN or A RUSADA catch shy of a two-year ban from the sport in the wake of Yuliya Efimova 's positive and two cases still pending ( after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to lose : if reputation and the denial of all those in its swimming ranks who are training and racing clean are paramount , then the hosting of the next FINA World Championships in Kazan next year is at stake : under FINA rules , a banned member can not engage with the rest of the membership during a suspension . <p> Russia will be in the gold hunt in Berlin , with Vladimir Morozov at the helm of the men and Daria K Ustinova at the helm of the women . Both men and women have strong chances in relays . <p> Ustinova is among those whose name appears in the FINA doping case file . She tested positive for ( Class S.6 Stimulants ) following a doping control test at the Russian National Swimming Championships in Volgograd back in 2012 . She was 14 . <p> Her age counted for much and Ustinova was let off with a warning and reprimand , her case paling by comparison to a case of child abuse added to FINA 's case file in the same month : Li @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time " tested positive to the substance EPO ( Class S.2 Peptides Hormones ) following a doping control test conducted out-of-competition by China Swimming Association in cooperation with CHINADA . The China Swimming Federation imposed a sanction of two ( 2 ) years ' ineligibility and a fine of RMB 5 ' 000 on Ms. Li starting from 31 March 2012 . The same sanction was applied to her coach Wang Jun . The Liaoning Provincial Swimming Association also received a warning and the obligation to cover the costs of twenty ( 20 ) doping controls . " <p> Someone should have gone to jail , of course . A criminal offence in other parts of the world , Europe included , to feed PEDs ( particularly those carrying the dangers that come with EPO ) to under-age athletes . <p> In Russia , Ustinova 's case was reported with three other positives from the same national championships : <p> Kseniya Moskvina ( RUS ) Methylhexaneamine second violation of anti-doping rules 6 years bar ( the end of a career , effectively ) <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to account no explanation given as to how swimmers under the guidance of the same group of people and two of them having fallen foul of anti-doping rules before could have come to have had banned substances in their systems . <p> Of late SwimVortex has heard troubling tales from two sources from within Russia : their claims point to a cultural problem in which some regard cheating as standard procedure . Only Russians know what is truly happening in Russia . <p> The picture is complex and not all cases are related , Efimova 's downfall made in California and in the mistake she is said to have made . There are those who feel sorry for Efimova and they include those who ruled on the case , the level of mercy to be measured in the fact that the Russian , will only have been out of racing for just over a year should she make her return in time for a home World Championships in Russia next year . <h> Comments <p> Wth regard to the Hungarian roster , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youth Olympics <p> Craig Lord August 16 , 2014 <p> Thanks Kim <p> KeithM August 16 , 2014 <p> Too bad SOM is n't healthy .

Going on their anti doping website I do think that they are serious in cleaning up their act and have introduced Whereabouts and the Passport system . But mud does stick . <p> Steve : The official policy in 2006 was that there would be no taper from training , according to the quotes in my archive of Times articles .

" . The reason was : Melbourne 2007 worlds was little over half a year away and all focus was Beijing 2008 . Berlin will be the first Europeans since 1999 at which Britain is not officially saying ' we 're swimming through ' ... those gunning for medals in Berlin are folk who have had a great Commonwealths and arrive here rested and ready to see how they can back up again ( a different sort of test ) ... what no-one is saying on an official level is ' we 're swimming through at a time of training for a bigger moment ...

 of racing in the temporary pool sunk into the Europa-Park Velodrome at the 32nd European Championships , we take a look at some of the stars gunning for gold over the coming seven days . <p> Sweden may struggle to figure among the top nations when it comes to team wide success but one swimmer can do a lot of damage : Sarah Sjostrom 's form this year raises the prospect of a bountiful haul in a week in which the clock plays second-fiddle to the ability to race and win . <h> Sprint Showdown <p> Over at Pan Pacs this week coming , Australians Cate and Bronte Campbell look set to hold sway in sprint freestyle events . In the Commonwealth dash last month , both were pipped by England 's Fran Halsall , whose 23.96 took down the world textile best of 23.98 that made Sweden 's Sarah Sjostrom a pioneer as the first woman ever to crack without the significant buoy of shiny suits banned since January 1 , 2010 . <p> With Ranomi Kromowidjojo out of race action this summer as she makes changes to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 50 and freestyle crowns , Halsall and Sjostrom lead the dash charge on freestyle , with the likes of Jeanette Ottesen ( DEN ) a whisper away . All eyes on that , then , but perhaps even more on the wings of a butterfly challenge with the same three protagonists that transcends the race even in championship waters given the Beamonesque nature of Sjostrom 's stand in Boras at Swedish nationals . <p> At any other moment in history , Halsall 's Glasgow 2014 win of 25.20 Photo : Gian Mattia D'Alberto / would have rippled out across world waters as ' the best there 's ever been ' : the time did not quite get to the world mark that had stood to another Swedish sprinter , Therese Alshammar , at 25.07 since the Rome shiny suits circus semis , but it got past the 25.43 at which Ottesen had set the best unassisted time ever for the world title in 2013 and inside the time that replaced it : 24.23 by Sjostrom in heats in Boras on the way to a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while yet . <p> Boras was outdoors ; perhaps the wind had helped , some suggested . Understandable that deeper explanation was on everyone 's mind . The clock in the final stopped at 24.43 . That would make Sjostrom Photo : arena 119th best among men dash flyers this year ( by comparison , Katie Ledecky 's 3:58 world mark in the free ranks her just shy of 300th in the world among men this year ) ; Sjostrom 's ' fly time would also rank her ninth in the world this year , swifter than the national titles of the USA and the season best of all other nations barring five , within of the season best national-title winning effort of Kromowidjojo and within of Ottesen 's national record and lifetime best on freestyle . <p> And all in a week in which all her other swims were in line with expectation . A perfect storm of flatlining , breathless supremacy with a touch of wind-assistance in a race in which all but two swimmers produced solid lifetime personal bests through the wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know more when the clock stops in Berlin . Suffice it to say that with Sjostrom , Halsall and Ottesen in the water , the free and ' fly dash challenges will be charged with rare voltage . <p> Of the three , Sjostrom has the most on her plate : the world butterfly champion stretches to being favourite for the two-lap ' fly crown , the two-lap freestyle crown , among favourites for the free title and then there are relays in the mix . Not hard to see a haul of at least five medals . <p> The record haul by a woman belongs to Germany 's Franziska van Almsick : six golds and a silver at Sheffield in 1993 , three of the golds and the silver in individual events . <h> The Iron Lady Goes Iron Plated <p> And talking of record hauls , what chance for the Iron Lady who has just gone Iron Plated with a new logo that puts a brand on multi-missions . <p> Hard to imagine that Katinka Hosszu approaches a championship race without any sense of butterflies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunt for top honours but if anyone knows how the challenge of race day feels and how to handle it , the Hungarian does . makes for a perfect production , so the thunking goes and history is full of evidence that it works ( with first-night nerves and mistakes in the mix among the very best in the business too ) . <p> World champion over 200 and medley last year , four years on from the 400 medley crown in odd circumstance in Rome and two years beyond disappointment and frustration at London 2012 , Hosszu is in the hunt for titles across a wide range of events . <p> Of her 10 challenges IM , IM , free , free , free , back , back , back , fly , fly it is not hard to imagine her making the podium in at least half of them , with a couple more events offering the prospect of outside but certainly not remote chance . There are worthy opponents at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man she married , Hosszu Photo : Aniko Kovacs enters favourite for both medley titles . The no longer delivers the new challenge that had taken shape of an 18-year-old Brit who is going from strength to strength : Commonwealth champion Siobhan-Marie O'Connor has withdrawn through illness . <p> At home in Budapest in 2010 and then again in Debrecen in 2012 , Hosszu claimed triple gold . In 2010 , it was butterfly and medley and then the 4x200m freestyle ( plus a silver in the 400IM ) and she was a European l/c champion for the first time . In 2012 , it was butterfly and both medleys ( plus a silver in the 4x200m free ) . <p> The long medley in Berlin brings another Brit into Hosszu 's focus , Aimee Willmott and the one opponent who can claim to match the Hungarian 's race-day mileometer , Spain 's Mireia Belmonte , the Olympic butterfly silver medallist who will also challenge for the long ' fly crown with Hosszu . <h> Mireia Belmonte " everything " is possible <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool ( open water ) , Mireia Belmonte Photo : Patrick B.

" He added : <p> " She then becomes a senior only and that makes her life easier to operate . We 're mindful that these are the last two titles that she has n't got in her treasury . She 's got Olympics , world , world school games ... these two would be the last two boxes to tick .

Butterfly aside in Berlin , it may be too soon for Britain 's Ben Proud , 19 to muscle in on the freestyle parade of the likes of Florent Manaudou ( FRA ) and Vladimir Morozov ( RUS ) but he and they will at least get a taste of where things are going on the way to Rio 2016 as double Commonwealth champion who claimed gold in the company of the likes of James Magnussen , Cameron McEvoy and Roland Schoeman . <p> Between 19 and 21 , Alex Popov knocked a second off his dash best en route to the 1992 Olympic crown in 21.91 .

 the 19-year-old Commonwealth breaststroke who races for his second senior international title this evening in the breaststroke at the 32nd European Championships , has landed a kit deal with Arena to run through the Rio Olympic Games to the end of 2016 . <p> Peaty , coached in Derby by former British international Mel Marshall , made the British junior team in 2012 , racing at the European Junior Championships in Antwerp , where he swam in all 3 breaststroke events and finished 5th in the final . <p> His first national senior medals came at the 2013 British Championships in Sheffield , with silver and bronze in 50 and 100 breaststroke , a maiden voyage inside the minute unfolding at Youth nationals the same year . <p> The 2013 season ended with his senior debut for Britain at the European Short Course Championships in Herning , Denmark , with personal bests in all three breaststroke events . <p> His arrival as a major international title challenger was announced in the rounds of the breaststroke events at Glasgow 2014 .

In the winning 4x100m medley for England , Peaty split a 58.59 to conclude a tremendous week in Glasgow with a second gold . Says peaty : <p> " I was thrilled with my results at the Commonwealth Games , not only with the two gold and one silver medals but also the way I raced throughout the week of heats , semi finals and finals .

 championship season , Tyler Clary was largely flying under the radar . While most of the chatter hinged on what to expect from Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte , Clary simply went about his business at SwimMac Carolina . Obviously , the training he has done under the guidance of David Marsh has clicked perfectly , for Clary has enjoyed one of the best summers of any Team USA athlete . <p> Snaring his third individual medal of the competition , Clary earned gold in the 200 backstroke at the Pan Pacific Championships with a narrow victory over Japan 's Ryosuke Irie , . Irie was trying to complete a backstroke double after winning the 100 back earlier in the meet . As for Clary , his gold completed a full set of medals at Pan Pacs , complementing his silver in the 400 individual medley and bronze in the 200 butterfly . Australian Mitchell Larkin won the bronze in 1:55.27 , with American Ryan Murphy fourth in 1:56.17 . <p> There 's never been any doubt concerning Clary 's international presence . After all , he is the reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple medalist on the global stage . Yet , racing in a country which also features Phelps and Lochte , Clary has n't received his due recognition . Nonetheless , he has simply done the work necessary to excel at the most critical of times , and that dedication has been rewarded . At Nationals , Clary provided the evidence that he was in fine form with wins in the 400 medley and 200 back , along with a silver in the 200 butterfly . He has merely carried the momentum forward . His winning time in the 200 backstroke was just off his season best of 1:54.73 from Nationals . <h> Men Backstroke <p> 1 <p> <p> Ryosuke Irie JPN , 25 <p> Asian Games KOR , Incheon <p> 2 <p> <p> Kosuke Hagino JPN , 21 <p> Japanese National Championships JPN , Tokyo <p> 3 <p> <p> Tyler Clary USA , 26 <p> US National Championships USA , Irvine <p> 4 <p> <p> Xu CHN , 20 <p> Asian Games KOR , Incheon <p> 5 <p> <p> Mitchell Larkin AUS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irie coming into the final as the top seed and with the fastest time in the world this year , a 1:53.91 from the Japanese National Championships , Clary knew he was in for a major test . Irie took command during the first half of the race , but Clary started to close the deficit over the last 100 meters . By the 150-meter mark , Clary was within a half-second and his closing split of 28.70 , to the 29.41 of Irie , proved to be the difference . <p> " I wanted to see what the field was going to do , and just hang with them and let them dictate the pace of the race , because I knew with how this summer 's been going that the last leg of every one of my races has been pretty good , " Clary said . " I wanted to lean on that a little bit tonight , and by pacing put myself in a position to use that opportunity .

 medley was supposed to be among the highlights of the Pan Pacific Championships , the event set up for a three-way clash between a Japanese upstart and the two most accomplished athletes the shorter medley has ever seen . Well , the event lived up to the hype , albeit with a major twist . <p> Clocking 1:56.02 , Japan 's Kosuke Hagino fought off a late charge by three-time defending Olympic champion Michael Phelps ( 1:56.04 ) and completed a sweep of the medley events . But Hagino only shared the fastest time of the evening , as Ryan Lochte matched the 1:56.02 during his triumph . Lochte was relegated to the B Final after a miscalculation during his prelim swim left the world-record holder as the third-fastest American , behind Phelps and Tyler Clary . Pan Pacific rules allow only two athletes per nation in the final . <p> What would have unfolded had Lochte been in the championship final , thus generating the three-man showdown that was anticipated ? Obviously , there is no concrete answer to that question , but it 's reasonable to believe Lochte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hagino and Phelps into faster times . Alas , that is not the scenario which shook out and Hagino was surely fine with the official result . <p> The top-ranked man in the event this year , off his 1:55.38 from the Japanese National Championships , Hagino has been viewed over the last year as the one individual capable of disrupting the hierarchy of the 200 medley , an event in which Phelps and Lochte have accounted for the top 15 times in history and all 14 of the sub-1:55 performances which have been produced . Although his winning time was n't in the same category as the best of Phelps and Lochte , Hagino proved the Americans can be beaten . By ascending to the top step of the podium , Hagino ended a streak of 12 years in which either Phelps or Lochte won the gold medal in major international competition . During the run , Phelps won three Olympic crowns , three world titles and a Pan Pacific championship . Meanwhile , Lochte won three world titles and a Pan Pac gold . <p> Behind Hagino and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1:57.72 , with Brazilian Thiago Pereira finishing fourth in 1:57.83 .

Phelps cut his deficit slightly during the breaststroke leg and then made a big move off the wall and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 27.82 of Hagino , Phelps nearly caught the Japanese standout , and would have gotten the job done with an additional meter . But the race is not known as the individual medley and there was Hagino celebrating a major decision . In addition to winning the 200 IM and 400 IM , Hagino was the silver medalist in the 200 freestyle and 400 freestyle , and a member of Japan 's runnerup 800 freestyle relay . <p> " Today my body was hurting . I woke up this morning and I was in pain , " Phelps said . " After this morning 's race and the nap I got , I felt pretty fresh ( at night ) . I felt good . For my first real big international meet back , we accomplished everything we wanted to . We were able to find out some of the things I need to improve on over the next year . It is frustrating at times , but that 's usually how I respond well . " <p> For Phelps , his first international competition since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly with Phelps still working his way back into form after his brief retirement . Phelps left the Gold Coast with gold medals in the 100 butterfly , 800 free relay and 400 medley relay , along with silver medals in the 200 medley and 400 free relay . He also posted a solid performance in the 100 freestyle , where he finished fourth . Certainly , he has established a starting point from which to work as the 2015 World Championships and 2016 Olympic Games loom . <p> " It was , I think , a successful year , " Phelps said . " Obviously I 'd like to win every single race I swim in . But ( that ) does n't always happen . It was a learning experience . That 's most important . " <p> Given the chance to race a second time in the 200 medley , Lochte treated the consolation final as a serious affair and improved his season-best time by almost a half-second . <p> In the case of Lochte , it was a learning experience for the 30-year-old veteran . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be repeated and while he 'll only contest the 200 medley and 200 freestyle at next year 's World Champs , Lochte has the knowledge that he can battle through injury and still be effective on less-than-full preparation .

It 's impressive indeed . <p> As far as I know Denmark 's time 3:55.62 holds water , being approximately the same as Australia did earlier today . Even though one can not directly compare those times it still proves Denmark may well be a threat in the Women 's IM relay to bigger swimming nations . I hope Denmark 's golden quartet just stays healthy . <p> But Sweden was n't bad either . Their team is still young and has also room for improvement . <p> To sum it up I can see both Denmark and Sweden going approximately 3:53 3:54 in Kazan and in Rio .

 elapsed since the Commonwealth Games gave way to the Pan Pacific Championships and European Championships : ample time to digest what took place in Glasgow , on the Gold Coast of Australia and in Berlin . The upcoming Asian Games will complete the 2014 canvas as far as long-course international championships go . Only then will global perspective be complete for this cycle . <p> The midpoint of the quadrennial on the way to the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games in 2016 is a good time to conduct a review of the international scene in terms of relay standing . Which countries are in a position of strength ? Which nations have considerable work ahead ? Who is on the verge of a breakout ? Let 's take a look , starting with the men 's 400 medley relay . <h> Commanding Position for the United States <p> Of any of the six relays in the American arsenal , it 's easy to see that the 400 medley relay is the strongest .

There was n't a weak link , with Grevers , Phelps and Adrian all entering the water as reigning Olympic champions . <p> The biggest positive for the United States at Pan Pacs was the performance of Cordes , who demonstrated why he has been touted as a future star in the breaststroke for several years . After being disqualified in the 100 breaststroke earlier in the meet , Cordes turned in a split of 58.64 on the relay , an effort which spoke to the talent of Cordes . The performance was a measure of redemption for Cordes , too , as he was guilty of an early takeoff which cost the United States the gold medal at last year 's World Championships <p> The return of Phelps whose last of 18 Olympic gold medals was won in London as a member of the 4x100m medley relay before his brief retirement is significant . He has already clocked in the 100 fly during his comeback and will likely get faster as he continues to round into the form which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more Olympic medal should figure into the equation as the United States has never lost the event at the Games . Only Australia has also won the event at the Olympics , doing so while the United States boycotted the Moscow Games in 1980 . <h> Young Guns Powering Great Britain <p> At the 2012 Olympic Games in London , Great Britain finished just off the podium with a fourth-place finish , 0.74 shy of Australia 's bronze . As close as that British squad came to the podium , it could well be that none of its members make not to the final relay line-up in Rio . Why ? The development of young talent breaking through from the ranks of Europe 's best juniors to senior success this summer has helped to produce a cheerier landscape for British swimming this year after disappointment at London 2012 and just one medal to Fran Halsall at the 2013 World Championships . <p> Then , at last month 's European Championships , three of that foursome , Walker-Hebborn , Peaty , Barrett ( who fell just shy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined by Benjamin Proud they mined gold in . None of the relay members are yet 25 years old , with Peaty and Proud checking in at 19 . Surely , expectations for the next Olympiad have to be flying high , though as head coach Bill Furniss noted " there is work to be done " on the way to the far more competitive waters of the Olympic Games and a time in the sub-3:30 realm . Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Peaty has the chance to be a game-changer in the event , as his breaststroke speed was on full display between the Commonwealth Games and European Champs . Peaty split 58.55 in Berlin after 58.59 in Glasgow and with a huge upside , he has the ability to provide an event-altering split . <h> Can Australia Put Something Together ? <p> Had there been a worldwide championship meet this summer , Australia would have finished out of the medals in the medley relay . In fact , the Aussies rank just fifth on the world rankings , the result of their outing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a deep look at the relay for a full understanding of the struggles . <p> In the coming years , Australia can be expected to be much stronger on the breaststroke leg . Dealing with a shoulder injury , Christian Sprenger Photo : Speedo was off form at the Commonwealth Games and bypassed Pan Pacs in order to rest the injury . When he is in prime condition , Sprenger is one of the world 's best and a mid-58 split is already a part of his scope ( 58.47 at world titles in 2013 ) . <p> Meanwhile , with Mitchell Larkin continuing to evolve as a backstroker and the freestyle leg in the capable hands of either Cameron McEvoy or James Magnussen , the spotlight turns to the butterfly leg . At Commonwealths , Jayden Hadler split 51.81 . At Pan Pacs , Tommaso D'Orsogna covered the butterfly in 52.34 . Splits of that ilk are a major concern , as it means the yielding of at least a second to the top teams . Whether the drops come from current team members or a developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of weakness for the Australians . <h> A Japanese Freestyler Makes a Difference <p> Japan 's presence in the medley relay has been felt for years , but the missing piece has always been a reliable freestyler to bring things home . While Japan still does n't have one of the world 's big guns , the 47.76 split from Katsumi Nakamura at Pan Pacs was a welcome sight for a country which has other pieces in place . More , Shinri : Aniko Kovacs could also make a difference on the freestyle leg . <p> Taking a look at the first three legs , Japan is in good shape with Ryosuke Irie handling the backstroke duties and Yasuhiro Koseki looking like the linchpin on breaststroke . The butterfly leg is a little more in doubt , but both Hirofumi and Takuro Fujii are sub-52 performers who should split come Rio . Whether Japan can better its from Pan Pacs at the Asian Games will be an interesting storyline to follow . <h> France : Paging an Effective Breaststroker <p> At the European Championships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver medal behind Great Britain . But during that showing , there was no questioning the weak link . Jeremy Stravius was solid on backstroke and Mehdy Metella and Fabien Gilot did fine work on butterfly and freestyle . The problem was a 1:00.04 split from breaststroker Giacomo . Really , France had to be begging for the days of Hugues Duboscq . <p> The French actually have some options with their medley relay , as Florent : Patrick B. Kraemer could be anchoring by 2016 , or perhaps on the butterfly leg . Additionally , Camille Lacourt can regain his peak form and if he goes backstroke , Stravius may well be the best man to put in on butterfly as the swiftest from his country in the past four years and best ever in a textile suit on 52.04 until Metella 's 51.96 losing out to Laszlo Cseh ( HUN ) in the Berlin swim-off for the final . None of that will matter , though , if a respectable breaststroke leg can not be found . <h> The Best of the Rest <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot can change , and it will have to for some of the following countries to be a factor . If Brazil can find a serviceable backstroke leg , it has some nice pieces in place in the likes of Felipe Silva on breaststroke and several freestyle options . Meanwhile , Hungary had to feel good about the 47.08 freestyle split of Dominik Kozma to give it the bronze medal at Euros . <p> Germany , Russia and Poland also have formidable components in several areas , but these nations need to become more well-rounded in the coming year to make a real impact . If nothing else , they have starting points , and that 's better than going from scratch . The Asian Games this month will provide further clues as to the development of China 's medley relay , bolstered significantly by the progress to world No 1 on the clock over backstroke this season of 19-year-old Xu Jiayu Photo : Aniko Kovacs . <h> Comments <p> September 5 , 2014 <p> I personally think that the Chinese will leapfrog quite a few nations soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fluke ) , Ning Zetao on Freestyle ( 47.31 relay split last year ) they have two extremely solid legs . The trick is finding a and breastroker . <p> Fly I do n't think will be too much of a problem for China , especially given their YOG champion in the fly and the fact that some of their older people have split 51 . X before . Breastroke is going to be the problem but they definitely have the capacity to surprise . <p> Anthony September 5 , 2014 <p> Mehdy Metella is faster at 100 fly than now he went a 51,96 in the swim off with Lazlo at the european champs <p> Craig Lord September 5 , 2014 <p> Quite so noted ... thanks ... they now have and 10 on all-time France list after 8 shiny suit efforts just over half a second to go ... <p> I think Brasil will be right in the mix come Rio , I think they will have huge performances ( home teams always do u less it 's Britain ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are solid on breast &amp; fly &amp; Santana could be the man to beat by then in the 100fs . There will be a gold medal chance . <p> Rafael September 6 , 2014 <p> Pereira split 51 fly on pan pacs we would need someone like this to move him on back . Cielo when swimming fly on relays split 51 low already by 2011 <p> September 6 , 2014 <p> Brazil looks good if they get it together , Periera on back , Silva on breast , Cielo or santos on fly , or Santana on free . If Cielo and santos both go 22 high flat they can get out 24 low and come back 27 off relay . I 've always though South Africa could really have a good medley if they found a backstroker . I think le clos could go 53 on back honestly then they 'd have Cameron and either Dyland Bosch or on fly , hopefully brad Tandy can get his hundred together as well . <p> Billabong September 9 , 2014 <p> Team GB look to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If each member improves the amount that one would expect them to , over the next two years ....... they will blow the USA team ( listed above ) away . Unfortunately the USA has so much depth that they could easily have a new addition or two that keeps them in front . <p> mike in dallas September 10 , 2014 <p> Having just finished the better part of a year in the UK , TEAM GB is certainly coming together after what was a disaster called London 2012 ! Cuts in funding have hurt , but the Common-wealth Games and European Championships both showed that the Brits can use their up and coming talent to be serious contenders . Having seen some of them in action , they are young , they are hungry , and they are getting faster ! <p> NB : If Scotland votes to become an independent country later this month , it could be a factor ; but even then , the split of Scotland from the UK would not be completed by the time Rio comes around , if I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor . <p> September 11 , 2014 <p> I 'm seeing a number of posts where people are jumping to the conclusion that people with great 50 's are going to necessarily have a great 100 and therefore a relay option . In some cases , the names touted have passed their best over the longer distances and have switched down . With some younger names , they have yet to translate stellar 50s over to the 100 . Some may do so , some most likely will remain 50 specialists . <p> Zali September 12 , 2014 <p> When , if it will ever come true , will they allow 2 teams from a country to be entered in a relay event ? US can definitely put 2 teams in the WC or OG . It will get interesting . <p> September 12 , 2014 <p> Haha ; do n't think so . This might be seen at smaller international meets , esp with only a few countries present but ca n't see it ever being allowed at an Olympics or Worlds . There certainly have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a totally different line-up swam the finals AND where the fastest heats time was faster than the silver medal . <p> On the issues of fairness , it was a very positive move when they changed the rules so heat swimmers would also get medals . <p> Mike , the question of a SCO team in Rio does have some curious implications for GBR . GBR ranks certainly look well-almost over stocked in male BRS and a SCO team would certainly make it easier if the likes of Murdoch and Jamieson took that route . However , one suspects that , regardless of a Yes VOTE , most SCO sportspeople will stick with GBR due to assured funding .@@2757552 <p> The Jerusalem Walls

Clary pipped Irie for Pan Pacs gold last month , the virtual battle on the clock irrelevant when race day coincides . In shiny suit , Irie is also second best ever : the world record is held at 1:51.92 by Aaron Peirsol ( USA ) , the world 's leading backstroke ace of the decade past , with Irie on 1:52.51 . <p> Irie is one of the most aesthetic backstroke specialists in history , his style evoking memories of the likes of Roland Matthes , who in his day ( when wave-breakers and level-deck pools were a thing to come ) was described as the Rolls-Royce of swimming .

He always plays catch up during the stroke after being left during the turn . <p> September 30 , 2014 <p> swim fan <p> You 're right , I forgot about Seebohm . CWG do count as a major LC competition , even if the competition can sometimes be spotty , depending on the cycle of British and Aussie swimming . Though , with Sjostrom 's 24 mid swims , I sort of double-took when I saw Seebohm won a bronze with 26.29 , almost 2 full seconds slower . <p> Seebohm suffers from the Coughlin curse ... very good at a large number of events , but not truly great at very many . On one hand , Coughlin was world top-10 material in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 free , 100 free , 200 free , 100 fly and 200 IM . Indeed , she medalled in 6 different solo events at the Olympics and Worlds . However , other than the 100 back , she never really dominated an event , and she was often at best a contender for bronze in her others . Between that and a preference for a simple schedule , she never really put together a truly the board single meet ( maybe 2002 Pan Pacs ) . Likewise , Seebohm is good at a whole lot of event ( pretty much the exact same events , in fact ) but seems unlikely to win an Olympic medal in anything other than the 100 back . <p> Sadly , Hagino may suffer from the same curse . Really , that if what separates Phelps and Lochte from other modern swimmers only they have been able to rule the world in 3+ events similtaneously <p> Here are some

 a headline around the world in 1964 extract , Les Jeux Olympiques , L'Equipe <p> Dawn Fraser , the Australian pioneer of sprint swimming , returns to Japan today to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics at which she claimed an historic third victory in the freestyle and then got slapped with a 10-year ban by her national swim federation . <p> After her success in the pool , Fraser was arrested by Japanese police for attempting to take a flag to keep as a souvenir following a party on the last day of the Olympics . <p> Now 77 and an official " Australian National Living Treasure " , Fraser told AP this week that she would " think twice about souveniring a flag " . Fraser added : <p> " The flag incident was an over-reaction by swimming officials considering I had been given exemption for a week from the Olympic team when it happened . " <h> The Fraser Legend <p> Born on September 4 , 1937 , Fraser became the first woman to race inside a minute for the freestyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( freestyle ) at three consecutive Olympic Games , the Balmain Bullet might have made it four but for the high-handed bureaucracy of the Australian Amateur Swimming Union in response to the swimmer 's high jinks at the 1964 Olympic Games . <p> Fraser won her first crown in front of a cheering home crowd in Melbourne , beating teammate Lorraine by in a world record of , Australia celebrating the sweep as bronze went to Faith Leech . <p> In Rome four years later , she became the first woman to retain the title doing so in 1:01.2 some three metres ahead of American Chris Von Salza then set an Olympic record of 1:00.6 leading off an Australian freestyle relay that included Ilsa Konrads , and Alva that won the silver medal in behind a world record of , which went to the USA quartet . <p> On October 23 , 1962 , Fraser clocked over in Melbourne and made history four days later with a effort to qualify for the Commonwealth Games in Perth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark to 59.5 . On the last day of February , the 29th , in the 1964 leap year , Fraser swam the last world record of her career , in 58.9 . <p> A couple of weeks later , Fraser was driving home from a social event at a football club with her mother , sister and a friend when her car skidded and collided with a parked truck . Mrs. Fraser was killed , Dawn 's sister was knocked unconscious and Fraser herself spent six weeks in plaster while a chipped vertebra mended itself . <p> Incredibly , Fraser was back in shape seven months later and her sporting immortality was confirmed on October 13 , when she claimed the Tokyo Olympic crown in 59.5 , ahead of the second woman to break a minute , Sharon Stouder of the USA , a result described in the US as " Stouder 's silver behind Old Ma Fraser " , who was 27 by then . <p> Coached by Harry Gallagher in Sydney , Fraser was the youngest of eight children born into a working-class household in Balmain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 when , on February 21 , 1956 , she shaved off Dutchwoman Willie Den Ouden 's 20-year-old freestyle record with a 1:04.5 . The same year saw Cockie ( NED ) lower the mark to 1:04.2 and , Fraser to 1:03.3 , and then Lorraine to 1:03.2 and a stunning 1:02.4 . <p> At the Melbourne Games on December 1 , Fraser 's world record victory marked the start of a record-breaking run of nine world records and 15 years at the helm . The 58.9 with which she closed her account was equalled by Shane Gould ( AUS ) in London , April 1971 . <p> The night before the 1956 final , and her first international outing , Fraser had a nightmare , which she described in her autobiography , Below The Surface : <p> " The gun went off but I had honey on my feet and it was hard to pull them away from the starting block , I finally fought free and dived high . ... the water was n't water , it was spaghetti . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and battle stroke-for-stroke well ahead of a pack from which Faith Leech emerged as bronze medal winner to give Australia a clean sweep . Fraser celebrated by borrowing a ladder from a TV crew , climbing into the stands to hug her parents and dedicate her win to her late brother Don , the man who introduced her to swimming . <p> Eight years on , Fraser was named Australian of the Year , but just days after she had enjoyed a lap of honour in a car around Melbourne racecourse , she received a 10-year suspension by the AASU ( later , and too late for a comeback , reduced to four years ) , preventing her from defending her crown at a 1968 Olympic Games that saw the won in . <p> Her misdemeanors : parading at the Opening Ceremony in Tokyo against orders ; attempting to steal a flag in a midnight raid at the entrance of the Emperor 's Palace .

When you look at today 's problems you wonder about the weight applied if it is similar or over the top ? One thing though is that i am sure Dawn is enjoying her time and all strength to her . <p> October 9 , 2014 <p> I 've seen Dawn Fraser speak and she might well be " the most Australian woman " in the world ! That fine country could n't ask for a better , truer ambassador , at least from the sporting world . <p> Craig Lord October 9 , 2014 <p> yes , she 's true grit ... she once said to me ' listen , for the record , I did not swim the moat Tokyo like some reports said I did back then so , get it right ! " ... <p> Viva la Bang October 10 , 2014 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> October 12 , 2014 <p> What 's amazing about Fraser 's three-peat is that during her period female swimmers had very short career , and most female swimmers only went to one olympics , let alone two or three . <p> Also , in those period , world records were broken more frequently , and yet no one but Fraser alone broke and held 100 free WRs from 1956 until 1971 when Gould equaled Fraser 's last WR . Also , in the years between 1964 and 1972 when her WR was finally broken by Gould , WRs in 100 backstroke and breastroke were broken 9 and 8 times respectively , while no one touched Fraser 's last WR . One can imagine how many more medals she would have won if 50/200 free and all three relays had been olympics events back then , and how many world championships she would have won in those years , especially if there had been no ban on her . <h> They ARE out 
 all-time swim coaching legends , Peter Daland , passed away today . He died at 93 having endured Alzheimer 's in the past year . <p> If there be men whose lifelong commitment was worthy of FINA 's highest honour , Daland would surely be up the front in the queue . <p> His place in the pantheon is assured by a treasury of success stories , most notably at the height of occasions when he led the United States 1964 Olympic women 's team to triumph with six gold and the 1972 Olympic men 's team to victory , Mark Spitz at the helm of a achievement with his famous seven golds . <p> Daland played a key role in persuading Spitz to stick with his program and take to his blocks in the freestyle in Munich . He coached a galaxy of stars on a personal level , including John Naber , Dave Wharton , Mike O'Brien , Australia 's Murray Rose , Jeff Float , Joe and Mike Bottom , and Bruce and Steve Furniss . <p> " Coach Peter Daland was , without question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he led , the many he positively impacted and the contributions he made are unmatched , " said USA Swimming Executive Director Chuck Wielgus . <p> " Coach Daland carried himself in a manner that brought respect from everyone he met and for every institution he represented , including USA Swimming . The American swimming family and the international swimming community have unfortunately lost one of our sport 's most iconic figures . " <p> Jim Wood , former president of USA Swimming , summed up the feelings of many with the following tribute : <p> In the USA , Daland is a University of Southern California legend . His coaching career spanned almost a half century . <p> When Daland , who served a President of the World Swimming Coaches Association photo : with wife Ingrid and coaches George Block , left , and John Leonard , right , retired from coaching in April 1992 after 35 years at USC , he had 93 NCAA individual and relay titles to his credit . His personal charges won seven gold and two silver medals at the 1976 Olympic Games alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 14 AAU Men 's Team Titles to his credit , Daland was the 1962 ASCA " Coach of the Year " , the 1976 National Collegiate &amp; Scholastic Swimming Trophy recipient . and the 1975 recipient of the AAU Swimming Award . <p> When he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame , the citation read : " He is the only coach to have won all three major national team championships " , including 2 National AAU Women 's ( LAAC ) crowns . <p> Daland began in New York City graduating from Swarthmore in 1948 and got his first coaching job at Rose Valley , PA , where he won 8 straight Suburban League titles ( 1947-55 ) . He founded and was first coach of the Philadelphia Suburban Swim Club and served as an assistant to Bob Kiphuth at Yale before deciding to take Horace Greeley 's advice and head west in 1956 as coach of USC and the Los Angeles Athletic Club . In 1958 , he returned to Yale with 5 USC Freshmen and won the National AAU Team Title from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Swimming Hall of Fame was assured a long time ago but his presence there is not confined to a plinth : generations of aquatic achievers who have been recognised include in the shadow of their citations the name Peter Daland among those who recommended them for honour . <h> A Towering Contribution <p> " He looks and sounds more like a tweedy Ivy League philosophy professor , " The Los Angeles Times once wrote , " and he 'd just as soon the spotlight never found him . " <p> Daland was born in New York City on April 12 , 1921 . Raised in suburban Philadelphia , Daland 's father , Eliot , was an aircraft and helicopter engineer . Like father , like son , at 90 Daland the father was still developing a type of hovercraft ; at 90 Daland the son was celebrating his birthday in the company of leading figures and friends in the world swim community and throughout his 80s was still a constant presence at events around the world , one of his roles that of expert and keen observer of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he remained the eyes and ears of USA Swimming . <p> During World War II , Daland served in the Army Signal Corps . After the war , he studied at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania . At college , he ran and took part in long jump , while serving as captain of a swim team that he would also coach twice a week . His take on his own athletic prowess in water : " I was not a good swimmer you have to have a feel for water and what I could do was see who had just that . " <p> After graduating in 1948 , he worked fora short while at a medical books publisher and spent his spare time coaching a swimming club not far from Philadelphia . It was from 1950 to 1954 that the passion took off and tipped into excellence learned in the best of company : he was an assistant swimming coach at Yale under Robert J. H. Kiphuth , USA Olympic coach at the 1928 , 1932 , 1936 and 1948 Games and known as " The Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind sprints " innovation was developed by Australians into interval training . <p> In 1952 , Daland and Kiputh co-founded Swimming World Magazine . After that grounding , Daland began 16 years of coaching at the Los Angeles Athletic Club in 1956 . The U.S.C. job he took was part-time until 1972 . <p> " I saw it as a fascinating thing , college swimming , " Daland once told me . " Yale had a great team , terrific kids , fine students . I thought to myself ' This is the world in which I 'd like to spend my life ' . " <p> USC offered Daland a year to coach kinds in a pool so archaic it was known as " The Dungeon " . Done deal . Respect was part of the equation when Daland dealt with his swimmers . <p> " He saw a very clear line of distinction between the coach and the swimmers , " Naber , the four-time Olympic gold medallist of 1976 , once told the LA Times . " In fact , a reporter once asked him why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won a national championship , as other teams did with their coaches , and his response was , ' I would n't hear of it . ' What this accomplished was , it kept us in great regard for him and it brought the swimmers closer together as a team . " <p> Twenty years on from Munich 1972 , in the year of his retirement from college swimming , Daland could be found championing the cause in the The New York Times : " If we can keep college swimming strong , and if we can keep the age-group program churning out future Olympians , and if we can keep promising youngsters in the sport if , if , if the United States will remain the world 's strongest swimming nation . " <p> In his " retirement " years , Daland was a WSCA leader and fierce critic of doping and what he saw as the tolerance of it by FINA . In the 1990s , he was to be found arm in arm with other outspoken coaches , swimmers and media as China made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left off . For Daland , that link was heart-felt : he led an American team to victory over the GDR and USSR at a tri-meet inn 1971 and then watched as the world turned on performance-enhancement . <p> Daland was a man who could persuade , who could make an athlete believe . When Spitz looked set to buckle under the pressure of expectation in Munich in 1972 after a string of gold medals , Daland stepped in . Years later , Daland told me : <p> " He thought there was a strong chance that he 's lose the free to Jerry Heidenreich , US teammate and he did n't want a silver to soil a whole lot of gold . Sherm Chavoor , Spitz 's personal coach told him he 'd be seen a ' chicken ' is he pulled out . He was still unsure but I told him that he was in the shape of his life , this was his moment , there was nothing he could n't do and that he 'd regret it forever if he did n't honour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't look at his best to me . But that was n't the point . I told him that I 'd never seen him looking so good . I told him how great he was and what a golden opportunity he had . He swam it and he won . That 's how you had to talk to Mark sometimes to get him to do what we knew he could do . " <p> Reflecting on his career in a chat we had in 2006 , Daland said : " I still feel the losses more than anything . They hurt and they live with you . I never looked back and thought ' was n't that great ' ; more its been a case of thinking what we could'a done better . The things that grate are the recruits you never got , the kids who should have stood on an Olympic podium but never made the team . I always felt those things badly . <p> " The coach is there to unlock every possibility in the swimmer . When someone falls short , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and nowadays , the thing I love most is to see talent rise up and the thing that hurts most is the poor governance of world swimming . " <p> Daland was a gentleman , a swimming scholar , a keen observer , a man full of tales from the road that provided insight to moments we thought we knew about , complete with a reminder to " do the right thing " and " let those who say they run swimming know how we feel about the sport that belongs to us " . <p> There were a couple of occasions on which I had the privilege of spending hours in his company talking over breakfast that spilled into mid-morning coffee . With Daland , it always felt as though the conversation ended too early . He always had another gem up his sleeve . And what he was good at , too , was motivating others to recognise their skills and talents and honour them . He often said : <p> " Competitive swimming is preparation for life . " <p> Daland was a kind man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note Daland wrote in a signed copy of one of his books . I wo n't repeat it here but it speaks to the simplicity and directness of the messages he wanted to get across for the betterment of swimming and the potential in unlocking the very best in all of us . <p> I first became aware of Daland at seven when my father told me about his achievements . I met him in my teens and I interviewed him several times later in life as a journalist . He was a man who greeted you as if each meeting was just a day after the last time you met . <p> Daland always maintained : " The best people in the world are in swimming . " One of them no longer is though his impact and his memory will live on long into the future . <p> Daland is survived by his wife , Ingrid , whom he married in 1964 ; two sons from a previous marriage , George and Roger ; a son , Peter Jr. , and two daughters , Bonnie and Leslie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Condolences to his family from SwimVortex and this author , to whom Daland was a mentor , a friend and a font of wisdom .

I know that I still have an accent , but 13 years ago my English was n't good at all . Peter being his polite and sweet self , commented on my English at the end of our conversation by saying : " It is amazing . You have no accent at all ! " My response was : " Peter , you must feel that way because you are married to a German woman . " And we laughed . This little story had been an inside joke between us ever since . Over the years Peter shared some great stories with me about his experience travelling to the former East Germany as a coach . They were nothing short of amazing and a great first hand history lesson for me . Then in 2008 I had the honor to work with Peter on his book The History of Olympic Swimming , Volume 1 , when I assisted him in finding the right pictures to illustrate his stories .

 Part 1 <p> In the first of a new series " FINA Future " , SwimVortex asks " What is It ; Who are They ; How is It Built and How does it Work " . <p> The series destination : the betterment of swimming and what FINA must do to get there from where it is . <p> The purpose is not to hunt down the guilty but to gather and share deeper understanding of how the umbrella body for aquatic sports functions in order to consider what it is getting right , where it is going wrong , which structures should be underpinned and which need demolishing . <p> Is FINA fit for purpose and is it working in the best interests of the constituency it is supposed to serve ? Easy to spot many ways in which it is ; not hard to see where things could be much better . <p> We start by looking at the structure of FINA . To some this is fairly academic stuff but it is the best place to start because the structure of the international federation may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in another fine mess , this time by wading into world politics at a time of high sensitivity and in a place where conflict and doping collided to create a perfect storm of controversy that should have and could so easily have been avoided . <p> Why " FINA " in parenthesis will become clearer but in short the international federation is a collective of many people and even where you might point to Mr. A or Mr B. as having done X and Y , the thought process can not stop there , the question clear : why did the checks and balances built into the FINA Constitution , its rulesand By outline and define the duties and responsibilities of those who govern at the top table and tiers below it fail to prevent those moves that are met with an instant response from the wider world of swimming : " How the hell did that happen ? " <p> " Officials shall remain politically neutral in accordance with the principles and objectives of FINA , the confederations , associations , leagues and clubs and generally act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In my view it is clear that awarding Vladimir Putin FINA 's highest honour a decision that was taken without consultation with the wider membership of the international federation nor , I am led to understand , with the full agreement and vote of the ruling Bureau was anything but a " politically neutral " act , particularly not at this moment in history . <p> The move begged the question : should FINA ever honour state leaders given the obvious potential for backlash that screams ' best stick to what 's on your label " Water is our World " , not world politics . <p> Rendering unto sport that which belongs to sport , the parallel problem is clear , too , and prompted protest from leading coaches : honour had been bestowed on a head of state at a time when his nation happens to have a woeful doping count , the highest in the world during the past two years in swimming . As far as I am aware , not his fault ( and indeed the Russian sports minister has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole-nation ban ) any more than it is the fault of any head of state when people decide to cheat . Even so an award for Putin , who the head of state , is an award for Russia is an award for Russian Swimming at a time when such things ought to be avoided by an international federation whose Constitution and rules , not to mention swimming 's signature on the dotted line of the WADA Code , scream ' Thou Shalt Not Dope " . <p> A little over a week has passed since I resigned from the FINA Press Commission . Against a backdrop of Putin and the sums of money that change hands in staging global sports events , the work of those tasked with ensuring good working conditions and flow of information to journalists is small beer . Still , as Tolkien would have it and as we will show here : small things can matter a great deal , for it is in the detail of how FINA functions that we find the answer to the question " How the hell did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushed , this opening consideration to be followed soon by Part 2 , those two articles to stay in focus for the next few of weeks on the way to suggesting answers to the question : " How does swimming make things better by improving the way it is governed ? " <p> We start by asking : <p> What is FINA ? <p> What was its original mission and what now is its modern zeal ? <p> How is the hierarchy and governance of FINA constructed ? <h> What is FINA ? <p> The Early Years 1908-1919 : At a time when he was President of the Amateur Swimming Association , a body founded in England in 1869 , George Hearn chaired a meeting at the Manchester Hotel , London right , on July 19 , 1908 , at which the Federation Internationale de Natation ( FINA ) was founded . <p> The meeting coinciding with the first Olympic Games to be hosted by Britain 's capital after the 1906 Mount Vesuvius eruption dictated a need for Italy to spend its money rebuilding Naples and not investing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was agreed by a committee of 23 , including eight from Britain , that from that time on , " England , Scotland , Ireland and Wales " , as noted in the minutes , would be considered as one country . That remains one of the constants in the world of FINA to this day . <p> The pioneer committee wasted no time in establishing the cornerstones of a new FINA rule book , and one of the most important decisions of the day showed the intention of those early guardians of swimming to take charge of what had been , at the international level , a very lose affiliation of swimming activities devoid of cohesion or common standards : " ... no nation shall institute , or allow to be instituted , within their jurisdiction , any Race or Competition , which shall have the title of a World 's Championship " . <p> That principal was in keeping with Hearn 's priority of codifying the Olympic aquatic sports of swimming , diving and water polo , the start of standardisation of the structures of those sports crucial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much derided over the years ( sometimes for good reason and with great development as the result ) their presence provided the framework for common practice , community and tradition to evolve . <p> Indeed , the early mission and rules laid the very foundation on which the house of FINA was built to last . Much has morphed along the way , of course . <h> The FINA Mission : Then and Now <p> In 1908 , with Hearn at the helm left , some of the key founding principles of FINA spoke to the age : amateurism , modesty and the need for standardisation in the midst of a chaos of claims to be the best at a time when hardly any two swims swum apart were alike enough to be compared . <p> A stringent definition of " amateur status " was written into the first FINA rule book , as were conditions under which records could be set , including the assertion that " no claim for Record can be considered unless all swimmers wear recognised costume with drawers under the costume " . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of today : the London 1908 meeting agreed that world records could only be set in " absolutely still water ( ie without current or tide ) " . That remains the case , though the status of some pools hosting major moments has been called into question of late . Imperial and metric measures were official , the length of pools variable back in FINA 's early years . <p> Other conditions to be met by record-breakers included the need to start from a dive , except in the case of backstroke , and for the time to be registered by a minimum of two timekeepers . In a quirk of its time , where three timekeepers could not agree , the average of all three times was registered as the record . <p> A surveyor was needed to measure the pool , and records had to be applied for within 14 days of a time being recorded . Those basic standards remain very close to original intention to this day . <p> In Paris on August 1 , 1909 , Hearn , as Honorary Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in the French capital that the first full set of FINA rules was laid down , including the principles established in London 1908 on the issues of amateur status and world records . A few pertinent pioneer rules : <p> Rule 1 established the new organisation 's name as the " Federation Internationale de Natation Amateur " , to be comprised of " all Nations or Countries who accept and agree to abide by the Rules herein contained " . <p> Rule 2 spelled out the objects of FINA as : To draw up and enforce an Amateur definition acceptable to all nationalities , and under which the Sport shall be conducted . The mutual recognition of all suspensions The Framing of Regulations , under which the Worlds sic Records alone can be recognised To ensure that all contests open to the Federated Associations shall be organised under the Laws of the International Federation . <p> Rule 3 set in place the framework of FINA management : " The Council if FINA shall consist of Two Representatives appointed by each Nation or Country , together with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every Council Meeting held , and who shall be an sic ex-officio Member of the Council . " While eight nations Belgium Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Hungary , Sweden and the three home countries forming Great Britain were represented at the 1908 conception of FINA , the international federation began its official , formal life with 20 nations registered as being eligible for affiliation including " Bohemia " , Greece , Norway , Russia and Switzerland though not all those actually signed up from the start and by the time FINA met at the Hotel de Ville , Brussels in September 1910 , the list of founding nations had been reduced to 15 . <p> Rule 4 listed the nations eligible for membership of FINA as follows : The First FINA member nations : Australia , Austria , Belgium , Canada , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Great Britain , Holland , Hungary , Italy , South Africa , Sweden and the United States of America . <p> Rule 12 noted that each national federation was to recognise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International relations " in swimming and water polo . Although records had existed before the birth of FINA , it was not until the Paris meeting that the federation sought to formalise standards by requesting that all nations draw up a list of national records so that an official list of World Records could be established dating from January 1 , 1910 . <p> In Stockholm from July 8 to 10 , 1912 , FINA met at the House of Parliament in the Swedish capital and the first World Record Application Form was introduced . At a time when trouble was brewing beyond the field of sport , FINA 's first brush with true controversy landed on the table in Stockholm . German delegates , in the face of agreement among other members that the international federation should press the IOC to allow FINA to appoint starters , timekeepers , judges and referees for sports under its jurisdiction , objected on the grounds that the Olympic committee of the nation scheduled to host the 1916 Olympic Games in Berlin should control such matters . <p> The note from Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " A part of a superior organisation can not progress independently , and we must decline to take part in any further discussion referring to this question . " Nonetheless , FINA members pressed ahead with their plans and extended their request to the IOC for aquatic competitions to be held at the Games under the auspices of the international federation 's new rules . To a large extent that has indeed what has happened since the pioneering age and continues to be the case to this day . <p> On the table in Stockholm was a request from Russia : it applied not only for membership of FINA but also to be exempt from the rule dictating that swimming teachers were automatically barred from being swimmers through loss of their amateur status . Swimming teachers were hard to come by in a nation where swimming was " all but totally unknown " , said Russia , which had sought help from Finland . The Finns would not help out if they were then to be disadvantaged . FINA granted the exemption but advised Russia that it first had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the international body . <p> In Budapest at the end of May 1914 , FINA 's meeting logged word from the IOC of support for the idea of FINA rules and folk effectively running the swim meet at the Olympic Games . A FINA Committee for Olympic Business was established , with Britain , Belgium , Hungary , Sweden and Germany represented . That pressed for standards such as height of starting platforms and a basic condition ' the end walls of the pool should be perpendicular to the bottom of the bath that shaped pools in a way that remains with us today . <p> So confident were some FINA members that they were doing a rather better job of forming a sound set of rules and organising the FINA disciplines than any work being conducted by other sports that the IOC was asked to consider extending FINA 's rulebook to all Olympic sports . That proposal , from Belgium , would meet with limited success in so far as the IOC did adopt some of the general principles agreed by FINA for application for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 <p> Some things have shifted only slightly in the past 100 years , relatively speaking , while others have shifted a great deal to reflect the way the world has developed , socially , technically and on other fronts . <p> Here is where all of that leaves us as far as FINA 's mission and constitution goes in 2014 a few pertinent passages : <p> DISCRIMINATION <p> FINA shall not allow any discrimination against national Federations or individuals ( compe- titors , officials , judges , delegates , etc. ) on the grounds of race , gender , religion , or political affiliations . <p> OBJECTIVES <p> The objectives of FINA are : <p> a ) to promote and encourage the development of Aquatics in all possible regards throughout the world , <p> b ) to provide fair and drug free sport , <p> c ) to promote and encourage the development of international relations , <p> d ) to encourage participation in Aquatics disciplines at all levels throughout the world regardless of age , gender or race , <p> f ) to promote and organise WorldChampionships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase of facilities for Aquatics ' disciplines throughout the world with the support of other interested parties , and <p> h ) to carry out such other activities as may be desirable to promote the sport . <p> The constitution and rules of a Member must not be in conflict with the FINA Rules . Where there is a conflict , the FINA Rules shall prevail . <p> C 12.1 Any Member , member of a Member , or individual member of a Member may be sanctioned : C 12.1.3 for bringing the sport into disrepute . <p> Beyond the key lines in the constitution , FINA now pays swimmers for performances in stark contrast to its founding years and in keeping with the modern world . In Kazan next year , when Russia hosts the World Championships , FINA , though revenues and partners/sponsors plus hosts will award around in prizes to swimmers in pool and open water . <p> The division goes as follows : <p> Gold <p> Silver <p> Bronze <p> 4th <p> 5th <p> 6th <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record . And in such a world , the imperative to get it right on anti-doping measures is all the greater , athlete testing accounting for a sizeable sum in the budget ( a theme we will consider later in the series ) . <p> Within the above framework ( the FINA handbook , of course , runs much deeper in details and scope that the short selection of items here at this stage ) , is the structure of ' how it all works " . <h> The House of FINA Hierarchy <p> The layers of what follows run deeper than those we consider in this opening part of our series but important to get to grips with the basics for those not already steeped in the system : <p> The top brass <h> FINA Bureau <p> 23 voting members , including three executives ( the FINA handbook suggests that there are 24 voting members but the Athletes ' representative listed as a member has no vote ) , who are the president , honorary secretary and honorary treasurer . Honorary reflects the title-only nature of the roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not actually do what the likes of Harold Fern did in the pioneering years of FINA : take personal charge of writing and sending out letters , instructions to federations , adding up the sums , submitting accounts and so forth . Such things are now done by a small team of professional staff at FINA HQ in Lausanne plus the professional companies hired to oversee good booking keeping , auditing , marketing and the like . <p> Beyond the 23 voting members and the executive are members " without vote " : the one athlete 's representative , the one Honorary Life President , Mustapha Larfaoui ( president between 1988 and 2009 , a term that is the subject of discussion over whether it should be possible for one man to sit in the top chair for so long ) and 10 honorary members of the Bureau , nine of whom are folk who have served on the Bureau , including hon sec and hon treasurer past , for example , but either stepped aside or lost out at voting stage for a right to remain as a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining among them is the paid Executive Director Cornel Marculescu who effectively runs the show across all Olympic disciplines under the FINA umbrella on a daily basis and is based , when not travelling far and wide on business , in Lausanne . <p> In the mix of all of that , the voting members shall include five vice-presidents , one from each of the continents represented . <p> The " Executive " consists of five members , those being the president , the hon. sec and ho , treasurer and two others from the Bureau nominated by the president . <p> FINA may co-opt onto the Bureau a member from the host nation of the next Olympic Games or World Championships if the country hosting is not already represented at the top table . <p> No nation may be represented by more than one Bureau member , while the geographic composition of the Bureau is established through voting : <p> 16 members are elected by General Congress in accordance with the votes of continental organisations affiliated to FINA ( CANA , UANA , , LEN and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa 4 each from the Americas , Asia and Europe 1 for Oceania <p> The latter has accounted for Australia 's difficulty in finding room to be represented at the top table , the Oceania post currently occupied by the delegates from Fiji , though a move to have <p> Beyond the 16 continental votes , another 7 members are elected from " the world at large " , the count per continent not to exceed 1 for each of Africa , Asia and Oceania or two each from the Americas and Europe . <p> Who are Bureau members answerable to : <h> General Congress <p> The highest authority of FINA is the representative body of all FINA members , consisting of two delegates from every nation , each delegate carrying one Congress vote on issues to be decided . Where a nation has just one delegate , that delegate carries two votes . <p> I 've heard it said that " anyone can be elected to FINA " . Not quite . You can only get this close to any influence if you work your way through the ranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA level ( same for the continental organisations affiliated to FINA ) . <p> The Congress also includes all members of the Bureau as above , including those without vote , the influence of former leading lights ever present , for better or worse in a model that is apt to slow down the pace of change when change is called for by the wider membership . <h> Technical Congress <p> The same structure as above ( but dealing only with technical matters and the rules pertinent to such things ) unless the theme being dealt with is pertinent to a singular sport : if diving is being discussed , then the two delegates per nation quota may be reduced to one delegate per nation . Technical Congresses take place every four years and coincide , in general , with the showcase World Championships . At least 20 members must be present for a quorum and decisions taken can be overridden by the General Congress . <p> Who provides the expertise <h> The Committees <p> 6 Technical Committees to represent each sport and the general category of Masters <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; disciplinary ; ethics and the Bureau may form any ad hoc committee deemed appropriate to deal with matters arising . <p> Members of committees are chosen and appointed by the Bureau , subject to the approval of member federations that committee members are either affiliated to or associated with through nationality . <p> Effectively the committees are there to help the Congress and Bureau depending on topic and relevance in the pecking order of priorities form fitting rules and set the conditions under which athletes will compete , officials and coaches and media work at events and so forth . <p> Pertinent to the reason why this series came into being are such clauses as that specified as a duty of the Media Committee : <p> " To offer advice to the FINA Communications Department on the best way to promote FINA and the image of its aquatic sports throughout the world " . <p> For any organisation to get the best out of such mechanisms , that last clause is among those that suggest it would be good to also take account of what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA 's image . <p> No point in a sounding board that bounces back ideas on how to make the world rosy and light if no-one is prepared to listen to the same people on the subject of dark clouds that stand in the way of blue sky and brighter future . <p> That hierarchy takes us to the next stage : not uncommon for those in hierarchies to protect themselves through structures controlled from top downwards . FINA is built to be inclusive and include the views of many for the benefit of all .

 Luke Greenbank - members of the Tokyo 2020 Squad Photos : British Swimming <p> Britain and Japan have entered a Tokyo 2020 Youth development partnership aimed at mutual understanding and growth in the water and on deck in both countries . On the eve of a " hard working camp " in Japan before Christmas , talks to the man guiding the program in Britain , Tim Jones . The 1988 Olympic swimmer left the pool for the gym in his post-race days to develop performance skills as a professional in another sport but has now returned to his alma mater with a fresh approach . <p> On December 12 , eight young British swimmers will board a flight to Japan at the start of a Tokyo 2020 partnership with Japan , a nation well-versed in the art of accelerated development in youth surfacing , its nationals an annual wonder when it comes to the quality of depth and speed among those 13 to 16 years old . <p> The man at the helm of the partnership on Britain 's side is Tim Jones , a former 200 ' flyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After his swimming days were done , he developed deck-side understanding of performance , coached and down the line came to play a role in the Smart Track program blue-printed in Britain by Australian Bill Sweetenham , a scheme that contributed much to the careers of Fran Halsall , Jazz Carlin , Lizzie Simmonds , Jemma Lowe , Ellen Gandy , Jess Dickons and others . <p> Jones gives a nod to Smart Track as he gets set to lead a new generation of talent into international waters focussed not on the immediacy of Rio 2016 but the longer term of Tokyo 2020 and beyond but the plan is not simply Smart Track II nor is the choice of Japan only down to the location of the Olympics after next . " 2TP " , as the Tokyo2020 program is referred to by those working on it , speaks , too , to the learning curve that Jones has travelled out in the world beyond water and the lessons he now feels that he can bring back to his source sport . <p> After a year back in swimming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping head coach Bill Furniss and performance director Chris Spice in the realm of turning Britain 's swim ship around in time for Rio after the disappointment ( not catastrophy ) of London 2012 . <p> " I believe I have a significant role to play in what the future of British Swimming looks like , " says Jones . To that end , he , Spice and Furniss travelled out to Japan last February to visit programs , federation and Olympic Committee officials to discuss meaningful cooperation aimed at mutual benefit in sport , in performance and through cultural understanding . A partnership aimed at sport but transcending that , performance in life the greater good . <p> Jones followed up by taking five swimmers , including Molly Renshaw , to the Japan Open , one of the most unforgiving of development race environments , a meet at which the heats of the breaststroke , for example , is apt to flood the pointy ends of the world rankings with more than 10 new entries . Jones recalls : <p> " We were looking at the potential program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of quality swims , the immense depth in the sport in Japan . Their program is time driven ; it is a huge part of their education system and approach to teaching kids . <p> " They accelerate the development of their kids very quickly . Clearly they have far more kids going fast at a young age than we have or any others have outside of the United States . We are interested in learning from that system . " <p> Those who will learn first are youngsters Charlie Attwood , Luke Greenbank , Duncan Scott , Martyn Walton , Emma Cain , Georgia Coates , Holly Hibbott and Rosie Rudin , all with a degrees of junior success at European , British and even global levels . They will travel with Jones , team manager Dawn Peart and coaches Sean Kelly ( boys ) and David Hemmings ( girls ) . First stop will be camps in Suzuka for the boys and Shizuoka for the girls , from December 13 to 22 in time for Christmas back home in Britain . <p> What kind of pace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will not be a light-touch camp : it will be very much a hard working camp . " <p> With a nod to what the Brit leadership group saw on their tour of Japan earlier in the year , Jones notes : " We visited everything from club programs to centres to university programs . The types of work and the intensity and volumes involved are so far ahead of what we would normally do with kids of that age related to youth development . " <p> That speaks to a world beyond the pool . " In society and in the education of that society there is a great deal of pressure top perform early , " says Jones . " They do n't have a pure swimming view of things but how that culture translate in the sport is that unless the kid is really good by the time they are 11-12 , then their time in the sport is pretty much finished . " <p> The survivors are among the fastest in the world in their age groups and a few , like quadruple Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Setos and Kosuke of the world step up to challenge for the ultimate honours . Jones has some first-hand experience of that realm of early pressure to perform , having coached the children of Japanese parents in Britain . " That high parental expectation of education takes over . " <p> On tour in Japan , the Brits watched children of 10 and under training five and six times a week , children 11 and 12 years old endure nine sessions a week . Says Jones : " That is not something we would see or indeed advocate in the UK at the moment . " <p> He brings experience of accelerated development with him back to the pool from his time as performance head of British Gymnastics at a time when the sport celebrated four medals at a home Olympics in London , the tally matching the number of gym medals won by the country in the rest of Games history put together . <p> " My time outside of the sport has challenged my thinking about what you can do in swimming , " says Jones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partnership is to expose the swimmers , coaches and staff to a different environment . We had the 2011 gym world championships in Tokyo and we visited the city a few times for training and competition prior to the world championships . <p> " The culture that sits around that becomes something you are comfortable with and that is part of the point and purpose of what we 're now setting out to do on 2TP . There are agendas we need to address long before 2020 . " <p> Much of what is on the cards will be kept to those involved in the program , the call of competitive edge part of the reason for such efforts but clearly the realms of skills , philosophies , types of work , science and medicine , ways to ensure the athlete is at their very best when it counts most , will all play a part in the exchange . <p> Back in the early days of Smart Track when Halsall , Simmonds , Carlin and Co Photos : Simmonds , left , and Carlin , by Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rotund folk on the chalkboard along with cheeky notes to the boss in Sweetenham 's office at Loughborough , Jones witnessed up close the potential of working with youngsters that arrive with some of the best tools in nature 's bag at the start of a long and often complex journey . <p> " We saw through what came out of that program that you can accelerate the development of a group of kids , " says Jones . " Beyond that , I was more informed by my experience in gymnastics , a sport that has a very young base but one in which the hours put in are similar , for coaches and athletes alike . These are both sports in which you do n't train without a coach , both areas of early specialised sport . There are a lot of similarities in that regard . " <p> Tokyo 2020 will extend to camps for Japanese youth in Britain as well as exchanges in senior waters , from elite-athlete exchanges and stretching all the way to competitions along the lines of the Duel in the Pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones : <p> " Duel meets have been muted and we would love that if a commercial way can be found . That 's in its embryonic stages but take the duel Europe All Stars Vs USA last year and the amount of interest it created in the sport . The more events like that , the better and globally so . " <p> Behind 2TP , Jones oversees the development of around 50 youngsters in Britain through the world-class potential program that in 2013-14 included some more mature athletes whose focus was coming good for Commonwealth Games and European Championships . <p> " We 've made headway but we have to be very realistic about our performances this year : it is a hell of a step up from this to world championships and Olympic Games . We should not for a moment underestimate the size of that challenge . " <p> The 2020 group is specific to a time beyond Rio 2016 , with 10 to 12 athletes identified as possessing that extra something when it comes to potential on the biggest of occasions well down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year after year will require some changes to the competition structure at home and abroad ( through choices as well as reinvention ) . He intends to do what Smart Track did by taking more youth swimmers on tours that take in the likes of the US Grand Prix circuit . <p> Making race-day schedules work for the athlete not the meet or an organiser is not always as easy as it sounds . Swimming 's issues with hosting events that generate interest beyond its own waters outside pools Olympic and World long-course are well know , entries on the world cup tour and even at the world s/c championships in Doha next month lacking many of the biggest names in the sport . <p> Britain will send 12 but all but one of them has a gold medal from a major international this year , at the helm Adam Peaty Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer , with crowns Commonwealth and European as well as two world records to his name . His is a among tales that highlight the need for central/systematic approaches to sit alongside , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth their weight in gold . <p> Meanwhile , the world of competition events , dates and formats dictated by politicians not players is here to stay , the trick to work with it if you can find ways for it to work for you . By 2016 , Europe will have changed its age-group categories for juniors to fall in line with FINA ( girls 14-17 , boys 15-18 ) , while next year delivers the debut of the European Games in Baku . <p> Criticism of the new event in swimming terms has been focussed on the restriction of numbers allowed to race because the Games will replace the European Junior Championships for the 2015 season . Talks between organisers and LEN , the European federation , and the Baku event organisers have led to a relaxation of a plan to restrict numbers of entries per country to eight athletes . That would have robbed nations of the chance to send full youth teams into continental competition . Now , numbers will fall in line with those seen at the traditional LEN event . Jones sees the obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expose youth to big multi-sports events do n't come around that often , so this well be a good moment to give our kids experience of the village and big event environment on the way to 2020 . " <p> Jones intends to be there the whole way . " I feel like I can make a contribution . I did n't meed to move away from gymnastics and its always nice if the timing of a move can be one you decide on and does n't happen because someone else makes that decision . My decision was driven by the desire to look back on the sport I came from but from outside of it . " <p> " I 'd fallen out of love with swimming but the feeling has returned and I think there are exciting times ahead . " <h> Builder told to 
 Make Doping A Crime In The Complex World Of Gain Vs Cheating <p> Providing and administering doping to under-age athletes has long been a crime in German law ( both west and , despite State Plan 14:25 , the east ) but today the Bundestag , the Berlin ruling home of the Government , is considering the draft of a coalition proposal to make doping in sport a criminal offence for all involved along the spectrum of role and age . <p> Against this historic backdrop that speaks to the current and a serious commitment to promote sport as a healthy place with Fair Play at its core , the draft law will be presented at the Bundestag today before being put to vote in Parliament next spring , 2015 . If the move goes through as the draft suggests , German elite athlete who fall foul of anti-doping rules and any overseas athletes caught doping while in Germany would face prison sentences of up to three years . <p> For those in the shadows supplying and manipulating , the costs could be 10 years in jail . The law would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat those who offend with far less leniency that that often applied under the WADA Code that it speaks to . <p> Where Germany goes next year , other nations may follow , while the possibility of doping criminality entering European law is a distinct possibility down the line . One of the key implications for international federations such as FINA is clear : if an athlete who has served a jail term for a doping offence subsequently makes a comeback in sport , that sport would be allowing back into its realm not only someone who has broken the WADA Code but someone with a criminal record to their name . <p> The German draft anti-doping law is designed to : <p> " Protect the health of athletes , to ensure fairness and equal opportunities and to defend the integrity of the sport . " <p> The law is proposed by the new coalition Government of the centre-right CDU and the centre-left SPD and would be specific to elite athletes registered for anti-doping testing and would not apply to the leisure , recreation and such realms as the masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do not also race in the elite world ) . In Germany , some 7,500 athletes would fall into the category of those who would be answerable to the new law , while all elite athletes visiting the country would also be called to account should they offend . <p> Doping is a dark chapter in the experience of German sport , the nightmare returning during the Winter Olympic in of late when German biathlete Evi tested positive , was sent home and then subsequently served with a two-year ban . WADA bans for the most serious offences shift up to four years from January next year . <p> High-profile cases such as those of Lance Armstrong together with the high number of positives across many sports in Russia have contributed to a view that all athletes who achieve fine results on the biggest of occasions " must be doping " . <p> An athlete who competed for the GDR looks back : " We are talking about serious organ damage , especially heart , lungs and liver . There are also cases of disabled children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Because of the steroids they took , they could train a lot more and for that reason the wear and tear on the body was much worse . We have cases of damaged backs , arthritis and damaged joints . But the saddest thing is the list of deaths continues to grow . These athletes are just dying . Recently , a former weightlifter Gerd Bonk , who was once celebrated as a hero , as the strongest man in the world , died due to multiple organ failure . " <h> When Complex Laws Collides <p> The issue of doping and national law , not to mention WADA rules and the interpretation of those by the Court of Arbitration for Sport , can be a complex one . <p> A case in point : Astrid Strauss tested positive for testosterone on June 1 , 1992 , at a national swim meet . She was suspended for 18 months and as such was ineligible for selection to the Germany team for the Olympics in Barcelona . When her former GDR teammate Dagmar Hase won the freestyle crown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who she felt had been dealt with unfairly ( no mention at the time of how unfair 1973 to 1989 had been to the rest of the world of women swimmers in particular ) . <p> Strauss challenged her suspension in a German court and won . That verdict , however , did not alter her ban in international waters as the only swimmer to compete for the GDR ( in days gone by at that stage ) to officially test positive . Stasi documents uncovered after reunification showed that many GDR swimmers and other athlete tested positive in internal tests analysed at Kreischa in Saxony but never revealed to the world or reported back to the IOC , which had granted the laboratory near Dresden official status as an accredited testing facility . <p> The ruling on Strauss placed other German athletes in choppy waters . Any who raced alongside Strauss in domestic competition could , technically , have faced suspension themselves under rules that forbid racing with banned athletes . <h> Hypoxic Chambers <p> In the realm of the many complexities of sports vs national laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the conditions of altitude training can be replicated in theory , at least . Feedback from athletes and programs that have used the tents is mixed . Some say ' it works ' , some say ' more problems than benefits ' . The way the tents wok means that they duo not actually replicate the way nature is set up in terms of how reducing oxygen in the air is achieved . A further issue is the question of whether ' benefits ' achieved through the use of oxygen tents can be used to mask EPO use . <p> Those and other issues haste been at the heart of discussions in Norway , Italy and elsewhere in recent years . Norway has considered banning altitude tents , while a suggestion of late is that Norwegian athletes found using such equipment would face suspension . In Italy , they are not allowed under an all-encompassing rule that forbids manipulation of blood values via artificial means . <p> The crucial difference between altitude for real and a tent is exogenous approach to triggering the response required in the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injecting EPO . Important to note that it is relatively hard to make the body respond to hypoxia , the gains slower and more limited than the effects of a banned substance such as EPO . Even so , in a very competitive world , a small edge is an edge . <p> Given that altitude tents are not forbidden under the WADA Code , national suspension of an athlete would go beyond the rules of engagement in international sport . Among other questions raised by that notion are : <p> would a Norwegian athlete who uses a tent ( of a kind being used by rivals ) when outside of Norway also be called to account in national law ? <p> what are the reasons for banning tents ? <p> would a ban in one nation but not in others create artificial advantage/disadvantage ? <p> The latter is a question that WADA is due to consider in the near future , some of that discussion related to the notion that tent use could help mask banned substances and the technology of tents also used for other purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tier of difficult detection . Short of raiding the home of an athlete or arriving for tests with a search warrant , proving use of a tent could be difficult . There is research to suggest that testing could reveal whether hypoxic gains were achieved in nature or tent but there has been no need/drive to develop such a test . <p> Much of the discussion is mute in countries that either have direct access to altitude environments or the funding to travel to such places for training . <p> Among the many leading athletes who used tents as part of their preparation are Michael Phelps and British cyclist Bradley Wiggins . <h> Will Tents Go The Way Of Xenon Gas ? <p> In an article in The Economist it was suggested that Russian athletes have been using xenon gas as a performance-enhancing substances for at least a decade . Even if that were true , the practice was not specifically banned under WADA rules until August this year ( along with argon ) . There is no specific detection test as yet but the ban is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in the air we breathe . It is a colourless , dense , odourless " noble gas " , the latter definition granted by rarity : it occurs in trace amounts , making up 0.0000087% of the Earth 's atmosphere . <p> Pure xenon can be pulled out of the air by fractional distillation . How does it apply in sport and performance ? <p> A form of xenon gas is used for imaging the lungs and a range of other medical applications , including protecting our internal organs from hypoxic ( lack of oxygen ) injuries . <p> Research suggests that inhaling xenon boosts the body 's production of the HIF1 Alpha protein , one that triggers the production of other compounds in the body , including EPO , the red-blood cell booster . More red cells , greater ability to transport oxygen around the body . <p> When WADA considered Xenon gas for inclusion on the list of banned substances , the questions asked included those that might be asked on tents : <p> Damage to health ? <p> Artificial performance enhancer ? <p> Ethically acceptable or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of engagement in world-class sport ? <p> On Xenon , as in so many areas in which cheats venture before the rest of the world catches up , it took a while for WADA to find the line . <p> In 2006 , the news archive reports , the president of the Russian Olympic Committee sent a thank-you letter to the director of the ZAO Center for its role it helping to prepare the Russian national team for the 2006 Turin Winter Olympics . Of the 22 Russian athletes that won medals at those Games , 15 had used a xenon-based mixture of gases as part of their preparation in a move approved by the Russian Government . <p> A presentation prepared in 2010 by the ZAO Center suggested that " xenon-based recovery methodology will aid Russian athletes in London ( 2012 ) and Sochi ( 2014 ) Olympic Games " . <p> For those who want to read more about the role of ZAO , its research and the methodology of administering xenon gas , this Australian cycling website offers a comprehensive overview . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be compared to other possible methods of performance enhancement ( some proven , some not ) Insulin Growth Factor 1 ( banned but not in its raw source form such as cow 's milk and deer antlers ) and UV-light blood treatment . <p> NADA , the German anti-doping agency , lost a case of late in which a ban for using UV-light blood treatment ( believed to mask EPO use ) was challenged at the CAS . Of course , a country can have its own national laws that transcend the WADA Code . <p> Under the law being proposed by Germany ( and perhaps in any law being suggested we believe no more than a suggestion but if anyone knows otherwise , please alert us in Norway on tents ) , the athlete not free to compete in international sport but in jail for a national ' crime ' would find himself or herself locked out of competition . <h> Comments <p> gordon November 12 , 2014 <p> Many world class athletes are children . Will they be prosecuted as adults if they test positive ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who regularly try children as adults . There are UN laws and international laws that forbid trying children as adults that are not recognized by the USA . <p> Craig Lord November 12 , 2014 <p> I understand , Gordon , that such provisions would apply ( which is why I note " up to 3 years " ) ... both specific and because of existing provisions in German law for handling cases involving minors ( in line with Britain and other European nations ) . The harder line is aimed at those who make a choice to cheat or assist or drive cheating . <p> gordon November 12 , 2014 <p> by the way . not on topic but ... I went to Westpoint to watch Army vs . Columbia ( who won ! ) On the wall , all-comers best 100 yard fly from 1972 , guess who ? 47 and change , who else ....

You could argue that they even out competition for those living at lower levels vs those at higher elevation , granted you have a few thousand dollars . <p> I suppose the thing to do would be to put an upper limit on the red blood cell count . I could be wrong , but I 've only heard of one case where an athlete was not allowed to compete due to having a incredibly high red blood cell count . He was n't caught for the EPO , but was n't allowed to compete on the ground of a high risk of a blood clot . <p> Could n't agree more with what Germany is doing though . <p> seamus November 13 , 2014 <p> So back to countries with altitude facilities , or athletes with deep pockets , able to gain an altitude-training advantage over the rest . Altitude tents are no different to air conditioners ( taking an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and have been getting cheaper . I could buy a 2nd hand one for less than a 2 week trip to Colorado Springs home of the US Olympic Training Centre <p> Craig Lord November 13 , 2014 <p> Seamus , your point is well taken but the picture is yet more complex than that , the number of athletes for whom neither altitude for real nor tents helped much fairly significant ... indeed , for some , it set them back . True to say that a great many do n't ever get to go to altitude camp because of costs ( national team stuff is mostly subsidised ) but just as true to note that the vast majority making their way into world-class waters never get to see a tent either , while some with deep pockets , as you put it , get to do both . I think the concern when it comes to anti-doping discussions rests more in the area of debate on what constitutes artificial aid and how some ' benign ' methods can mask darker things . <p> " Hey guys

 people rallied throughout France today in solidarity with victims of this week 's terror attacks . Sport may seem a remote place in many ways but there are moments that link all things and demand a common response , a fellowship of support for a world that allows the very things we take for granted to be a part of our lives . <p> Solidarity has been shown in various ways in the world of sport , the French Federation ( FFN ) displaying a " Je Suis Charlie " banner on its website as a mark of respect for the victims , condolence and support for the values and freedoms that are part of what makes international sport and friendship possible . <p> This Sunday , we join the tribute to the 17 victims of the three-day killing spree in Paris and close by as world leaders including British Prime Minister David Cameron , German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu join France in a show of defiance against those who would wish to shatter the very foundations of freedom . <p> We mark the moment with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those out there swimming this weekend to stop for a moment and appreciate just how wonderful it is to be free to do so , how fine it is to live in a world that aspires to providing people with opportunity not shackles . <p> French Prime Minister Manuel Valls predicted that millions of people would turn out on Sunday to honour the dead and decry the fundamentalist attacks . He told thousands gathered near the place where a gunman killed four hostages at a kosher supermarket on Friday : <p> " I have no doubt that millions of citizens will come to express their love of liberty , their love of fraternity . France without Jews is no longer France . " <p> Quite so . And France without tolerance is no longer France ; France without freedom of expression is no longer France . And the same holds true for many nations and peoples and communities sport , too across the world . <p> Fear will not end our days . <p> This Sunday , we join hands , hearts and minds with France and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in the terror attacks this week and a day of support for those who put their lives on the line in defence of our freedom and so much that comes with that that we take for granted : Nous Sommes Tous Charlie . <p> The first edition of the post-attack French satirical magazine will poke fun at all those who had never read nor even heard of the publication but now wave the " Je Suis ( nous somme ) Charlie " banner . Laughter and tears . The best of responses . <h> Comments <p> The world is such a crazy place to live in with a lot of crazy people . <p> Lawrie Cox January 11 , 2015 <p> And a world without humour is not a living place to be . Je suis Charlie . <p> gordon January 11 , 2015 <p> To say " I am Charlie " is to say that I would say terribly offensive things about a religion about which I know very little . That is most definitely not who I am . I respect all religions . As a Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible . Therefore when terrible quotes from the Koran are put in the public view I see that as ignorant bigotry . I love to swim . I love swimmers . The Olympic boycotts surely taught us to keep politics out of the pool . Sorry Jim . Maybe I am just another grumpy old swimmer ! <p> Craig Lord January 11 , 2015 <p> gordon , I do n't think that 's what Je Suis Charlie means at all : it is to say that we value freedom , including freedom of expression , religious belief and much more , regardless of whether the legal choices of others would be our choices , regardless of whether you accept or reject the messages contained in forms of art . Many of the folk marching in Paris , in Dresden , in several others places in the world today would neither buy ' Charlie ' nor find much favour with the contents therein but that is n't the point : it is about the right for such things to be a part of this world . World sport as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as fair play and yes , there are bad aspects of sport , too ) is possible because we live in a free world . Without it , there would be no competitive sport worth its salt : some things you simply can not divorce . This transcends politics , in my view : it is about the right of all of us to live in the world we find acceptable within the bounds of the law . Allow that to be eroded and you would n't have to worry about Olympic boycotts . <p> gordon January 11 , 2015 <p> There are MUCH better examples of free speech . Speaking truth to power is a wonderful principle . Put yourself in the shoes of my Muslim friends who are terrified by " I am Charlie " . They hate the murderers in this but the God they love , fear and profoundly respect is blasphemed by Charlie and they see the world saying they are with Charlie 's words . That is how they take it . If you put yourself in their shoes you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am off to the pool so perhaps I can wash away these political issues that must not divide us , eh ? <p> Craig Lord January 11 , 2015 <p> They should not divide us , gordon . I appreciate what you say but to me ' Je Suis Charlie ' is standing up for tolerance , understanding , freedom of expression and intelligent response to the events in Paris in the face of anti-islamic marches of late in Germany and elsewhere that include a number of folk who would do well to remember that he of the amusingly short moustache and a penchant for the swastika would have also surely have shot the folk at Charlie Hebdo , where the victims were the first citizens in Europe to be massacred en masse for exercising freedom of expression since the nazis . I think your muslim friends had and have far more to fear from the fanatics flying an Islamic flag in the way that IRA terrorists ( among others ) boycotted the Catholic faith ( among others ) and killed and maimed the innocent as they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how offensive certain images may have been , images that included Jewish leaders , The Pope , nuns , monks ( much aimed at mocking poor response to sexual abuse claims etc ) , the Queen and many others down the years without us witnessing what we witnessed in France this week . There may well be ' better ' examples of free speech but we should not imagine that those who shot the cartoonists would not shoot those better examples and the rest of us if we happened to have a point of view that differed from their own . Je Suis Charlie is much wider than the nature of some cartoons . Enjoy the swim <p> January 11 , 2015 <p> Who defines " freedom , of speech " ? <p> Is it ok to trash one religion and deeply insult its followers but NOT OK to even say one single negative thing about another religion , lest you be persecuted ? <p> As often throughout human history , " freedom of anything " is defined by victors of wars . <p> Craig Lord January 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of speech or anything else that is what national laws and culture are about ( and why France and many of its neighbours , find what happened this week unacceptable and worth standing up against ) . Of course , in some places in the world what people want is not what they get . The scenario you paint is the one being debated in Europe , where some feel that certain religious groups are afforded more sensibility than others ( and others stretching to other groups in the community including those who do n't believe in a god at all ) . In this particular case , no religion was sacred as far as portrayal and caricature by the cartoonists . No religion was singled out in the thread of time they all got it down the years along with many other topics and themes and politicians and people in various walks of life . The last part of your comment does not lead us to the conclusion that the " victors of war " are necessarily wrong , of course , the Holocaust being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private response to your other note . Thanks <p> A religion ( and its Icons ) is sacret for its followers.At some point , a part of a belief will be totally against other ( in the same root religion or against another religion belief ) . The muslims do n't  have the monopoly ( at least , in historic context ) of the Prophet , the same way christians do n't  have of Jesus . Freedom of speech means no one have the MONOPOLY of the truth . Just my two cents . <p> Lawrie Cox January 11 , 2015 <p> My comment was the fact that it is offensive to utilise faith as justification for murder . Comment will be made on virtually all things in life that will offend someone that does not justify taking a life to defend the goodness of the faith . I live in a broadly multicultural society with good friends of many faiths there are times where i have no doubt i will have offended by a comment or view held that does not mean that my friend will come for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out and often apologies may occur due to the circumstance . What i always find difficult to accept is that each faith espouses love and peace for your fellow human yet so many are hurt by those ' enforcing ' one view of a faith . the reason for i am charlie is to say that we can exercise freedoms including speech without resorting to terror , you will not silence speech through terror . It maybe political and hopefully the human race can progress after this tragedy rather than fall into backward faith thinking ( across the board no group has a monopoly on forward thinking ) . <p> pol January 12 , 2015 <p> So , if you insult other 's religion it 's ok to shoot them . After all they insult your religion . Wow . Okay . What about debating them ? Like in a form of discussion ? Instead of using your gun as a tool to retaliation . That 's the real meaning of freedom . <p> Denis Serio January 12 , 2015 <p> Nice words , Craig . <p> But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported more than 100,000 deaths that attracted none or efemerous media and society attention . <p> I will only fully believe in this world when I witness 4 million people in Champs-Elysees because of a killing spree in Somalia . <p> January 12 , 2015 <p> Wow ... no one ever said shooting is even remotely OK to insult a religion . <p> Again , interesting that my comments were deleted , but misleading and divisive comment such as " o , if you insult other 's religion it 's ok to shoot them " is allowed to appear . <p> And I totally agree with that respect for each other is the key to harmonious society rather than thrashing each other , or insult a religion just because you can . <p> January 12 , 2015 <p> I concur Denis . <p> I have so many good friends working for international media covering many areas/countries where countless innocent children and women were killed on daily basis by operatives of countries who claim that they have the greatest " freedom of speech " <p> Like Denis Serio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorkers march on their streets because of indiscriminate killings of those women and children . <p> Craig Lord January 12 , 2015 <p> : your second comment was not deleted ; it never got published and I sent you a mail to explain ( if you supplied a correct email you will have received that mail ) you went well beyond the issue at hand and while I have no problem in whatever views you may have on any of that , much of what you wrote about would simply have invited vehement disagreement from many with religious views one way or another . That was not the point of registering a day of mourning that had far less to do with religion and far more to do with freedoms of speech and expression and cultural values/way of life that will not be shaken . <p> Craig Lord January 12 , 2015 <p> Denis , the reason that wo n't happen is because the foundation of feeling has very little to do with religion but to do with violence and brute force on the doorstep . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , London , etc , we can all expect to see what we saw in Paris . The people of France feel a direct connection to the victims of murder this past week and the murderers were French , too . In my role as a journalist down the years I , too , have covered the deaths of many thousands , in a working world well beyond the pool . The associations of people are far more complex than you paint , I believe . A great many people from Europe , US and elsewhere can also be found working tirelessly to resolve conflicts and help victims of brutality ... and many places in Europe right now are accepting tens of thousands of political refugees , including many muslims , from conflict zones , many of which come down to people supposedly of the same religion killing each other . I understand what you mean but I also think that whole picture is far more complex than a simple wish for on the streets of France to march for Somalia of course , that is not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil or anywhere in Asian either . That does not mean to say that people do n't care about such things . 2000 people are said to have been massacred by an islamic fundamentalist group in Nigeria at he weekend ... that will not result in a march of in France , either , but you can be sure that people have noticed and that they care . What remains to be seen is millions marching in Africa , Asia and elsewhere in the face of such atrocities as that which unfolded in Nigeria , marching and standing up against atrocities on their own doorstep . All for a different forum . Meanwhile , I uphold the right to note the day of mourning in France and the massive impact that events in and around Paris this past week have had and will continue to have for a vast swathe of our readers . <p> Clive Rushton January 12 , 2015 <p> The problem is not straightforward and will not be easily solved as I am sure everyone recognizes . <p> I live in a predominantly Muslim country which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the population , especially females , which would be alien to other Muslim societies . The integration can be experienced here in Bali to a greater extent than even the rest of the country my next door neighbour is a Dutch Christian , his wife is Hindu , the next door , next door neighbours are Buddhist . A famous tourist spot nearby has five buildings of worship built literally next to each other buses unload their passengers on the extensive common parking area and they walk the 20 or 30 meters between each of the buildings an Islamic Mosque , a Hindu Temple , a Buddhist Temple , a Catholic Church and a Protestant Church ( no Greek Orthodox Church or Jewish Synagogue give them time ! ) A few years ago The Jakarta Post described the place as " a commitment to religious tolerance in the area , " and as a " unifying spot for many Balinese . " The various communities respect and help out each other Muslims do n't switch on the loudspeakers for the call to prayer when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Muslim helps train the Protestant choir for Catholic Christmas Mass , and Hindu , decorated bamboo poles , are erected in front of the Christian church to mark Christmas Day , and so on . <p> In a place where the various religions and sects form such a communal congregation you would expect a congruence of abhorrence and horror at the murders , at the manner in which they were carried out , and at the selection of the specific victims . <p> However , talking to Muslim friends here reveals that the sense of insult provoked by the Charlie Hebdo cartoons is a very deep-seated pain and anger . The satire has attacked aspects of all religions and has not been restricted to depictions or descriptions concerning Islam but my friends can not understand why anyone of any religion would not be mortally offended . So the pain is felt as a personal attack and as one which insults the very essence of their existence and purpose . <p> Additionally , and this is where the difficulty arises , I think , their value system appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian world , and , of course , Christian values appear to be completely unaligned with those of Islam , even though many of the concepts expounded in both The Qur'an and The Bible share common origins and both belief systems accept Jesus as a prophet of Allah/God . They , literally , really literally , see no difference in degree of ' wrongness ' between publishing insulting drawings and killing the artists in retaliation and revenge . <p> That last sentence will probably reward re-reading . Even the murder of the Muslim security guard is viewed as justified and just , because he was , " protecting the artists . " To respond to Lawrie 's assertion , to my friends here it is NOT offensive to utilize faith as a justification for murder . <p> Respected business ' guru ' Edgar Schein recently described culture to me in personal correspondence using a metaphor of a lily pond : " the leaves and blossoms on the surface are the visible artifacts which would not exist but for the nutrients in the water and mud . " The visible artifacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief systems which form a perceived reality and values which describe a desired reality . While the values here equate offensive cartoons and murder there is little hope of reconciliation and a peaceful , cooperative future ; the deep rooted nature of the beliefs and values precludes their owners even seeking reconciliation . <p> Value systems are deeply rooted and almost impossible to change by discussion , ' logic ' and evolution , much less manipulate or change by imposition . The problem , therefore , is not going away on either side . <p> The Charlie Hebdo murders have not moved Christians towards Islam and the demonstrations and remarkable shows of solidarity have not moved Islam towards Christianity . Lawrie quite rightly says , " ... you will not silence speech through terror , " but we seem to be at a crossroads where neither we will silence terror through speech . " <p> It is a very worrying development . <p> Denis Serio January 12 , 2015 <p> Ok Craig . Agree about people . But what about media coverage ? 2,000 feared dead in a Boko Haram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline around the world for a week . <p> We might see Nasdaq index become though , but not this massacre . <p> It happens because western media generally uses two different measurements about what 's important , and it has a heavy role in shaping world 's focus . <p> Craig Lord January 12 , 2015 <p> Clive , a good overview of where the cultural/religious lines are drawn thanks but the geography ( social , cultural and religious ) of all of this is important " Even the murder of the Muslim security guard is viewed as justified and just , because he was , " protecting the artists . " To respond to Lawrie 's assertion , to my friends here it is NOT offensive to utilize faith as a justification for murder " . <p> The point in this case , I would suggest , is that it is not HERE ... it is in Paris , in Europe in a place where a cartoon is a switch on a TV remote if you do n't like it , do n't look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have that choice runs deeper than religion ... and is supported by a great many muslims ( witness the responses of Islamic Societies in GB , FRA and elsewhere those past few days ) who want to lead peaceful lives here in Europe . <p> A few thousand folk used to read CH on a regular basis . Now , very many more will , even people who do n't particularly like it but want to say " this is our culture ; these are our freedoms , gained over many centuries and not to be relinquished lightly " . <p> That culture includes : Murder is illegal , criminal and neither acceptable nor justifiable " here " and that is what all must respect and tolerate . If Yannick Agnel wishes to read cartoons that poke fun at various leaders and religious figures around the world , he has a right to do so in law and culture HERE . If h goes to some parts of the world and wishes to drink a her on the street , he may not be able to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok and all should tolerate that . <p> Some of this does indeed represent worrying developments , as you say , because value systems in clear conflict are deep-rooted but intelligent response is key : the terrorists seek to divide , not only one religion and another , one people and another but people of the same faith and nationality . <p> Where you are , your penultimate paragraph may well be true but here in Europe efforts are being made on all sides to ensure that is not the case and to ensure that what you describe in your opening comments is achievable far and wide , however difficult that may be . <p> gordon January 12 , 2015 <p> Clive Rushton , yours words are the first true words spoken here , for me . I also have lived in a predominantly Muslim area and was tolerated for being very different . I deeply appreciate what you have said . <p> As far as I can see , it is getting widespread coverage ( several reports and updates rolling out every half an hour on some news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the same kind of intense daily debate in Europe and elsewhere for a variety of reasons , including " paris is on our doorstep " and what happened is a direct challenge to everyone 's way of life HERE , where the media from HERE is reporting to those who live HERE . <p> I see the terrible atrocities in Nigeria being treated as ' Important " as you put it , by many media outlets but it wo n't stop people going about their daily lives in Europe , Brazil , Asia , the USA etc ... and it wo n't prompt mass gatherings in the streets of Paris and I do n't find that hard to understand . <p> The responsibility of ' leaders ' is something else : " A French-led initiative has called for Nigeria , Niger , Cameroon and Chad to contribute 700 troops each to a multinational force against Boko Haram , but no country has implemented the plan . " <p> Craig Lord January 12 , 2015 <p> My words and those of Denis and others are true , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what we express truly and freely . In London , we have lived for many years with many cultures and religions all about us and for the most part there is harmony , friendship and tolerance despite obvious times of trouble and conflict and difficulty when worlds and value systems collide . I have also lived in four countries in my life and have always been made welcome and always respected local culture , law and custom . It is the least any of us should expect . <p> January 12 , 2015 <p> Clive Rushton , <p> I also live in Jakarta , Indonesia . And I am glad you wrote . <p> In Islam , a murder of an innocent person , regardless of faith and belief , is strictly Forbidden . It is in the Qur'an : " to murder one innocent person is equal to murdering the whole humanity " , with promise of severe punishments in after life . <p> And I do n't believe when Europeans say they protect freedom of expression . You can thrash Islam any way you want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying holocaust did not happen . <p> Craig Lord January 12 , 2015 <p> , thanks for the clarification . Beyond that , you may believe Europeans or not but freedom of expression is hugely important to Europeans and you ought to respect that . Any should indeed face the threat of jail for seriously denying the holocaust in my opinion though many get away with it all the time ( and none of that prevents CH and others poking fun at aspects of life among orthodox jews , at rabbis and jewish mother-in-laws , for example and none of it justifies murder , of course , as you have previously noted yourself ) . <p> As the judge put it : " The sheer point of your crimes is the killing of others and the destruction of a way of life , our way of life . This is unacceptable in a civilised society . " <p> That is what Je Suis Charlie is all about . <p> Meanwhile , for the most part , it simply is n't true that Islam is singled out for particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentalists and associated intolerants , nutters and murderers ( and the finding of such things acceptable ) do indeed come in for a deal of trashing as have many other leaders and religious leaders and assorted others down the years , including the Catholic Church , the Pope , de Gaul and on and on and on and few in Europe would wish it any other way . <p> : " In Islam , a murder of an innocent person , regardless of faith and belief , is strictly Forbidden . " <p> Yes , indeed . <p> My point was that , amazingly to me , my friends do not consider the cartoonists innocent . <p> pol January 12 , 2015 <p> , that newspaper they massacred also made fun of all religion not only Islam . There 's no excuse nor any justification about killing innocence . <p> January 13 , 2015 <p> Clive , <p> That is very true . Just like in any other religion , many Muslims either do not fully understand or practice the whole context or teaching of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muslims even says very clearly that even in wars , women , children , worship buildings ( regardless of faith ) and etc , should be spared . <p> And Pol , again I hope you read my comment that in Islam a murder of innocent person is never justified . Therefore you have Islamic organizations in Europe and the USA condemning the killings . <p> However , the governments of democratic countries who are so proud of their " freedom of expression , and democratically elected by their own citizens , had no trouble in killing hundreds of thousands of innocent people of other countries . <p> Craig Lord January 13 , 2015 <p> , on your last point , even if that interpretation is accepted , we must also then note that undemocratic countries and unelected regimes have also done their fair share of butchering folk , including their own people . Many thanks for your notes and clarifications on the Qur'an . <p> Dee January 13 , 2015 <p> Clive , I am surprised you are amazed . Insulting the Prophet ( pbuh ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world love the Prophet ( pbuh ) more than they love their own families . These cartoonists challenged that belief and showed little respect to the most severe crime in Islam . <p> My point is , be careful how you Interpret the teachings of ANY Holy book as the phrase " Innocent " ( often ) only applies to those who adhere to the teachings of said book , not those who ' ' it 's teachings . <p> gordon January 14 , 2015 <p> I am so impressed with the discussion we are having . It is the most civil discussion I have seen on this topic . Swimming is more than a sport , is n't it ? <h> Restaurant review :

 by the journal Sports Medicine of late suggests that between 14 and of elite athletes are using performance enhancing drugs . Dutch authors , led by Oliver de Hon , the manager for scientific affairs for the national anti-doping organization of the Netherlands , conclude : " All doping-related discussions and decisions would be strengthened if this vital piece of information , i.e. scientifically reliable information on the prevalence of doping , becomes more readily available . " <p> That there is doping in sport is not in question , the debate centring on ' fight it or live with it ' but in one sense , de Hon 's statement is correct : those who shrug and say ' live with it ' suggest that most world-class athletes must be taking doping to do what they do . If the figure is more like 25 to albeit disturbingly high all the stronger is the argument against the line of Armstrong and others ' they 're all at it so I had to do it ' and for ' doping is not required to achieve pioneering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wish to cheat and achieve a status that would be beyond them without artificial assistance ' ( in over words , without cheating ) . <p> The 14 range suggested in the study requires further inquiry into different groups of athletes at varying levels along a spectrum ending at world-class elite . Doping prevalence can be expected to fluctuate substantially between different groups , researchers suggest . <p> The anti-doping catch rate of something like 1 of athletes called out by testing is , as is widely believed , conservative when it comes to actual numbers cheating . As such , the statistics from the research by De Hon and team will simply confirm to anti-doping testers and agencies what they already , surely , know : the testing regime is letting many a cheat go free and falling shy of protecting clean athletes , of which there are many . <p> Meanwhile , the game is in play and it is a complex one , some of the world 's leading swim coaches and anti-doping experts of the view that some lesser known athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems can say ' see , we are catching cheats ' , while knowing that big names are getting away with it . <p> This month , the Russian tally of doping cases in sport grew when former world open water champion Vladimir Dyatchin retired after being suspended for two years in the wake of a positive test for an anabolic agent last June . <p> The FINA case reads : On June 30 , 2014 , the swimmer Vladimir Dyatchin ( RUS ) was tested positive to the substance Ostarine ( Class S.1.2 Other Anabolic Agents ) following a doping control test conducted with the occasion of the Russian Open Water Championships . The Russian Swimming Federation imposed a sanction of 2 years ' ineligibility on the athlete starting on July 4 , 2014 . <p> That Russia reported a case in domestic waters saved the country from a whole-nation ban : Russia has three prominent athletes serving suspensions after positive tests that fall into he ' FINA ' category , or cases generated by international testing . <p> Yuliya Efimova , world champion from 2013 , Sergey Makov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive EPO test , have placed Russia on high alert . Efimova Photo : Patrick B. Kraemer is set to make her return o top-flight racing after a lenient 16-month ban when she races at Russian nationals in Moscow in April . <p> Shame seems to be in shorter supply than doping , meanwhile . , 32 and well beyond his 2003 and 2007 world titles , tested positive last June and now his case and bar are in place , he tells the R-Sport news agency : <p> " I will not compete again of course . I will concentrate on organising events . " <p> It may be that reports fell shy of reporting the ' sorry I cheated and I think that entirely wrong ' or perhaps that kind of phrase was never forthcoming and it may be that when he mentions ' organising events ' he means his family 's next holiday but should be nowhere near young athletes and the organisation of events in swimming during his two-year suspension , at the very least . 
 Highlights College Action in USA , Missy Franklin Leading the Way <p> As the United States tries to piece together a way to defeat the Australians in the 400 freestyle relay at this summer 's World Championships and next year 's Olympic Games , Missy Franklin and Simone Manuel will be key components to the problem-solving venture . On Friday night , though , they tangled in a classic 200-yard freestyle showdown at the Pac-12 Conference Championships . <p> Racing side by side and away from the field , Franklin and Manuel battled all the way to the wall , with Franklin giving California the victory with a time of 1:41.09 , to the of Manuel . Those times sit No. 2 and No. 3 in the history of the event , topped only by Franklin 's American record of 1:40.31 from last year 's NCAA Championships . <p> Franklin had the advantage from the start and held off a final charge by Manuel over the last 50 yards .

Franklin gave that barrier a run a year ago and seems to be ahead of track this season . Cal heads into the final day of the Pac-12 Champs with a commanding lead in the race for the team title and the Golden Bears also received individual wins from Celina Li in the 400 individual medley and Olympian Rachel Bootsma in the 100 backstroke , where she claimed the conference crown for the third consecutive time . <h> A Texas Two-Step for Jack Conger and Joseph Schooling <p> Given its top-flight talent and depth , the University of Texas is expected to challenge for its 11th NCAA team championship next month at NCAAs , California-Berkeley the biggest obstacle on that path .

 Ruta Meilutyte On The Cusp Of 18 &amp; Homing In On Defence <p> Ruta Meilutyte turned 18 today Happy birthday to the Olympic and World Champion , in a week that saw two London 2012 stars come of age . A recent feature with the Lithuanian : <p> Ruta Meilutyte hesitates . The Olympic and World champion wants to be clear . The question is about pace , rhythm , what it feels like to flow , to know you 're going fast and what it feels like when all of that evades you , as only a breaststroke ace knows it can . <p> Is there a lightness of touch , shade , density about the water and your moving through it ? " Yes , definitely , it feels like that when I 'm going fast , " says the 17-year-old . " In the 100 there 's that easy speed that comes in first 50 , when you make as low an effort as possible but know you 're still going fast ; you feel like you 've got so much energy but you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different . The fast feeling only truly comes into its own on race day . Big race day . " You feel it by the way your body position is in the water : only rest can really do that fully and I can tell if its flowing . When the feeling 's there , when you know your swimming is effortless , you know the time will be good as long as you get all the details of the performance right you 've prepared for . " <p> And when it goes wrong ? A little nervous laughter and the world record holder ( 1:04.35 faster than the men 's Olympic title was own in 1972 , good enough to make a men 's final as late as the 1980 Games , the Lithuanian the only current swimmer ever to have raced inside 1:05 in a textile suit , Rebecca Soni the only other to have done so , at 1:04.91 , and now retired adds : <p> " There are definitely days when he looks at me and says ' maybe do some freestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach at Plymouth Leander . <p> " My breaststroke is not 100 per cent every day : some days it feels like drowning . " <p> Knowing when to ease off , make a change as good as a rest , let the dice roll a little , avoid straining , avoid repeating bad habit and risking injury and then returning with a sense of respect to the moodiest of strokes and the water that resists resistance . <p> " The thing is not to make it slap dash , " says Meilutyte . It 's 7am and one swimming session is behind her , gym ahead of breakfast and college and then it 's back for more swimming in the evening and all that the day after returning from a couple of days in Milan shooting film and video for her sponsor , Arena , alongside Chad le Clos . All photos : La Presse courtesy of Arena see our gallery on the SwimVortex Facebook page . <p> " It 's the busiest day of my week . " Not all of it is spent at break-neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the sprinter 's life as the controlled fury of rapid precision she is known for when the are on and the world tunes in . Says Meilutyte : <p> " The slow bits in training make the difference , that focus on precision , on getting it right , on being at ease . The thing I try to do is swim diligently every time , in warm-up , training , hard sets ... " <p> All the better to avoid the off day clashing with the wrong day : race day . <p> The coach has an eye for when things are going well and a need for lightening reactions when things go the other way . What , for Rudd , were the tell-tale signs of those extremes ? <h> The good : <p> " Its the rythm of her stroke ; when she gets it right , its just poetry in motion , there 's a connection between pull and kick , no dead spot , everything flows very sweetly . You ca n't get that every day . Breaststroke can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains she 's worked for over the past couple of seasons and when she is just on it and it all goes smoothly , its a formidable thing to observe . " <h> The bad but avoiding the ugly : <p> " You have to think in terms of repair when its not there but you never push it . We get to swim other things when her breaststroke is not on . With Ruta , it is definitely a case of the age-old adage that change is as good as a rest ; that works well for her . " <p> He adds : " We 've found that three days off doing others things and it 's there again good breaststroke form . That 's the key thing : move away , give it time . She 's very good at that . We 've got it right and we know what works on that score . " <p> Rudd noted how " very fortunate " swimmer and coach are that Meilutyte is no one-stroke wonder . Her forte , of course , is sprint breaststroke but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in short-course . " She 's not a one-trick pony and when its time to come away from breaststroke and let it naturally rejuvenate we know we 're not wasting time , " says the coach . " She 's got some other things to do in the sport . There 's a way to make sure she 's making constructive use of her time . " <h> Between Games <p> Those last five words sum up the career of Meilutyte , who will still be a teenager when she arrives in Rio for the defence of her Olympic crown , her 18th birthday coming round a week today . Not a season has past without a major crown , last year , in the absence of major long-course global senior competition , sealing an impressive golden account in her treasury : she now has a title at every international level that has ever been open to her , Olympic , World long- and short-course , European , long- and short-course , Olympic Youth and European junior , all her big prizes in the 50 and . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains : <p> " On the 50 , it 's so easy to start slipping , missing strokes : it 's a crazy race . There 's so much pressure to get every single stroke right but at the same time produce as much power in every stroke . I much prefer the 100 . In the 50 , you just want to go balls out . " An infectious snigger precedes : " The 50 's too short but I still enjoy it . " <p> The 100 is more thought-provoking . The tone more serious , the contemplation keener , when talk turns to what a sub 1:04 breaststroke would look like four decades after John Hencken took the men that way in Concord at U.S nationals . Says the woman closest to the pioneering moment among her peers : " We 're working on the back 50 because that 's where the weakness bit of it is : the last 15 ( metres ) . That 's where the most work is needed . You have to have the easy speed for the first 50 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Define endurance . " It 's not only the endurance of doing many 100s in sets but the kind of endurance you need to do back to back 50s and hold the time and have the target in mind and think ' this is how I want to come back in the race ' , " she says . " That 's hard . It 's a lot of focus but the reward is that when you feel that flow down the first 50 , when that comes after you get some rest taper . " <h> Swimming Solo But Conscious of the Strength Of Support Around Her <p> There is a certain loneliness about singular dedication : only you , ultimately , can do it , not just on race day but in terms of the daily habit of living ' world-class ' each and every day . Meilutyte acknowledges that but couples the thought to support . Asked what the most challenging thing was about preparing as a world-class athlete , she said : <p> " I think that its less to do with a set and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself ; it 's about not having that attitude ' that 'll do ' . Not always easy to follow that diet make sure you do this or that , make it a habit . Having that discipline is very hard . " <p> Just " what you have to do " if you want to perform and then stand on the podium . <p> It 'll be just her bowing to have the medal placed round her neck but in spirit she carries with her all who help her to get there . <p> What 's Rudd like ? What does he bring to the party ? As with almost all questions , Meilutyte 's reaction time pales by comparison with her signature speed off the blocks as she contemplates carefully chosen but sincere words : <p> " I think he 's really nice . He knows what works for me and how to get the best out of me . I do n't feel any pressure from him , which truly helps . I think he 's good at this : he does n't forget to enjoy what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell me off when I 'm doing something wrong . " <p> Plaudits too for the strength and conditioning coach Paris Payne , other support staff and her leander teammates who " bring the best out of me " . <h> Street Wise &amp; Mature Beyond Her Years <p> To some extent 2014 was a holding year , a moment of calm in the storm of progress the pace of race day set by the commitments she made to her nation in her last stand as a junior . Was there a sense of relief that the ' junior ' world was done with ? <p> " I think there are two key benefits to moving on , " says Rudd , adding : <p> " One , she 's a lot more stable in the training environment : there are fewer competitions to keep Lithuania 's Olympic Committee and federation satisfied and we never saw that as a negative because they 've been hugely supportive of all that 's been doing ; and two , she was psychologically finished with being a junior a year ago : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her country than anything else and she no longer has to contemplate that any more . She racing senior athletes and she 's a senior in her own mind . " <p> There is another aspect of junior life that she wo n't miss , notes Rudd . " The attention she got when she walked into a junior event was amplified so much . At senior meets she 's one of many stars . At World juniors and Youth Olympics the spotlight was all the more concentrated on her . " <p> Much has changed since the approach to London 2012 . " In 2011 and 2012 we were still thinking of her as a top-end age-grouper . We did a lot more medley work at that time and quite a bit of freestyle work , " recalls Rudd . " Now , we 're much more honed in on breaststroke . She may do the 50 free at the Olympics . Her training in the pool and gym reflects that , reflects the changes . She 's 18 next week : I 'm training a woman now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He mentions " cognitive knowledge " as one of the assets she now has that was not there in 2012 . Meilutyte knows her way around in the elite swim world ; she 's at home , stable , the pathways to the podium known to her . How would she describe the difference of then and now ? <p> " I 've developed a lot as an athlete overall , not only as swimmer , " says Meilutyte . " The swimming 's become a lot smarter . It used to be a case of ' go out fast as you can and come back as fast as you can ' . I 'd be windmilling , taking tiny strokes . In the past few years , there 's been a lot of technique focus and thinking of swimming in terms of strength . <p> " I 'm more powerful , I 've got a better hold of the water and everything else has stepped up , too . I 'm much more experienced and there 's so much on board that I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is how she describes the sport of swimming to add to the toughest challenge she mentioned earlier . But no chance of seeing her walk away anytime too soon . " I 'm really passionate about the sport : I love doing it and it gives some kind of meaning to my life . <p> " To represent my country , to feel like a better person , to have a great team of people surrounding me all my teammates are amazing I 'm just so grateful to have this opportunity to do something that I enjoy so much . " <p> Meilutyte is still at school , reading A-Level psychology but bypassing other subjects until Rio is done . " The subject fits her really well , " says Rudd . " She 's an amateur psychologist in the way she thinks and operates her own life . Her academic commitments are low and we 're going to do that this year and then just continue that psychology in her 2nd A-level year or change subject . Plymouth College the school that partners the Leander club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mind ticking over and keeps her emotionally and psychologically active without detracting from the energy she needs for training and racing . " <p> All roads lead to Rio , all goggles to the Games but on the way there she will defend her world crown this August , via swims at a meet in Sheffield and in heats as a visitor at British trials in London mid-April . <p> The latter will bring her back to the place it all began in terms of and Olympic-champion status . Says Rudd : " She 'll have a run out in the 100 breaststroke and in the pool where it all happened , possibly ion the same lane . She 's not raced there since 2012 so that 'll be exciting . " <p> Mare Nostrum in Canet will be followed by a training camp in Rome and the Sette Meet in the Eternal City , Russia round the corner if world politics leaves the calendar untouched . What 's the aim in Kazan ? <p> " The key thing for me will be something better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the best motivational state last summer . The Youth Olympics and European Championships she raced the in China and the 50 in Berlin in the same week was not the most attractive prospect for her . " Global challenge returns a spring to her step , he adds : <p> " There 's a buzz and a glow about her for the global challenge . It 'll be about how we create the performance and about taking on people head to head . We 're looking for it to give that psychological boost of where you stand in the world going into Olympic season . " <p> Kazan will be followed by a short break . " She will have some time off in the summer : she needs to recharge her emotional batteries ; she would get psychologically stale if she did n't do that , " says Rudd . No World Cups on the cards as yet ( nothing is ever ruled out ) because Rudd would like her to return to training by late August after visiting family and home . Says Meilutyte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . It definitely feel like home when I get back . I visit grandma and the family and see all my friends . It gets a bit crazy with all the attention and stuff but I would like to live there again one day . " <p> The bonds are strong regardless of the move to Britain . The swimmer 's father Saulius Sonny believed that his daughter , at 12 already showing fine skills , would not fulfil her potential at home , he moved to Plymouth in England to a place where Ruta could combine sport and school . The excellence bridge between the city 's Leander club and Plymouth College provided the perfect set-up and Rudd took charge of Meilutyte 's development in the pool from day one . <p> A year after her first Olympic Games , at which she caused one of the upsets of the action in the pool when pipping champion Rebecca Soni ( USA ) , Meilutyte was to be found thriving at the start of a new chapter in the first flush of life as an Olympic champion as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been started to emerge . <p> Now , she 's a little over a year out from her approach to the defence of her crown . This summer is about pace , performance , time , place and standing heading to the bigger moment . " Worlds is about just seeing where I am before the main event next summer in Rio . " She adds : <p> " If everything goes well and with the way training is going right now , I think I 'll perform the way I 'd like not to be but the most important thing is 2016 and that 's what we 're working on . " <p> And how will it feel to walk in as the defending champion come 2016 , will there be a sense of pride in the mix ? " I 'll definitely feel a touch of pride , " she replies . " I do n't feel any of it as a negative pressure the expectations are there but its down to me whether I want to put that pressure on myself . Yes , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's all there but I see it as positive pressure : they 're there to see you do well . " <p> Social media is overflowing with support for Meilutyte , too . " I have in the back of my mind that they are there to wish me well and support me . I want to make my country proud and all of that gives me a boost . " <p> There will be a trip to Brazil on the way to Rio but not yet and nothing designed to give the swimmer a " taste of what it will be like " , says Rudd . He explains : <p> " It will be a different Games . She walks in as defending champion . No-one can take that away its there in history . We 're neither of us people who look backwards . She 's very much looking forward and it will be a case of ' it 's my title and I want to defend it and do all I can to honour it ' . I feel the same . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the challenges of night swimming ( that Rudd has been critical of ) nor the challenges from self and others will be the same as all that was London 2012 , he adds : <p> " Nothing quite prepares you for an Olympic Games ; not even another one . There 's not an awful lot of relevance in one Games to the next . They are microcosms in themselves . Nothing else feels quite like it . It is a case of living the moment . " <p> Meilutyte knows it and the thought thrills her . She draws comfort , too , in the knowledge that come Rio she will have the support of two nations . Much loved in both homes , Meilutyte counts among well-wishers tuning into her progress as a ' local hero ' and heading to the defence of titles World and Olympic this summer and next the Plymouth taxi drivers who hope to be the one that ferries this global citizen to the airport when it comes time to fly down to Rio for a date with destiny and a shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Biohacking has brought 
 time today at the helm of the controversial race was 1:53.42 . In the pack finish that followed him Britain 's Jack Burnell , breaking through in open water , pipped Germany 's Christian Reichert and Italy 's Matteo Furlan , German 's second man home , Andreas just locked out of the medals . The women 's race was led by Rachele Bruni of Italy in 2:07.13 ahead of China 's Siyu Yan and Keri-Anne Payne of Britain , with Poliana Okimoto of Brazil fourth . <p> It would be hard to conclude that the event was well supported by the ranks of world swimming . There are 208 FINA member federations : just 19 sent swimmers to Abu Dhabi discounting the host nation , which has no world-class swimming program and fielded five men but no women . <p> The most notable absence was that of the United States , the 12 members of its national open water team having decided to boycott the event for a variety of reasons best summed up by a column by swimmer Alex Meyer for ESPN.com that starts : " In October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran Crippen , died in deplorable conditions during a FINA World Cup race in the United Arab Emirates . Recently , FINA reinstated that same race , to be held in Abu Dhabi just 150 miles from the 2010 venue , and under the supervision of the same race director . " <p> Meyer goes on to explain why he was not there today at a race that also went without the other 11 American national open water team members . <p> Meyer highlights how things get done in FINA , much of what happens or does not down to one man , the Executive Director Cornel Marculescu , of Romania and a former water polo official . Much of what happens also goes without serious ( sometimes in the absence of any ) question or challenge from members of the top table , the FINA Bureau . <p> Writes Meyer : " I first heard about the possibility of a World Cup race returning to the UAE in September of last year , and I was both surprised and not surprised at all . Knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event , the fact that it was only a possibility at first and eventually " tbc " on the World Cup schedule , offered little hope that it would n't come to fruition . " <p> And then this : <p> " My biggest problem with this whole situation is that I still feel like FINA has not taken its share of responsibility for Fran 's death , or any at all . " <p> Meyer raises the context of a doctor or A Another being found negligent when a patient dies and wonders why FINA has not had faced the same " get their pants sued off " , with dismissals in the mix . <p> What actually happened , he points out correctly , was that one of the key men in charge on the day Crippen died and criticised in independent inquiry reports was promoted by Marculescu to the top table of Open Water within FINA , the Technical Open Water Swimming Committee . Writes Meyer : <p> " Of course , Mr. Saad did n't mean for 2010 to happen , I 'm sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harsh lesson . The race on March 13 will probably be well-run and safe , especially because he knows the whole world is watching this time . But still , I do n't think the race should be put back in the control of the man who ran the 2010 race , a man who never did penance . " <p> Meyer emphasis that neither he nor anyone he knows wants the UAE to be penalised forever but he also points to the remaining stain in open water when it comes to allowable water temperatures for swimmers covering and more , limits that stretch well beyond what is permissible for a sprint swimmer in the controlled environment of a swimming pool under FINA rules : <p> " I just want FINA to take responsibility for what happened , restore trust with the athletes by putting real rules in place to make us safer ( like the new supervision rules it imposed , unlike the bogus 31 degrees C max temp rule based on a highly suspect " scientific " study commissioned and run by FINA committee members ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " <p> The waters off the UAE coast today were reported as ranging from 23 to 25C . <p> Meyer notes that USA Swimming , a federation that did not issue any formal statement and refused to provide a comment of its own position for this website when one was requested preferring to lean on the boycott chosen by athletes and say that ' spoke loudest ' of all has backed its athletes . He then adds : " Many athletes do n't have this luxury of support from their federation , and given that many international swimming federations do n't want to cause problems with FINA , there could be a lot of athletes in the UAE on March 13 who may not want to be there but are required to compete by their federations . " <p> Meyer concludes : <p> " Until FINA makes some real changes , I do n't think this race belongs back in the UAE. " <h> Fears for safety 
 : Julio Maglione , top right , is the latest in a line of federation presidents going back to George Hearn in 1908 <p> Editorial <p> Veteran French journalist Eric , former star writer at L'Equipe , has joined the chorus of opprobrium of FINA leadership , its u-turns and blunders , with a stinging satirical and sarcastic rebuke of plans to have the president of the swimming federation stay on in the job until he is 85 in the face of prevailing rules at IOC and FINA levels and even though the Uruguayan incumbent came to the top seat on a campaign ticket of " no more than two terms " . <p> 's opener : " Jules Cesar Maglione does not fear the Ides of March ( nothing to fear , after all that was the day before yesterday ) . " <p> A " real gem is this Cesar " , writes as he sharpens his quill to explain how Julio would like to hang on to power and how those closest to him would play king-makers to their own champions as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would then be in line to become the president when the is majesty no more and finds himself half a decade beyond his sell-by-date as an IOC member ( in Olympic circles and in FINA rules that he voted for just a few years ago , the age limit is 80 ) . <p> 's forced retirement at IOC level would leave the figurehead with so much time on his hands . Thank heavens for FINA , suggests , tongue more firmly in cheek than a goose whose foie gras is about to be cooked . <p> If there is nothing new in the detail of what writes on the topic FINA 's leaders think appropriate as their next move to empower themselves not swimming the Frenchman 's words do indeed deliver a line rare in the media to date and unheard of in FINA circles : criticism and deep cynicism of the role of the all-powerful executive director Cornel Marculescu , 74 this summer . <p> The FINA Bureau proposals we wrote on last month after a gathering of the executive in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sensible , suggests , given that tend to get tired more quickly ( especially with all those other organisations , world , regional , continental and domestic , that take up his time and energy and leave one wondering how it could all be possible for one man ) . Add to that , of course , the notion that Marculescu already has control of the power of wheel and deal when trotting the globe to press the flesh with hosts and potential hosts of what many in the sport now see as FINA 's overblown world of **25;428;TOOLONG sake . <p> Writes : <p> " In short , we extend Maglione 's reign , but we wish no longer to tire him that 's a promise and Mr Marculescu will assume those presidential powers that interest him . <p> " If I were cynical , I would say that I know well that there method of Marculescu : extend the term of a senile and threatened leader , engineer a vice-president to reassure all about continuity , walk off with essential power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president . <p> He concludes : " But we know that is not the case : here at FINA they are building the best system for ethical and effective governance of the International Federation ... " <p> The late Nick Thierry ( how we miss him ) had a playful term he would use when referring to Julio Maglione in his days as Hon , Treasurer : " Uno para ti , Dos para mi " . Today , it seems , he of the middle name Cesar would like to make it " tres para mi " in true empirical style . <p> Congress , the ultimate power of the international federation , should , say coaches , athletes and others , tell him that it is time to move on and the role of director is to serve the membership of swimming and negotiate only that which the ruling authority of FINA say he should . I share that view : those ' serving ' have gone beyond themselves and seem to be incapable of rolling back and planting their feet back down on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this summer , we can expect a lot more attention on the way FINA is going about its business . Let 's face it : we 're back in Rome 1994 , we 're back in Perth 1998 ; we 're back in a place where FINA 's top table has opened itself up to much deserved criticism and ridicule . " <p> Another observer noted that the issues have started to spill into the attention zone of the leadership at the International Olympic Committee at a time when the wider membership of swimming is asking : can FINA be repaired , or should it the replaced ? <h> Comments <p> March 17 , 2015 <p> It 's a good thing that such a respected media outlet is shining a torch on FINA . The mainstream media generally ignores the sport of swimming except when the Olympics come around and , in a more limited way , when the World Championships are staged . <p> What has Jules Cesar ever achieved ? In fact , most of the FINA bureau appears to be made up of compliant time-servers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the sport is becoming less and less visible on the sporting landscape . <p> Children are suffering 
 Coaches Association and its American partner has issued a public appeal to athletes worldwide , retired and currently in the swim , to end their days of ' slavery ' , organise themselves and press for better representation and the lion 's share of the spoils of their sport . <p> In an open letter headed " Let Us Stop Being Chumps And Slaves " and intended for coaches , their charges and parents , John Leonard , the director of coaching bodies international and American that account for tens of thousands of members worldwide , declares : <p> " It is time for our Professional athletes to end their " SLAVE DAYS " . Take a page from Golf and form a ' Swimmers Union ' . " <p> Leonard focuses on the vast sums of money flowing into FINA , a non-profit organisation . Some of the cash is spent on prize money these days but the sums to individual athletes for a world title remain relatively small , coaches and programs get no share , and the bulk of prizes is spent on a failed attempt to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world cup series . <p> Among other issues : <p> a slowness to respond to calls for a complete overhaul of a tired world-cup format <p> a rethink on the way partnership deals are done , with every athlete obliged to wear a cap with a FINA sponsor on it at world titles , sometimes in direct competition to the private sponsors who do actually fund the way of swimmers through the sport in a direct way <p> Logos on kit are stringently controlled by FINA , with many believing that the international federation 's stance is holding back the sport and its potential to sell itself to a wider audience . <p> If proven , that last allegation alone , one made in a series of television documentaries by one of Germany 's prime networks , ARD , could have serious consequences for Russian sport on the way to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . The WADA Code includes clear rules governing the chain of command of anti-doping samples which must never be opened by any other than the relevant staff of any IOC-accredited laboratory they are headed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what the FINA annual or quadrennial budget is ? Neither do I. Nor does anyone else except for ( perhaps ) the FINA Executive . Maybe no one knows except FINA Executive Director Cornel Marculescu . Or he might share that information with his President ( a man aiming to hang on to the top seat until he is 85 ) . Or he might not . But I do know this . Once every four years , the IOC gives FINA 45 MILLION DOLLARS . <p> The IOC does that because FINA is one of the top three federations in terms of television views at the Olympic Games . <p> WHY do those public folk watch the Olympic Games ? Is it to see Cornel Marculescu and his Bureau sitting on their Thrones ? I think not . This will come as a surprise to the FINA Bureau , but people tune in to watch ...

Administrators are rewarded and glorified ( and , enriched ) , athletes are a " necessary annoyance " without any say and coaches having zero status in the entire organization . <p> Money earned on Athletes Backs is Money that Should Be in Athletes Pockets and not in the wallets of those who select to sit on Thrones . <p> WE ALL DESERVE BETTER . <p> John Leonard <p> Director , <h> Comment : <p> In due course , a reaction will follow to the above call for athletes to find a voice and stand up for their rights through representation that allows current swimmers to get on with the job they have at hand without distraction while those recently retired or able to take up representative roles start the work required to radically improve the way the sport is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming here and the campaign for change and better governance is in its infancy . A similar wind is blowing through others sports , the most notable and publicised of them football . Some of the mood music from the world of football may speak to far larger sums of money and beat at a different pace but the lyrics are most relevant to swimming on a number of levels . Without comment , beyond urging you to replace FIFA with FINA from time to time as you read , I bring you this speech delivered today to UEFA Congress by FIFA Presidential Candidate , Prince Ali of Jordan . <p> President Blatter , <p> President Platini , <p> FIFA Vice-presidents and Presidents of Confederations , <p> Members of the UEFA Executive Committee , <p> Distinguished Presidents of European Member Associations , <p> Friends and colleagues , <p> It is an honour and a pleasure to be given the opportunity to stand before you as a FIFA presidential candidate . <p> And I want to thank you President and the Austrian Football Association for your kind hospitality in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convey my utmost respect and appreciation to my fellow candidates for being a part of this debate about the future of our great game . <p> I bring you greetings from my home country of Jordan ; a land of peace ; a country that serves as a bridge between cultures ; and a mediator in times of conflict ; a country that is at the crossroads of all continents and civilizations . <p> A country that believes in the pursuit of values , such as integrity , honesty and respect . <p> We are in a crucial time for football . Both inside and outside the football family , people have expressed concern about the way FIFA is run . <p> And there are some deep rooted issues that we as a family must unite to confront together . <p> Around the world there is a real appetite for change , new leadership , better support to National Associations , meaningful investment in football development , and for FIFA to be a genuine service organisation . <p> This movement calls for a better FIFA , one based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed with a spirit of inclusion and transparency . <p> For the past 16 years as President of a developing FA I understand the many challenges associated with that job . I am also proud to have been elected as a FIFA Vice President for Asia and have always tried to bring the interests and needs of National Associations to the FIFA Executive Committee . <p> I envisage a FIFA that empowers its Member Associations , while always maintaining the highest standards of good governance . <p> We need a change of culture and a departure from FIFA 's authoritarian approach to strategy . <p> Strategic direction must come from the Confederations and Member Associations so that their interests become THE priority in the future . <p> So , this election is not simply about choosing a person you believe in , it is about choosing a future for football and for FIFA , your FIFA . <p> Next month I will publish a detailed programme based on the input of colleagues around the world . <p> Today I want to share with you some thoughts . <p> FIFA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding the wave of European football 's success which has also helped directly the success of the FIFA World Cup . <p> And while the popularity of the World Cup has soared , the image of the organisation has sadly declined . <p> Imagine a rejuvenated FIFA , with its own reputation rebuilt and restored , coupled with the love of football , the only possible outcome will be explosive commercial growth far exceeding what we see now . <p> Ongoing and new commercial success coupled with the excess funds from our reserves can combine to create the right formula we need for FIFA 's development programmes . <p> The aim has to be to expand the game to new markets and territories , and give more countries a chance to produce new talent and achieve success at international level , both youth and senior level and in both men 's and women 's football . And allow Member Associations to aspire to host these events and receive the necessary support . <p> Many FA 's around the world still do not have their basic needs met such as kits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reaching the knockout stages of the World Cup . <p> Whatever the case , the answer can only lie in harnessing the creative power and minds across FIFA 's Member Associations to give us the solutions to fit their specific needs , on a case by case basis . <p> And we need to expand financial support to the Member Associations because the more sustainable they are the better it is for football and for FIFA . <p> I see a new era where development is a fundamental right of Member Associations ... not a gift from FIFA . <p> There is also a human dimension here . I want to see new development partnerships in coaching , in governance and in player talent . I would like to see scholarship programmes to link coaches , officials and players around the world to benefit all our Member Associations . <p> I also believe that football has to use its power in the field of social responsibility to help the wider society and this is something very dear to my heart . <p> I am particularly grateful to a colleague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concept to unify FIFA 's work in this field . That colleague is the President of the Malta FA . Thank you Norman . I want to translate your vision into reality . <p> When it comes to the FIFA World Cup and the debate about the allocation of places , I want to give you my commitment to the protection of the European slots at the World Cup . <p> We are , after all , talking about the home of the current World Champions and the continent that is home to some of the most successful national teams ever to have graced the game . <p> This extends to also protecting the existing slots of all the Confederations . <p> There should be no change to the World Cup format , or the allocation of places , without a full and transparent consultative process . <p> We must preserve the integrity of the competition , ensure that the highest standard of football is played at the game 's global flagship event and that neither format nor slots become subject to political whim and manoeuvring . <p> Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against each other . <p> I am proud to be endorsed by Member Associations from three different Confederations . However , I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members of UEFA who had the courage to grant me their support , Belarus , England , Georgia , and Malta . <p> FIFA should take great pride in what European football has given the world . You have set the highest standards in all that you do , both on and off the field , and the whole world watches , including my children , when the great dramas of European football play out . <p> In this respect I want to pay tribute to the vision and dedication of President Platini . <p> As the custodian of European football , I would like to acknowledge your inspirational leadership , your management of excellent national and club competitions and your valuable contribution to improving the governance of world football . <p> Mr President , you also showed us your qualities on the field of play . Wonderful creativity , professionalism , precision , team work and a will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , a true sportsman . <p> And there is something else , which I have always respected , you never received a red card in your long and distinguished footballing career . You played by the rules . <p> These , are the qualities that inspire me and countless others as an example of the ethic we need to rebuild FIFA 's reputation and way of working . <p> Over the next two months it is essential that together we focus on the opportunity for real change and genuine reform . <p> This is a crossroads which could set FIFA on a new and positive path . That is the choice that the football family faces on May 29th . <p> President Platini , dear colleagues of UEFA , it has been an honour to address you today and thank you very much for your time . <h> Comments <p> Guilty by association ? March 24 , 2015 <p> Dr. Margo Mountjoy is a member of the International Olympic Committee 's Medical Commission , is Chair of the FINA ( F ? d ? ration Internationale de Natation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Anti-Doping Agency 's TUE ( Therapeutic Use Exemption ) Committee . <p> A fan , perhaps , but let 's not slander her for sitting while speaking . She has a job to do and that might even include communicating with FINA 's ED . <p> Unless Mr. Leonard has information that has n't been shared publically that Dr. Mountjoy is a big part of the problem , do n't throw her in just to augment the broadside aimed at a worthy target . <p> Craig Lord March 24 , 2015 <p> Reader by the name of Guilty by Assoc. , I urge you to find your true voice and speak in your own name and let the reader know what function you play in sport I know it and it will remain confidential if that is your choice but context is important in such matters and fear has no place in this debate if we truly want a better sport . Beyond that , John Leonard may speak for himself on his choice of words . And beyond your suggestion , not mine , that she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has received emails from me , as have other Bureau members , with questions on very serious issues . I have never received a reply , neither when the mail came from The Times newspaper nor for this website . All must go through and be approved by the man she is seated with , it seems . The job she has to do includes asking questions of the director such as : In my name and in the name of all Canadian swimmers and coaches and other members of our federation , precisely who voted in favour of granting Putin FINA 's highest honour and why was I not asked to vote on the matter in a formal debate on the issue because that is part of my duties and responsibilities as a member of the ruling Bureau . By all means defend Dr Mountjoy but also ask her the pertinent questions that pertain to her duties and responsibilities as a FINA Bureau member , such as has she seen a full set of detailed accounts for the international federation and is she happy with where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that facilities rules designed with safety and athlete welfare in mind do n't count when it comes to world records. , Of course they do count and the rule unmistakably backs that up .... but FINA HQ tell the media that ' no , not the case , minimum FINA Pool Standards ' do n't apply when world records are set . Where does Dr Mountjoy stand on that issue and has she spoken up for athlete welfare ? And how about Dr Ba Zhen has Dr Mountjoy asked what her director and FINA is doing to enforce the WADA Code after the banned doctor appeared on the poolside working with Sun Yang with official accreditation at the Asian Games during his suspension under the Code , his penalty should be doubled . Fact . So , has Dr Mountjoy asked ? And has Dr Mountjoy asked about what penalty will be imposed on her fellow Bureau member from China and the CSA after China fell foul ( by a big margin ) of reporting deadlines under the WADA Code and FINA rules in the Sun Yang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , she would surely have taken a very keen interest in the doping issues on the table and will be keen to enforce the WADA Code . I can only assume she has taken up this matter with the director in the most vigorous manner . I could go on and on but I think you get my point . I 'd be delighted to hear from Dr Mountjoy , the representative of Canadian swimming in the world , on the above and other substantive issues in the sport . She has my email address . Whenever she is ready , I 'm all ears . Reader I thank you for your comment and the opportunity it raises . I urge all members of the FINA Bureau to stand up and start asking the questions that they have long needed to ask when things were going down in their name , on their watch . Best , Craig <p> March 24 , 2015 <p> Golf , football , swimming ... Spot the difference . <p> Our sport does not make money . There are plenty of pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the real world no one has cracked the formula . With the exception of one week in a thousand , that 's just the way it is . <p> Fina ca n't be held to ransom because Fina events do n't make money ; that 's just following a simple principle of union strategy . Contrary to a rather silly notion that 's becoming a popular meme here , the athletes are not assets ( in the financial sense , which is the theme of this letter ) . <p> For a sports professionals Union to make any sense there has to be an identifiable market and an identifiable membership . There 's no market ( Leonard has some nebulous ' tour ' vision ) for swimming , and that basically ensures an uncertainty as to membership . Who would be part of this Union ? Olympic swimmers , self-defined professionals , promising juniors , the guy at the local club . Without some idea of the professional market place , we ca n't get off the ground enough to even start a membership . <p> As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yes , it Is not fit for purpose ; no , I do not claim to have the answers . Although , I do believe size correlates well with corruption and Fina 's multi-sport mandate is harmful to progress . The first step is separate administrative futures for the aquatic sports . <p> Craig Lord March 24 , 2015 <p> Last point , I agree ... wo n't happen within FINA they survive on universality and all that goes with it . I do n't agree with the money argument , however . No , of course it is not football and golf but a pot of a year ( and a bit more ) is what we 're talking about ... that 's not a pittance ... used wisely and directed properly in a sport that could attract bigger and better there is fine potential that is simply not being tapped into right now ( and it costs nowhere near over to put on a phenomenal world swim champs ... depends what you want to spend vast sums of money on ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few that look at all attractive ) , felix but in my experience there are swimmers out there who do have some very fine ideas but are never heard and have no say . Getting things off the ground always takes effort . It was the case with FINA in 1908 : there was a mess , chaos , no standards or parameters ... but it happened . Current swimmers are often too busy and focussed to deal with such things as organising to have a voice while retired swimmers are often lost to the sport ( and a fair few leave somewhat embittered by that lack of say in their own feds as well as at intl level ( to some extent , same thing , same problem ) . I give your an example : Michael Gross is a very smart man , some of what he had to say simply did not match the cosy existence of federation folk in his country he left and with him went a great deal of potential for swimming beyond his swimming years . That picture is repeated many times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the most senior in the pool now and some retired get together to represent the rest need to do if they want change is simply begin . You wo n't build Rome in a day but begin . best , Craig <p> jman March 24 , 2015 <p> I hate , hate , hate the term " slavery " used here . I agree with either changing or moving away from FINA . But that is a choice of swimmers , coaches , countries , etc . Those either currently in bondage or slavery in the past ( as in the USA ) was not a choice not are/were those people ever afforded the chance to travel , earn medals and earn a living . Use a different word . <p> Craig Lord March 24 , 2015 <p> Appreciate why you would hate it jman but just to note that the definition of slavery includes : servitude , subjugation , enthralment , a condition of having to work very hard without proper remuneration or appreciation ... Such things speak most closely to what is being suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of helping people understand what is being suggested . <p> The word slavery used here demeans real slavery , not even reminiscent . <p> Craig Lord March 25 , 2015 <p> Thanks jman . I will choose a word when I get to writing my own on this theme ( slavery means the same here , too ... and it is not historic ... it continues to be an issue , with people kept prisoners in the homes of very wealthy folk etc etc .. please do n't imagine I do n't know what you mean )@@3138307 <h> Deals of the 
 the French nationals in Limoges was never going to be an easy moment from the day that Camille Muffat died in a helicopter crash in Argentina . France honoured the Olympic champion with a fitting tribute as National Championships got underway . <p> Among mourners at the Olympic freestyle champion 's funeral was friend , challenger in water and training partner Charlotte Bonnet . She , along with coach Fabrice Pellerin and the rest of the team at Olympic Nice Natation joined French Swimming in a ceremony of remembrance today in Limoges and watched videos of Camille Muffat in the pool after filing past giant posters of the swimmer in the entrance to the pool . <p> And then , Bonnet and Nice clubmate Evelyn Verraszto , of Hungary , paid homage to their former training partner with a 2:12.14 to 2:12.32 demonstration of many of the skills that Camille Muffat also honed down the years over medley in the days before she switched to freestyle focus . The bronze went to Lara Grangeon in 2:13.27 . <p> Marie Wattel produced another win for Nice , her 58.35 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a French swimmer in a textile suit , a 58.33 by Alena in her first season for France after a switch from Belarus the standard setter . <h> Tribute To Camille Muffat <p> In a moving tribute at the Limoges pool , a 10-minute film was shown . Dedicated to Camille Muffat , the compilation showed some of the highlights of the swimmer 's career and included tributes from teammates , including Yannick Agnel , fellow Olympic champion and a man much affected by the death of his former training partner in Nice . <p> The film was watched by onlookers silent and still but for the tears that rolled . It was followed by an address by the President of the French Swimming Federation , Francis . A minute of applause concluded the tribute . <p> There to pay homage was 2008 free Olympic champion Alain Bernard , who had also been a played in the TV show " Dropped " with Camille Muffat when tragedy struck . <p> Camille Muffat died March 9 in a collision between two helicopters in Argentina where the game was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Alexis Vastine , the boxer . Ten people were killed in the accident . <p> Muffat 's parents were not present in Limoges for the tribute . <h> In other action at nationals <p> The opening day in Limoges also witnessed a 23.37 victory for Florent Manaudou , of Marseilles , ahead of clubmate and Fred Bousquet , the dad to his niece and sister 's daughter , on 23.78 . Also inside 24 was Yonel , of Toulouse , bronze to him in 23.87 . <p> Also into the early season world top 5 was Dutch challenger based in Sarcelles , Sharon van Rouwendaal , on at the helm of the freestyle , the French champion Coralie Balmy , of Mulhouse , in 4:07.51 , and bronze to Oph ?

 like a soldier going over the top of the trench . You can shoot at him and shoot at him and you will not stop him moving forward " Coach Mel Marshall . Adam Peaty will arrive at the World Championships this August with a rare status in tow : a Brit perceived as a ' dead cert ' for a world swimming title in the way that Katie Ledecky is in the three distance freestyle events <h> Comments <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> Unless he is injured or do , he will take Kazan and Rio golds , Thank you very much . <p> He seems likeable and he is not bad looking at all , so if his parents are savvy , they would already be on the phone with potential managers or IMG sports right now , if he does n't have a manager already . <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> Injured or dq <p> The autocorrect feature is really annoying <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> I think British Swimming needed a central figure for the other athletes to look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation to look to as a sign that their investment in swimming has been worth the sacrifice . Well , now they have one ! The rest of the world better be paying attention ... <p> You do n't think Van Der Burgh has taken all those posts about " Peaty this " and " Peaty that " and posted ' em on his locker door ? ? ? <p> Let him bask in his glory now but come Monday ... back to work ! <p> Craig Lord April 19 , 2015 <p> Bill Bell : Mr Peaty did n't need you to tell him he 'd said it before you got there ... in the article <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> Or Yamaguchi going from WR holder in 2012 to 9th in the world rankings in 2013 and 20th in ' 14 , with no international medals . <p> For that matter , he has n't had a best time in any breaststroke event since then . <p> Craig Lord April 19 , 2015 <p> Quite , but that scenario would n't really apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth champion ahead of the Olympic champion , so proven under pressure in intl waters , Yamaguchi never having achieved anything close to that . <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> No one is unbeatable , but the above comments are really focusing on two different things . Someone else can get better , or you can get worse . <p> The first one is unlikely here . Van Der Burgh may be motivated , and he is a great competitor , but it would be very surprising if he could drop that much time . <p> Yamaguchi has n't missed out on international medals because of other people , but because he has n't been able to back up his great time . Of course his WR is n't that far ahead of the field , whereas Peaty is now in the Ledecky bracket of having a clear advantage on the known competition . <p> Chris April 19 , 2015 <p> For me his the favourite and rightly so for Kazan and that 's a bit of an unusual thing for British swimming after a disappointing Olympics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there as Gold medal favourite going in . Having said that there is still a long way to go to the Olympics and a new young talent could emerge that year . Adlington to use a British example was the favourite going into London and then a new talent blew everyone away . Good that World Records are still being broken and that the Super Suits era does not mean that they can ' be broken . Its amazing in this event how low under the 1 minute barrier the time has gone since Roman Sludnov first did it . Possible to go under 57 ? <p> Caroline Peaty April 19 , 2015 <p> All I can say to the comments left in response to the article is that Adam Peaty will always give his and that is all anyone can ask . <p> Craig Lord April 19 , 2015 <p> Thanks Caroline anyone who has ever met him would get that fairly quickly Great job all round <p> Rob April 19 , 2015 <p> " Just because I have got the world record now it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get my head down again and make sure I get that medal . " <p> " If at Worlds I do that kind of performance again it is all about carrying less emotional energy through to the next day ... I tried to come in this morning and do a job and that would have got me into semis at worlds so job done this morning . " <p> Sounds like someone who is switched on enough to take learning points from a WR swim , and who will work to be his best in Kazan and for the ultimate prize in Rio . And , to echo Caroline 's post , that 's all anyone can ask . <p> Craig Lord April 19 , 2015 <p> , Adam has an agent , he is Rob Woodhouse , the 400IM Olympic bronze medallist for Australia 1984 , and agent to Becky and others .... excellent choice . <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> Caroline Peaty , If you are related to Adam , please tell him everybody in the US is awed by his accomplishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be behind after the breaststroke leg , to be honest ) . My sincerest congratulations go out to him ! <p> April 19 , 2015 <p> Ah Rob Woodhouse . Of course I am very familiar with him ( not in person ) . Yes , excellent choice indeed . Rob 's nephew and niece are in the current Australia world championships team . <p> Viva la Bang April 20 , 2015 <p> Unless a Russian unknown comes out and swims 57.6 ! <p> April 20 , 2015 <p> It 's a bit stretch to say this swim was " " . <p> Not to downplay this swim- I gasped and thought it was spam when I first saw the number that came up here at . It is the largest drop in a WR in recent memory , and the majority of his competitors have n't even found out how to go . <p> This swim is no because we knew it was coming . Sprenger , and to a lesser extent , van der burg have been talking about it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a revolution since 2012 , and it really would n't surprise me to see all 6 records go down this summer . <p> The only swim I figure is actually since 2009 is the Sarah Sjostrom . That one was just so anomalous ( esp with respect w/ times ) that it could easily stand for 25 years . On the other hand , we 're already looking to Peaty to break more milestones and get down to . <p> April 20 , 2015 <p> I agree with John26 ... strictly , Sjostrom 's 50 fly record is the only one in the past 5 years . <p> breast would be truly if it 's dropped to at least 57.50 . Maybe this summer ? <p> Craig Lord April 20 , 2015 <p> May well be a bit of a stretch but we always know something is coming , John26 ... and neither you nor anyone else apart from Mel Marshall ( and the man himself ) thought this would come right now , April 2015 swimmers talk about possible times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something else . I do n't expect a flood of 57s to follow ... we 're sill awaiting a flood of 58s , I seem to recall ... Look at the free : we have that 47.10 ; we have a fair few 47.5 to 48 folk ; and a 2015 world ranks in which all top 20 are 48 plus at this stage in the season . Men : one 57.92 ; next in 59.1 so far ... and a top 20 spread to over 1:00.50 , more than 2.5 spread as opposed to spreads of around 1 to in all other strokes . <p> April 20 , 2015 <p> I truly believed that Peaty would break the WR , but yes , I did not expect him to go sub 58 this early . <p> Form , like most commodities , is " finite " and therefore will have an expiry date . Whether that comes before Kazan or Rio , we can not know . Ditto for Ledecky . In no way is this meant as a " diss " to either but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers . <p> Ledecky has been to the " big ones " but we are yet to see how Peaty handles Worlds and Olympics especially with an enormous target painted on his back .... and British media pressure . <p> Re Furniss ' statement re QT 's ; one can acknowledge his points about " challenging people , However , given the very uneven state of the GBR program the arbitrary standard set was arguably for where GBR currently sits in far too many events . <p> Craig Lord April 20 , 2015 <p> ' cautionary notes ' apply to everyone but history is also full of folk who stacked up ... I think the swimmer 's take on it is the perfect one ... ' a moment to be very pleased indeed but ... feet on ground , head down ' . One of the most important aspects of the theme you raise is what the article alludes to ... the swimmer 's nature , his approach to what he wants to achieve , the nature of his goal ... and the nature and approach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer who takes on not only the concept and an understanding of the hard times and tough stuff , the need for them and to get through it all but embraces it , welcomes it . I think that those able to do that feel far less of the damaging kind of ' pressure ' comme the big moment because they know without a doubt that they have given it all they have got and that will not change in the race ahead of them , no matter what the result ends up being . And as his mum says : you ca n't ask for more than that . As for media pressure in Kazan ... I doubt that : there 'll be hardly any British media there beyond the usual handful . The scrum only happens at the Olympics <p> For the record , I think we may see a " Beamonesque " swim from Katie Ledecky this summer or next . <p> Chris April 20 , 2015 <p> I think that the large drop in the WR is of note and he deserves all credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the minute barrier had yet to be breached . <p> Torchbearer April 21 , 2015 <p> I think Ledeckys WR is pretty much Beamonesque too .... must seem it to the other girls anyway ! On Peaty , it is interesting to see if a low pressure WR in a national meet transfers to the biggest stages . I remember watching Trickett and Sullivan smashing WRs in the and at national Olympic Trials for a total of zero golds at the Olympics . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> well yes , if we can call only two swimming world records as , those would be meagher 's two WRs . <p> Craig Lord April 21 , 2015 <p> Yes , , they are the standout examples . There are several other candidates for the club , such as Janet Evans ' marks , 400 , 800 , 1500 ... 's 200 back from 1991 ... I think the test is longevity and not just whether the protagonist can repeat the record speed but how long it takes for not just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark but how long it takes the wave to wash over the record ... Meagher , Evans , times , all still very competitive today and would still win the vast majority of national championships in the world and even make podiums at major international events .... I think we may be able to say the same of Adam Peaty 's time a decade from now when it comes to the wave of folk that make his time ' normal ' in the realms of an annual world top 20 . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> I was intrigued to compare how strong those legendary WRs stack against each other . <p> One of the best criteria for a " Beamonesque " WR is certainly longevity . But we also have measuring tool for the strength of a women WR : comparing it with the corresponding male WR and see in percentage how much slower it is . The lower the percentage , the stronger the women WR against another . <p> So I 've done the calculation : <p> Meagher 's 100 fly WR ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WR at that time ( 52.81 ) <p> Meagher 's 200 fly WR ( 2:05.96 ) is 6.74% slower than the men WR ( 1:58.01 ) <p> Evans ' 400 free WR ( 4:03.85 ) is 7.45% slower than the men WR ( 3:46.95 ) <p> 's 200 back WR ( 2:06.62 ) is 7.94% slower than the men WR ( 1:57.30 ) <p> So , the winner HANDS DOWN is Meagher 's 200 fly . Everyone bow down to the Madame Butterfly . It took a legend Susie O'Neill repeated attempts , a 2000 speedo body suit and a 19 years to shave Meagher 's WR just by 0.15 seconds . 2:05.96 is the swimming version of Beamon WR . <p> As a comparison , Ledecky 's brand new 400 free WR ( 3:58.37 ) is 8.31% slower than Thorpe 's 13 years old WR ( 3:40.08 ) . <p> So , despite seemingly crazy fast Ledecky 's WRs , it confirms my early suspicion that Ledecky 's WRs are " merely " putting women middle distance WR progression back to its natural progression after years of Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Another alternative to explain is that Thorpe 's WR is truly Beamonesque , after all , the 3:40.08 is -by far- the longest standing men WR in the history of swimming . <p> I did not make comparison of 800 and 1,500 free WR because : 1 . 800 free is not a men 's Olympics event , and 2. 1,500 free is not a women 's Olympics event And so making strength comparison between men and women WRs in those events would produce misleading results . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> Judging by current 400 WR comparison between men and women and judging by how stronger she is in distance events as well as by the fact that she keeps getting faster in 200 , I think Ledecky can bring down 400 WR to 3:56 by the end of her career . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> I agree with whoever has the opinion that Ledecky 's 1500 WR is the strongest of her WRs and her 800 WR is her weakest one . <p> Craig Lord April 21 , 2015 <p> aswim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention O'Neill 's suit you would certainly have to mention Thorpey 's <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> I have no qualms mentioning Thorpe 's bodysuit as I think he would have gone faster in today 's jammers . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> Thorpe swam 3:41 in banana hammock at the age of 16 turning 17 , and he was only swimming 3:40 in his Adidas bodysuit at the prime age and physical peak of 18 and 19 . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> Also , today 's female swimsuits are not that much different compared to those 2000s body suits , with only leg cover being the difference . <p> There was a proposal during 2009 by Forbes Carlisle to limit female suit coverage back to pre 2000 model , but of course it was no go as etc would not be able to charge upwards for such suits . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> Mike Barrowman 's times in the have to be up there . He first broke the world record in 1989 and kept bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barcelona Olympics where he swam 2.10.16 . That record stood for 10 years until Kitajima came along . <p> April 21 , 2015 <p> , <p> Correct . Barrowman 's WR is the second longest standing at 10 years 2 months and change . <p> Third longest is Lamberti ' s WR which stood for more than 9 years and 7 months until Hackett hack it ( sorry could n't resist ) <p> But if you count only textile , ' s WR stood second longest for 11 years before Magnussen cleared it by a wide margin . <p> However , unlike Thorpe 's WR which we all know would have stood until now , so many swimmers went under record in shiny suit and 2 of them , Cielo and Sullivan , went so far below it , we are not sure if 47.84 would have survived 2008/2009 onslaught . <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> At this point , we might not see Thorpe 's record go down under 2020 . Crocker 's 50.40 is doing quite well too . <p> Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to stand ? <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> Zhang Lin record will stand for eternity . Only half joking of course . <p> Even Ledecky only cleared 27 years old Evans record by less than 5 seconds in a longer time , but Zhang Lin cleared 4 years old Hackett record by 6 seconds ( and took 7 seconds off 8 years old Thorpe record ) in a shorter time . Even Yang , for whom I think 800 free is the perfect event , and on trimetazidine , was nowhere near 7:32 <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> Whoaaaa ... I totally forgot about Crocker 's record ! <p> It 's gon na be 10 years old this July . And it does not seem anyone will be able to crack Crocker 's record this year or next . <p> It 's really unfortunate that he did n't win that Athens gold . I truly felt for him . <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> I feel bad that Crocker did n't wear a full LZR racer like Lauterstein did in the 100 fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have lost to him by 1 hundreth of a second and would have finished his career on the podium instead of 4th . Maybe it would have been a little less comfortable , but I think he could have gotten used to it ! <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> By the way , I 'm hoping Phelps makes breaking Crocker 's 100 fly textile record one of his goals for the Rio Olympics ! <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> It 's funny how when there is steady progress in an event everyone is pulled along , but sometimes after a big leap no one else can conceptualise a challenge . When Crocker and Phelps pushed each other on the event was so exciting , but now it 's as if it is in global recession . <p> Also believe the 200 fly record and textile best will last out another generation . <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> I agree . I think Phelps ' 200 fly textile will last a long time . <p> As a swimming fan and statistics and history fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with history continuity and comparisons . Now we never know what Phelps ' 400 IM textile best time would have been . Could Phelps have gone faster than his 2007 time , or is Lochte 's textile record is the legitimate one . Truly frustrating . <p> April 22 , 2015 <p> I would n't want to take it away from Lochte , but I imagine Phelps had a slightly faster potential than his own 2007 time , if only because at worlds the 400IM comes at the end of the week . <p> Mr Martin said

The international federation will , however , continue to post the most recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historic case files from the FINA website is likely to be unpopular with media that relies on such collations for its intelligence and the wider swimming community that finds it most valuable to point to the statistics as evidence of consistent wrong-doing . <p> For example , as Russia prepares to host the World Championships this August in Kazan in a year that saw a few FINA leaders hand Vladimir Putin the federation 's highest honour , the FINA Order , and Rio prepares to host the Olympic Games next year , those two nations have the highest counts in the sport in the past decade .

The same Member Federation must also Publicly Report within twenty ( 20 ) days the results of final appeal decisions concerning anti-doping rule violations , including the information described above . <p> 14.3.4 Publication shall be accomplished at a minimum by placing the required information on FINA or Member Federation 's website or publishing it through other means and leaving the information up for the longer of one month or the duration of any period of Ineligibility . <p> 14.3.6 The mandatory Public Reporting required in DC 14.3.2 shall not be required where the Athlete or other Person who has been found to have committed an anti-doping rule violation is a Minor . Any optional Public Reporting in a case involving a Minor shall be proportionate to the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correctly , that it complies with the letter of the law and accompanying discussion in the anti-doping realm , in these places : <p> The above passage in the WADA Code raises the question : why has the Chinese Swimming Association not received an anti-doping reprimand over its handling of the Sun Yang Case ? . If it did indeed inform FINA of the case in timely fashion , then FINA will have known about the case before Sun Yang raced to three gold medals at the Asian Games . Assuming FINA did not know for if it had known months before the world got to know about a case and a suspension imposed belatedly and under pressure , then the federation itself would have been in default of the WADA C0de then China failed got comply with the WADA Code . If China has been reminded of its anti-doping responsibility and the rules it must comply with as a FINA member , that information has not , as yet , been placed in the public domain . <p> Sun Yang Photo by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> FINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wake of questions from SwimVortex dating back to November 27 last year . Time for it to reinforce the message that a failure to comply with the WADA Code is not only unacceptable for individual athletes and their doctors but all federations affiliated to FINA . <p> While " stakeholders " in anti-doping may not wish to have us all trawl back into the past and remind everyone of a sorry chapter , it is in history that we find lessons most valuable today : valuable to the culture of today , to the education of today and to the prevention measures of today along with explanations as to why such things are required . In the absence of such things , wheels will be continually reinvented and all that urine , blood and money that flows through the anti-doping system will go to more waste than it ought . <p> In swimming , the sorrowful histories of the GDR and China of the 1990s , among other episodes unavoidable as you trawl through the true history of the sport , remain swept under a proverbial carpet . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . It is for that reason that , while the explanations provided by FINA are well understood , we will continue to keep a comprehensive record of anti-doping violations and exercise our right to publish the facts of history . <h> Comments <p> May 13 , 2015 <p> Is this something the wayback machine or other similar internet archive sites would have records for ? <p> Interesting how USADA finds there is no such privacy concern and will cheerfully let you search out how many times an athlete was tested withing a certain time frame . ( Drifted over there and noticed that Dana Vollmer was tested 3 times in the third quarter of 2014 despite maternity leave , so the door may be open for her to try to make it to Rio . ) <p> Craig Lord May 13 , 2015 <p> I 'm not sure if those archives have the lists they may well do , . I do know that we have them and they will be made available at some stage . I think the privacy argument a fairly weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be found in many places . The collation of such things is part of transparency even though such things may be uncomfortable at times for official organisations . There 's a rub , too , in bowing to the complaints of those who tested positive ( federation complaints I have no respect for at all on a number of grounds ) within a system that now allows for blood samples collected some while ago to be retested if there is a breakthrough that justifies such action . <p> May 13 , 2015 <p> This is a stunning , in a bad way , move by FINA . <p> I hope has copied and kept all those doping cases data and information . <p> Now most people will never know that Kazan will be the major championships with the highest number of participants that have tested positive to banned substances and served ban . <p> It 's a 
 series of features looking ahead to the World Championships in August with consideration of the performer of the season so far , Adam Peaty , before moving on to reading the runes of defending champions and their challengers for titles in Kazan . <p> We interrupt the flow of relay crystal-balling to reflect on Australia 's sizzling sisters of speed , Cate and Bronte Campbell after a weekend in which the elder sibling put some muscle on a dream of downing the days of ultimate shiny speed . <p> Whether Cate Campbell 's most recent defeats over freestyle at 2013 worlds behind Ranomi Kromowidjojo ( NED ) at 2014 Commonwealth Games behind a world textile best 23.96 from England 's Fran Halsall ( GBR ) and at Australia nationals behind sister Bronte Campbell this year are merely part of the process preceding the storm of speed being forecast far and wide remains to be seen . <p> What is clear is the intent of Cusack 's charge after relay splits of 23.29 and 23.5 last weekend in Canberra . The swiftest of this efforts was clocked chasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a realm they will never find themselves in when racing side-by-side as Dolphins . Even so , such speed raises the question : how vulnerable is the 23.73 world record clocked by Britta Steffen ( GER ) , the double Olympic sprint champion of 2008 , in what she called a " motor-boat " of a shiny suit at Rome 2009 world titles ? <p> On that occasion this author wrote : " The speed of suits is not the speed of swimmers but in third Cate Campbell , on 23.99 , races in a fashion that suggests she will get there one day without the buoy of apparel more surfboard than bodysuit . The Australian could well be the first to crack 24 in the new textile era . She may even dream of getting to Steffen 's stunner one day well down the road . " <p> We are well down the road 2015 and heading to a second Olympic Games at which the record books and all-time rankings remain swamped with the stuff of the short-lived shiny suits era and the dream leans ever closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 24 in textile : that was Sarah Sjostrom ( SWE ) , on 23.98 last year at home , before Halsall clocked 23.96 for Glasgow glory ahead of the Australian . And then Campbell matched that best ever with a 23.96 victory at Gold Coast Pan Pacific Championships at home . <p> Any dash end speed and result with the likes of Campbells elder and younger , Halsall , Sjostrom and Olympic champion Kromowidjojo will come down to who gets the most right in one package in one race on the right day . Cate Campbell identified the blade that needs sharpening when she tells Nicole Jeffery in The Australian ( the link will not work if you are no subscription to the paper/online ) today : <p> " My start is average at best , and I 'm hoping to have it a lot better by the time worlds comes around . I 'm doing a lot of work on starts with Jacco Verhaeren . He 's one of the greatest skills technicians in the world . " <p> Quite so : the Eindhoven Express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inge De Bruijn story and on to the next Olympic double with Kromowidjojo before he left for pastures new at the helm of the Australian fold . <p> The Dutch defender stands 1:79 ( same as Bronte ) , Halsall 1:72 , Sjostrom and Campbell 1:86 , a height that plays out in the streamline and flow into a stroke long and lean though regardless of height , at best all mentioned are apt to look like a model of wind-tunnel testing as the spray arcs off fingertips in full flight . The taller they are the longer it takes them to fall , in a manner of speaking : explosions favour the compact . <p> Cate Campbell , courtesy of Swimming Australia <p> " I 'm never going to be the fastest off the blocks but I want to make sure I 'm generating enough power that my reaction time is n't too much of a liability . " says Campbell with a nod to this ( the Australian the second swimmer listed in each case : <p> 2013 : <p> 0.69 24.05 Kromowidjojo 0.75 24.14 ( 0.06 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 0.69 23.96 Halsall 0.75 24.00 Campbell ( 0.06 lost at the start on the way to silver by 0.04 ) <p> Campbell tells Jeffery that Kromowidjojo 's mentor is a feather to her bow : <p> " I 'm definitely glad Jacco is in now my toolkit instead of hers . I want to make sure I 'm using everything I have to the best of my ability and that 's not happening at the moment . " <p> Of course , one of Cate Campbell 's main opponents shares the same toolkit : Bronte , a ' little ' who started out the better prospect in the pool because of her attitude and now , after some years in the shadow , is threatening to steal her sibling 's thunder . <p> Last weekend , The Australian Magazine ( only available through purchase ) carried a fine feature on the Campbells , among observations by writer Greg Bearup the two poems pencilled on the wall above Bronte 's desk at home : <p> The first is If by Rudyard Kipling : <p> Dressed to thrill : Cate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can keep your head when all about you Are losing theirs and blaming it on you ... <p> If you can dream and not make dreams your master ; 's in it , And which is more you 'll be a Man , my son ! <p> Cate and Bronte Campbell by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Make it daughter and then turn the gaze to the second poem : <p> Invictus by William Ernest Henley <p> ... I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul . <p> In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not the master of my fate , I am the captain of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and breathes , bounces and leaps in the hearts , minds and sinews of champions in the race , in life and of self-determination . As Bronte Campbell tells Bearup on the question of how sisters approach the same big battle : <p> " If we both swim as well as we can possibly swim and we both lose , we 'll still be satisfied . Simon will be happy that we 've done our best and Mum and Dad will be as proud as if we 'd won gold . " <p> Finding the alchemy to convert If to outcome is a hard enough task as it is . " Ridiculous " is how Bronte defines it as she acknowledges circumstance and status : " It 's a bit of a joke , really . I am the third-fastest swimmer in the world and yet I am the second-fastest swimmer in my family . It is ridiculous . It is not normal . " <h> Twin Targets <p> Consistency counts in Cate 's favour so far : 12 swims inside 24.25 side 2013 ; 14 efforts in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bronte on 3 dashes inside 24.25 and 1 effort inside 53 over . <p> In the Australian Magazine , Bearup writes : <p> Cate looks at her Bronte and laughs , almost embarrassed that she stands between her sister and the prize . She desperately wants Bronte to succeed , but she holds the same intense desire for success in exactly the same events the and freestyle . Since the London Olympics where she won gold in the 4x100m freestyle , only to cruelly fall i 'll before her individual sprint events Cate has consistently been the fastest female swimmer in the world . " I feel bad for beating her , but not when we are swimming , " Cate says . <p> The Australian 's swimming writer , Nicole Jeffery , says Cate 's height gives her a natural advantage over her sister ... Jeffery says it has been inspirational to witness her comebacks from illness and injury . But Bronte is possibly the more hungry and driven of the two . <p> At first , Bronte was the better and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came home with a bunch of medals and trophies . " It was terrible , " says Cate . " She would wear her medals around her neck and bring her trophies to the breakfast table to taunt me . " The older sister was intensely jealous . She did the logical thing ; she stole all Bronte 's medals and hid them under her own bed . " In retrospect , probably not the greatest hiding spot , " says Cate . " Mum eventually found them . <p> She sat me down and said , ' If you want to win medals like Bronte you will just have to put in as much effort as she does ' . " <p> She did . And she grew and grew . <h> Watching Nature Whisper of The Wisdom In Quality of Movement <p> Sprint Diva Cate Campbell finds time to help the waves form a Sydney Opera House in the wash as she sprints Photo by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> If the feet-on-the ground attitude spills from mum Jenny and dad Eric no vast trophy cabinets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siblings ( " ... it ca n't be all about them " , says dad ) , then Cusack 's nature , together with an experience and knowledge built in a world far from the pool of human talent and water , is another of the essential ingredients to a cake of layers being built yet . <p> Cusack tells of his philosophy for training sprinters . During his time as a stockman in the United States , the swim coach-to-be worked on training horses through attention to quality of movement . <p> Milt Nelms whispers wisdom to coaches in Sweden as Dana Vollmer and Caitlin Leverenz enact it in the background by Craig Lord <p> The descriptions bring to mind the essential nugget at the heart of , the art of Milt Nelms , the " water whisperer " and partner of one of the all-time greats of swimming , Shane Gould , a swimmer who instinctively whispers to water . <p> Cusack talks of " rewarding the horse immediately if they had executed the move correctly " and then letting it recover before asking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be found harnessing best speed to quality of movement . And when the hit upon harmony , there is rest before a return to reproducing the same ' perfect ' pitch summed up by that " feel for the water " . <p> A glorious moment when in Seville in 1997 we heard Alex Popov say : <p> " The water is your friend , you do n't have to fight with water , just share the same spirit as the water , and it will help you move . If you fight the water it will defeat you . We were born in water it 's like home to me . " <p> On the same occasion he spoke words close to these aired when his career was done : " In the crucial , final moments , I was able to release a special kind of concentration and energy , which drove me forwards . I was born with it . I always knew approximately how fast I was . " <p> A heightened sense of interaction between water and swimmer is something that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand there " . Rather , as Nelms does , and Cusack would appear to do , the process of about asking the swimmer to feel what only they can feel , to know what only they can know . The secret is that the feel for water is a secret itself , one held between element and swimmer , unique in every case for it relies on sensory perception . <p> Cate Campbell says she is " almost conquering instinct , in a way " . She explains how a big race feels : " It is like I am watching myself from above and my subconscious has taken over . " Here 's how Cusack puts it to Bearup with a nod to both siblings : <p> " They have an intimate feel for the water . They feel the water on their hands and their limbs , it is instinctual and almost impossible to teach . " <p> And yet the result of learning and practice is there for all to see as the next dream dashes towards destiny . <p> " When we were seven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training we 'd talk about what we would do after we went to the Olympics , " Cate tells Bearup . <p> " It was never one of us , it was always going to be both of us . <p> Bronte Campbell by Craig Lord <p> Cate Campbell by Swimming Australia ) <p> " The best moment of my life was the Australian national championships in 2012 and we hit the wall and there was 1-2 next to our names 50 free it still gives me goose bumps to think about it . It was in that moment our dream was realised . " <p> Cusack , a man said never to raise his voice , sends his charges off to their blocks , Bearup notes , with the words : " Have fun .

 The Divide of the Swim Schism are you ? Photo by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In the last part of a three-part feature and editorial on the latest moves by the FINA leadership to convince the world that it is on the right path , we look at transparency , at influence and media waning and waxing , at pythons , paper tigers and the new foundations that must be built in a sport where the madness of blazers even comes in Stars and Stripes these days . <p> Part 3 : In our second part of this mini-series , we considered the latest move by members of the Board that steers USA Swimming , a federation oft viewed as one of the " good guys " of governance , sound reasons aplenty to back up that view and particularly when it comes to the professional approach to performance and providing the environment in which swimmers , coaches and programs can thrive . <p> Yes , we are aware of the sex abuse scandals and the tardy handling of matters that has been at the heart of sorrow and scorn when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been a part of the sports realm and a place of learning for children but right here we are dealing with matters beyond the realms of criminality and the particular complexities therein . <p> In the context of this discussion , American blazers have long been seen as a critical backbone of support for the system that produces such soaring excellence team after team , generation after generation after generation . This month , there has been a shift , seismic in my view when it comes to the USA 's power to do great good or back things with the potential to damage the sport of swimming . <p> From where I stand including being the subject of a plan by FINA leaders to discredit my work and , far more significantly , that of US coaches Jim Sheehan will go down as the USA aquatics president who bucked the trend . His May message had him swimming against the tide when it comes to supporting a clean up in sports governance . <p> All such things serve to highlight the overwhelming need for independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the top table of swimming can be held up as model of progress and pride not as one that is constantly viewed as purveyors of poor to bad decisions that hold the sport back from where many aspire to it getting , athletes included . <p> Sheehan and team have let the side down , their cheerleading for the unacceptable standing in stark contrast to the excellence of Michael Phelps , Bob Bowman , Gregg Troy , Ryan Lochte , Eddie Reese , the Texas Trio and all the stuff that those names stand for as the spray of their time in an ocean of achievement . <p> As we discussed yesterday , the US Board was sold on its course by a presentation from the FINA Bureau member Dale Neuburger and the head of the international federation 's Technical Swimming Committee , Carol Zaleski . We pick up where we left off , with Two Sides to Transparency : <p> IOC ( FINA etc to follow ) will publish its per diem rates for volunteers . For FINA Bureau members that means a day when attending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duration of the world titles , about 3 weeks , this summer for ' volunteers ' who get all expenses paid on top of that ( travel , hotel , food , local transport ) . In other words the money is to compensate those people for loss of earnings while away from other work beyond the world of FINA . <p> Many of those who will receive that money will suffer no loss of earnings elsewhere ; some of those in Kazan will actually be in the very realm in which they make their money in a world ' beyond ' but very closely connected to FINA . <p> My view : FINA has the money to pay for professional work and should do so on a fixed scale of incomes , while reducing per diems to those who actually incur costs during FINA events , those costs to be receipted and accounted for common practice in business and places far and wide where folk submit a tax return and account for what goes in and what goes out . <p> If the IOC , FINA and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be looking at the kind of system that a great many others have to abide by in their normal working lives . Per diems are declarable income and need to be set against invoices to show precisely why you got the money and what you spent it on . What is required is a public register of interests and a public register of per diem payments , all above board , no issue : easy to achieve if only the will was there . <p> Proposals such as IOC Agenda 2020 do not stretch that far , as far as I can see . It should , in my view , be possible for all members of Oceania swimming , Swimming Australia included , for example , to see precisely what Dennis Miller , of Fiji , is up to on their behalf : how many days a year is he on FINA duty , what does that entail , what per diems that translates to and what everyone is getting for their money from a man who has a job to do back home when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he was a supporter of a junior journalists ' training course that has made its way into FINA world of late when it really ought to have found no place in the world of elite swimming , not least of all because the international swim federation has precisely no skills nor any part to play in the training of journalists and independent reporting . <p> Miller recommended the scheme to FINA based on his experience at Oceania Championships ( junior/development ) . As a member of the FINA Press Commission at the time , I responded with a note to say that while I could well see why such things had merit in an environment with no media to speak of covering development swimming , such things had no place on a media stand at the likes of a World Championships as professionals went about their jobs in a live environment on deadline . <p> More than eight months later , gestation of thought was done : it leaked out via a question nor through direct communication with the press commission that FINA had cancelled a media forum that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the World Short-Course Championships last December and ... yes , you guessed it , we would all be called on to help train a group of trainee reporters . <p> It was an example of the ridiculous lack of understanding of professions that FINA leaders do not understand but wish to control . The swimming equivalent would be for the USA Swimming Board to ask each of the USA team staff coaches in Kazan to take along an aspiring coach to track and trace their every move as Ledecky to Lochte step up ; the swimmers ' equivalent would be to ask Ledecky and Lochte to take a winner from a local junior meet with them to the blocks as they step up for the final of the 800 free and 200IM . <p> No self-respecting journalist on deadline at a world titles has time to have a cub reporter in tow , quite apart from the fact that such positions ought to be earned , as in train , impress , get better , get the job , get the place on the team , earn your spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your role may be at the excellence level of things . Except for blazers , it seems . <p> Miller is an example of someone with influence and vote at the top table representing a part of the world that includes one of the great swimming nations ( not his own ) but whose take on what FINA ought to focus its energies on should be subjected to scrutiny . Miller is a member of the FINA executive alongside Dale Neuburger , both of them vice-presidents . They will both surely have known about the JTA proposal to discredit folk and all sold on the basis of using Michael Phelps as a poster boy ( as if ) . Had they not known , then the lack of transparency in FINA would be an even darker place than we imagined it to be . <p> Understanding of what constitutes transparency and necessary declaration of interests differs the world over . Dale Neuburger , for example , is a TSE Consulting Partner . He steps out of votes when TSE is bidding for work with FINA , the conflict of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA include the Dubai Sports Council , UAE Swimming Federation in Dubai , Saudi Arabian Swimming Federation , the Bahrain Ministry of Youth and Sport , the Qatar Women 's Sport Committee , the Qatar Olympic Committee , the Turkish Swimming Federation , Brazilian National Olympic Committee , the Danish Swimming Federation , the City of Manchester , the Mexican Federation , Guadalajara . Association of Summer Olympic International Federations ( ASOIF ) and Olympic Solidarity ( IOC ) . <p> That list includes a vast network of people directly involved in bidding for FINA events , connections in the Middle East , a region to which FINA has turned to often of late in search of hosts , funding and support , a region whose presence in the system of committees and commissions has grown significantly in the past several decade . <p> While the FINA Constitution allows for Neuburger 's status and position and the man steps out when he sees a conflict of interest looming , as responsibility demands , the international federation does not tolerate membership of the Bureau by working professionals leading swim federations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of FINA 's . Several leading figures in swimming have indicated to SwimVortex that they find that balance uncomfortable . The system was put to the test when the Chief Executive Officer of British Swimming , David Sparkes , wanted to stand for a place on the Bureau via his position in LEN , the European Swimming League . Sparkes was told that if he joined the Bureau , FINA would expect him to stand down from his professional job in Britain . <p> The difference between the positions of Neuburger and Sparkes both with obvious domestic interests and one with clear business interests is one of myriad issues that independent review ought to consider so that a sensible decision can be arrived at . There is likely to be a better way than the fuzziness of current constitution and rules from a book that the FINA leadership leans on and ignores in high measure on both scales when it suits . <h> Conflicting Positions <p> FINA in focus : Julio Maglione , top right , is the latest in a line of federation presidents going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USA Board 's position is clear : it is tolerating an awful lot that it ought not to tolerate in the interests of getting its way on some issues which , in my opinion , it would win the day on anyway if the system was better built for purpose . <p> What we have is a status quo in which it is hard to find FINA leaders or committee members prepared to take a stand . That is the case even when , with a nod to the stance of Neuburger , Zaleski and their presentation , USA swimmers are among those most wounded by events . <p> Here 's an example : USA Swimming , through the documentary mentioned in this article on troubled waters , will remind us all next year that 40 years have passed since Kornelia Ender and GDR teammates thumped the USA 's women into submission with the aid of what would be the ' assisted means ' of State Plan 14:25 : Oral Turinabol ( and some other health-threatening stuff that made victims of young women and men in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Question : did Dale Neuburger or any other USA delegate to FINA ever press the case for GDR officials with criminal records to have their FINA Pins ( a service honour ) withdrawn ? Did they press for victims on both sides to be recognised ? And what came of it ? <p> I ask because when that USA Swimming memory emerges in the world next year , the rest of planet water , not to mention the likes of Shirley Babashoff , have the right to ask what all those American people and their ' strategic initiatives ' at the heart of FINA did to fight for justice and reconciliation down the years ? How many of them pressed for the right thing to happen ? Or have they followed a damp mantra of " go along to get along " . <p> Right now , this less than merry month of May the USA Board 's position may well be perceived as this : <p> Thumbs up for Julio and folk who want days of plenty to carry on until they 're 85 ; a Fanfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back In Your Box , we wo n't be asking FINA or Dale Neuburger if our international masters really have spent on a farce that includes misrepresenting the good name of our key aquatic asset Michael Phelps and discrediting our leading coaches , John Leonard cited but far from being alone . <p> That may not have been the intention of the USA Board , a body that will have many fine folk in its midst . Even so , that is how much of Sheehan 's message can be read at this troubling juncture in swimming history , the blindness of the blazer and remoteness from the ' FINA family ' contributing to a culture in which : <p> an Olympic champion such as Amanda Beard is reduced to tears as she walks out to her blocks because she 's being threatened for objecting to wearing a sponsor in direct rivalry with the company that backs her way through a swimming life ; <p> in which USA swimming leaders do not raise a flag when its leading coaches are cited at the heart of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to USA Swimming , use its good name at the same time as discrediting US coaches and misrepresenting Michael Phelps <p> in which perfectly reasonable questions on doping and other issues that directly affect USA swimmers go ignored and unanswered for weeks , months and forever because FINA leaders , hiding behind staff at HQ , have no answers that would be acceptable to the wider membership of world swimming . <p> the man at the helm on the day Fran Crippen died is promoted within the FINA ' family ' <p> USA Swimming and all associated blazers : you can do much , much better than that . <p> As you nestle in to the comfort of status quo , I take the opportunity to remind you of the words of Andy Warhol : <p> " They say that time changes things , but you actually have to change them yourself " <h> Pythons and Paper Tigers <p> FINA is both them and it is all of you out there : athletes , coaches , the parents paying for entry fees and much more , clubs , a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without whom none of any of this would happen . <p> So , why , would you wish to be silent any longer ? Fear , I 've been told . Of what ? The FINA leadership is a paper tiger . To prove it would require the likes of the USA Swimming Board , Swimming Australia and a few others , to find the conviction to test it . <p> Note , it is not courage you need just belief that what you stand for is the truth and the right , as in : <p> " Let them say about me , that I lived in nature 's fair light , and that I stood , for the truth and the right " - Bob Dylan , " Cross the Green Mountain " , a refrain lamenting a slain soldier of the American Civil War <p> I take us back to some who have tested the paper tiger , the truth and the right on their side , and moments when the way of the Python ( Monty ) was a good way to deal with darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first day of finals for the event was promoted by one local radio DJ with a call to spectators heading to the pool to " raise your flask in the air and show ' em ya care ! " . <p> Yuan Yuan under arrest , 1998 , by Craig Lord at Perth Airport <p> He was referring to the 13 vials ( flasks ) of Human Growth Hormone found in the kit bag of Yuan Yuan , a teenage victim of abuse at the mercy of rogue doctors , coaches , politicians and others privy to the crime unfolding as she made her way to a World Championships soaked in the scandal of doping and a China Crisis of GDR plus positive tests in the making . <p> When a group of journalists dashed across to get reaction from FINA director Cornel Marculescu on the news of seizure and arrest at Sydney airport as the China team went through transit on its way to Perth , the director 's response was : " This is a balloon ... you will bring down your own house . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with journalists covering the sport . At Perth airport , we witnessed painful scenes : swimmers under police escort , a vast scrum of media , cameras whirring , writers screaming and scribbling as they moved as one across a waiting lounge , bystanders , including young children , trampled underfoot . All a balloon , apparently . In fact , it was a crisis FINA could and should have seen coming , should and could have prevented . <p> Meanwhile , Gould 's approach to what she and many others saw as softness on China and doping back in 1998 was to get a great many folk to wear yellow t-shirts bearing logos in support of clean sport . Matching balloons were handed out . And then , Gould held a press conference to get her message across in a side hall at the championship venue . Asked one FINA official : <p> " What is she doing ? She has no platform here , no right ... " <p> I interrupted him to say : " If Shane Gould has no platform on world swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about a clean and healthy environment , then we must all be silent forever . " <p> The suggestion took hold in FINA culture , apparently . For these days , silence is the order of the day if the question is the ' wrong ' one . <p> It has long been like that . I wrote the story above on the day and at those championships and on every day in Perth the paper boy brought more from the dark side of the sport . One evening as the press centre clattered to the sound of deadline just after the last final was done , someone noticed that a press release had been quietly popped into one of dozens of pigeon holes among the results and quotes and stats of the day . Four more Chinese swimmers had tested positive , pouring further fuel on fire . A sizeable group of journalists went in search of anyone from FINA who could supply us with more information on the latest cases . No blazers to be found . We tracked them down to a hotel in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As one Australian colleague put it at the time : Fina was to be found tucking into a " ute load of prawns " as swimming sank further into the mire . I turned to Nero and Rome burning for metaphor in my notes from the moment , unaware that a decade on , we 'd get even closer to the geography of history and circumstance during the shiny suits circus . It took Cornel Marculescu more than two years to say a civil good morning to me after Perth 1998 . I was glad that he and the leadership of FINA had been embarrassed , pressed , pushed and questioned into action , by athletes , coaches and media . <p> It was the only way to get a federation always reactive never proactive to do the right thing . <p> And here we are again , back in the same place and with many of the same people wearing the blazers . If that is how swimming wants it , then it needs me no more . <h> Should I stay or should I go ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August but I will not be there . Like Michael Phelps , James Magnussen and many of you for a variety of reasons , I will watch the second-biggest showcase in swimming after the Olympics from afar and that for the first time in a quarter of a century . <p> The reason : a decision forced and another chosen . Neither of the two newspapers I work for in Britain , The Times and Sunday Times , feel that swimming still merits spending money on to cover live and that in a season of Adam Peaty on the rise . The truth is that swimming is simply not big enough to make the bigger budget required for live coverage , as opposed to remote observation . <p> What plays into such decisions ? Well , this from a leading decision maker in the media when it comes to sporting choices : " ... they gave Putin their highest honour ! ? Really ? And the championships are in Russia , right ? " . And then , beyond Golden Thrones and more nonsense since condoned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discredit folk , including a Times journalist who has written more articles and features promoting the Arte Natandi than I care to recall this past quarter of a century . <p> The warning signs of waning interest in swimming have been there for a long time and they continue to be there across a great many leading media platforms . Go back to the 1990s and we find newspapers such as those I work for sending its correspondent on Mare Nostrum Tour , to any event where the best might gather on the way to the Olympics ; we find Reuters and other big agencies covering short-course championships continental and world . No longer : all of that fell away as the frequency of events tilted to quantity over quality , calendar chaos over seasons meaningful to the wider sports audience in keeping with the regulars on the trail of sporting magnets , the Wimbledons , Grand Slams and Open Golfs of the world included . <p> And as swimming 's draw waned in eye of editors at a time of shrinking media budgets , events such as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minds of blazers that the way to resolve tension with the world of scribes was to make its house a more comfortable place for the media . I 'm talking about a different kind of cushion . <p> In 2015 , the media stands will include a fair few who are there because a federation , domestic or international , from FINA to IOC level , has either paid for them to be there or contributed heftily to making sure they are there . Others are supported by sponsors who want the media there when their charge gets that gold , sets that record but knows that it is n't nearly as easy to guarantee the presence of reporters and coverage as it is in other realms , such as Wimbledon and the like . There is competition within competition . <p> In Barcelona in 2013 , setting aside the handful of agency reporters for a moment , there were between ' 0 ' staff journalists from mainstream print media there to cover the world championships from the United States , Britain , Canada , among several other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where increase in numbers could be found was in the realms of journalists and so-called journalists funded wholly or in part by official bodies and sponsors . <p> USA Swimming 's Board will doubtless be interested to know the final count for Kazan in those stands overlooking the pool ( assuming FINA does n't build the media stand behind the finishing line for the majority of writers as it did in Barcelona two years ago ) . It is only my estimate but I would guess that , Associated Press and niche websites apart , there will be no staff journalists from any mainstream US publications in Kazan . Not a single one . Australia will have a handful . Great news . And I hope that the likes of Karen Crouse makes it and FINA faces the questions that need to be put to them in a live forum where silence is simply no option . <p> The independent journalist is needed now more than ever in swimming as the media stands are heavy on folk there by virtue of the backing of a sponsor linked to the event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reporters for those are a little like counting all the teams in the stands as part of the paying public . <p> That US media picture will be repeated for Britain and several others key nations , too , while the bulk of FINA member nations will have no reporters in town at all . To some extent , the response of federations noticing the lack of media tuning in has been to increase their media services . All good until that spills over to sponsored reporting , subsidised coverage of the cheerleading kind , the presence of one type of ' journalist ' dependent on the very people the independent journalist ought to be keeping an eye on . <p> Given recent events , given a lack of will to do something about it out there among you in the swimming ranks , it is not hard to see why those who neither do nor need care about swimming in the way I have done would rather wash their hands of it . The world is so full of popular stuff of other realms , the choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make media decisions . <p> There have been similar challenges to loss of coverage at live events and coverage all all in the past . Each time I 've fought the corner of continued coverage and more often than not managed to persuade editors to stick with it . Not this time . <p> In the void , there is work to be done and new avenues to explore . I shall , of course , miss the athletes , the action , the coaches and personalities and those excellent colleagues on the media stand I 've had the pleasure to work alongside ; I shall miss bringing you the small details , nuances and finer points that can only be seen up close when swords are flying and the battle raging ; I shall miss helping my colleagues with the stats and ranks , the memories that contribute to fine coverage ; and , if you allow me a momentary lapse in standards of neutrality that I believe to be an important part of coverage , I shall miss Mr. Peaty 's shot at becoming the first Brit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit , I shall be there and SwimVortex will be well served , from beyond and in Kazan , by my side John Lohn and Liz Byrnes and the digital team that makes sure we 're here , and the great eye of Patrick B. Kraemer , too . <h> Gateway To A New World <p> Before Nick Thierry passed away in 2012 , he predicted in an email exchange with me that USA Swimming would " continue to get closer to FINA " and " ... at the expense of many of its friends " . I replied ' surely not ' . And from that emerged a deal . Right now , the balance of events , with USA Swimming Board opting to keep the sport shackled to an unacceptable status quo , suggests that Nick had read the runes perfectly ( as he often did ) . I hope never to have to fulfil my promise to Nick though I will if I have to . <p> There is hope and it rests with the wisdom of age and experience and the spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay the foundations of a new world should the old one continue to fail them , should those , like USA Swimming chose to hide its light under a bushel of bureaucratic diplomacy doomed to end in woe of the kind that tends to shadow those who couple themselves to people , connections and events they have not fully understood . If the athletes and their sponsors leave FINA for waters new , there will be no FINA . Very simple . <p> A terrible moment for swimming when folk who hold high office at the helm of excellence not of their making stay silent when bad things happen but instead feel it wise to speak out in favour of those with their hand on the wheel of woeful outcomes . While silence is not what is called for right now , it might have been wiser of USA Swimming blazers who could not bring themselves to back their coaches to heed the advice of Abraham Lincoln : <p> " Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public efforts to persuade FINA to do the right thing . They are a lost cause , the leadership unfit to govern , those about them unable and unwilling to call them to account . <p> Time for a different approach for a while . There will be a little of Frank Ocean in the mix " Work hard in silence , let your success be your noise ... " but I urge each and every one of you in swimming , including all of you sitting on boards and committees and commissions , all of you sponsors and partners who , presumably , want swimming to be more than niche to consider that you may just be getting what you deserve . Which side of the divide are you on ? In the words of Edmund Burke : <p> " All tyranny arbitrary or unrestrained exercise of power needs to gain a foothold is for people of good conscience to remain silent . " <p> One wonders if the FBI and the Department of justice can take on the lads at FIFA can the folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mas deserving bunch ! <p> So Cal Swimmer May 28 , 2015 <p> The article brought me to tears of frustration and anger . We may as well be hitting our heads against a wall . <p> Clive Rushton May 28 , 2015 <p> Craig , you sound like Reginald Perrin preparing to walk into the water . Do n't . Do . It . <p> Craig Lord May 28 , 2015 <p> Clive ( as you know , I can swim <p> May 28 , 2015 <p> This is another excellent article which says it all . FINA is not a true democracy nor is there financial transparency despite the recent spin about ' best practice ' . The culture is all about the prestige and privileges of the blazers , most of whom hail from corrupt , undemocratic countries with no real swimming programs . As long as these second-raters stay in control , swimming will fall further and further behind other sports when it comes to attracting fans and seizing commercial opportunities . And yet swimming has a lot to promote . It is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich history and its athletes are amongst the most wholesome , appealing , articulate and hardworking . Despite all this , swimming is becoming less and less visible in the sporting landscape except when the Olympics come around . <p> The hope has always been that the leading federations would finally take a stand . However , the recent cosying up to FINA by USA Swimming does n't look promising . It must be time for the swimmers to press for meaningful change . After all , they are the lifeblood of the sport . All the prestige and benefits that the blazers receive comes from their hard work . We know that a former elite swimmer , Matt Dunn is the supposed representative of the swimmers on the FINA bureau but I 'm not sure he has the make-up or the drive to press for radical change , and even if he did , one voice amongst a sea of blazers would n't make much difference . <p> Darth Vader May 28 , 2015 <p> Wow that was a lot of words . Thank you for bolding select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply assume you 're correct regardless of the swimming topic . Allows me to just read the highlights when short on time . There is always so much passion in your writing . <p> Craig Lord for FINA President . <p> May 28 , 2015 <p> One thing our educational system does a good job of instilling in the minds of US students is the notion that our country is " one of the good guys " . Unfortunately , when you reach adulthood and seek to understand US political/economic foreign policies on the world with a more critical eye , you tend to find a " what 's in it for me " mentality that can have devastating long-term effects . <p> I realize USA Swimming is independent from the US Government , but it seems like a similar mentality prevails in the " leadership " of that organization . My ( albeit limited ) understanding of Mr Lord 's series of articles informs me that USA Swimming has followed a strategy of manipulating " the system " rather than changing/improving it . My innocent fanboy image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans welcome in Australia ? <p> Craig Lord May 28 , 2015 <p> Do n't take it personally , . There are many fine folk in US swimming who are pressing for the right thing and I 'm confident that they will prevail and a fine day will come . The USA gets singled out here for 2 reasons : because of its huge capacity and power to do the right thing ( as it has many times ) and because it broke silence to back something that is broken and needs fixing . Right now , there are those at USA Swimming who do n't even understand the damage they 're done and are doing ; do n't even know precisely what it is that they 've backed ; have n't the first idea of the connections and networks of people they are flying a flag for . Wisdom is ahead of them . <p> Craig Lord May 28 , 2015 <p> I thank you for the nomination , Darthy , though having rifled through my toolbox I ca n't seem to find the skills required for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2015 <p> Thanks for your first note and yes , indeed , to all that follows , longstroke . <p> May 28 , 2015 <p> Mr Lord : I admire your optimism in the face of all this corruption ! I agree that most of the USA Swimming voters did n't understand the ramifications of their decision , but IMO that only serves to further vilify the people leading them down the wrong path .@@3304626 <h> Sanofi appoints Suresh 
 over almost all , Britain 's Duncan Scott made it a sprint freestyle double with triumph in the freestyle and Ziv Kalontarov made history for Israel with a 22.16 victory in the freestyle in the curtain-closing session of the European Junior Championships , part of the inaugural continental European Games in Baku . <p> The 's dominant sprint granted him the last slot in the season world top 20 and granted us all a chance to consider the bridge between Israel and Europe at the sound of the Hatikvah . <p> It was a day dominated by another Russian rush on gold : the winning nation claimed 23 golds , a tally that matches one of the more disturbing lane lines in the sport , the count of Russian aquatics doping cases since Kazan won the right to stage the World Championships this summer . Why link the two things and why now as a team celebrates ? How not to , is the rhetorical reply . <p> Impossible to ignore the timing of events : this season coincides with comments from the Russian sports minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source of a doping problem . Russia has the worst record on doping in swimming ( among many other sports with similarly woeful counts ) this decade . Allegations of systematic doping in Russian sports are the subject of a investigation led by Dick Pound and due to report its finding by the close of the year . <h> Kalontarov &amp; The Bridge To Europe <p> Ziv Kalontarov <p> Ziv Kalontarov <p> Kalontarov , of Rishon Lezion , had given warning of his intention to take the dash crown with efforts of 22.62 ands 22.62 in the rounds , gains inside his 2014 lifetime best of 22.80 . His time in the final was a class apart , however : 22.16 established a national record by half a second and left the rest fighting for the minor spoils . The silver went to Italy 's Giovanni Izzo in 22.51 , the bronze to Russia 's Aleksei in 22.69 . <p> The winning time fell just shy of the European junior record held at 22.06 by Russia 's Evgeny Sedov since 2013 . <p> Kalontarov beamed as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hatikvah " The Hope floated across the still water . The anthem is significant , a symbol of the bridge between Israel and Europe . <p> Team Israel cheering for Ziv Kalontarov <p> The melody for Hatikvah derives from La Mantovana , a 16th-century Italian song composed by Giuseppe Cenci ( del Biado ) around 1600 with the text " Fuggi , fuggi , fuggi da questo cielo " . Its earliest known appearance in print was its inclusion in the composer 's collection of madrigals . It was later known in early Italy as Ballo di Mantova . The melody spread widely in Renaissance Europe , under various titles , such as the Pod ( folk song in Polish ) , cu sus ( Maize with up-standing leaves in Romanian ) and the Kateryna ( from Ukraine ) . The melody is also close in composition to one by the Czech composer Bedrich Smetana in his symphonic poem celebrating Bohemia , M ? vlast . <p> The adaptation of the music for Hatikvah was done by Samuel Cohen in 1888 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hatikvah based on the melody from the song he had heard in Romania , cu boi , or The Cart . <p> Kalontarov drove a cart , horse and ox through his rivals ambitions yesterday , a sprinter with meat to put on bones and fine potential on his way to senior waters . <h> Britain &amp; Germany Buck The Trend , Too <p> Duncan Scott ( right ) a member of Grangemouth ASC and guided by coaches Steven Tigg and Elaine Johnston through his junior years and Great Britain teammate Cameron Kurle bucked the trend of Russian victories with a 1-2 finish on 1:48.55 and 1:48.92 respectively in the freestyle to keep Elisey Stepanov at bay by a solid margin , bronze gone in 1:49.64 . For Scott , now coached by Tigg at the University of Stirling , triumph granted him the 100-200m double on his way to then World senior championships in Kazan come August . <p> Given that Russia boasts backstroke , breaststroke and butterfly champions at the meet , its absence from the girls ' medley podium was noticeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the crown in 2:13.37 ahead of Ilaria Cusinato , of Italy , and Britain 's Abbie Wood , the medley winner in Baku , on 2:13.78 and 2:14.49 respectively . <h> And so to the Russian Rush <p> It started with the medley , Nikolay Sokolov and Igor keeping at bay Poland 's Karol 4:19.44 and 4:20.80 to , Hungary 's Daniel Sos locked out by just . <p> Next up , Polina Egorova took the first of two golds for her on the day . A 1:01.19 in the backstroke pipped teammate Maria Kameneva 's 1:01.23 , the blanket finish for the podium completed by France 's Pauline Mathieu in 1:01.34 . <p> Anton Chupkov added another breaststroke gold to this treasury with a 1:00.65 win in the , the silver to Lithuania 's champion Sidlauskas in 1:01.42 , the bronze to Britain 's Charlie Attwood in 1:01.71 . Chupkov 's win was reported as a world junior record inside his own 1:00.84 from the Youth Olympics last year , however , Wang Lizhou , of China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national championships in April this year . The best ever breaststroke by a junior is the 59.56 of world record holder Akihiro Yamaguchi ( JPN ) in Niigata , August 2012 . FINA started to recognise world junior records last year but did not backdate the book . <p> Up for gold next was Maria , victory in the completing a breaststroke sweep in 1:07.71 . The silver went to Italy 's Giulia Verona in 1:08.61 , the bronze to the winner 's teammate Daria Chikunova in 1:09.02 . <p> Daniil Pakhomov ( right ) added the butterfly crown to his win over with a narrow triumph of 52.72 to 52.78 over Alberto Lozano , of Spain , the bronze going to the second Russian and Daniil in the hunt , Daniil Antipov , on 53.36 . <p> Polina Egorova was back for another gold in the butterfly on 26.82 , Austria 's Caroline Pilhatsch on 27.18 for silver , ahead of Julie Jensen , who took bronze for Denmark . <p> Arina , the relay completed a seven-gold tally <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their gender 's crowns , Arina claiming a seventh gold after she moved her squad from third after the first leg into a lead after the second leg . The winning time , kept at bay quartets from The Netherlands and Great Britain , on and 8:04.84 respectively . <p> The Russian riot was completed by the boy 's 4x100m medley relay , a time of 3:36.38 setting a European junior record inside the 3:37.93 of another Russian quartet in 2013 . Great Britain took silver in , the bronze to Poland in 3:39.31 . <p> 7 golds and a silver for , will be interesting to see how she goes in senior waters . Scott looks like the real deal for GB . I notice he stepped in to swim the Fly in the relay , which was important given that they did n't otherwise have a sub-55 guy . His 52.7 split spoke to his all round talent .

Every swimmer has their own development path . <p> June 28 , 2015 <p> How come Israel gets to compete at Euros when they are geographically part of Asia ? <p> My point was not to , diminish the fine accomplishments of those who swam at Baku but merely to Nite that at an earlier age one in a gadzillion , was already a Champion . <p> There 'll NEVER be another until the next one comes along . <p> Craig Lord June 28 , 2015 <p> they are considered part of Europe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc when it comes to contexts and prizes , because they have no regional competition allegiance with their neighbours in the Middle East . There is a background of neighbours who have refused to compete with Israel and even in world cup swimming of late one host refused to acknowledge swimmers and the flag of Israel until it got a warning from FINA after media questions . Beyond the obvious geographical anomaly , connections to Europe run very deep , obviously , for better and for worse . <p> A powerful group 
 the thrill of the wave with coach Bob Bowman at Melbourne 2007 world titles - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> And for your next trick ? That was the question for the aquatic maestro and magician back on August 22 , 2008 , as Bob Bowman when he popped into the Casa Italia in Beijing in the wake of conduction his 8th Swimming Symphony with Michael Phelps in Beijing . It might be February 1 , 2009 before the swimmer got back in the water , said the coach , Phelps having been promised a long break if all went t well . All had gone exceedingly well . Better , indeed , than any other Olympic campaign in history . <p> Even with a February 2009 return on the cards , Bowman believed that Phelps would be back in tie for Rome 2009 world titles . " He ca n't sit still for long , " Bowman told me in his last interview before he boarded a plane for home . " It 'll be like his welcome back meet , a little like Montreal ( 2005 ) , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City . <p> We 'd seen the sun the day before inside the Water Cube . And the moon and the stars and all the planets on a tour of the aquatic orbit of a truly unique human being , a man whose achievements come straight from the book of comic-strip super-heroes . Spirits soared at the sight of it all . <p> Michael Phelps referred to being " almost half way through my races " after taking the freestyle crown in a world record of 1:42.96 , the pace of a panel or two of polyurethane on the way to a full shiny crisis . <p> Patterns in the Pool : Michael Phelps on the way to one of his eight golds at the Water Cube by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> It was after the free that the 8th Symphony was starting to find its way into the soul . With each passing race , a few more notes were heard . Beethoven 's Ninth , Mozart 's Clarinet Concerto In A , K 622 2 , Adagio , Rodrigo 's haunting Concierto de Aranjuez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me after I noted the Spanish composer 's haunting work in my report of the freestyle final . <p> It was there for all with an ear for the water to hear , for all with an understanding of swimming and its element to feel , to see : the balance , the rhythm , the beat , the drop , the harmony in between . The sparkle of symbiosis between water and the swimmers whose bodies are made of the same fluid . How could they not get on ? <p> The uplifting beauty of it all ; movements , orchestral and aquatic . In all the years I had ( and have ) watched swimming , I could not recall witnessing something quite so complete , quite so certain even when the call was closer than the eye can count and the clock is judge . <p> Time up , tolled the bell for Nurmi , Latynina , Spitz and Lewis half-way through the Symphony at the count of nine all-time career Olympic golds . The ensemble was just getting into its swing as nests came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an editor had said he 'd got " bored " with the " inevitability of it all " , a few nods of agreement among responses . Like jokes , great events sometimes require you to have been there . After the free , my colleague Nicole Jeffery , of The Australia , noted that even for a man who performs five miracles before lunchtime , Phelps had excelled himself . <p> Bowman had told him that he should and could get his feet on the wall at half-way . Yes , sir will do . We 'd seen it before , at Melbourne 2007 worlds in particular , but the sight of Phelps on a roll was something to behold . <p> When he rolled and streamlined and drove and dug , Phelps moved like a killer whale settled on sealing the fate of a seal marked supper . Latent power and controlled aggression combined with an accuracy of thought and calculation , timing and tenacity steely and cutting in nature . Watch the cupping of Phelps 's hand , the roll of the whole arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element , an invisible yoke to transport him through translucence . , second star on the right , straight on ' til morning kind of stuff . <p> Ian Thorpe , with Pieter Van den Hoogenband and Michael Phelps after the " race of the century " by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Phelps emerged from the gold in Beijing to note that loss in the same event in that " race of the century " with Ian Thorpe and Pieter Van Den Hoogenband at the 2004 Games in Athens had put the fire in his belly for what unfolded this morning . <p> " I hate to lose , " said Phelps . " And getting third in the 200 free four years ago ... You know , when I do lose in a race like that and in circumstances like that , it motivates me even more to try and swim faster . " <p> On drawing level at nine career golds with the all-time record holders , Americans Mark Spitz , Carl Lewis , Finland 's Paavo Nurmi and Soviet gymnast Larysa Latynina , Superfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golds of all time , with those names in Olympic history and the Olympics have been around for so many years , is a pretty amazing accomplishment . It 's pretty cool . It 's definitely an honour . I 've been able to spend some time with Carl Lewis and exchange a few words with Spitz here and there , so it 's pretty amazing . " <p> Ahead of him at that stage : the 200 ' fly final , the 4x200m free relay , the 200IM , the 100 ' fly against Ian Crocker and the 4x100m medley that would draw him level with Spitz or not and keep the possibility of eight alive or not . Turned out that not was not part of his vocabulary . <p> The coach needed to say very little come the big moment , the work having been done long before leaving home . Even so , there were moments when Bowman needed to be hands on in the full glare of the lights . In Beijing , that moment came on the day of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after . After the medley , Phelps returned to his coach " totally drained " . Said Bowman : " I had to talk him through that . He was really tired at that point . I was n't sure how it was going to go . " <p> US swimmer Michael Phelps ( second from L ) touches home for gold , just ahead of Milorad Cavic from Serbia ( third from L ) with silver . That made it Gold No 7 for Phelps level with Mark Spitz 1972 by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Phelps got through it and the next day took the butterfly gold ahead of Milorad Cavic , of Serbia . Ill-feeling followed when Serbian team officials challenged the result , suggesting that Cavid had touched first but that his pad had not registered . Conspiracy theories suggested that Omega had stopped the clock themselves in favour of its poster boy . The truth was to be found elsewhere , while the controversy required Phelps to stay focussed , his job not yet one . <p> Bowman lated noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Phelps stares down Cavic " said one headline and accompanying photo-caption . Not so , said Bowman : " If you were watching the butterfly final , the Serbian swimmer and Michael were facing each other standing behind the blocks and it looked like they were trying to stare each other down . After the race I asked Michael if that was what he was doing , and he said ' I did n't even know he was there ' . That 's how focused Michael is on what he wants to do . " The butterfly result flicked a switch for the coach : <p> " The biggest moment of relief for me was after the butterfly final . I 'd convinced myself that seven was the number . It was n't until the last butterfly that I thought maybe it eight would happen . One thing Michael does better than anyone else is to use the right amount of emotional energy for every race he stands up for . " <p> And stand up he did , teammates with him to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towering , the symphony complete , Bowman said that Phelps would branch out into more sprints , more backstroke , some more breaststroke at national events , no , as agreed with Phelps , and while the free and a shot at Thorpey 's standard was not on the cards , the signature 200 ' fly would remain all the way back to the blocks at London 2012 . <p> In Beijing , Bowman had witnessed the very thing he did not expect to see but had , nonetheless , prepared his pupil for many moons before risk turned to robotic response just when it was hosted needed on the biggest of occasions : Phelps ' goggles had filled with water at the start and he had struggled to find best form . The result was still a world record of 1:52.03 , the suit , perhaps , having made up for the loss of vision . Bowman had thought a time " in the 1:50s " had been possible that day . <p> The impact of suits had not yet become clear and Bowman was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realms of possibilities for Phelps . It would happen , in a LZR Racer , too , in a Rome Circus that would sink the shiny suits for good , a January 1 , 2010 deadline for death to buoyancy set after Bowman said his boy would not be coming to the FINA party unless the hosts got back to swimmer and swimming , not industry and impostor . <p> Even so , Bowman was among those who would later say that much had been learned from the experience of suits and the catch-up with the clock might be swifter because of the knowledge gained even with the artificial aid had been lost . The role of coach and swimmer fits well with the thought of George Bernard Shaw : <p> " People who say it can not be done should not interrupt those who are doing it . " <p> It is the mindset of the psychology graduate , deep thinker and man with a mind for composition that is Bowman . He helped to build the perfect competitive beast in the pool from the time Michael was 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bowman , revealed the terrible truth to me and Jeffery that day back in 2008 : " At the Melbourne World Cup in 2003 I stepped on his goggles deliberately . He said ' hey , someone stepped on my goggles ' . I said ' Oh ... well , you 're just gon na have to go without them ' . " <p> When the scrawny , gangly boy raced at his first national junior meet in the United States , Bowman noticed he had left his goggles behind just before he walked out to the blocks . " I saw them sitting in our team area , I could have taken the goggles to him but I decided to keep them and see what he could do , " Bowman said . " So he swam and won the race without the goggles just like he did here in Beijing in the ( 200 ) butterfly when his goggles filled with water . " <p> Bowman added : " I 've always tried to find ways to give him adversity in either meets or practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took Phelps , 14 , to an evening competition and asked the driver to turn up late on purpose . " That way there was no dinner he had to deal with it , " said Bowman with a chuckle . <p> " He 's used to handling pressure situations in training , where that pressure comes from me , " Bowman said . " We have often put him in a situation where practice is not over until he achieves a certain time . Things have to be done absolutely correctly or we do them over . " <p> Bowman learned some of his tricks and tactics from former Britain performance director Bill Sweetenham . " I was at the AIS when Bill was there training a squad of juniors . After one session , they all complained that the water in the water fountain was too hot . So the next day , there was no water fountain . " It had been removed . <p> In Phelps , Bowman found the raw materials that he had been looking for at the North Baltimore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to swim with older swimmers ... but by the end of the practice , and at the most difficult part of the session , I saw a little cap moving up forward to the front of the line with each repeat swim . It was so remarkable , I 'd never seen anything like it and when I went home that night I could n't sleep I was so excited , but of course I did n't tell him that . " <p> Instead , Bowman piled on the metres and challenges . After one particularly bruising practice , Phelps leapt out of the water and started throwing water at some of the girls watching nearby . " I said ' you should be very tired , that 's the hardest practice you 've ever done ' , " Bowman recalled . <p> " I 'll never forget , he looked me straight in the eye and said ' I do n't get tired ' , so I made that my life goal to see if I could accomplish that . " <p> He took Phelps to junior meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three in the afternoon and then I 'd say to him , ' that 's not quite right , you could go again ' . Every time he got out and said ' I 'm tired ' , I said ' no , no , look , let 's just try that again , go on now ' , and every time he 'd get back in and go again . " <h> <p> Phelps had a built-in clock . Bowman asked him to write down the times he wanted to achieve in three favourite races . " He was just 11 but six months later he swam those exact times , to the one-hundredth of a second , " Bowman recalled . " I do n't know how that 's possible but it 's true . He always had a very good sense of finding where he wants to go and how to go there . " <p> That much was obvious in Athens , in Beijing and all points along the way , the pathway to the top of the podium part of the swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games , Bowman told me : <p> " On a daily basis I remind Michael of what his long and short-term goals are and how he stands today in relation to that . That 's where that whole thing comes in where many say ' I 'll deal with it tomorrow ' . I 'm there to say no , let 's deal with it today . That 's my job . When we 've had tempers flare , that 's where the issue is . He may not be ready to face that at that time and I make him do it or get him to a situation where it happens . There 's a lot of work that goes into it . There are a lot of ups and downs . He has bad days just like everybody else . " <p> Canadian medley ace Marianne Limpert trained in Baltimore for a stretch and told Bowman : " I 'm so glad I 'm training here ... I just though Michael was like a little swimming robot but now I see he 's a real person , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's in a bad mood he channels it into effort . " <p> " One of his best attributes " , says Bowman , whose role has been pivotal , critical even : up to Beijing there had been 12 years of emotional , mental and physical preparation of a kind that few could have withstood . <p> Beyond Beijing , beyond a long break the longest of Phelps ' entire career it was a case of ' now starts the craft of mature relationship ' . On the way to London , there would be no more ' Bob says , Michael does ' . The swimmer had become a man , the goals has been accomplished . A new chapter . That ended with ' retirement ' in London . <p> Before he got there , Bowman said : " It would be nice to have Michael retire on top . It 's important to me that he does n't peter out . " <p> In June 2013 , Phelps was back in the swim and aiming for a comeback . His London 2012 tally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated among greats in the pantheon , all sports . Rightly to some , arguably to others , Phelps goes down as the greatest Olympian in history . There is no dispute when it comes to his status as an achiever who transcends his sport . <p> Bob Bowman by Craig Lord <p> The same might well be said of Bowman , who taps into energy sources beyond the surface of the pool but intrinsically linked to the deep network of things that connect many realms , each a drop that forms the ocean . <p> Look up this week and you will see a full moon . It was there on the night in London three years ago when the most versatile cancerian swimmer wrote another line in his adventure : victory in the medley stamped his ticket as the first man to join the exclusive triple Olympic swim crown club founded by Dawn Fraser in 1964 , 32 years before Krisztina doubled membership at the Atlanta Olympics . Phelps then checked into a second final that would make him the first to have two tickets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 2 , 2012 and you could almost hear Bowman singing to himself . He 'd been humming Dvor ? k 's 7th throughout the past Olympic season . Composed in 1884 , the work breathes , said the coach , of " sentimentality , melancholy , sadness , struggle and defiant triumph " . It also leans on the notion of legacy through struggle and strife and was written with a London premiere in mind . <p> As I waited for a taxi to take me to the airport after US Olympic trials in Omaha in 2012 , Bowman said : " Holst , The Planets ... I 'll be interested to see what you make of that . " <p> Music derived from astrology is rare . Great music even more so . Gustav Holst : The Planets Suite . From the ancient Greeks and philosophers to those who check the stars column in their local paper , humans have long been fascinated by astrological teachings . <p> Michael Phelps by Patrick B Kraemer <p> The Greeks came up with the " Music of the Spheres " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , must surely hum as they go , must surely sing in space . They knew of seven planets : Sun , Moon , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter and Saturn and Western music evolved with seven-tone scales . Gustav Holst brought music and astrology together again in his suite devoted to the seven planets , the Sun and Moon displaced by Uranus and Neptune . <p> The Planets Suite was first performed in the autumn of 1918 . Here 's a summary : <p> Mercury : The Winged Messenger like listening to a cosmic butterfly <p> Venus : The Bringer of Peace beauty , refinement , the counter to the untamed violence of Mars <p> Mars : The Bringer of War unrelenting , merciless , brutish , the stuff of war <p> Jupiter : The Bringer of Jollity benevolent , generous , Jupiter come down from Olympus to flirt with mere mortals recognising that quality in self . <p> Saturn : The Bringer of Old Age serene , deliberate , stoic , acceptance of mortality and the end of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The magician is bumbling and accident prone but a born performer who can not resist just one more try , obsession deemed as mad as the dark side of the moon but masking wisdom of the eternal , the ultimate prize . <p> " I 'm 
 <h> Day 4 Finals <p> Laszlo Cseh . World Champion . Giant Of Longevity . The last time we write it was a decade ago . In a treasury stacked with 9 silvers ( 3 behind " The Alien " and 9 bronzes at Olympic and World Championship level was one gold : Cseh 's gem dated back to 2005 , the global crown in the medley when Michael Phelps stayed away . Now , a decade on , the Hungarian ace is a world champion again , the butterfly gold his in 1:53.48 . <p> Cseh , who switched coach and made butterfly a zeal renewed only in January this year , defeated the " Phelps Slayer " defending champion Chad Le Clos ( RSA ) in classic style , playing cat to the South African mouse to half-way , piling on the pressure and passing his quarry down the third lap and then playing lead role in what Le Clos knew he was in for : a dog fight . <p> Le Clos dug deep with to go but Cseh had a response the champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1:53.68 , bronze to Jan Switkowski ( POL ) in 1:54.10 . <p> Cseh said : <p> " I just did n't believe I could do it . I will have to watch the video so that I can believe it . He Le Clos came back at the end . I wanted to have the fastest last lap but by half-way to the end wall my arms felt completely dead . " <p> Laszlo Cseh of Hungary celebrates his win by Patrick . B. Kraemer <p> Le Clos was out first , on 24.81 just down on the world-record pace of Michael Phelps . Could we be in for a big one ? Race , yes . Record , no . At the mark , Le Clos turned in 54.13 , Cseh right there with him on 54.21 after clawing back 0.29 of the first lap deficit . <p> The momentum with him , Cseh surged off the wall and within three strokes had a visible edge on the Olympic champion , who seemed to be struggling as Masato Sakai ( JPN ) caught and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong lead after a 29.33 lap , to a 30.20 from le Clos that did n't match the rest of his or anyone else 's pace pattern in the race . <p> Laszlo Cseh PBK <p> Chad Le . <p> Cseh on 1:23.54 , Le Clos 1:24.33 and Sakai in between on 1:24.04 . At that point , Switkowski was back in 6th on , the race tight across the pool , European champion Viktor Bromer ( DEN ) on in 7th , Tom Shields ( USA ) the only one over 1:25 . <p> out in the swiftest last lap : 29.24 . Le Clos almost matched him on 29.35 as he tried to scramble back into contention with Cseh . The Hungarian of epic experience was not to be beaten , a 29.94 good for gold in 1:53.48 , le Clos on for his first since that magic moment in London , Switkowski pipping Sakai for bronze in 1:54.10 , a big best four the whose previous high of 1:55.23 was set at Polish nationals this season . Sakai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 1:55.16 , an out-of-sorts Daiya Seto ( JPN ) or a man giving nothing away until the last day and the defence of the medley in these days in that event . <p> Cseh spoke to Liz Byrnes at the Kazan Arena this evening and note that his latest ' fly mission , version X , is young even if he is approaching 30 . <p> " Back in January I did n't think that the fly would be the event I make it in again . I wanted to have a last shot to return to the top , I changed coach and training methods and it paid off . Today the last were really tough , I did n't feel my arms but I told myself this one I would n't let go . I almost cried afterwards but managed to hold it back . I 'm strong , you know !

His performances this year in butterfly are most impressive , particularly his finishing speed . I greatly appreciate his commitment to continued improvement after all these years . " <p> The switch of focus to butterfly while dropping medley at big meets is a relatively new thing but it all began with heartache hat London 2012 , Michael Phelps , the man who had confined him to silver three times at Beijing 2008 on his way to an epic 8 victories , was right there on the pages with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly in the race in which Cseh chased down a Phelps blinded by leaky goggles down the last lap on the way to what remains the Hungarian 's best : 1:52.70 . In textile , he has never been faster than his winning time in Kazan today . He is entirely recognisable in current version but reinvented nonetheless . <h> Berlin 2014 and the memory of London 2012 that fed a new focus <p> Laszlo Cseh of Hungary on his way to victory in Kazan by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> When Cseh stretched every sinew and mined every drop of experience to win the European title for a fifth straight time in Berlin last year , the Hungarian , his five crowns shining in his treasury , stood tall as undisputed king of European medley . <p> His emphasis on the in Berlin was no coincidence . When it comes to the medley , Cseh is a troubled mind and the eight-lap challenge is one that hangs in the balance . He may never do it again . In Kazan it was gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of his miscalculation in the heats at the 2012 Olympics as well as the physical rigours of the event , Cseh looks at the medley these days like the diver who must overcome fear when first taking on a four and a half somersault with twist . Step by step . And then if the wind is still up him , he will climb down the ladder , the butterflies in him a reminder that that 's the stroke he 's done rather well at before , one hue loves , too . <p> At 29 and soon to be 30 , Cseh would rather focus on what makes him happy than what evokes memories of the most uncomfortable kiss of his career . <p> " It is different for me now , " he told Liz Byrnes in Berlin last year . " When I was younger I was more relaxed and now for a couple of years , maybe after London I start to get a little bit more busy about the race . I start to feel more pressure on me . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave it behind me . <p> " I hope so that when I go to Rio I take my step to the starting block and I feel okay , I am prepared , I am ready , I do n't have anything in my mind , I just want to swim and do my best . " <p> Before all his races ? " Usually yes , " says Cseh . " Especially in the medley because I have a long history with the medley . I have my own thing I want to do maybe it is a self-made thing . " <p> Cseh Photo : Aniko Kovacs has been working closely with a sports psychologist but nothing gets past the 400IM and London 2012 . <p> Cseh was in the lane next to Michael Phelps in the 400IM in the heats in London . However , his decision to track the defending champion 's pace was the " biggest mistake of my career " . The American scraped into the final in eighth later finishing fourth as Ryan Lochte took the title but Cseh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final , four years after silver . <p> " In London we swam next to each other in the heats .

I got the ninth position and missed the final . That is a problem I had . I am not thinking that Michael 's pace is not so fast . That was my biggest mistake in my career . Maybe a little bit too late . It was the hardest experience for me . " <p> Cseh 's last 400IM was a world cup swim and that was clearly a painful experience . " That was terrible for me . I did n't get tired but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have problem with all the strokes , with the distance , the 400 . I do n't know what the main problem is . Maybe I had bad feelings about London . When I got to that meet , in the heats it stayed in my mind . " He adds : <p> " I am still in the 400IM but I have a lot of trouble with that . Because of my head . I start to swim it but the first 100 it is not good for me , I am not feeling comfortable with that . I choose to not swim now because I am not training well or training enough . But that is okay , I need to have some rest from the 400IM . But maybe I start again . " <p> One day when , perhaps never . The butterfly is his focus now . He will arrive at Rio 2016 as the world champion . There waiting for him may be " The Alien " . The schedule is not yet clear to any other than Bowman and his charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversary . " When people said he was retiring , I said ' of course , he has done everything . There is not much left to chase ' . But somehow he has started feeling a need for swimming . I think it is a good thing because we can race each other again , it 's good . " <h> I 'm a Lucky Man Top Have Phelps &amp; Lochte There <p> Laszlo Cseh <p> Cseh sees fortune in challenge : " I think I am not unlucky to race against Michael or Ryan Lochte . I think they have inspired swimming , inspired others to be better and faster . And that is true for me because maybe if there is no Michael I am not the swimmer we know now because maybe I do not get the same feelings about wanting to win or swim my best time . <p> Cseh has swansong in mind for Rio 2016 at least when it comes to the Olympic Games : <p> " Rio motivates me , it keeps me moving , it keeps me training . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after that we can talk about what will happen in Rio , what events I will be swimming there because now I am not decided , what will be my best events .

 a prayer to the goddess of going the distance into uncharted waters , with coach Bruce Gemmell - main image by Patrick B. Kraemer ( inset by Craig Lord ) <p> Bruce Gemmell started by asking the coaches assembled at the World Clinic here in Cleveland : " How many of you have been on the deck when a world record has been set ? " <p> A fair few hands went up but the vast majority stayed down in the crowd of a thousand folk and more . Gemmell was there last month in Kazan when his charge Katie Ledecky established world records Nos 8 , 9 and 10 , one in the and two in the freestyle , the clock left at and 15:25.48 , the pace of the best men circa 1975 , the pace ahead of her peers the stuff of Mary T , Janet E and folk and phenomena 's of that ilk . <p> Gemmell witnessed his first world record live from the deck at Woodlands on August 2 , 1978 , when Kim Linehan clocked in the freestyle at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nation 's Capital coach . <p> Linehan 's time took down the 4:08.91 of the GDR 's 1976 Olympic champion Petra Thumer . The latter was among those who did n't make it to the World Championships in West Berlin later that same month and the tale of how two women were taken out of the line on the eve of departure beyond the Berlin Wall , driven south to a clinic in Saxony for ' cleansing ' after they 'd tested positive for banned substances in internal checks to preserve State Plan 14:25 as a secret , will be told in full one day . Not here , not now . <p> Katie Ledecky by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In Berlin , Tracey Wickham and Bill Sweetenham , the Australian coach in the audience listening to Gemmell in Cleveland , produced a timewarp 4:06.28 world-record victory that would remain the world-championships record until Laure Manaudou ( FRA ) cracked it in 2007 . <p> The time warper this generation is Ledecky . When Gemmell was invited to speak on her preparation , he told his wife that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few simple slides , depicting these two overriding points : <p> she will do anything to be her best <p> she 's as tough as nails <h> " That 's it any questions ? " <p> Much merriment and chortling from those gathered . Gemmell 's point had a power beyond laughter ( " in a lot of ways it is that simple ; in some ways not " ) , one summed up by Wayne Goldsmith later in the day when she repeated the mantra " it 's not what you do ; its the way you do it " . <p> Happily for the vendors at the coffee stand not quite ready for an early rush , Gemmell stayed to explain how that pans out in the preparation of Katie Ledecky and the process that renders the outcome no less thrilling but much less surprising than some have and may suggest . <p> There are the basics , he noted : pool training ; dryland ; **42;154;TOOLONG &amp; plans . She shares much in common with other swimmers and regimes . He adds : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . That 's somehow , fuzzy , about intuition and feeling . " <p> Perhaps , some have suggested , she 's just more talented than others . But what , asks Gemmell is talent . His next slide reads : " What seems like talent , it turns out is often better practice habits in disguise . " He adds : <p> " I 'm not sure what talent means ... in her case it means she started practising early and has done it consistently well for a long period of time . " <p> Katie Ledecky by PBK <p> Back in 2013 , Ledecky , already an Olympic champion , " did n't have great stroke , did not have great feeling for water and no overall athleticism " , says Gemmell . He got Ledecky working on improvements to kick , pull , strength and explosiveness . Until 2013 , her dryland program had been very limited and that , Gemmell believed , was " was appropriate for a young lady " . <p> Strength work has been critical to her development from an 8:14 swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the world crown retained ; essential to the speed she now knows over ; a prerequisite to being able to ' pull ' a 15:27 world record and almost ' pull ' a 15:25 one after that . <p> However , Gemmell plunges back into the water to get to the nitty gritty of progress and explanation of the events that unfolded in Kazan . As he speaks , you can almost hear the synchronicity of Ledecky 's splash and the sound of blocks building to metronomic , pioneering speed . He starts his explanation at the heart of the extraordinary , that day in Russia when a second world record and a gold in the preceded qualification for the final . <p> " In the past year she has specifically got better at pulling . There was a strategic reason for that ... we knew that tackling final and the semi immediately after was going to be challenging . We thought that she would have to swim the 1500 as a pull set , saving her legs . " <p> Huge emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with dryland , core work and exercises geared at improving all-round athleticism in the mix , the search for small gains that add up to much extended to cutting out the right-hand catch-up that kicks in when she 's tired . Kicking was not dropped but it was put in its place : a reserve tank flicked by a " sports " switch alongside gears 1-5 driven by arms . Heavy work . Says Gemmell : <h> " She did n't like it but she did get better at it . " <p> Asked in Kazan after one of her world marks to pinpoint where strength had grown in her armoury of skills in the past two years , Ledecky said : <p> " My pulling has improved a lot : a shout out to Andrew Gemmell , he 's the fastest puller in the world and I think having Bruce as a coach you do a bit more pulling . I do kick a lot for a distance swimmer and I think I did decide to rest my legs a little bit and see what I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-class distance ace at the helm of the men at his dad 's program and one of 8 to 10 men who face and pace Ledecky in training every day . She is the only girl in Gemmell 's front line . <p> Katie Ledecky shows her feet to the world by PBK <p> His 2013 training group boasted just one sub 4:30 swimmer . In February , Ledecky shattered the American High School record with a 4:26.58 and yet , Gemmell notes , a touch of machiavellian mischief creeping round corner of lip , " she ca n't get in the 4:25 lane for 500 sets ... that makes for a good , exciting training environment ; those little things get to her . " <p> The coach notes that Ledecky 's metronome has been set at a for 100 yards pace sets for the past year . Only two men in the group can match that and there is constant downward adjustment . Says Gemmell : " Some of that is achieved through timed swim sets ... some of it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we move down to 57.0 . " <p> He takes a quick glance in the crystal ball of possibilities and says through a smile : " If we get to April next year and we 're using 56.5 , we 'll be real fast in Rio . " <p> That 100 pace work is the foundation for other building blocks , refinements galore work on starts , keeping the head down not up going into turns , underwaters off the wall the cement that binds . Once asked if he did a lot of drills , Andrew Gemmell once said , sarcastically , " if you consider a drill , we do lots of drills " . <p> Tempo , another drill . When Ledecky " demonstrated her ability " to swim at a rate of point of entry of one arm stroke through , over and back to the same place " for the majority of the 400 and all of the first 300 ? on her way to the world title over eight laps in Barcelona two years ago , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Gemmell recalled . <p> Ledecky has a flotilla of fast tugs and pace-setters all about her day after day at Nation 's Capital . " To the untrained eye , there 's a group of 8 to 10 middle distance swimmers , " says Gemmell , his top squad in his mind 's eye . <p> " She does n't stand out until you realise she 's the only girl in the group and that includes the best high school 500y man and a 2012 Olympian . " <p> The coach acknowledges the peers that went before , Yuri Suguiyama the man who guided Ledecky to London 2012 : " I was very fortunate to have those people in place when I got there and fortunate that they continue to develop . " <p> Ledecky , blessed with the right genes and fortunate to be in the same place as a coach with the right knowledge , teammates and support mechanisms pointed in a direction most favourable to her , has other world-class attributes beyond the line " where the rubber leaves the road " , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercely competitive and goal orientated " before adding : <p> " She challenges me every day and sometimes gets to the goal before I 'm ready to reset " . <p> Another race won . Katie Ledecky , unbeaten throughout and before her international career is a swimmer who hits reset before the coach can get there . <p> emerged from Gemmell 's talk to say : " There is nothing new in the kind of work she is doing ; it is a good , solid , sound distance program and Bruce Gemmell understands what 's needed . The rest is , if you like , genes . She 's an exceptional human being . " <h> Long-term Goals On Trail Of Progress &amp; Constant Renewal <p> Katie Ledecky by PBK <p> Gemmell talks of the progress made in cycles of 2012-13 and 2013-2014 , the seasonal nature of cycles , the aerobic endurance periods , the cycles of working all systems , the tapers of 3 days in between those , the mother of all tapers , a three-week , reserved exclusively for the big occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather have left out when he spoke to his wife about the presentation ; not because there 's a secret but precisely because there is no secret . <p> Back in 2012-13 , Ledecky was doing 7 water workouts a week . Now its 9 and the average of all weeks is around , going up to a week depending on where the cycle has turned to . There is a proactive side to the athletes and the program : Ledecky and Gemmell junior , for example , did n't like the feel of Sunday off and return only on Monday afternoon , the solution of coach and athletes a 6,000-yard easing in session on Monday mornings before a dryland set . <p> The latter is what Gemmell is most looking forward to this coming Olympic season . When more dryland was introduced in 2013-14 , commitment was not lacking from Ledecky but school demands dictated a ' **25;198;TOOLONG ' approach . That is about to change , Ledecky having set her academic cap at two classes a week on the way to Rio 2016 , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next Olympic cycle . <p> " What I 'm most looking forward to is having dryland as a regular program this coming year , " says Gemmell . " Her high school commitments make that difficult and she fit dryland in when she had free time ; it was not consistent . " <p> Bruce Gemmell <p> In the roll of a wave of workouts he puts up on the board , Gemmell notes that Saturday is over-distance day . The mind may conjure up thoughts of or , he says but the sets are more likely to be a series of 500 swims on a set time at a set pace , ascending , descending . " It will be something to keep her going but that is n't going to kill her . " <p> He apes one of Wayne Goldsmith 's messages to coaches in his presentation on " Turning Swimmers into Complete Athletes " : " It is not what you do but how you do it : she enjoys the process and is part of the group that is going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets training pace was a 58.5 base . By 2014-15 season , Ledecky was to be found coming home in 54.6 during blocks of 100 swims ( intervals vary from set to set and the rest period when the swims were done was not specified in the presentation , Gemmell noting that he was happy to share such information with coaches who wanted to know the presentation was a mixture of metres sessions and expressions in km as well as yards ) . <p> Whatever the pace and the rest , it added up to many moment when he had witnessed straight swims in training with Ledecky lapping at the pace we saw in Kazan : about 1:01 per 100 metres over on average . Asks Gemmell of his audience in Cleveland , rhetorically : <p> " How many 1:01s freestyle do you think she did to be able to do 8:07 ? It is about preparing at race pace : we do a lot of it . " <p> Katie Ledecky by PBK <p> The thought he had on the deck in Barcelona in 2013 when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season after two years of constant brick building . The emphasis on ' pull ' , even in the race , showed up too : legs ' rested ' , relatively speaking , Ledecky was able to bring in a Thorpe-like kick down the last lap of the freestyle for a 28.41 finish . <p> " The aim was to try to come him in 28.4 ; we 'd tried it , she 'd done it . She 's not going to do it every day and she never does , " says Gemmell , the implication clear what she needs in the race does not need to show up every day in training but it does need to rear its head occasionally , the confidence it carries all the way to blocks and body under duress among the keys to outcome . <p> Visiting coach Sue Chen , after observing Ledecky train , noted : " She just does what she needs to do to get better . " Gemmell adds : <p> " ... and she does it well , with enthusiasm , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " <p> Chen made another observation on her own coaching learning curve : Ledecky spent one session ( among many ) putting her head down in the last of a set of 50s in a display of determination to get her hand to the wall ahead of the boys about her every single swim she did . <p> Purpose , goal , says Gemell : " In Kazan we knew that she would need to to get her head down in the last to get to the final and then to get to the wall first " come the big moment . " <p> Small details practiced over and again week-in , week-out for 2 to 6 years of process . Says Gemmell : <p> " In a cake factory ... some people just want to work on the sprinkles ; you got to bake the cake first . " <p> And in the mix , he notes , is this mantra up on the Ledecky leaderboard : <p> " She 's not afraid to fail .... but failure is n't an option . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katie fails in the practice environment more than anyone in the group : sometimes she fails spectacularly . " She has a system of self-assessment in training : A , B or F. There 's either great or good or failure , with nothing in between . <p> Gemmell posts an example : a set of with a base time of to go at but descending in groups of eights . The first 8 she over swims ; the second 8 she meets a target designed to have her overreach ; the third 8 she misses the target spectacularly ( by in some cases ) . <p> Before Kazan , Gemmell sat down with Ledecky to talk through possible outcomes and what response she might have to them . Here 's how it went from Gemmell 's viewpoint : <p> Good : all works out <p> You swim the 1500 then semi and do n't make final ... <p> Stop right there . Ledecky looks her coach in the eye , the unspoken words in the eye of the glare screaming " what an idiot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalls . <p> Katie Ledecky by PBK <p> She was right : between the world record No2 of the meet and the semi , Ledecky had 8mins in warm-down , she ate , drank and went off to play top seed in the second semi , the fastest time seed a deliberate act she wanted to be in the second semi , not the first , to grant herself a touch more rest , and the only way to guarantee that was to swim fastest in heats . <p> After the ' pull ' set of the 15:25 world record it was time to test the ' rested ' legs . Gemmell , the video of the 200 semi rolling on the big screen above him , says : " She told me later that when she got on the blocks , her legs were like jello ( jelly ) . " The truth was that she had kicked in the and at times very much so . <p> In the , she was last at the mark , and later would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs in the world of jello . At the fist turn , she told Gemmell later , she realised it ' was going to be hard ' . Notes the coach : <p> " Not ' oh crap , I 'm not going to make it but ' oh , this is going to be hard ' . <p> Katie Ledecky by PBK <p> At the mark , 7th , by , Gemmell is praying ' please get fourth and sneak in ' ; at she 's still 6th and , Gemmell recalls : ' I 'm working out in my head what we ; ' re going to say ; ' ok , we gave it a try and it did n't work ' . " <p> And then " she did what she 'd practised to do : she puts her head down all the way into the wall : third . " Gemmell notes the time and gold in the final and the 1:54 of Sarah Sjostrom in the relay lead-off for Sweden before saying : <p> " There is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:54 she would have done a 1:54 . That mental capacity of not being able to fail is really what sets her apart . " <p> The beast of all distance sisters is a beauty in the making yet . Imagine by next April that she 's hitting that 56.5 training set base , lapping consistent half a second swifter on split swims , getting close to that 1:00.5 repetition in full swims . <p> The gap between her and the rest a year out from Rio over 400 and suggests that all being well , two gold medals are her 's for the taking . The 4x200m freestyle hangs on the strength of mates ; and the is less certain in some ways and yet looking ever more solid in other ways all the more so if you assume the blocks being built now bread the same quality of fruit as the ones that went before them . <h> Comments <p> Ger September 13 , 2015 <p> Kudos again Craig for another great piece . A work still in progress , what will she do during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 burdens to carry either . I do question the 1:54 , on demand , . She won the final by a touch and if she could have done it easier , she surely would have . It was a great performance and she gave it her all , I would have said . <p> clive rushton September 13 , 2015 <p> Craig , the " rate of per stroke " should be measured in seconds ( time ) , not in meters ( distance ) , so per cycle or 44-43 cycles per minute . It 's an exercise intensity that sits right on the cusp of the limit of metabolic contribution ( combination of fiber-type recruitment and energy-conversion methids . Anything more is down to sheer bloody-minded mental effort , exactly what your article promotes as her defining characteristic . <p> Sue Campbell September 13 , 2015 <p> Incredible coaching from Mr. Gemmell , with a very deliberate plan for the World Championship results , and for her ( increasingly exciting ) future . In 2016 , I hope Ledecky may reach the range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The will be an extraordinary race between a number of swimmers . Is it known whether Sarah Sjostrom will be swimming the at the Olympic Games ? I presume it is a bit early to know . If so , how do you think Sjostrom and Ledecky would match up ( in terms of pacing , heavy race schedule causing fatigue , etc . ) ? Have the two ever raced over ? <p> Great reporting , Craig ... always enjoy learning more about the training of the swimmers , especially when the knowledge is freely shared by the coaches . <p> roy September 14 , 2015 <p> Again what were , s average splits when she swam 8:07 in the 800 free and 15:25 in the 1500 free . I , m not really sure . Was it around 59.5 or faster ? And if it was around 59.5 secs per 100 meters , then a 56.5 per 100 meters looks like a steep drop . But Bruce gemmell is looking at a 56.5 for her . I do n't think it , s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 2 guys can match her . <p> Actually not much was said by Bruce Gemmell , besides the well-known fact that Katie Ledecky is exceptional and strongly determined swimmer . It 's either he does n't have to say anything more or he does n't want to discuss the know-how . I prefer the later . It would be incorrect to suggest that the significant progress she made since London should be attributed entirely to her genes and was possible without guidance from talented coach who is learning together with his pupil . But the question is if Bruce Gemmell 's training system created for Ledecky is sufficient enough to reveal all potentials of this extraordinary gifted swimmer . I would like to hear some comments on this 8:07 race swum with negative splits . Was it designed this way beforehand ? The only thing said was that the Family decided to celebrate Grandfather 's 88th birthday with 8:8 record . Was the Coach at this gathering ? I would like to hear how the coach plans to improve Katie 's sprinter abilities to make her able to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:55.16 is where Ledecky is now then at least improvement is required . To understand how much that is compare it with numbers that illustrate Ledecky 's unprecedented dominance at 1.2% , at 1.6% , at 1.4% . I would like to hear that this long distance coaching specialist knows how to train a MIDDLE DISTANCE champion who can also swim from time to time at world record time at and . The only hint given to us was that they have something to improve with her turns . But she already swam underwater more distance than anybody else . That is exactly what helped her to beat Pellegrini at final . Do they plan to make underwater all at each turn ? The way how Gemmell sounded makes me to believe that he knows more than says and that Katie will not disappoint in Rio . Let 's see . <p> roy September 14 , 2015 <p> yeah Katie already has very good turns so I too do n't really understand what means when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means more time underwater . <p> September 14 , 2015 <p> No magic formula here people ; the kid just wants it more than anyone else . Think about it : next season no distractions from having to go to class and do homework . She can focus on training . <p> Nice job on the write up . <p> Gin Ichi September 14 , 2015 <p> Yozhik , Ledecky 's family suggested her to swim a 8:08 because that day was her grandfather 's birthday , it was n't a rule to swim 8:08 . Judging by her post-interview and other 's comment , everyone were predicting it will be 8:08 , so 8:07 is a big surprise . About her turn , she will look to her left sometime before the turn , it has slow her down a little bit . I think Bruce still want to lowering her turning speed . After all , compare to her start , stroke , underwater , her turn still is the weakest point . <p> Craig Lord September 14 , 2015 <p> Roy , the emphasis on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated ( she lifts her head going in , loses a fraction each turn ) <p> Craig Lord September 14 , 2015 <p> Yozhik , there is a lot more than ' only ' in there . If she is lapping sets of 100s in and has a base lap target of 56.5 and is hitting it come April next year , she will have a killer last 100 in the 200 ... regardless of whether you work out what that pace means in yards or metres .... the ultimate sums are easy to work out ; and she does n't need to be a ' sprinter ' ... that 's for the Campbells and Co and she 'll never beat them sprinting . What is not hard ti imagine if a flat splits swim or thereabouts come Rio in a week that will have no 1500 to get in the way . <p> Craig Lord September 14 , 2015 <p> Roy , you can easily do the maths : 8mins would be laps ; 15mins 1500 would be laps , so clearly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a time she is doing in sets of 100s ( i.e. 20 ? 100 yards ad metres that kind of stuff ) with rest in the middle ... she is not lapping 56.5 for a straight 800 in training or racing , obviously not . <p> Craig Lord September 14 , 2015 <p> Thanks for the explanation Clive <p> roy September 14 , 2015 <p> Craig thanks for the info . I did n't understand the 56.5 secs per lap when l read it at first . Ledecky improving her turns further will be deadly . Sjostrom will have to step up her game . <p> If miera garcia wants to trouble in the 400 and 800 freestyles then she has to train out of her skin . I think she holds the short course world records from the 400 free to the 1500 free . <p> September 14 , 2015 <p> Re : The discussion of the base pace that is in Yards . I remember Gemmell saying that in a talk I heard from him a year ago . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jon Urbanchek colors system as their guide . ( Gemmell swam for Urbanchek about 30 years ago when this system was starting to take form ) . When Ledecky does train LCM in the summer ( there are few LCM pools in the Washington DC area available in the winter ) , they do a lot of pace 100s for races ( those 1:01s for example ) . <p> But when using 57 base , Ledecky 's " white " 100s should be 57.5 , pink 100s 55.7 , red 100s 54.7 , blue 100s 53.0 . This is all short course yards . You can also apply the base pace for times for longer distances ( 200,300 , etc ) . This way you can track progress and use a faster base when the colors become easier . The " base " is ideally based on a T-30 or any 30minute endurance set ( what can you hold for straight ? For Ledecky- 56.5 in short course yards sounds like the goal this year for example ) . See the calculator here . <p> Also Gemmell occasionally posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 , 2015 there is a freestyle set on the left of a white erase board with 300s and 100s and in a box in the corner , it lists the times that should be matched over these distances using the 55. 56 , or 57 base pace for the colors . It is short course yards ( see the intervals and the goal times ) . Still challenging , but not as absurd as swimming 56.5 over 100 meters on a regular basis . <p> Craig Lord September 14 , 2015 <p> Thanks coach swim ; I 've now made that clear in copy , sorry for any confusion ( travelling for many hours and was unable to get to it ) : the presentation included a mixture of yards and metres sessions expressed in 1000s , not always stating whether they were swimming yards or metres ... but overall sums were often expressed in metres ... the bottom line is that she 's used to repping 1:01s over multiple 100-metre , which is reflected in the peak pace she 's racing at . I hope that comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ichi , of course this ' was mentioned half seriously , but it shows some details between coach and his pupil . There was an initiation period when Ledeckys and Gemmell checked if they were good for each other . The race in Barcelona performed under coach 's instruction and being just a little bit faster than in London looked so unnatural for Katie leaving her almost out of breath at the end . It was the last race , but nevertheless . Then I thought that this coach does n't understand the specifics of this attacking everything and everybody girl and maybe is not a right choice for her . Things changed since then and we see that Katie 's attitude in the pool became more sophisticated and I give all credits to her coach with that . However Bruce mentioned multiple times that he never knows how Katie is going to race . She obviously did n't followed coach 's instructions at the end of 1500 final by adding extra efforts with powerful kicking to make an impressive world record . That almost jeopardized her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . I think that Bruce and Katie have kind of team type of mutually respectful relationship . They praise each other for out-of-pool attitude on very many occasions . Have you seen anything like this in the case of let say 18 year old Phelps or Lochte ? <p> Craig Lord September 14 , 2015 <p> Yes , to your last question , : I have . My notebooks have plenty of references of such respect and praise &amp; ... and criticism of coach when swimmer does not stack up beyond the pool . <p> Yozhik September 14 , 2015 <p> Craig I do n't argue that Ledecky can be a sprinter in terms of being a match to Sisters , Sjostrom and girls from Holand . But there is some opinion exists that in order to be compatible at she has to swim first part of race as close to sprinters as she possibly can and that is the only her resource for improvement . It is kind of same argument that is used for the super sprinter saying that she has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case people think that she has to improve her speed . In this regard I agree with you that attempts to approach sprinters by changing her technique and training excersizes is a wrong way for Ledecky because she is not a natural sprinter . The Heemskerk example with the very slow start can be the perfect receipie for Katie at race . <p> Ger September 14 , 2015 <p> Yozhik , the plan for the , both heat and final , was to go easy for , build for , and swim the last as she pleased . There was no ignoring instructions . She might have been wiser taking it easier , for , as you say , she had a tough straight after , but it was her decision . If Ledecky is indeed set on swimming the 4 ? 100 relay then we will surely see her swimming races at meets in the coming months , which will also serve the . <p> Yozhik September 14 , 2015 <p> Ger , the plan you mentioned was set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the plan for the final was . But what was said by Katie and by Bruce is that they expected more resources left for the 200 semi . The surge at last 50 at final was a risky undertaking and most likely was n't recommended by coach . He was really worry about this semi and told that Ledecky should be considered an underdog at 200 . He did it to low expectations . <p> Yozhik September 14 , 2015 <p> Ger , since London the most progress in percentage form was done by Ledecky at . It correlated very little with improvements at longer distances . It is an interesting fact that deserves a special study . Different reserves were revealed . That 's why I agree with Craig that setting for Ledecky a sprinter type training will have little success . I expected Gemmell to say something about that . <p> Yozhik September 14 , 2015 <p> Craig , what I meant was that girls at 18 are usually more rebellious . And boys at this age are more submissive to the authority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Ledecky and Gemmell remind me relationships between elite tennis players and their coaches . <p> Francene September 15 , 2015 <p> : Ger was correct , the plan was the same for the prelims and finals in the 1500 . And Bruce will tell you that holding back Ledecky is the last thing he wants to do . <p> Next , I think measuring anything with her 100 is not meaningful to this point as it has not been such a serious event for her , and therefore the data just is not of much value . I suspect that will soon change . <p> I will agree , however , that she 's about as mature and respectful of her coach as almost any swimmer of any age . She is completely trusting of her coach . I 'll take it a step farther and say that she 's the most humble athlete at the top of the world that I 've ever witnessed . <p> Gin Ichi September 15 , 2015 <p> Yozhik , both Katie and Lotte did n't swim well at 800 of Barce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1500 last , Katie mention later in press , her mind drifted to her grandfather both who are no present anymore , the only thing she can do is " dug deep " , I think that expain her losing control at the last , judging by the huge wave . Also after the 1500 premier , Katie said that her final always faster than the premier , so either way she will go hard at the 1500 final , regardless the 200 semi later . <p> September 15 , 2015 <p> She is , in other words , the perfect athlete : physically talented , mentally strong , hungry for victory , unafraid of hard work . I already suspected that ? ? I am very curious to see what she can do in the shorter distances . <h> KT Tunstall forgot 
 to transform swimming into a professional drug-free , risk-free sport that serves athletes first and foremost image by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The founding principles of the World Swimming Association , officially adopted in Cleveland this week as the organisation that intends to take over the global governance of the sport , were backed by a unanimous vote of approval from more than 650 coaches this weekend . <p> The Board of the World Swimming Coaches Association , backed by its American counterpart ASCA , intends the WSA to serve as the governing body for swimming across the world . The organisation will replace FINA , the crisis-torn international federation ; the timing of that move less relevant than true commitment of those unprepared to tolerate " another 40 years of governance that is not risk-free , not clean , not , not transparent , not serving athletes " . <p> Those were the words of a man whose olive branch was ignored by FINA , Australian coach Bill Sweetenham . From the platform at the ASCA World Clinic , staged in the Renaissance Cleveland Hotel , he asked coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " risk-free , clean , , transparent , serving athletes " . <p> No-one stood ; not a single person in a hall than included several worthies from USA Swimming and in which the numbers were greater than FINA ever sees at a full Congress of delegates from around the world . <p> Bill Sweetenham <p> Later in the same session , Sweetenham , who gave what he called the last seminar and presentation of his coaching career in Cleveland , turned the question around and asked all in support of " drug-free , clean , risk-free , transparent , sport " served by " professional management " to stand . No seat was left occupied . Unanimous . Applause . FINA has its answer : no , this is not Leonard , ASCA Director , Sweetenham and a few others trying to act as thorns in FINA 's side . <p> Instead it is a powerful wave building , a clear commitment to replace FINA on the assumption that FINA 's leaders will continue to adopt the stance of the three wise monkeys , western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of FINA 's failure to respond to the call of coaching unions , including those from the world 's leading swimming nations the United States and Australia , representing more than 20,000 members worldwide for the federation to submit to a review and audit of its management and financial structures . <p> In Cleveland this week , the Professional Athletes ' Association was also founded . The body will represent the interests of athletes at the start of a new era in which issues such as image rights and the marketing of swimmers will no longer be controlled by FINA . <p> There is much meat to put on bones but then that is the stuff of daily life for coaches , generation come and go . Both WSCA and ASCA ended their commitment to engage with FINA this week , while Sweetenham confirmed on Saturday that he too now believes the time is over for repairing the federation , saying : <p> " The olive branch was offered . Replacement is the only option if swimming is to set a new course . " <p> While FINA 's leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes ; failing to pay swimmers their fair share ( less than of all funds go to swimmers ) and distribute prizes fairly ; and of failing to enforce the World Anti-Doping Agency Code , tolerating covering-up and even honouring athletes who have tested positive , the founding principles of the WSA speak to everything FINA has abandoned : <p> Honesty <p> Transparency <p> Governance in the interests of the sport not individuals <p> Financial targets aimed at benefitting athletes <p> Leadership by those who know swimming and how to grow the sport <p> Opposition to corruption in all its formed , including doping <p> Governance under the Rule of Law <p> Genuine development of the sport worldwide <p> Talks are being held with professional facilitators , backers and business leaders , a WSA convention will be arranged in the coming months , beyond which a Constitution and rule book will be published and swimmers and coaches allowed to get on with the business of preparing for Olympic season , beyond which the gloves will come off , according to those leading the way here in Cleveland and according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in support of the plan to replace FINA . <p> George Block , president of WSCA <p> Constitution and rules will closely mirror a great deal that already exist but too often overlooked , not enforced or wilfully misinterpreted in the FINA Constitution and Rules , those leading the way confirmed . Critical changes and updates would be required to rid swimming of antiquated rules and to take account of new structures required for events and in recognition of new entities such as the PSA . <p> In a statement today , the president of WSCA , George Block , who shared a stage with Sweetenham and this author in Cleveland as master of no ceremony and many questions , said : <p> " At this stage , the timing of events and the fine detail of WSA 's development is to be determined but what we are all very clear on is that the WSA is the organisation that will steer swimming in a bright , new direction that leaves the swimmer in control of their own earning power and right to play . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new structure of governance but said the notion of a body run only by coaches and swimmers was false . Professional management would cast the net far wider than the pool and deck . <p> The start of the first truly professional swimming era is on the horizon . Imagine a world where the top 30 swimmers ( or more ) through the world ranks are paid for what they do , like tennis players on tour . Imagine a back to the future approach where the sport returns to holding its showcase world long-course championships once every four years in the middle of the Olympic cycle , continental events regaining their status and respect and windows created for a professional tour fit for future purpose , a platform on which to promote swimming and swimmers as the great sport and sportspeople they surely are . <p> The dream got a big stroke closer to reality in Cleveland this week . A marathon ahead in a sport whose main players know what it takes to go the distance . <p> After a panel discussion in Cleveland at ASCA World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brent Rutemiller : <h> Comments <p> Yozhik September 13 , 2015 <p> I was looking for the reaction and comments on the news of WSA creation . The search for " World Swimming Association " returned with nothing either by Google or by Bing . Even the reference to this article popped up and now disappeared . What has actually happened in Cleveland ? Was it just the declaration of intention and we have to wait for the convention to make it official ? <p> Lawrie Cox September 13 , 2015 <p> The first step of many towards a stronger and far more transparent sporting body . <p> Ger September 13 , 2015 <p> Best wishes to all involved ; hopefully the beginning of a new era of transformation . <p> September 14 , 2015 <p> Who are in professional swimmers association ? I want names ! <p> Good luck to WSA and PAA ! <p> And do n't forget to make your swimming events available to watch for swim fans like me who may not live in USA or Europe . ( and who would be willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my unpublished stories about the behaviour of officials will be useless ! <p> A ' swimming ' association , rather than ' aquatics ' is a good first step . I love water polo , and have a deep respect for the athleticism of synchronised swimmers , but these are completely different sports with a vague watery similarity . The sprawling purpose and size of FINA is a big part of their problems . <p> swimmers should be paid for what the do . I agree . Also there should be more intercontinental championships like the duel in the pool . Europe vs the Americas vs asia . <p> roy September 15 , 2015 <p> The intercontinental championships should be every 4 years just as it is now . In between the olympic cycle . I , ve not seen anything about the WSA on the internet ( google and bing ) . And where will the headquarters be located . In the USA ? Will it be america centric . <p> Craig Lord September 15 , 2015 <p> Roy and all wondering : there will be nothing much on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in terms of visibility and unrolling of plans . Like all that work swimmers do every day , the details of the work going on in the background are best not played out in public . The location of any head office has not been decided and the organisation will not be america centric but you could , as we all should , expect the USA to have a key say in the running of world swimming . And on a number of levels , that 's a good thing , together with all the cautions that come with any singular influence from anywhere in the world , not forgetting that the same thoughts and cautions apply to universality , elements of which have been and are detrimental to the development of swimming . <p> Jorge Abril September 15 , 2015 <p> It will be like boxing ? Two or more International Organizations ? <p> Craig Lord September 15 , 2015 <p> Not if 1 global organisation has no world-class top 30 swimmers to represent , Jorge . The intention of those preparing for the new world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace does not wish to be replaced ... <p> September 15 , 2015 <p> The newly formed WSA will not amount to much unless the leading federations get on board . If the USA , Australia , Germany , Great Britain etc. had insisted on higher governance standards FINA today would not be the mediocre , unrepresentative , unaccountable body that it is . I fear the federations will go into denial about the need to have a new governing body rather than admit they were asleep at the wheel . <p> Craig Lord September 15 , 2015 <p> All but your first sentence may well be so , longstroke . On that first point : no federation nor association can go on without athletes . The power is with federations because of the structures in place . Change the structures and much changes with that . And home feds would be wise to wake up . Right now , those athletes earn nothing to little for the most part , including many world top 30 swimmers to and upwards for a relative few ; and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be down to athletes ultimately : if they want a sport where the top 100 ranked swimmers in the world are earning a decent living wage that stretches to longer careers and being able to save for a day before sport ; and if that format were to attract those who can ensure the financial rewards run much deeper , then no federation nor organisation will have the say as FINA does now : the world will have tilted on its axis . It can happen if the biggest players want it to . <p> September 15 , 2015 <p> Craig , I agree totally that the swimmers are the lifeblood of the sport and need to be better rewarded financially for their efforts . They also need a much bigger say on how the sport is run . In the past they have not been very active in demanding change . Perhaps this is already happening behind the scenes which fans like myself are n't aware of . I certainly hope that 's the case because without their strong support for the WSA I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be wedded to the current power structures . <p> Jorge Abril September 15 , 2015 <p> Craig , thanks for the reply , but I am very sceptical about it . Long road ahead of us . What does think ? , por example ... <p> Yozhik September 15 , 2015 <p> Six month is probably sufficient time to make it clear what WSA is up to and where and how it plans to get money . Meanwhile longstroke raised a valid point if WSA against FINA and FINA is the association of National Federations then what what will those federations do if their association is gone ? It 's a lot of people can be out from their well paid jobs . I think that relationships with Federations is the most crucial point that can determine WSA 's fate . <p> Skepticism is bound to remain , Jorge ; federations have it in their hands to force change in the way they would like to see it before it is too late , however long that takes , Yozhik ; Jorge swimming only ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must find a way to self-govern or stick with FINA if the WSA attracts the bulk of world-class elite swimmers . There will be a time of divide , a moment of big change ... or a moment when all accept an even worse version of FINA in its current structure and form . The time to decide iOS not far away , choices all the easier when it becomes clear what the new world could look like . Sitting around being skeptical , pessimistic is not going to change anything , of course . As said : " They say time changes things but you actually have to change them yourself " <p> Yozhik September 15 , 2015 <p> There is no skepticism in my posting , Craig . There is one unsolved major problem so far professional swimmer has to be paid whatever he/she earned and there supposed to be free market conditions that will determine the appropriate payment . This problem will be addressed one way or another pretty soon . It is an unstoppable process and this is how I see ithttps : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement they will be gone . What will be instead it is hard to predict . I have no doubts that WSA or any similar organizations that will move in this direction will evolve , transformed and modified multiple times before the situation gets stable . What I also strongly believe in is that as payment system gets straight forward then this sport becomes cleaner , because there would be no joke about steeling someone else 's earnings and it would be considered a criminal act with the following professional disqualification . <p> Craig Lord September 15 , 2015 <p> Thanks , I think you 're on right lines ... and agree with your last sentiment ... the skepticism comment was for Jorge , who says ( understandably ) he 's skeptical . A new world with even the bulk of the very best and free of so much of the nonsense that backers , sponsors and broadcasters and potential hosts have to put up with from current arrangements would , I believe , be most welcome . @ <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h>

 drop of knowledge on offer in Lund next January - main image , Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Question : Is swimming an ethical sport ( sub-question : is it run on an ethical basis ) ? <p> It could be doping ; it could be economic advantage ; it could be the lack of a risk-free environment in which a young athlete develops ; it could be about how a coach coaches and deals with his/her charges ; it could be about the impact of and messaged inherent in returning to waters where an athlete lost his life just four year before ; it could be about moral and ethical poverty ; it could be any number of issues from a catalogue headed " What 's wrong with FINA ? " among others . <p> Ethics <p> What is the best way for people to live ( beyond general , in a given realm ) ? <p> What actions are right or wrong in particular circumstances . <p> What relationships , partnerships are appropriate ? <p> How important is declaring interests and avoiding conflicts of interest ? <p> How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve ? <p> " All coaches and athletes are affected by sport culture and ethics . The 2016 WADC will offer ideas about how to operate within the culture , and how to anticipate changes in the culture in ways that will help coaches and swimmers of all ages . An overarching theme of the conference will be the link between the first experiences of swimming , in learn-to-swim , and the future success , or limitations , of swimmers . " <p> As moderator of the event , this author is already looking forward to January 2016 , the line-up of speakers thrilling in prospect at a time of great turmoil in the sport of swimming . Those limitations organisers speak of should not be interpreted as ' what the swimmer could have done better ' . The limitations are those placed on the swimmer by the environment in which they work , the education , culture , approach and governance around them . <p> These past two seasons beyond many moments of schism and unacceptable management by the FINA leadership and acquiescence from federations around the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a watershed . <p> FINA in focus : Julio Maglione , top right , is the latest in a line of federation presidents going back to George Hearn in 1908 <p> FINA , it is clear , is no longer wanted nor even needed by coaches and swimmers who want a new start . That will not translate to FINA rolling over : those who lead the international federation and those who follow the blazer code that gives with it simply have too much to lose . The system is trapped in bad practice and inertia . But change you can bank on . It is simply a matter of time . <p> And with the passing of time in mind consider these quotes : <p> " My view is that under FINA , the system has lost the plot . On the world stage there are far too many meets , imposing a heavy load on the swimmers . The unbending FINA attitude remains : ' We govern the sport we 'll put on the meets wherever we want to ' . So far , the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play the politics game ( i.e. ensuring that their officials get jobs at future major meets ) have gone along with it , notwithstanding their serious concerns as they bid to raise enough money to run their own domestic programs . " <p> " People like me , as head coach of Australian Swimming , had no direct input into FINA whatsoever . The Australian input came through our delegates who , in the past , have not been strong enough in pushing the things we see as being best for Australia . Similarly , every country should have input . " <p> " FINA 's World Cup meets ... cost or so to host ... The World Cup concept , which I am not against per se , bleeds the budgets of the swimming nations dry . " <p> " Some ... argue that swimmers can only get up for one major meet a year ... I believe that is not the truth of it ... and after suggesting three is possible The sport will become the swimmer 's job , and he or she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train and compete to make a living . We are far from that thinking today . " <p> " FINA are motivated by the money factor , but I feel they ca n't justify that while there is no transparency . They 'll argue : ' Well , we 're out there doing it ( promoting swimming ) in Third World Countries . ' I would ask in return , " How ? Where exactly ? What precisely are you doing ? ' ... these questions are going to have to be answered . " <p> They all come from one man : Don Talbot . They date back to 2003 . Forbes Carlile and Bill Sweetenham are among other leading Australian coaches down the years who can look back 40 to 60 years and know the damage that has been caused by poor governance , stretching all the way to deliberate self-serving measures designed to keep the status quo no matter what , even if that means breaking rules , ignoring rules , setting aside constitutions and changing them when the mood suits a leadership determined to get its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sport . <p> From the platform at the ASCA World Clinic , staged in Cleveland , Sweetenham asked coaches and others gathered to stand up if they thought swimming was " risk-free , clean , , transparent , serving athletes " . <p> No-one stood ; not a single person in a hall than included several worthies from USA Swimming and in which the numbers were greater than FINA ever sees at a full Congress of delegates from around the world . <p> Later in the same session , Sweetenham turned the question around and asked all in support of " drug-free , clean , risk-free , transparent , sport " served by " professional management " to stand . No seat was left occupied . Unanimous . <p> Bad culture and poor leadership from the top be that in coaching , in the boardroom , at club night , in the way a child grows up in the sport spills to bad practice not only in the immediate realm of world-class swimming . <p> What happens far out in the ripples of learn-to-swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , successful folk , and on to damaged goods and lives . Full spectrum . <p> In the competitive realm , issues of morality arise in governance and guardianship with every passing day . <p> Here is an interview to stir thought to theme . In a recent interview with Sport Integrity , fellow journalist Hajo Seppelt explained why he believes anti-doping to be failing : <h> Saying one thing , doing another <p> " It is a convenient excuse to claim that we have an anti-doping system that is working , and that we are doing our best to catch the cheats . However , I tell you that when you see how many tests are conducted against how many samples are actually analysed in a proper manner ... I know this from an international federation that some years ago did n't do any serum blood testing or HGH testing at all . <p> " If you do n't have any blood serum , you ca n't find any HGH . Finally , the big international federation had to admit that they did n't do that . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <h> Future challenge <p> Going , going ... by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> " If they have enough support from doctors and scientists , gene doping is a real possibility . Also , as far as I can see at the moment , they still do n't have too much to fear , because the anti-doping system is n't effective enough . If they take care and pay attention , they can have an easy life continuing to dope without getting detected . " <p> " I was in China during 2008 , where stem cell treatment was being offered to young athletes . This was the beginning . I am pretty sure that in some countries with different cultures and traditions , they are already at work on this . Last year , when I was in Russia , somebody was working on a so-called wonder drug . He showcased it at an international scientific congress and wanted to offer it to delegates . I approached this guy and he wanted to sell it to me for . <p> " From this , you can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have other interests , obviously , than to clean up sport or save sport and the culture around it . Sport has a cultural value and this , which we are talking about , has nothing to do with cultural values . " <h> Holding sportspeople up as heroes <p> " I do n't understand how people can speak about the so-called role model of high-performance athletes . I think that the opposite is true . In your life , to focus on just one thing and ignore what is close to you on both the left and the right and to do this for ten or 15 years for me , that is kind of crazy . Life means much more than just physical ability . I think that high-performance athletes are not a role model for me exactly the opposite . We have to think what happens to them they are often victims of the system . Only a few of them ever get enough money to develop themselves . This is also a concern that should be discussed . " <p> " Athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footballers , only receive a small amount of money . A fencer or a lower level swimmer might only receive ? 500 to ? 1,000 per month if you do n't have a sponsor . However you must train twice a day , you never know if you are going to succeed . This is a big risk in your life , and I do n't understand why we think that we need role models like that .

 most sure-fire gold predictions for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games is the Australian 4x100m freestyle relay , the strength of the Dolphins six deep one of the sharpest pictures of dominance in the pool across all events . <p> Little wonder then that seven-time All-American and four-time national champion Simone Manuel has taken a decision to set the college racing season aside this season to focus on long-course training and the needs of self and the USA come Olympic trials on the way to battle in Rio . <p> A Stanford Sophomore , Manuel , four-time national champion and American record holder in the 100 free in the smaller pool , is among those critical to the USA 's chances in a 4x100m free campaign that has steep improvement ahead to get on terms with the Australians . <p> The U.S.A long-course record stands at 53.02 to Amanda Weir since the last season of shiny suits in 2009 . Manuel has come closer to any other , her 53.25 relay lead-off from last year marking the swiftest textile time over two laps freestyle ever by an American woman .

Kraemer <p> " After careful thought and discussion with my coaches , I have decided to redshirt a term used in American college athletics that refers to delaying or suspending an athlete 's participation in order to lengthen his or her period of eligibility and shift my focus to long-course training and competition for the upcoming year . I am still training with Stanford University and will continue my journey academically . I am fortunate and grateful to be a part of the Stanford family , as we share and support each other on our journeys . " <p> " This is a great decision for Simone , " head coach Greg Meehan told Philippou . " Continuing her academics , training and social life here at Stanford allows for consistency over the next eight-plus months leading up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training in the team environment and our program will certainly benefit from her presence . " <h> Comments <p> October 24 , 2015 <p> Realistically this is the only intelligent she could make under the circumstances and it is to Greg Meehan 's credit that he is supportive of this move ' something that can not be said for ALL NCAA Div 1 coaches during this Olympic lead-up period . Then again ; what they are being paid for by their relevant Athletic Departments is to win meets , conferences and championships ' NOT specifically fostering swimmer 's development . <p> As for Manuel , she essentially has at least a second 's gap to bridge to be a medal contender in Rio ( working on being " medal country " ) as at this point she is realistically a swimmer . This was good enough for a final in Kazan but that may require at least faster next year . <p> Whilst some will point to her 53.25 relay lead-off at Pan Pacs ; all other evidence tends to point to that being an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 and under similar conditions of surfing a faster swimmer 's wake ) as all other swims at that swim and internationally since then have been high side of 53.50 . <p> Whilst not impossible , bridging such a gap over this time period looks a significant ask . <p> With regards to the USA ; their only current swimmers with a relay split to their name are Coughlin with 52.98 at 2013 Worlds and Franklin with 52.99 at 2011 Worlds .... and none for 2014 &amp; 2015 . <p> They would certainly be needing at least 2 sub to be challenging NED for silver . As in stands at the moment ; the gap AUS has over the field in this event does not look like being bridged by the competition currently in evidence . Illness or injury to one or both Campbells or an illegal changeover look the most likely means of " levelling the playing field " . <p> USA would certainly welcome a anchor on the where currently they only " maintain par " at best with other nations and haemmorage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October 25 , 2015 <p> 1 sec gap is probably too much . Despite she probably was under better care than Franklin and there would be no back spasms the SCY training is like a scar and some LCM time is needed to heal it . Hopefully nine months will be enough to get to the required form . Also nobody knows how tough the competition will be . Who could imagine that the most anticipated race at W200 fs in Kazan would be that slow . The race where five under 1:55 times were expected to be shown . So in Semone 's case the good luck , smart training and confedence is what is needed . <p> October 25 , 2015 <p> Yozhik , the scenario that you paint COULD play out . The in London was distinctly slow compared to Beijing with no -one below 53 and bronze at 53.44 . TBH , Manuel would need a somewhat similar scenario to unfold out to be a major factor as a drop down to for her looks more plausible than a full second . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period for the W100 with rarely if ever broken whereas over this present cycle there has been a group who have cleared away from the ruck and are either " regulars " or " repeat visitors " to not only but the zone . <p> Maybe we 'll have a better read when we see how the Campbells &amp; Sjostrom are tracking next year along with the Dutch . <p> Yozhik October 25 , 2015 <p> I think that swimmers you mentioned are very stable . Despite not much of progress was shown this year the competition was hot . That I believe insures that the women sprint in Rio will be faster than Simone is capable of now .

He jumped back into swimming following several facial surgeries , and less than a year later was the star of the 2012 Paralympic Games , taking home two gold medals and one silver . <p> This past summer Snyder dominated the IPC World Swimming Championships , taking home 3 gold medals , all in meet record fashion . He is considered the best blind swimmer in the world . <p> Filming for the biopic will begin next summer , as Snyder prepares to qualify to compete in his second Paralympic Games . <p> Knott just recently finished working on project with Vince Vaughn and Universal Pictures and is currently writing a new show for FX .

 among those described as ' veterans ' making a scream for China at world titles . The next wave is on the way ... - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In the seventh part a series of articles on the wide gap in standards and selection processes for swimming at the Olympic Games , we turn our attentions to China . <p> In the absence of an official announcement outlining the selection criteria of the country on the way to Rio 2016 well worth considering the second-tier of youth being prepared for a crack at action in Brazil . Who are they and what have they been up to during 67 days of camps with the leadership of Chinese swimming ? <p> More likely than not , the China team for Rio 2016 will be selected mainly from the National Championships next spring , with provisions to add names ( and remove them if required ) left to the discretion of the head coach and other leadership figures , the final say on it all resting with the Chinese Swimming Association and the Chinese Olympic Committee . <p> Details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this past week . No firm news yet on the swimming trials , times and how the squad will be selected . Suffice it to say that much but perhaps not all will come down to China nationals next spring , the top 2 times in most events almost sure to be fast enough to set aside any doubt over conversion to a ticket to Brazil . <p> While we can say with some certainty that Sun Yang and Ye Shiwen look set to defend at least some of the treasure they claimed at London 2012 and look to those who excelled at the Asian Games in 2014 and at World titles in Kazan this year , there are two other factors to take into account : <p> China has a habit , nay all but a tradition , of selecting swimmers ranked 3rd , 5th and even outside the top 10 , for international competition when you might expect them to stick to the top tier , often without logical explanation given , so until the team is named , you never know <p> China has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world No 1 , the United States , the coaching of coaches and swimmers a key theme at centrally organised camps , with large youth teams gathered from all corners of the country for 67 days of camps so far this year <p> China 's ambitions may well be loftier than its self-image and true status in world waters . Take this from the pathway to Rio 2016 designed by those leading the nation 's elite approach to the next Olympic Games : <p> July-August 2015 30 days altitude camp , Kunming , , Yunnan Province , while the elite squad of seniors was away at World titles in Kazan . Purpose : <p> " ... to promote the results of scientific training of young swimmers . In order to continue to consolidate the basic training of adolescents aimed at narrowing the gap with the world 's swimming powers , according to the status of project development and training arrangements throughout the year , the leadership group decided to organise a camp for the national swimming team preparing for the 2016 Olympic Games chosen from the second-tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world swimming powers ahead of China on the medals table ? ... <p> Shanghai 2011 worlds : the USA , and no others <p> London 2012 : the USA an no others <p> Barcelona 2013 worlds USA , AUS <p> So , when China says narrow the gap with the world 's swimming powers it can only mean one thing : the USA . China wants to be world No 1 in world waters . Full stop . <p> Make no mistake : while China purports to need its connections in Australia and elsewhere and notes , somewhat too humbly on occasion , what it can learn from overseas and how facilities and conditions are so much better abroad , the fact is that it is operating a systematic approach to its national teams and at the edge of that , selection to the biggest of events on the swimming calendar . <p> Liu Xiang , left , and Fu by PBK <p> Shun Wang by PBK <p> China will arrive in Rio a force to reckon with , come what may , critical to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitters who , like Sun and Ye , have not been back to their 2012 best in the intervening years ; the progress of the breakers of 2015 , like Wang Shun ; the ability of the likes of Fu Yuanhui and Liu Xiang , top 2 in the backstroke at world titles , to step up in Olympic waters where the challenge starts at ; and the strength of surge in the new wave rolling in . <p> Last week , China 's swimming leadership let it be known that the nation is aiming to top its and " miracle " tally from London 2012 in the pool at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games and that it will strive to do so with commercial backing , capitalist style with a twist , its war chest set at million . <p> As Sun Yang knows well : money ca n't buy everything , including space in a funded pool in Australia now that the double Olympic champion of London 2012 tows a doping positive . <p> And there are no guarantees in the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in domestic waters in recent years set by youngsters who either fell off the pace or appear to have disappeared altogether . <h> Gathering Of Elite Youth <p> The latest camp in Yunnan at venues long used by the Chinese dating back to the doping crisis-torn 1990s when it comes to gathering talent from around the country for assessment and preparation , included head coach Yao Zhengjie ( national swimming team head coach ) and his deputy Lu Yifan ( national swimming team research group leader ) , though some of those listed on the official roster could not have been present for any or all of the time given that they were elsewhere . <p> The coaching staff working with coaches and swimmers included Zhu and Xu Zhejiang coaches from the provincial teams of Sun and Ye : and Liu Haitao .

Ai Yanhan , 16 , is the latest to be racing at a pace that may place her in the Olympic quartet next year by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The same leadership and staff list was at the helm of a similar camp back in March-April this year . <p> Lasting 37 days , almost 100 of China 's top medley and distance freestyle prospects and provincial coaches gathered in Wuhan to , according to the official invitation , " strengthen young athletes in long-distance freestyle and medley technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international competitiveness of long-distance freestyle and medley swimmers ; ensure better results at the 2016 Olympics " . <p> To make the camps , athletes had to meet he following criteria : <p> 1997-2002 men national standard ; already preparing for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games ( that would make them between 14 and 19 come the Games ) with development potential <p> 1998-2003 women same was above plus the need for an " inspection certificate for preparing for the 2016 Rio Olympics training with future development potential " ; ( age range would make them between 13 and 18 come the Games ) <p> When it comes to the content of the camps , the CSA focuses on coaching the coaches to improve their performance ; laying the foundations of " basic , technical and special training capabilities " in the swimmers ; and is said to involve " foreign experts , coaches with special technological know-how , including land fitness and " technology trends " . <p> The foreign coaches are not beyond saying that they must be " World Swimming Coaches and leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the camp were also told that if they did not think their units are up to it , they should send no-one .

Those who arrived in camp would only be allowed to leave before April 6 under " exceptional circumstances " . <p> Each athlete received about US$8 a day to cover the cost of meals but must cover some transport costs themselves . " Scientific testing " is paid for by the centre in Wuhan . Travel and accommodation costs for all coaches and managers and others invited to attend are also covered by Wuhan , plus an allowance of about US$35 a day . <p> So where have the cream of the crop got to ? <h> All China Youth Games <p> Li Zhuhao of China <p> Let 's start with the top liners in the China youth ranks : breaststroke sub-minute man at 16 , Wang Lizhou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man at 15 . Wang did not show in Fuzhou . Li did show and took gold in the 50 free ( 22.8 ) , silver in the free ( ) , gold in the 100 and 200 ' fly ( 52.5 and 1:56.1 ) . <p> Among girls , Chen Xinyi , with a 56.6 over butterfly last year , cruised home to victory in 57.84 and clocked 2:12.27 for the win over 200IM . And among the lesser known winners and those not know at all beyond China : <p> Wang Siqi , 16 2:06.91 200 ' fly for 8th in the world this year <p> Zhu , 16 53.82 100 free for world No 11 this year <p> Zhu 24.9 50 free for world No 24 this year <p> Li Bingjie , 13 , 4:06.0 400 free for world No 12 this year <p> Ai Yanhan , 16 , 1:57.2 200 free for world No 17 this year <p> There were also efforts of 1:00.3 from Wang in the 100 back and 2:09.93 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver in the 200 ' fly in 2:07.7 , Chen Xinyi on 2:08 flat . <p> Among boys , Li Guangyuan took the backstroke double in 54.6 and 1:57.25 ; Cao Jiwen clocked 49.9 for the free crown and for 16th in the world over free this year a from 16-year-old Qiu Zihao . Wang away , Qin Haiyang took the 100 and breaststroke in 1:01.6 and 2:11.8 . The silver medals in most of those races was not far behind , the bronze also world-class among youth . <h> Li swifter than Manaudou and Ledecky at 13 <p> Laure Manaudou left France for Love but later suggested she wished she had n't -by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Katie Ledecky by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> That 4:06 from 13-year-old Li Bingjie is remarkable . She was born in 2002 , before Laure Manaudou , of France ( on a best of at 17 ) took the game on in her approach to Janet Evans and beyond and when the swiftest time in the world was the 4:07.10 in which double Olympic medley champion Yana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At 14 , Katie Ledecky ( USA ) , now world champion and record holder and the first inside 4 minutes in a textile suit , had a best of from USA Youth nationals in 2011 , a year out from claiming Olympic gold in the . <p> At 13 , Li came from a place outside 4:15 a year ago . And what of Wang Siqi and a 2:06.91 in the 200 ' fly . Back in spring at China nationals she shaved back her career best to 2:06.91 and at the World Junior Championships cracked that back to 2:08.24 . If she repeats that kind of progress next year , she will , most likely , be Olympic champion . That , of course , is not how it happens usually . <p> Then there is Zhu Menghui : on a best of 55.14 over free last year , she took her high to 54.5 at China nationals , clocked 54.7 at world titles in August . In domestic waters , she raced almost a second faster . <p> Ai Yanhan entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationals back in spring . Now , six months on she sports a best of 1:57.21 for a maiden voyage into the world top 20 .

Kraemer <p> A year before that and the best man in China was 15:24 swimmer . Zhang cracked 15 minutes for the first time in 2007 and in 2008 , the year of a home Olympics had romped on to a 14:45 best ( shiny suits in the mix ) , Sun Yang making a sub-15-minute show on 14:48 in Olympic heats that year . China 's third best : 15:12 that year . Very similar this year : 14:55 , 14:59 , 15:11 , the top 3 compared to four sub-15-minute efforts in 2013 and a 15:06 as national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a clear pattern in the China ranks : Olympic year witnesses a definitive peak . You would expect that though not among 13 to 16 years olds making the world top 30 , 20 and even 10 across a fair few Olympic events . <p> The rush of youth has been seen before in China and some of the names that looked like they were set to make a big noise as they reached their later teens simply faded from view . One day , the reasons why will become clearer , China still to this day a nation that is happy to be perceived as lagging on the coaching , facilities and other fronts , when the reality that challenges the best in the world on the scoreboard suggests a different story . <p> One way or another , 2016 will be a fascinating year in the story of China 's pursuit of " narrowing the gap " to the " world 's swimming powers " , as if it was n't already one itself . <h> Comments <p> roy October 30 , 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched her race back in august at the FINA world cup in france ( paris ) but she went out too fast .

 with an kick - FINIS narrows down one of the tipping points of excellence on the trickiest of strokes <p> The awkward stroke , the only child in the family of strokes , the stroke that takes no prisoners and so on : that 's breaststroke , a discipline where a small shift in a skill , a rhythm , a flow , a point of timing can make a huge difference on the clock , both ways . <p> Now , FINIS , the California-based kit maker , has come up with a training tool , the Kick Pro , that is being hailed as a fine new aid in the search for efficient breaststroke . <p> The company explains : " The Kick Pro has two neoprene cuffs that are attached to the leg at either the swimmers ankles , or around the knee area to promote a narrow kicking technique . When worn , the kick pro limits the distance between the legs , and activates the outer leg muscle , resulting in a faster and more efficient kick . The Kick Pro has a fully adjustable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Designed specifically for breaststroke , there have been many technical changes to the width of breaststroke kick in recent years , and the FINIS Kick Pro is an effective training tool , that will help swimmers monitor their technique and generate propulsion in the water .

The Kick Pro can also be used to teach proper flutter kick , making this a great universal tool for all kicking styles . " <p> The Kick Pro is an effective training tool for beginners and elite athletes alike , FINIS notes . Scott Weltz , a 2012 US Olympic Teamster , says the device is " great ... for fast swimming with a narrow kick " , adding : <p> " I was able to do fast pace ( swimming ) with the straps .

 ( main image ) , Cesar Castro , ( left inset ) and Hugo Gonzalez highlight the inconsistency in international rules on age limits in swimming <p> ( File updated 9pm European time with reaction from LEN ) <p> The barring of two Spanish from competing at the European Short-Course Championships highlights the inconsistency of international policies when it comes to aquatic sports , the European body run by the same people who play key roles in FINA . <p> The global body allowed a 10-year-old nowhere close to being inside any limit time nor anyone whose skills and speed reflected an outstanding talent among her age peers worldwide to race at world titles this year . <p> Hugo Gonz ? lez and C ? sar Castro , both medallists at the World Junior Championships in Singapore this year , have been barred from racing at the European Short-Course Championships to be held in Israel from December 2 to 6 , according to Spanish media . <p> The reason why Spain wanted the boys of the blocks : international experience of racing some of the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on the Olympic team for Spain come March next year <p> The reason why LEN ( the European Swimming League ) says they ca n't be in Israel : the rules of the continental body are said to state that no boy under 17 and no girl under 15 may race in senior European waters ( general rules that state otherwise only come into force on January 1 , 2016 ) <p> LEN 's general event rules state the minimum age for boys as 15 . However , media reports the original at AS.com state that the European body has impeded the entry of the from Spain on the basis that they are not 17 . <p> Update : <p> The Executive Director of LEN , Paulo Frischknecht confirmed to SwimVortex that new rules do indeed reduced the age limit for boys in European racing to 15 . However , he noted that the LEN Technical Committee 's recommendation had been accepted by the ruling Bureau on March 7 this year and it came with a condition that the new rule would kick in on January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as FINA ( no age limits ) and does not admit 10 years olds . <p> The European body has received no protest from Spain nor any request to consider the potential entry of any athletes who do not comply with the current rule that sets an age limit of 17 for boys in senior European waters . Spain has representatives on the LEN Bureau and on the TSC of the European body . <p> FINA attaches a rider for new rules so that changes approved on a range of issues and by a range of committees come into force a set number of days after approval of the new rule . LEN works to the annual calendar , January 1 of any year the date when a number of changes made in the previous calendar year come into force regardless of the logic of making changes before a December showcase event . <p> Update ends <p> Any European rule reflects the views ( on age limits and all other matters ) of a much deeper body of people and nations that those who represent the continent via their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Europe not only has several of its key players in leading positions on the FINA Bureau ( the honorary secretary of global HQ , Paolo Barelli , is the president of LEN , as the prime example of many ) and on key policy making forums such as the Technical Swimming Committee , but has the heaviest presence and highest potential block vote within FINA when it comes to Congress , the " highest authority of FINA " under the international federation 's constitution . <p> Another at the heart of policies inconsistent is Soren Korbo , director of the Technical Commission of LEN and a member of the FINA body responsible for establishing the policies of both bodies . was one of the three men who nodded through the polyurethane Speedo LZR in 2008 , a trigger for 23 months of woe in the pool , the consequences of the shiny suits era spilling into every major events to this day and set to do so for some years to come yet . <p> The inconsistency of international rules on age limits delivers a stark contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sar Castro barred from racing at a European showcase in the little pool and a 10-year-old from Bahrain allowed to race at world titles this year . <p> Tareq about to make her debut at 10 by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The stench of politics and back scratching walked out on to the deck in Kazan in the form of Tareq , the innocent who might well be said to have been a pawn in a game of men much older than her . <p> Faced with having to justify her presence to a skeptical and critical media , Julio Maglione , president of FINA , said that the was there to " open swimming to the world and show that there are no limits for swimming . It helps that swimming is encouraged and save lives " . <p> 's ' no limits ' most certainly does not apply in many nations that are members of FINA , on a number of levels , in a number of ways . First up , there are limits to ages and more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good reason . <p> Then there is the 10-year-old from Bahrain : she can swim but she is not outstanding among age peers around the world ; she is female and hails from a region of the world to which FINA has turned time and again in recent years for hosting of events and funding of the conveyor belt of championships and cups galore at senior and junior level in all five Olympic disciplines under the FINA umbrella . <p> That Middle East region is also a place that has been and remains resistant to the notion that women swim , they show a fair bit of skin in their race suits , they pump weights and they are world-class athletes with the freedom to drive , vote and have as much say and clout in the world as their male counterparts . That picture is reflected in many of the policies of federations , in prizes money in swimming and more but is not reflected in the make-up of swimming governance , which remains largely a man 's world . <p> Many are the issues on which FINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics . TV commentators certainly saw through the appearance of a 10-year-old girl from Bahrain at world titles with the skill of folk asked to spot the sun at dawn on a blue-sky day from the top of the tallest hill . <p> The mouths on mikes appeared to disapprove . One leading international swimmer of the past and a key commentator on the sport noted : <p> " I was off playing football and doing all sorts of stuff at 10 ... this is no place for a 10-year-old " . <p> That view , shared far and wide , is one that many who set up the European rules barring the two young Spanish talents from action in Israel next month sign up to . " The decision of the international federation ... mmm ... " said another commentator . " That 's about politics , not sports . " <p> The real motivation of having a 10-year-old at world titles can not be known . What we can say is that there are connections in FINA world that link commercial work to voluntary work in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East . <p> For example , the USA 's FINA Vice-President Dale Neuburger is a TSE Consulting Partner . He steps out of votes when TSE is bidding for work with FINA , the conflict of interest obvious to him and everyone else in a place where he is earning money as a professional consultant while serving as a ' volunteer ' on a hefty per diem while on FINA duty . <p> Of the many policies swim federations , clubs , local councils , governments and relevant agencies around the world show there are ' no limits ' in swimming and stretch that to the ultimate ambition of saving lives through the promotion of swimming as a skill that every youngster should learn , the benefits of having a 10-year-old on the blocks in Bahrain are from making the list of best measures . <p> The arguments for having two world-class in Israel next month ( if Spain wants them there ) would appear , certainly in sporting terms , far stronger , say commentators in Spain today in the face of conflicting and contrasting policies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep talent from the calm waters of a short-course moment that would do no harm to youngsters who have known the lights of a global stage broadcast to millions around the world . <h> Comments <p> Linny November 1 , 2015 <p> I thought it was daft when Olympic silver medallist Gyurta ( as he was then ) was too young to compete at European Juniors the following year when he was 16 because of LEN 's minimum ages which applied equally to senior and junior events . <p> 16 would now be fine for a young man to compete at European Juniors and I had assumed that the recent change to the age bands for junior swimming in Europe had also reduced the lower age limit for senior LEN swimming events to match them ( as was the case before ) . <p> To keep them as they were for senior events seems very silly indeed . I ca n't see where their rules say this either ? I can only see the new minimum ages ie 14 for women and 15 for men . <p> November 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you imagine if swimmers such as Thorpe and Phelps were European when they were 15 .

To wait until the following January though to implement any change is labouring the point but if that was the decision then albeit that isthat was the decision albeit that is n't very clear now in November . <p> Linny November 1 , 2015 <p> Thank you Craig for clearing that particular bit up ! ! <p> November 2 , 2015 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the europeans ! <p> Astrid van Hest November 2 , 2015 <p> The Dutch federation is also on it as 16 year old also qualified this weekend !

 of this season 's USA Swimming Pro Series is shaping up to be an impressive one . With the Olympic year fast approaching and athletes looking to sharpen their skills ahead of the festivities in Rio de Janeiro next summer , a stacked field will gather at the University of Minnesota next week . Action for the first stop is slated for Nov. 12-14 . <p> More than 50 members of the USA National Team will be in attendance , including the likes of Olympic champions Michael Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Missy Franklin and Katie Ledecky . While the meet is frequently held in a short-course format , the impending Olympic year coaxed organizers to make the competition a long-course affair . <p> Surging toward his fifth Olympiad , Phelps will be racing for the first time since the United States Nationals at the end of the summer , where he notched a trio of No. 1 world-ranked times . The 22-time Olympic medalist finished the year with the fastest times in the world in the 100 butterfly , 200 fly and 200 individual medley . Each of those events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Coming off a World Championships in which she became the first athlete to win the 200 freestyle , 400 free , 800 free and 1500 free , Ledecky will provide a glimpse of where her training has taken her since Kazan . Meanwhile , Franklin will have the chance to put in additional long-course racing in preparation for defense of her Olympic crowns in the 100 backstroke and 200 backstroke . <p> Although the entry lists for the meet have not been released yet , the above mentioned athletes are expected to race full schedules , along with Lochte , who won a fourth consecutive world title in the 200 medley over the summer . Joining Lochte as an Olympic champion in action will be Tyler Clary and Allison Schmitt . Other big names expected to compete are Conor Dwyer , Caitlin Leverenz and Elizabeth Beisel.@@3742055 <p> Tens of thousands 
 Death Will ' Remain A Mystery ' In The Shadow of Olympian Heights <p> Qing Wenyi , as she appears in news coverage of her life and death in qq.com reports <p> The day after she died and the night before Qing Wenyi was cremated , teammates who had shared a life with her from 13 to 17 years of age and considered themselves as " sisters " joined the deceased swimmer 's mother on a shopping trip to buy the dress that the swimmer had dearly wanted but had never had the time to go and try on . <p> The reason given for a lack of autopsy in a death and circumstances that would almost certainly have triggered inquiry and a call to the coroner in many parts of the world was a parental request for no investigation to take place . What they wanted was a swift farewell to allow their daughter to rest in peace . Both parents work in the police service and described by Chinese media as " bright " metropolitan citizens . <p> Sources close to Chinese swimming have not only questioned whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of those playing a guardianship role in Qing 's life on an official national-team training camp in Beijing . Among those in the frame is the Chinese Swimming Association : not a single official word . <p> Swimming has come to expect the kind of silence we are treated to from the CSA and the international federation , FINA , when faced with controversy . Biut none of that will make the questions go away .

In Sydney , Krayzelburg won the double , in the and , while Peirsol claimed silver in the . <p> Aaron Peirsol by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> By the time Peirsol lined up in Athens 2004 , he had three world titles to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 2003 . In Athens , he won the title and then added the title but , for a short while , lost the crown : a turn judge said that the American had turned over on his front at the turn too early but that initial disqualification was almost immediately overturned when FINA could not interpret the judge 's scribble on the race DQ form . <p> When I asked Reese about the Texas Trio of Peirsol , Brendan Hanson and Ian Crocker in 2007 , he told me : <p> " Aaron is a technique genius , knowing more about his stroke than anyone I have been around . Brendan is the strongest physically , able to move a lot of weight in the weight room . Ian is the most explosive . His starts and turns are really amazing . Beyond all of that , they are fierce competitors , loving the race and hating to lose . " <p> That was days before Peirsol took the world record in the below for the first time . After lifting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of being a good swimmer as someone who is consistent over their whole career and that 's what I 'm trying to do . " <p> Consider that speed : it was 1964 when Alain , of France , dipped below on freestyle for the first time . Pablo Morales did the same on butterfly back in 1986 and it took , an easing of rules and nine years to get past him . It took shiny suits to get past Peirsol , and Peirsol stayed the course . His was a wonderous thing to watch , a height of technical efficiency . <p> By 2008 Peirsol had retained the world title twice , in 2005 and 2007 , the latter in a world record of 52.98 the first sub effort and the world crown in 2005 . In 2007 , for the first time in seven years , he lost a major race when defeated at the world championships by teammate Ryan Lochte , who also claimed the world record . <p> Aaron Peirsol by Patrick B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown to Lochte but retained the title . A year later in Rome , at the height of the shiny suits circus , Peirsol donned an arena X-Glide , the reply of his sponsor to the Speedo LZR Racer and FINA 's flip-flopping on the issue of suits , and became the first man ( in a suit now banned ) to crack when he lifted the world title . He had intended to swim on : in 2010 , he was working towards the world titles in 2011 as a springboard to 2012 . He won the Pan Pacs crown in August at home in Irvine , an appropriate moment to bow out , he may have thought . <p> Asked by by reporters about his speediest moments and records , Peirsol said : <p> " Every single one I can pretty much go back and tell you about ! So yes , I remember every one . I could tell you every time I 've broken a world record . I could tell you which ones felt good , and which ones did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which ones I was completely content with . It was always about trying to go a best time . For a while I was kind of alone by that I mean it took a while for some competition to show up . But gosh , it did and it shocked me , because it had been a while . But that helped me . I have started to look back on my career , and there have been various phases . But all you do is find little ways to get better , working harder or smarter , and move forward . " <p> He described that odd 2004 DQ at the Athens Games that was ruled in then out , the gold confirmed as " the most interesting and memorable moment from a meet I have had in my career " , while the question of suits and records and the ability to chase a clock when swimming in altered race conditions , elicited this response : <p> " Every year I find it a little bit more difficult , especially when I have had the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to figure out how I can keep going . The emphasis is always on trying to get better . I always feel I 'm capable of getting better , so I just go .

Kraemer <p> Go from the race he did but Peirsol is a swimmer for live , a man who will never leave the water , nor the water leave him . <p> Peirsol is a big campaigner for oceans , through such organisations as Oceana and became involved in developing his house in Costa Rica , where he likes to spend time by the beach , in the ocean , surfing and swimming part of his life for life . <p> In a feature by reporter Mike Gustafson , Peirsol once said : " The central constituent to myself , more or less , is the ocean . It always has been . It is why I started swimming . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I 'm done swimming in a pool , there are countless number of things that I can do in the water that do n't have to be me swimming over a black line . It 's a very narrow way for me to express my love for the water . When I get the time , I try to head down to Central America or to Orange County and get my fix , so to speak . " <p> Laid back , popular and now heading for the pantheon as one of the greats of backstroke , Peirsol set the standard for a decade . He was the man to beat , the leader of the pack , the king of back , a boy who answered a calling for the aquatic environment and emerged a sportsman of high achievement . Said Peirsol : <p> " I always felt like I was going to be pretty good . Maybe this is just that hard-headedness , but I always felt that I could race the guy ahead of me . When I was young , I always felt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now that I 'm old , I feel the biggest advantage I have is being old . " Win-win . <p> Peirsol possessed the Pilgrim Spirit , as described by Reese to me in 2007 : <p> " I do believe that every pilgrim , the first and the now , has a very strong competitive gene . If someone else can do it , we can too , and it 's all right if we work even harder than anyone ever has to accomplish it . Swimmers , and coaches , do n't worry about diminishing returns . " <p> Aaron Peirsol set for action in 2009 by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In 2010 , Peirsol had a tip to those who follow in his slipstream : " Make sure to love what you do . If you ca n't enjoy yourself , you wo n't last long . <p> " I ca n't tell anyone to love swimming . That 's person by person . But in life , just find what it is what you like to do .

 To November 23 Ends With Katie Ledecky Being Showered In Prizes <p> The following is a quick-fire wrap of the news and views from the past week in the world of swimming and related topics . <p> The past seven days witnessed the German national short-course championships in Wuppertal , where racing for titles doubled as selection trials for the European Short-Course Championships . Among those topping the bill were Florian Vogel , who cracked out the 3rd best free swim ever , Paul Biedermann , Marco Koch , Steffen Deibler and Dorothea Brandt ( links below ) . <p> In France at s/c nationals in Angers , swimmers wore black caps with the words Nec in the wake of the Paris terrorist attacks . In the water , Jeremy Stravius was the swimmer of the meet with several titles across a wide range of events ( links below ) . <p> Ledecky was the queen of ceremonies and prizes in Los Angeles , her top woman 's prize buoyed by three other honours : her part in the USA relay of the year , the women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race of the year ; and the part she plays in Bruce Gemmell 's third straight win in the coach of the year category . <p> Jordan Wilimovsky , courtesy of USA Swimming <p> There were also two awards for Jordan Wilimovsky , world marathon champion <p> More detail on the awards from John Lohn later in the day . Here are the main category winners : <h> S/C Yards Warning From Caeleb Dressel <p> Viewed as a future cog for USA Swimming on the international level , Caeleb Dressel put together a superb weekend of short-course competition while representing the University of Florida at the Ohio State Invitational . Best known for his prowess , the 19-year-old Dressel demonstrated his range for the Gators . <p> Racing in a short-course yards format , Dressel zoomed to a clocking of 18.77 in the 50 freestyle and went 42.02 in the 100 freestyle , as the leadoff of Florida 's winning 400 freestyle relay . Perhaps more impressive were his results in the 100 butterfly and 100 breaststroke , where he managed respective times of 45.01 and 51.88 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a little quicker than Dressel in the 100 free , as he touched the wall in 41.89 . Chadwick is a late bloomer in the sport and should find himself in the mix for a relay bid for the United States at next summer 's Olympic Trials . Before his night performance , Chadwick was clocked at 49.53 in the long-course version of the 100 free . <h> How Aussie Olympic champions fell out <p> Leisel Jones and Stephanie Rice , once best friends in the pool , fell out when the medley spied on what the breaststroke ace was eating so that she could report back to coaches on the want to the London 2012 Olympic games , according to Jones in her autobiography . The ' fat feud ' made headline Down Under this week past . <p> Rice , double medley champion at Beijing 2008 , became the " ringleader " of " hurtful " behaviour in 2012 said Jones , the breaststroke champion at the same Olympics . <p> Jones claims Rice was " bitching to my coaches and reported on what I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jones ' weight , clothes and the away she walked , according to the breaststroke ace now retired . <p> They say that 
 a prayer to the goddess of going the distance into uncharted waters , with coach Bruce Gemmell - main image by Patrick B. Kraemer ( inset by Craig Lord ) <p> Even before the Red Carpet walks for Sunday night 's Golden Goggles Awards started in Los Angeles , there was no mystery over who would be the star of the evening . Under the spotlight in the water , Katie Ledecky stood in the spotlight on stage , collecting three awards , including Female Athlete of the Year for the third consecutive time . <p> When Ledecky left the World Championships in Kazan with five gold medals , including individual titles in the 200 freestyle , 400 free , 800 free and 1500 free , it meant she would later be recognized during honors season . That was the case at the Golden Goggles , the annual event that celebrates the best in USA Swimming from the previous year . <p> " I 'm very honored to be up here , " Ledecky said . " Everybody brings something special to the team the coaches , the swimmers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit . I could thank so many people in this room for your support of USA Swimming and the USA Swimming Foundation . " <p> For Ledecky , the upcoming year has the chance to be epic . The teenager delayed her enrollment at Stanford University in order to focus on her Olympic preparation , the potential of three individual golds dangling in front of her . It 's almost impossible to see anyone toppling the American in the 400 freestyle and 800 freestyle , and as the reigning world champion in the 200 free , she 's obviously at the forefront of that discussion , too . <p> In addition to earning Female Swimmer of the Year accolades , Ledecky took home Female Race of the Year honors for her victory in the 200 free at the World Champs . The likelihood of Ledecky winning this category was high , as she was also nominated for her wins at Worlds in the 800 free and 1500 free , both of which arrived in world-record time . Haley Anderson was also nominated for her 10K open-water victory at the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a world record like the longer of her global crowns , Ledecky had to overcome a stellar field to prevail , with the shorter race also testing her speed . To earn that gold medal in Kazan , Ledecky had to overtake a field that included Missy Franklin , and Femke Heemskerk , among others . It was Ledecky 's fourth consecutive triumph in the category . <p> Another duel with the aforementioned ladies is likely for the 200 free , the event adding Sweden 's Sarah Sjostrom to the mix in Rio . Sjostrom bypassed the four-lapper at the World Champs , but ranked No. 1 in the world at 1:54.31 and has declared herself ready to tangle on the biggest of stages . An advantage for Ledecky this time around will be the lack of a 1500 freestyle prelim the day before , her energy seemingly preserved . <p> Ledecky 's final honor of the night was shared with Frankliin , Katie McLaughlin and Leah Smith . At Worlds , the foursome took home gold in the 800 freestyle relay , Ledecky anchoring the United States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Capital Swim Club , Bruce Gemmell , was named Coach of the Year for the third straight time . <p> Michael Phelps , by Peter Bick <p> Despite not racing at the World Championships , Michael Phelps ' show at the United States Nationals was enough to power him to Male Athlete of the Year recognition . Phelps notched three No. 1 global times at Nationals on the way to prevailing in the 100 butterfly , 200 fly and 200 individual medley . The performance was a suggestion that big things await in the Olympic year for a man who has already collected 22 medals in Olympic action , 18 of them gold . <p> " Thank you for nominating me for this , and I look forward to big things next summer for all of us , " Phelps said . <p> Reinvigorated by his return to the sport and having recently announced that fatherhood is around the corner , Phelps has said he is working as diligently as ever with coach Bob Bowman . That 's a scary thought for the greatest Olympian in history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Clos in the butterfly events . Never one to let anything go , do n't think for a second that Phelps is unmotivated by his defeat to Le Clos in the 200 fly at the 2012 London Games . More , Phelps is just one individual win away from another Olympic record , most solo medals in a career , the mark standing to Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina at 14 . <p> Phelps ' teammate , Allison Schmitt , was honored with the Perseverance Award for her strength in battling depression , a disorder she has spoken about publicly in order to try to help others who may deal with a similar issue . The reigning Olympic champion in the 200 freestyle , Schmitt won the 200 free over the summer at the Pan American Games . <p> Schmitt will be part of one of the most anticipated races at the American Trials , the 200 free figuring to be a sterling showdown with Ledecky and Franklin . Of course , only two will get to test themselves in the Rio waters , but all three could form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The nod for Male Race of the Year went to Jordan Wilimovsky , who bested the competition in the 10K open-water event at Worlds by more than 12 seconds . That gold handed Wilimovsky a berth to the 2016 Olympic Games and snapped a 10-year winless drought for the United States in the 10K at the World Championships . The effort also propelled Wilimovsky to the award for Breakout Performer of the Year . <p> " I 'd like to thank my coaches , teammates , the whole open water team at Worlds . You guys were awesome , " Wilimovsky said . " It 's super fun to go out there every year and represent the United States . " <h> Comments <p> Yozhik November 23 , 2015 <p> I salute those who chose Ledecky 's 200 race over her incredible achievements at 1500 and 800 world record races . Despite her best race of the last year 15:28 was beaten by 3 seconds and her 8:07 is still beyond comprehension the two days saga at 200 will come to the text books as an example of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know everything about her was originally sceptical about the idea of including this race in her WC program . Was very very cautious with prognosis calling her an underdog at this race . Was scared of embarrassment to see her completely emptied morning after semi race and being able to compete at final . Was childishly excited later at interview believing that there is nothing that can stop her . She 's swum this race perfectly and at the end there was n't even a celebration as we saw it when she broke 4 minutes first time or set 800 historical record . She either was entirely exhausted giving everything to this race with no emotions left or her look said " you gave me a chance , I took it . More serious challenge is ahead " <h> Jericho Oil continues 
 a FINA star who has got no stripes for good behaviour of late - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> China and FINA escaped being named as non-compliant with Authority regulations because the independent Compliance Review Committee set up as part of the watchdog 's clampdown on cheats was asked to focus only on matters pertaining to the revised WADA Code introduced on the 1st of January 2015 . <p> After WADA published a list of non-compliant nations and others served with warnings , questioned how China could have been compliant given the events of 2014 . WADA 's response noted that the past is not forgotten and that the authority remains watchful of " the shortcomings of signatories in managing results management procedures , pursuing cases properly , and the poor message it sent to clean athletes " . <p> It was May 17 last year when Sun Yang , the Olympic 400 and freestyle champion , tested positive for a banned heart stimulant . It was late November when a short report from Xinhua revealed that the swimmer had served , in secret , a three-month retrospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , Sun served no time out , having swum on through the summer and then having raced to three gold medals at the Asian Games in Incheon . <p> It was November 30 when highlighted the presence of Dr Ba Zhen , served a one-year suspension from May 2014 for his part in Sun 's positive test , on the deck working with Sun with the full knowledge and acceptance of the Chinese Swimming Association ( CSA ) , a member of FINA with a representative on the ruling Bureau , during the Asian Games in September . <p> On March 25 this year , FINA finally replied to a string of questions stating : <p> " After our check , Dr. Ba Zhen has not been accredited to this competition through the Chinese Team present in the Asian Games . " <p> Apart from the fact that it was inconceivable for Dr Ba Zhen , a member of the medical staff for China at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games , to have travelled to the Asian Games to work with Sun Yang without the permission of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely irrelevant to whether he should have been there at all working with Sun during the period of his own suspension from sport . <p> FINA in focus : Julio Maglione , top right , is the latest in a line of federation presidents going back to George Hearn in 1908 <p> out that to FINA and noted that a second penalty ought to be served on any who break the terms of their original suspension under the WADA Code and FINA anti-doping rules . <p> It was May 8 when FINA announced : " Following the anti-doping violation of swimmer Sun Yang ( CHN ) and consequent sanction to the swimmer and to his doctor Ba Zhen , the China Swimming Association has decided to recount the suspension period of this physician . <p> " Initially suspended from May 17 , 2014 to May 16 , 2015 . Dr. Ba Zhen has violated DC Rule 10.10 ( status during ineligibility ) , by travelling on a private basis to the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon ( KOR ) and by helping to rehabilitate his athlete during that competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Chinese National Swimming Team officials . <p> " Therefore , Dr. Ba Zhen is sanctioned with a new suspension period , this time from September 28 , 2014 to September 27 , 2015 . " <p> " You can not condemn the stars just because they had a minor incident with doping . " <p> In response to our questions to WADA this week , spokesman Ben Nichols said : <p> " We are alert to the issues you raise , and stated on record our dissatisfaction that process was not consistently followed by signatories involved at the time of these incidents . <p> " We were very disappointed by the shortcomings of signatories in managing results management procedures , pursuing cases properly , and the poor message it sent to clean athletes . We took all appropriate steps required to pursue sanctions , and their enforcement . " <p> He added that " the work of the independent Compliance Review Committee focuses on compliance matters as they pertain to the revised World Anti-Doping Code introduced on 1 January 2015 . All incidents are monitored according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not forgotten , however , Nichols noting : <p> " Should there be incidents under the former rules , WADA will use its right of appeal and other powers as appropriate . And should there be an issue of non-compliance , which has not been remedied , it will be referred to the Compliance Review Committee . We continue to scrutinize these matters closely . " <p> In the wake of the WADA IC report , FINA moved doping samples away from the Moscow laboratory at the heart of the crisis , after having ignored warnings much earlier in the that some samples pertaining to swimming were among more than 1,400 samples destroyed at the Moscow unit before WADA inspectors arrived to investigate allegations of wrongdoing . <p> FINA 's samples are now in Barcelona for long-term storage and possible retesting which may happen in the future outwith FINA 's jurisdiction . <h> Political Pressure <p> Meanwhile , WADA has itself come under pressure of late by some who have sought to question its authority as the tidal wave of reaction and response to the Independent Commission report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well beyond the world of sport . <p> The International Olympic Committee has expressed a wish to see WADA take over global testing from sports federations that are perceived by some of the key stakeholders as untrustworthy . <p> WADA is considering its position on global testing , the need to be and be perceived to be independent paramount . Some in the IOC would like WADA to be brought back into the Olympic Movement 's HQ in Lausanne but any such move would be seen as retrograde to attempts to have WADA be evermore distant from those who run the sport and have often been seen to be reluctant to come down hard on cheats , while failing to deal with skeletons in a cupboard rattling with rogue results . <h> Death Threats In The Poisonous Mix <p> Death threats , swapping of Russian urine samples , 3,000 Moscow lab samples that did not get analysed even when ' results ' were announced as ' negative ' : some of the things raised in Chapter 16 of the WADA IC Report connected to the Lausanne Laboratory and Russian track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 24 Heures newspaper to give his side of the story . Here is what he said on the death threat he received in 2009 : <p> " I received an anonymous email from Russia saying : ' You know how we deal with justice in Switzerland . Go ask the family of the air traffic controller , involved in the ? berlingen crash* what she thinks ' . It does not make me happy to talk about it because I do not want to put pressure on my staff . " <p> He claimed that such things had been a part of the picture since 2007 in his experience , with intimidation present in the lead-up to Beijing 2008 . <p> said : " Based on blood tests , we were able to prove that there was a difference in DNA samples . It concerned potential medallists at the 2008 Olympics . " The athletes in question were Darya , discus thrower and a silver medalist from London 2012 who tested positive for steroids along the way Tatyana Tomashova ( bronze medallist in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Saugy claims that all in anti-doping knew about the Russian threats . <p> Of the 67 samples the Lausanne lab is said to have destroyed , none were earmarked for long-term storage as WADA 's IC suggests , according to Saugy . <p> *- in 2002 , two planes , one carrying mainly Russian children , crashed into each other close to the Swiss border with Germany , causing 71 casualties .

 treasury grew by three more solo Spanish short-course titles , over 200 butterfly and 400 medley , in Gijon today , while Jessica Vall joined her in the club of Spaniards in the season world top 10 with a 2:21 win over 200 breaststroke and Konrad Czerniak , of Poland entered the best 10 this season over freestyle and cracked out a butterfly relay split that was even faster than his 21.47 freestyle win . <p> A 2:06.32 win in the butterfly for Belmonte , the European long-course and World s/c champion , was followed by a 4:33.14 triumph in the medley in which she is world champion and record holder in the little pool . Later in the day she tested 4 mins over freestyle . <p> Solid workaday efforts . A season out of top racing as a precautionary measure in the face of shoulder injuries was just what the doctor ordered for coach Fred 's Barcelona and Sierra Nevada-based charge . <p> In the butterfly , Belmonte kept at bay a 2:07.40 from Spain-based Katherine Mills and a 2:08.34 from the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin 2014 European titles , Judit Ignacio . <p> A short rest later , Belmonte was back at the helm in the long medley doing what was needed to take the crown in 4:33.14 ahead of Africa Zamorano , and Jimena Perez , on 4:37.57 . <p> In the evening session , a 4:00.80 was good for a third gold on the day for Belmonte in the freestyle ahead of 2013 world championships silver medallist Melani Costa , on 4:03.44 . The bronze went to Maria Vilas Vidal in 4:07.52 . <p> Costa was back for a second silver soon after , on 2:06.75 in the backstroke , the crown to Duane da Rocha in 2:05.90 , bronze to Africa Zamorano in 2:07.37 . <p> In other action , there was a championship record for Carlos Peralta in the butterfly , his 1:53.34 leaving him well ahead of a 1:57.20 from Joan Pons Ramon for silver and a 1:59.35 from Javier Rivas Gallego . <p> In to 3:43.38 , Joan Casanovas pipped Sabadell teammate Marc Sanchez for the freestyle crown , the bronze to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on 3:47.04 . <p> A tight tussle in the breaststroke final ended with a 2:11.71 victory for Mario Cortes over a 2:11.88 from Joan Ballester Puig . The bronze was close : 16-year-old Hugo Gonzalez . <p> There was also 25.10 win for Fatima Gallardo in the freestyle . <p> The morning session ended with victory for Sabadell over Real Canoe in the men 's 4 ? 50 medley relay , the battle starting with world top 10 backstroke efforts from Ashwin Wildeboer ( 23.89 ) and Miguel Ortiz ( 23.99 ) , an interesting aspect of the Sabadell relay a 21.35 on butterfly from Poland 's Konrad Czerniak that beat all freestyle splits in the final . Sabadell took the crown 1:35.43 to 1:35.95 , the bronze to San Andreu in 1:38.88 . <p> If no-one else in the relay could match Czerniak 's ' fly speed on freestyle , neither could Czerniak himself later in the day when he clocked 21.47 for victory in the freestyle dash final for the win and No9 on the season world rankings . The podium was completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21.85 and 21.94 respectively . <p> In that evening session , Marc Sanchez and Joan Pons Roman battled for top honours in the medley and both emerged with a world top 20 rankings , Sanchez the champion in 4:10.09 , Pons Roman on , the battle for bronze won by Alan Cabello in 4:14.20 over a 4:14.29 from 200 ' fly winner Carlos Peralta . <p> Sant Andreu 's women took the short medley relay crown in 1:51.01 in the morning session , that win granting Vall a second gold on the day and Zamorano a second podium visit . Next home was the Sabadell quartet on 1:51.12 , Ignacio picking up a second medal , and Belmonte claiming a third medal as a member of the UCAM squad , on 1:52.09 . <p> Sabadell 's women later claimed the 4x200m freestyle crown in at the end of the evening session , courtesy of Fatima Gallardo , Sandra , Erika and Judit Ignacio. <h> Some parishioners eye 
 Say ' Nein ' To Olympics At A Time When Sports ' Image Is In Tatters <p> The Olympic park that will never be Architekten von Gerkan , Marg und Partner - gmp <p> Editorial <p> It is not a case of good for the burgers of Hamburg nor shame on them either . Hosting the Olympic Games brings benefits and comes at a price , too . Democracy has spoken and the burgers of the Hanseatic Port have spoken : no , we do n't want the Olympic Games . It was close : 51.6 per cent of those who voted won the day and Rome , Paris , Budapest and Los Angeles will proceed with their own plans knowing that the bid that would have been most closely linked to Olympic boss Thomas Bach no longer stands in the way . <p> Bach hails from a nation that did not give its citizens a vote when it came to such things as the Euro but Hamburg , conscious of the vast amounts of money that would have to be spent on hosting the sporting festival , let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nods to many reasons , economic , strategic , issues of security and a general feeling that this is no time for sporting largesse . <p> Two of the first casualties of the WADA IC report : Lamine Diack , left , and Grigory Rodchenkov <p> The Hamburg vote came at just about the worst of all moments if you happened to be one of those who did want to see the Games hosted in Hamburg : <p> There 's the billions in the budget going to the headline knocking all others for six across Europe this season the moment being allocated to help those fleeing war zones and oppression beyond Europe 's borders ; and while Germany and Hamburg receive thousands a day , Hungary and Budapest , that other Olympic bid city and nation , refuse them . Choices , choices . <p> There 's the watershed moment unfolding in sport FIFA and the IAAF in the full glare of global publicity : the rug that has for so long been hiding bad habit , the largesse of the sporting and the blind eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lifted not a finger to do anything about the bad apples in their midst for fear of being dumped on the compost with the entire system propping up the rot . Sebastian Coe is not Lamine Diack but that he should not fully accept the conflict of interest inherent in leading track and field while being in the pay of Nike , and that even when bowing to pressure and confining the conflict to the past , is an indication of how the mindset of those who run sport is at odds with many in the wider world and working under different codes . <p> There 's the ARD documentary ( and the WADA IC report it triggered ) , one that the burgers of Hamburg will have been acutely aware of given the publicity the who affair and subsequent WADA Commission report has generated , starting with revelations in their own language a quarter of a century after the fall of the Berlin Wall that unlocked the key to the Stasi chamber of secrets . The work of the ARD served as the gloves that knocked the stuffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the athlete named as the deceiver to the folk previously in the shadows moving the pieces on the chess board and now exposed to the light , folk in blazers , in white coats and at the very helm of the anti-doping process fighting the good fight in public ( and being paid to do so ) while in private facilitating the very cheating they are supposed to be preventing . <p> There 's this : great sport and the work of clean athletes , coaches and others in programs far and wide around the world remains but the trust in the people who run the show , the systems that keep them in power decade after decade come hell or high water ( and much of that of their own making ) has withered on the vine . In general and regardless of the good intentions and work at the heart of sport on many levels there is a widely held perception that those who run sport are in it for themselves , on the make , on the take ( even at petty levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to what they 've got . <p> Then there 's the divide : the wider world talks of climate change ; green energy ; how to deal with terrorists and others out to turn a flamethrower on democracy and capitalism and anything else that is not the thing they want ; the crisis of vast populations on the move away from the lives that can not sustain them ; where the food for our children 's children will come from ; and much more , sport has continued on its merry way , expecting hosts and sponsors to fund its passage , complete with first-class flights , five-star hotels , limos and the rest of a lifestyle . <p> Andrew Jennings <p> The Hamburg 2024 anti campaign 's focus <p> Raise the red flag in any discussion on the system of volunteers and per diems at the heart of self-perpetuating global sporting structures and you will be regarded as ' the enemy within ' ; and once out you will be portrayed as the sore grape who lost a perk and does n't know where to find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist who exposed wrongdoing at the heart of the International Olympic Committee and now FIFA and the IAAF , are treated as pariahs by those who run sport and would rather not have him poking around in their closets . <p> Given what has unfolded in the those two realms alone , IOC and FIFA , Jennings ought by now to have been nominated for prizes galore not by peers but by the folk who 's houses are now being cleaned up thanks to what he found under their rugs . Arise Sir Andrew for you had it right all along : in the midst of structures designed never to question themselves was a den of thieves . <p> Vitaliy Stepanov ARD <p> In a parallel world , astonishing to read in a report from David Walsh in The Sunday Times this weekend past that the Stepanovs at the heart of the whistle-blowing that exposed wrong-doing at the helm and heart of Russian sport have not heard a single word from Sir Craig Reedie , head of WADA . He has found time to email the Russian regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' but has found no time at all to contact the courageous folk who exposed the great lie in sport ( and that not only in Russia ) . No time , Sir Craig , to contact the very folk who made your latest thrust for clean sport possible ? No time to offer them support in their campaign to have the truth known so that track and field and the young folk working in it can enjoy a better day ? Really ? Hopefully David Walsh has got it wrong ... unlikely , though , given that a certain Lance Armstrong said that about him for quite some time and it turned out the reporter in question and several others , like Paul Kimmage , was right all along . <p> " Yuliya Stepanova started working for Wada three years ago . Now she lives in Germany and as far as we know is waiting for a Canadian residence permit . I always try to think well of people but there is a term ' stool pigeon ' in the anti-doping code . <p> " Mrs Stepanova assures us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own initiative . But can you imagine a person spending their own money to purchase cutting-edge eavesdropping and video surveillance equipment which can be stealthily planted into a ladies handbag or any other personal belonging ? " <p> And so on , as you might expect from a blazer from the political world who would rather speak ill of the teller of truth than face the truth and do something about it . <p> Walsh continues : The Stepanovs are not living in Germany . They are not awaiting residence permits from Canada , nor have they applied . Their only " cutting-edge eavesdropping and surveillance equipment " was a smart phone . Wada did not pay them , nor prepare them . Vitaliy regrets that no one at Wada suggested he tape conversations when he first went to them . <p> There is one conversation he would love to have recorded . An occasion when Sergey Portugalov , the chief medical officer , boasted about the gold medallists he 'd created across a range of Olympic sports . " <p> The athletes under Portugalov 's ' care ' included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultation with a doctor who has served on the medical commissions of the European Swimming League and Russian Swimming Federation of late . <p> LEN has stated that it will make no statement on Portugalov . Why would it want to change a tradition . FINA has spent a great while now failing to answer legitimate questions , for reasons best know to itself and the silence in situations that demand the voices of the guardians of youth in sport to be heard stretches far and wide . <p> Qing Wenyi , as she appears in news coverage of her life and death in qq.com reports <p> Asked if doping could ever be eradicated , Kayser states : " Never . Rather than drive doping underground , the use of drugs should be permitted under medical supervision . <p> That way you 'd avoid the current Tour de France situation where the skepticism keeps coming ... the legalisation of drug use in sport might even have advantages . The boundary between the therapeutic and performance-enhancing use of drugs is blurred at present . Anti-doping rules often lead to complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken by athletes are legitimate therapeutic agents or illicit . " <p> " Legalisation could encourage the more sensible , informed use of drugs in amateur sport , leading to a decline in the health problems associated . Medically-supervised doping could offer a clearer view of what is and is n't dangerous . " <p> And on and on , the intellect of the man failing to stretch to an understanding that in many situations , it has not been and is not a question of older athletes taking a decision to use medicines designed and developed for extremely sick people to enhance their performance in sport under medical supervision ; and an intellect failing to look back at the woeful history of the controlled environment at the heart of the Sporting Crime of the 20th Century , namely the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 . Control = abuse = health problems galore , sex-change operations , a hefty rate of miscarriages and the birth of disabled children that some experts put down to the cocktail of a controlled environment . <h> The Or Hypocritical Oath ? <p> Ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what way does the administration of medicines developed for the sick and needy ( and in many situations not available to those people ) to healthy sports people so they can get one over on another healthy peer under the same perverse version of a level playing field square with the thing doctors sign up to , including the NB in brackets my notes : <p> I swear to fulfill , to the best of my ability and judgment , this covenant : <p> I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those physicians in whose steps I walk , and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow <p> NB : which would include every doctor working with athletes in elite sport sharing precisely information on all the banned substances and methods being used to enhance sporting performance , so that all athletes and all teams would work to a level doped playing field ? As if . A new line would have to be set for what form of doping was allowable ; and guess what , cheats would try to cross it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sporting realm to one that obliged competitors to dope if success is what they had in mind . <p> I will apply , for the benefit of the sick , all measures which are required , avoiding those twin traps of overtreatment and therapeutic nihilism . <p> NB : gosh , well given that elite athletes are not sick , this point is impossible to square <p> I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science , and that warmth , sympathy , and understanding may outweigh the surgeon 's knife or the chemist 's drug . <p> NB : when Dr Lothar Kipke was ' controlling and supervising ' the administration of doping to under-age athletes for man a long year while serving on the FINA medical committee , he was reported to Stasi overlords by his Stasi watcher as a man who delighted in ramming the needles into the backsides of his victims ' aggressively ' . The Stasi those nice , decent folk intervened to ask him to tone it down . For Kayser 's benefit here is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doping trials in 1999 , Kipke on the stand and on his way to a criminal conviction : <p> " The accused was satisfied . ' The president is probably right , ' said Lothar Kipke after the 22nd Criminal Court of Berlin had found guilty ... of assault in 58 cases . Asked if he felt remorse , Kipe said : " I have told you that I 'm sorry , if something has happened , but you have to know the full story . " ... Of the significant side effects on the swimmers and the medical claims that have unfolded in the course of the years , he says : " We were told nothing by the researchers and by the industry " . <p> NB : Stasi documents have proven that that was a complete lie . The warnings were constant and Kipke was among those who was kept informed and sat in on meetings at which the topic of side-effects was clearly discussed at length . <p> Michael Lehner , representative of the five plaintiffs , did not want a settlement for " he ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welfare was of no concern to him at all ... he knows exactly what he did to the girls " . <p> NB : the report goes on to describe the witness testament , among man similar , of a former swimmer who appeared in court with her young son , who club feet swung under the bench as he listened to the past that dictated his future . Judge Peter Faust called Kipke 's offence " particularly despicable because it was committed secretly against children and youth " . <p> I will respect the privacy of my patients , for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know . Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death . If it is given me to save a life , all thanks . But it may also be within my power to take a life ; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humility and awareness of my own frailty . Above all , I must not play at God . <p> NB : nor play at God in sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never in the minds of those who drew up the Oath . <p> I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart , a cancerous growth , but a sick human being , whose illness may affect the person 's family and economic stability . My responsibility includes these related problems , if I am to care adequately for the sick . <p> NB : a world a million lies away from sporting performance . <p> I will prevent disease whenever I can , for prevention is preferable to cure . <p> NB : how would that square with the risk of side-effects that would render sick the very healthy ? <p> I will remember that I remain a member of society , with special obligations to all my fellow human beings , those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm NB : precisely impossible when doping one athlete to beat another and convincing parents hand on heart that all will be well would a form be required like those the doctor hands out shortly before an operation removing certain liabilities in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : cast your eye down the banned substances list and it is not long before you conclude that therein are many substances that carry distinct risk to the taker , that risk worth taking in the case of a patient trying to fight cancer , blood clots and various other serious ailments but surely not worth taking at all , ever , in the case of an entirely healthy athlete who can compete and win without recourse to any such harm ? <p> Meanwhile , while some sports fans are able to look the other way yet and focus instead on the thing it is all about athletic performance the burgers of the wider world are sick to the back teeth of hearing not only about the corruption at FIFA , the IAAF and elsewhere , but are resigned to the notion that the corruption of sport and the tolerance of that stretch all the way to doping , the abuse of young people who know not what is being done to them and the abuse of faith by older athletes ( and those who help them ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others as they chase the money and fame at all costs . <p> Sport has enjoyed an autonomous status for many decades , national governments in many countries staying at arm 's length , supposedly , and letting those who run sport get on with it . There are good arguments in favour of such a set up . Reality has proved it all a falsehood and unsustainable to boot . <p> Russia is a prime example right now : a powerful state government using its money and influence in the weightiest ways at the heart of sports governance , from the IOC downwards . <p> WADA , as the reference to Sir Craig in David Walsh 's report suggests , is far from being all hero , no issue . And yet , in these early days beyond the watershed moment of a WADA commission ( independent or otherwise ) report that pulled few punches , the World Anti-Doping Agency looks like a far more acceptable home for global anti-doping testing than the current domicile of domestic and international federations stacked with folk whose interests rattle to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask signatories to the WADA Code to comply and it has exercised that power . When we consider ' vested interests ' , the more pertinent questions at this juncture in the development of world sport are those to be directed at the IAAF and the IOC : can it really be right that organisations under a very dark cloud , as the IAAF is , should be the ones to say whether Russia runs in Rio ? And is the IOC truly going to keep that mechanism in place knowing what it knows ? <p> Vested interests often means the very same web of people who govern in Olympic , track , swimming and other sporting circles : they move as one and often speak as one , too , on message all the while , those in the club protecting each other up until the very door of ' corruption extremely likely to be proved so let 's drop this one like a hot potato and pretend we were never friends ' . <p> Power and money on two legs . The entire system of Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is established on a foundation of universality at arms length from mainstream politics so that a world at war may still come together in common spirit and compete . Some very pleasant ambitions in the Olympic Charter ( and many of them treated to the turn of a blind eye , too ) . <p> There is much that is undemocratic in the structure , too , the autonomy ( noted in the Charter and sports constitutions far and wide ) of sport often used as an excuse to say ' we run the show and we 're not open to review and do not have to heed your criticism if we do n't want , even when things are proven to be truly unpalatable and even when our key stakeholders , those folk we represent tell us they 'd like a review ' , so to speak . <p> At this juncture in the development of sport and what it means to societies and where it all fits in our socio-economic structures , we are presented with massive fraud , corruption , deceit and wrong-doing on a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being turned on WADA in the wake of its report . Watch for it . <h> Police The Police But Keep Your Eye On The Thief <p> It is right to police the police ( WADA also needs truly independent observation , checks and balances ) but none of that should avert the gaze from the rot at the heart of world sport . That investigation by WADA happened to focus on one sport and one nation in particular was a matter of circumstance and the loudest evidence but the authors of the report were keen to point out that many other sports and other nations have a problem , too . <p> Time for the world of wider politics and national laws to join the dots and make their minds up : do they want what Kaser above wants or do they want clean sport and a price the likes of the burgers of Hamburg are prepared to pay for ? <p> Many believe it is entirely unrealistic to expect the woes of Russian sport , stretching to the unpalatable views of the nation 's sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted FINA 's top honour in October 2014 , to be resolved in any concrete way by next August , so deep do the roots of wrong reach . <p> Dick Pound , meantime , was not asked to point out the flaws in the organisation he once led and is intrinsically linked to ... he and his panel and investigators were asked to look into the allegations of massive fraud in Russia and the outcome is there for all to see . There are those who would now love to turn the issue into ' well what about WADA ' if only to take the eye off the network of deceit that has been uncovered and is yet to be fully revealed . <p> WADA should also be open to review but for any at international federations to now suggest such review and even restructure at the anti-doping body ( doubtless aimed at bringing those reporting wrongdoing back on message ) when they themselves have resisted any such scrutiny for decades is the height of hypocrisy . <p> The decision of the burgers of Hamburg will be put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would rather look at it in the most convenient way possible . In fact , Olympic bosses would do well dust down Thomas Bach 's 2020 vision the document setting out a brighter future for the Movement and conclude : you know what , this does n't even scratch the surface when it comes to the kind of reform required . <p> Per diems for volunteers is often a theme treated as trivial by those in the know . Yet for the citizen tightening his belt and working on an average family wage in Germany , it is surely legitimate for such people to ask how it can be that a ' volunteer ' manages to take over 150 ( and much more ) days a year away from their job on ' federation duty ' , receive to a day for doing so while incurring no costs whatsoever and while finding him or herself in the very environment in which he and she makes his living ( that job that has supposedly been left behind at home ) . The citizen may also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared as an income just like all that I earn from working hard is declared and taxed ? <p> Different rules for different people ? It seems so . Time for the private sports club to be folded and the word autonomy to be burned on the bonfire of vanities that some in the ranks of the have all too often used to twist meaning with a view to self-preservation . <p> Time for those sitting on committees and commissions at the heart of the malaise to do the decent thing : working for a better day does not simply making a quiet point in camera while knowing that there 's a high chance your point will never see the light of day if a few men think it inconvenient ; it means getting the message out to the membership and demanding action in their behalf . <p> Sport belongs to the world just as swimming belongs to swimmers . Sport is a multi-billion dollar industry . It should answer to the same rules and laws as all others in business and finance , with watchdogs in place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comments <p> Felix Sanchez November 30 , 2015 <p> Craig , as an expert on Germany , do you think the recent wave of terrorism in Europe has been enough to make a 1.6% difference to the vote ? <p> Craig Lord November 30 , 2015 <p> I would say a touch but no idea about by how much . It is hard to tell what tens of 1000s are thinking , of course , at any one unmeasured time . The Paris attacks were barely mentioned in coverage of the issue in Germany today . I would think the majority think of financial issues and the effect on the city and whether that 's worth it ... and praying on their minds will be a host of current topics , immigration , the tarnished image of sport and security all in the mix .

 : How A Boy Of The Faroes With A Dream Became A Man In Fast 1500 Waters <p> Book Review : The Pal Effect by Rod Gilmour , published by Chequered Flag <p> The Pal Effect starts with the shipping forecast as broadcast each dawn by the BBC before the Today programme delivers the new of the day done and the one to come . Author Rod Gilmour uses the line to demonstrate the remoteness of recognition attached to The Faroes but in doing so also , intended or not , highlights the nature of life as an elite freestyle swimmer . <p> There is discipline , regularity , consistency , be the weather inclement or not , metaphorically speaking . The forecast is there to be relied on , clockwork , a daily must . It saves lives . Racing 30 laps in a long-course pool does n't but there 's metronomic measure in the mix as reliable as the weather warning to all those sailors out there on the wave , as reliable as that Atlantic current head strong and the northern lights that brightly glow but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's night " , as the Faroese poet Poul Joensen ( 1898-1970 ) once wrote . <p> Pal Joensen is a distant relative and a world-class man who has stood on European podiums long and short and the world short-course dais , too . He has the same number of Islands Championship gold medals in the pool as Michael Phelps has Olympic medals : 22 . <p> The Pal does not take long to read and reading it is time well spent . It charts the tale of a young man with a dream of racing for his country in Olympic waters . Pal Joensen made it to the Olympics in Danish colours , the IOC yet to grant the Faroes the same autonomous status as it enjoys in paralympic swimming . Both The Faroes and Denmark would be happy to see the small island granted its wish . Until that happens , Joensen races for Denmark once every four years , his place at the next Games reliant on the season ahead after the disturbing vents of the Kazan 2015 World titles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European short-course Championships in Netanya , Israel at a time when his sights are set on his goal since 2012 : for the past four years , Joensen has lived with his wife Malan in Copenhagen , in pursuit of a berth at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . <p> The Pal Effect reveals the mindset of a man on a mission . As the swimmer tells Gilmour of his life less ordinary : <p> " I do n't do as everyone else . Instead I invested a lot of my time in something I was counting on might benefit my future . " <p> As it turned out , it will benefit more than Joensen 's future : in 2010 when he claimed silver in the freestyle at the European l/c Championships in Budapest , I concluded my report of the race , as cited by Gilmour , with the words : <p> " Faroe Islands , build that man a pool and name it after him . " <p> They did : five years on , Pal 's Pool is built and many a generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story is a pleasant read with several anecdotes and happenings that may well be new to the swimming reader , let along the wider audience . <p> Of several favourite moments of mine are these three : <p> 1 . Towards the end of chapter four , about life on the road to London 2012 , Joensen talks about his relationship with Alex Dale Oen , the Norwegian 2011 world breaststroke champion who died suddenly early in Olympic year when preparing for the big moment at Flagstaff in the United States . <p> Dale Oen befriended Joensen when the man of the Faroes felt a little lost while cutting his teeth on international tour early in his career . Says Joensen : <p> " We had a bond . He used to travel alone to events as well and I was pretty much lost when it came to international meets in the early days . International swimming is just a big club of people and I have tried to have fun with it as each year has passed . Alex was open . He would sit with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it was because he saw me as someone who was also from a small country . " <p> Alex Dale Oen ( NOR ) Courtesy : Arena <p> In the course of their friendship , Dale Oen related a tale he once told to a journalist who had asked him how it was possible for a swimmer from a small nation to become the best in the world . The answer " The Frog Story . <p> The tale of a " bunch of frogs who organised a running competition " follows . The goal was the top of a very tall tower . The crowd kept shouting ' way too difficult ' ; ' the tower 's too high ' and the like . One by one the frogs fell away from the challenge . Not one little frog : he carried on , right to the top . His secret ? " He was deaf " . <p> Joensen , too , refused to listen to those who thought his dream on a small island was the stuff of pipe . He made it to London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained deaf to any negativity about his ambition to race in Rio . <p> 2 . The telling of how Pal 's Pool got built and how they raised the funds for it that one you can read in the book . <p> 3 . The last chapter of the book , penned with a northern pace by Malan Joensen , Pal 's wife , and entitled " We do n't tend to brag in the Faroes . She concludes : <p> " We do not know whet the future holds for us but moving back home has always been a part of the plan for the future . Until then , we enjoy life here in Copenhagen and hold the Faroe Islands close to our heart . " <p> The future is indeed unknown but should it pan out that way , Pal and Malan will have some tales to tell their children and grandchildren on those snowy nights around the fire sometime when . <p> " When in foreign lands keep in mind your little home In sun as well as dressed in snow " Poul @ <p> Unfortunately he took

 Adam Peaty rises to his blocks for the breaststroke final this evening at the Wingate Pool in Netanya , he will carry more than the weight of work in his arms . This has been a season of plenty for the man coached at City of Derby by Mel Marshall . <p> Only Mitch Larkin , with a soaring backstroke season in the bag , has a stake alongside him in the race for male swimmer of the year and then , perhaps , only among those who rate short-course as a twin not a younger sibling of the Olympic pool . <p> FINA counted Sun Yang* above both those men and Florent Manaudou , too , in Kazan , a folly of a points system that fails to reflect the worth and weight of achievement in any given season . <p> Peaty enters the final this evening knowing that he has the stuff of shoving tractor tyres across playgrounds in his challenge , as well as an ' easy ' week behind him in terms of what he would have been up to had Marshall had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Derby . The balance of speed is with Peaty , the more ' rested ' finishing pace with Marco Koch ( GER ) , perhaps , going off his last two laps to a flat world-record rattler in the . <p> Victory is what peaty always wants and gold would certainly buff up the shine on a terrific year . Triumph will not be required to alter his claim to Male Swimmer of the Year , however . That job was completed back in August , as it was for Katie Ledecky , the only candidate for Woman swimmer of the year and Swimmer of the Year to boot in the eyes or many in the sport . <p> The coming week will provide readers with a chance to vote in out Annual Awards with some prizes in the mix this time round . <p> On a lifetime best of 27.39 over backstroke at the start of this Olympic cycle , Katinka Hosszu ( HUN ) axed that back to 25.96 within two years to the world s/c titles a year ago . This morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Urbanczyk ( POL ) was closest in 26.88 , with Katarina ( SVK ) on 26.92 and last inside 27 on 26.95 Aleksandra ( BLR ) . <p> Similar tale in the freestyle : 1:51.18 is Hosszu 's high , from world titles a year ago , two years after a lifetime best of 1:53.57 at the start of a new chapter in her career , a 1:57.44 from 2010 having been her previous best . This morning she clocked 1:53.39 to edge ahead of Femke Heemskerk 's 1:53.49 pace-setter from a previous round , the Dutch challenger second through ahead of Federica Pellegrini ( ITA ) , on 1:54.59 in the lane next to Hosszu . Closest to the top three were Russians Veronika Popova , 1:55.19 , and Viktoriya Andreeva , 1:55.74 , with Robin Neumann ( NED ) last inside 1:56 , on 1:55.76 .

Her world s/c record of 2:01.86 compares to a next best ever of 2:04.86 . <p> Three finals an a semi ahead of her , Hosszu , if she is to have any company at all in the 200IM , will meet her closest rival in Siobhan-Marie O'Connor this evening , the Commonwealth champion for England last year on 2:07.92 this morning and possibly the only one in the final who might surpass Hosszu 's heats time . <p> Next through was her Britain teammate and Commonwealth champion for Scotland last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an age peer of Hosszu 's , clocked a best of 2:06.21 in late 2012 , Hosszu was in her first season of significant improvement , on 2:04.72 .

Time will tell . <p> What we know for now is that Hosszu 's ability to race at top-notch speed , often ahead of the curve of the rest of the best has ever done , meet after meet , event after event , heats , semis , final , , small-moment , whatever the distance and stroke , is a model that no-one is matching , no-one is following . <p> Meanwhile , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reka Gyorgy pipped Zsuzsanna Jakabos 2:09.67 to 2:09.74 , with Dalma Sebestyen on 2:10.41 . <h> Another Day , Another Duel <p> Jeanette Ottesen , left , and Sarah Sjostrom after their ' fly final by Patrick B.

Third place went to Sweden 's Michelle Coleman , training at Miami , third in 1:57.67 .

I 'll behave myself ( for once ) and refrain from posting anything about Monday 's nights finals to allow you to put out your article . <p> December 14 , 2015 <p> It 's a bit too harsh to call D'Orsogna a tourist only because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best December 14 , 2015 <p> Obviously it 's too early to call it , but I think the women 's 200 breast is shaping up to be the more impressive of the breaststrokes for women in Oz . <p> Georgia Bohl getting a slight PB , with a few others under and pushing will make it the more competitive of the two distances . <p> Though I think Bohl could be the one to next year in the 100 . <p> Craig Lord December 14 , 2015 <p> No problem , C Wombat ... landed and updated now <p> December 15 , 2015 <p> Therea , the " tourist " tag is one that originated with AUS Swimming and Olympic officials to describe those who swim excellent times at Trials to make national teams ....... then never replicate them internationally . <p> D'Orsogna has earned this tag on two fronts . Ever since his commendable 4 ? 100 heat swim ; his international record has been that of unblemished sub-standard performance . <p> For some inexplicable reason he has been handed lead-off responsibilities for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CG &amp; PP where the competition was shallow enough that this did n't torpedo the relay . He repeated this in Kazan where it DID count and his team failed to qualify for Rio . <p> He has also made the team for individual swims . Here again , he fails to replicate domestic times in international waters . <p> He 's been swimming internationally since 2010 . Apart from one swim , his record fits the definition of a " tourist " . Same with Hadler who 's been around since 2009 ; same with who 's been around for a full Olympic cycle . You do n't " hit " someone with the tag after just one bad outing but when its three or more years and there is a clear pattern ....... <p> December 15 , 2015 <p> , thanks for the explanation but it still sounds a derogatory term to me . These guys do n't underperform on purpose . They do their best , then maybe something happens in their mind on race day that prevents them from being their own best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed . Then again , if someone is willing to take his spot , he is free to come forward and race faster at Trials ... <p> December 16 , 2015 <p> Totally agree Therea . The " tourist " tag is definitely derogatory and very unsportsmanlike ! Regardless of common 's explanation the swimmers he is labelling are all trying to do their best . They are on the team because their performance at trials has earned them that place . Not because they have bought a ticket as inferred by " common " . I enjoy reading most of the commentary on that is those comments that contain interesting facts , opinions on performance and improvement but not childish name calling ! <p> What do points 
 High-5 King Of World 200 Back in 2015 As He Tops Irie 's All-Comers <p> When Mitch Larkin clocked 1:55.52 over backstroke at Australian national championships back in April , he confirmed his status as a potential podium placer at world titles with selection as a Dolphin a year after a lifetime best of 1:55.26 for the 2014 Aussie crown . <p> What happened next was the elevation of Larkin to the ranks of favourites heading into Rio 2016 . Today in Brisbane delivered more reasons why : on 1:53.72 for the Queensland State title , he posted a fifth sub-1:55 to grab ownership of the five swiftest performances in the world this year . <p> The 's latest effort took down the Australian all-comers record of another champion of consistent speed over backstroke , Ryosuke Irie , of Japan , on 1:54.02 at the start of the last Olympic year , in 2012 on his way to Olympic silver in 1:53.78 , a touch slower than Larkin in December 2015 and Tyler Clary 's winning 1:53.41 at London 2012 for USA gold , the bronze to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1:53.94 . <p> Mitchell Larkin by PBK <p> Speedy stuff from Larkin , then , as spring turns to summer Down Under . Coached by Michael Bohl at St Peters Western , the world champion now boasts an impressive wave of pace from 2015 . His all-time list is topped by the 1:53.17 Commonwealth record he established on World Cup tour in Dubai , followed by the 1:53.34 on the same tour in Tokyo , the 1:53.58 in which he claimed the world crown on his way to the double in Kazan , and after the 1:53.72 of today comes the 1:54.29 that in the semis at world titles hinted at what was to come . <p> Out in 26.73 , Larkin got to half-way today in 55.87 ( 29.14 ) , turned into the last lap in 1:25.08 ( 29.21 ) and came home in 28.64 . The silver was almost adrift , teenager Peter Mills , of East Brisbane , on 2:02.95 , his only sub-30 split the opening lap . <h> Men Backstroke <p> 1 <p> <p> Mitchell Larkin AUS , 22 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> Radoslaw Kawecki POL , 24 <p> World Championships RUS , Kazan <p> 3 <p> <p> Evgeny Rylov RUS , 19 <p> World Championships RUS , Kazan <h> Seebohm Pressed By Wilson Career Best on 2:07s <p> Aussie 1-2 Emily Seebohm and Madison Wilson top the backstroke at world titles by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Not quite the all-comers speed of the men 's race but a 2:07.43 from Larkin 's fellow double world backstroke champion Emily Seebohm set a new Queensland all-comers standard in the women 's final in a battle with Madison Wilson , on a lifetime best of 2:07.84 . <p> Only Seebohm , coached by David Lush at Brisbane Grammar and boasting the world No 1 of the year at the 2:05.81 in which she claimed the world crown in August , those who followed her on to the podium , Olympic champion Missy Franklin , big improver Katinka Hosszu and Daria K. have swum faster this year than Wilson and her new high .

What can we take from them ? <p> The " usual suspects " ( or at least fitting that tag on 2015 form ) have been their usual selves . C1 , Seebohm and Larkin have pulled out performances that have been consistent with their positions at the top of the international pile in their respective events . <p> Swimmers who had " break out " years internationally ( Wilson , Ashwood &amp; Packard ) have swam times at the start of the AUS LCM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Likewise with McEvoy . <p> Some positive signs from two swimmers ( &amp; McKeown ) who had disappointing Kazan campaigns and from Bohl in the female breast-stroke ranks . <p> Whilst QLD is often looked on as the engine-room of AUS swimming , the fields have been variable in quality varying from up to a handful of international standard in some events to events where the likes of Larkin are ahead of the next finisher . <p> Whilst there is the potential for the odd good performance coming out of the WA titles starting on Thursday ; realistically the next major event with regards to quality and standard of fields will be the Victorian titles starting 11Jan . <p> December 15 , 2015 <p> Let 's see if David Morgan can step in 2016 to fill the gaping hole ( sinkhole ) in the means butterfly events <p> December 15 , 2015 <p> , I would have to agree that he currently looks the best hope . Hadler &amp; D'Orsogna have been given more than ample opportunities and have proven themselves categorically inadequate and Wright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . <p> Up till now , the 200 has been Morgan 's stronger suit and his heat swim in Kazan was impressive . He fell apart in the semi but his heat swim in the medley relay was considerably better than Hadler 's in the final . <p> He will require PB 's of and to make the AUS QT in the 100 &amp; 200 respectively and Irvine has a better 200 PB but Morgan did look the more impressive in Kazan &amp; he is starting the season with some degree of promise . <p> December 16 , 2015 <p> Grant Irvine is another to be added to the litany of " tourists " in men 's butterfly events ... I 'm sure there are a few others for some reason in men 's butterfly ? ! ! One of our former strengths in men 's events <p> December 16 , 2015 <p> To be fair to Irvine ; I do n't feel he qualifies for tourist class just yet . He has at least made S/F at LC Worlds twice ; his 2014 CG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Trials efforts have at least been somewhere within range . <p> My usual " rule of thumb " for " tourists " is to give them say 3 years in the national team and if they 're still exhibiting " tourist symptoms " , the diagnosis can be said to confirmed . <p> At this point , Irvine certainly has n't matched the serial ineptitude of Hadler , D'Orsogna &amp; . Someone who IS teetering on the brink of " tourist class " is Groves who has had 2 very poor years internationally following stellar domestic seasons . <p> Robbos December 16 , 2015 <p> Mina Atherton just swam 59.37 in the 100 metres backstroke to break Emily 's 15 years old record . Makes her 7th in the world ranking this year , ahead of Franklin . <p> December 16 , 2015 <p> Very interesting ! ! Whilst Wilson should certainly still be the clear favourite for the 2nd individual spot in this event , Atherton is certainly making it clear that she intends being part of the show at Trials . Indeed , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nationality ; she would be either a certain Rio selection or highly favoured . <p> 24.12 from C1 in , at 24.99 the only other sub although C2 &amp; Wright were non starters this morning . Curious how " blas ? " we are becoming at the likes of C1 , Seebohm , Larkin &amp; Hosszu almost nonchalantly producing international medal class times at whatever meet they attend . <p> Little to report from final " Open " event , , with McEvoy 22.33 half a second ahead of the field . Chalmers at 23.10 5th . The AUS QT of 22.02 is not necessarily be a " pushover " as none of AUS premier 100 freestylers are as adept over one lap . <p> gheko December 16 , 2015 <p> I read somewhere that Eamon Sullivan is back for the free , maybe he can get the others to take this event seriously , he will probably qualify for Rio in one of our weakest events . <p> December 16 , 2015 <p> Have n't heard that , . Given that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very sceptical of this being viable let alone true . <p> Unless he 's " silently " advised ASDA of a return back in March at the latest , it 's far too late given the requirement of 12months notice of re-entering the out of competition drug testing regime before one can compete again . <p> Whilst he would , notionally , strengthen AUS in that event ; his " shot " shoulders effectively preclude him from anything longer ie assisting the very shallow talent pool for the <p> Talking on It 
 they 'd shown faith in Ben Proud : 20.74 a British freestyle record that took down a 15-year-old former world mark . The time was also a Commonwealth textile best in the bargain . <p> If the powers had hunger in mind when taking decisions on funding and team selections , it may come to something , though hard work and dedication are more likely to be the cause of a 56.35 victory for Simmonds over 56.84 for Davies in the backstroke and world top 10 times from Barrett in the butterfly , Lowe in the butterfly and in the freestyle on the opening evening of action at the ASA National Winter Meet at Sheffield 's Ponds Forge . <h> Ben 's Blast <p> Two who are funded excelled , too , this evening . The best was saved until last : Ben Proud , coached by Jon Rudd at Plymouth Leander and another who has not seen international action of late , is now the fastest freestyler all-time among Commonwealth nations . His British record of 20.74 in the dash took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the annual world short-course rankings . <p> Double Commonwealth sprint champion in 2014 , Proud cracked the 21.13 at which Mark Foster had held not just the British but the World record back in January 2001 . Proud 's own best had been 21.40 . The time would have won the European s/c crown but Proud noted that he does n't see much worth in comparing apples and pears , in a manner of speaking : <p> The 2015 helm of speed : <h> Men Freestyle <p> 1 <p> 20.71 <p> Evgeny Sedov RUS , 19 <p> European Championships ISR , Netanya <p> 2 <p> 20.74 <p> Benjamin Proud GBR , 21 <p> ASA National Winter Meet GBR , Sheffield <p> 3 <p> 20.75 <p> Cameron McEvoy AUS , 21 <p> Australian Championships AUS , Sydney <p> Proud said : <p> " I 'm really pleased . This morning I swam a 22 so I was n't quite sure what to expect tonight but I felt really fast and I was just trying to think about getting all the details right . As soon as I nailed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast swim but I did n't think it would be sub 21 seconds . " <p> Next home was a 21.55 from Andrew , of Loughborough , the bronze to Lewis , of Killerwhales , in 21.92 , ahead of Loughborough 's James Disney-May . <p> A terrific swim from Proud , a finalist in two events back in August , and indicative of where the sprint promise is headed on his way to Olympic trials in spring . No getting past Roland Schoeman ( RSA ) and a 20.30 in shiny suit nor the other five blasts from that era faster than Proud 's effort today but Cameron McEvoy 's Commonwealth textile standard of 20.75 from last week in Brisbane , is surpassed . <p> Fair , too , to point out that this is a relatively weak year for short-course rankings in some events , the free world mark held at 20.26 by Olympic champion Florent Manaudou ( FRA ) and a 20.70 ( at least ) or faster required for a shot at a big podium come the crunch of global gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ momentum on his side . <p> The other speedster this evening who is funded , as one among the most promising of the next wave in Britain , also rose into the world top 5 this season : at the helm of the women 's breaststroke on 30.03 was Derventio 's Imogen Clark , 16 . A national stand , no less . The British record had stood at 30.11 to Rebecca , the first black woman to ever represent Britain in the elite pool , back in the last season of shiny suits in 2009 . <p> Next home this evening was City of Derby 's Sarah Vasey , on 30.47 for a place in the world top 15 . The bronze went to Hong Kong 's Yvette Kong , 30.84 , with Corrie Scott , of Edinburgh on 30.92 , both into the world top 30 . <h> Speedy end of year for Simmonds &amp; Davies <p> The times logged by Simmonds and Davies , who count titles European and Commonwealth in their treasuries , would have placed them second and third at the European s/c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a point for Europe at the Duel , but she did n't cross the Pond for the meet in Indianapolis that the USA went to town on . Today , she moved up from No6 to No5 on the season world rankings . That kind of place in the world come the long-course season and Olympic trials next April is the kind of thing selectors and funders , funders and selectors , have their eye on when it comes to measuring worth on the scale of funding elite sport in Britain . <p> No-one cares much for medals in the European little pool , it seems , but they do care a lot when it comes to Rio 2016 , though the times being swum in Sheffield today put into perspective the death in standards at international s/c meets that mostly unfold without the full force of talent and speed present at one time in one place . <p> Davies moved to No8 on the world rankings , while bronze went to Lauren Quigley , of Stockport Metro , with a 57.79 that was just shy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening , on 58.18 , was Jessica Fullalove . There was also a British Junior record for 15-year-old Anna Maine , of Woking , on 59.23 in sixth . Said Simmonds of her own new speed : <p> " I 'm very pleased with that swim . After a disappointing world champs for me , this season is about the process of re-setting and learning from that . With tonight 's PB and gold , that 's a good sign for me . " <p> Adam Barrett by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The pattern was somewhat mirrored in the butterfly , when Adam Barrett , the Loughborough speedster who helps teams English and British to medley relays golds at the Commonwealth Games and European Championships in 2014 but has had a season out of international selection this year , clocked 50.26 to won the butterfly . <p> That would have left him just shy of the podium at European titles in Netanya and third by the grace of a full second at the Duel but he was n't at either event . Next home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51.05 , 20th in the world , the bronze going to Sheffield 's Braxston Timm in 51.41 , Manchester 's Sam Horrocks next home in 52.16 . <p> Jay first major medal in Berlin in 2014 ... by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Jay shadowed Nick Grainger for 14 of the 16 laps of the freestyle before unleashing a 27.03 blast for home for victory in 3:38.60 , No 10 in the world this year . <p> The title to Lelliot , of Bath , Grainger , of Sheffield and racing in his home Ponds Forge pool , took silver in 3:40.24 , the keen battle for bronze between three Loughborough teammates settled in 3:42.59 , and 3:44.04 in favour of Tim Shuttleworth ahead of Tobias Robinson and Caleb Hughes . <p> made his England and Britain senior debut in 2014 , claiming bronze in the freestyle at the European Championships in Berlin in 3:47.50 , shy of gold to Velimir Stjepanovic , of Serbia .

The bronze was close , at 2:08.51 courtesy of Birmingham 's Stepahnie Blakeburn , with Emma on 2:08.79 , all three following Lowe into the world top 30 this season . <p> Aimee Willmott by Patrick B.

The world record holder had entered the event believing that it was compulsory for Britain team members .

 is what Ben Proud intended to deliver this week at the ASA Winter Meet at Sheffield 's Ponds Forge then his mission was accomplished with a following wind from Santa 's sleigh , Rudolph and any other red-nosed reindeers out there : a British butterfly record of 22.39 . In heats . <p> Then he topped his own achievement but not in the ' fly final . <p> He was done with the dash . <p> Why ? <p> Because coach Jon Rudd thought he 'd had more in him when he set the British free record at 46.6 a couple of days back . Rudd was right : leading off the Plymouth Leander 4x100m freestyle relay , Proud blasted a 45.97 that swept him to the helm of the world rankings . <p> Take that .

Rudd told : <p> " We started this season with a determination that the 100 would improve , primarily for Medley relay purposes in Rio . We 've made a number of changes in the pool-based training , both technically and physiologically and the work in the gym has really ramped up as well . <p> " This meet was purely a run out with a short rest ; with Ben not selected for Euro short-course ( championships ) nor the Duel , we saw this meet as the chance to answer some questions about the 100 , particularly as three turns have n't ever really given him an advantage over one at least until now ! So we have some questions answered . And therefore it 's time to go and find some new questions ! " <p> Trials will deliver new answers , too . For now , Proud says : <p> " I am totally surprised with that . I knew that the top world rankings were set at 46.0 , so I am really pleased to be in the 45s . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the freestyle . <p> " I 'm also pretty pleased with my ' fly British record from this morning .

I 've got three months until trials and I am really looking forward to this next chunk of work . " <h> 's next chunk of work <p> Thunder after the storm , Florent Manaudou clocked 45.81 at world s/c titles in 2014 by Patrick B.

No by passing French Olympic trials in spring , the moment we will see where the two-lap project has got to . <p> Mark Foster 's freestyle standard had stood at 21.13 since he set the then world record back in 2001 at the height of a career that granted him the moniker " Short-Course King " . <p> Foster is backing Proud to go big in Rio , telling BBC Devon radio : " This is Ben 's moment and he is going to be one of our stars come the Olympics next year . I was number one in the UK from 1985-2008 , and it 's nice now someone can take on the mantle and progress it and take it a step further otherwise Britain just gets left behind by the rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay these times down now I think the 50 free was second-fastest in the world this year he 's in good form . At the Olympic Games he 'll have to be at the top of his game and do best times to stand a chance of winning a medal . " <p> Foster knows it well , his short-course victories having come in waves , his best Olympic finish 7th place in the freestyle . Long-course and the Games demand an extra level . <p> Proud showed he can step up in such waters when he claimed freestyle and butterfly crowns for England at the 2014 Commonwealth Games ahead of the likes of Magnussen , McEvoy , Schoeman and Le Clos , among the big hitters left in his wake . The Olympic Games is a different Games , a higher challenge , one Proud has been dreaming of ( and working on ) for quite some time . <h> How It All Began <p> About four years ago , Proud , already a tall , lean teen , left his home in Malaysia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinter with his eyes set on becoming the best he could be . <p> Ben Proud Photo : Gian Mattia D'Alberto / <p> By July 2014 , he was double Commonwealth champion , a 22.93 on butterfly worth gold and No1 on the world rankings at that stage in the year . By the clos of 2014 , two had sneaked beyond him , just , Ukraine 's Andrey Govorov on 22.87 , Brazil 's world champion Cesar Cielo on 22.93 . <p> In the free , it was 21.76 , a world top 8 swim that season by year end . He also picked up a bronze in the 4x100m freestyle , the freestyle slot in the medley relay for an England quartet bound for gold going to Adam Brown , who then bypassed the European Championships , leaving Proud to step up and help Britain take gold . <p> It is the medley relay at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games that offers Proud and teammates an excellent shot at the podium together . Chris Walker-Hebborn , Adam Peaty and Adam Barrett , in that European final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive with the best 5 in the world in their respective strokes . Proud is not there but the potential for him to be in that zone just added another layer of hope with that 46.6 British record in Sheffield . <p> Proud 's progress has been in the pressure cooker for quite some years . Born in London in September 1994 the second son of Nick and Sally Proud three years after the arrival of older brother Oliver , he was still in a cot when the family left for a life in Kuala Lumpur after dad landed a job in the Malaysian capital . <p> By 2 , Ben was in the swim and by 7 he was the youngest member of the Alice Smith School team . He was n't convinced this was the sport for him , though . <p> Ben Proud photo : SWPix.com <p> In 2008 the fates conspired to bring Proud together with coach Francis Kiu and set in motion a journey with an unknown destination . Kiu had been a swimmer before in Proud 's words he got a " proper job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent of the teenager . In 2014 , Proud told SwimVortex 's Liz Byrnes : <p> " I had a one-to-one session with him because no-one else from the swim club turned up . It was just me , him and one of my friends . After that he turned to me and said ' you have got some good talent . By the end of next year I want to make you national age group champion ' . " <p> Training in board shorts and doing less than a kilometre a session , he began to take the sport more seriously , going from five hours to 12 hours a week . All the time the focus was on the sprints . <p> Proud is grateful for a great start : <p> " Kiu taught me the basics : if I had n't have had him as a coach I would n't be where I am today because he taught me fundamental things about training . A lot of dives , a lot of technique work . He brought down my times by about three seconds in the 50s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit with success at the Selangor age groups before Proud stepped up to the national age groups and then the Malaysian Open , where he won the butterfly and was second in the freestyle . Here 's what bro Oliver captured : <p> At this point Proud informed his mum he wanted to purse a swimming career he wanted to be a world-class athlete . He noted : <p> " It was my own independent choice : I decided that if I wanted to swim competitively as a career I was going to have to come back to the UK at some point just to get my name out there . To get on to the teams and do Commonwealths and everything like that . " <p> After speaking to a family friend whose daughter had been at Plymouth Leander , Proud spoke to head coach Jon Rudd and at the age of 16 years 11 months he found himself in south-west England . <p> While he had visited family in Britain , he had never spent more than a month there and it was never a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered dual nationality . " But I could n't change it . I 'm English . Ever since I 've been back I 've become more patriotic . " <h> Putting Meat On Bones <p> The workload at Leander was a shock to Proud 's system . Rudd recalls : <p> " He had zero endurance : he could n't finish a 50 never mind finish a 100 . But boy did he have twitch and speed and what I had to do was finesse what he already had but bring something else to the table so he could finish races , so he was n't dying at . " <p> For his part , Proud recognises : " I was n't an athlete when I was out there : I knew I had to swim fast but I could n't run , I could n't squat , I could n't do anything . <p> " Moving to Plymouth , it made me smarter about my swimming and my lifestyle which I think go hand in hand . If I had n't moved to Plymouth I would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks to both Francis Kiu in Malaysia and Jon . " <p> One thing he noted on arrival was less of a focus in Britain on the one-length sprints . " In Malaysia the 50s were what everyone liked to do . Come here and not many people actually do it , " says Proud . " I hope in Britain the 50s become more of an event . " <p> That was in 2014 and a summer that ended with Rudd telling Proud : " Two laps is where it 's at " ... and that focus would not only improve his but his dash , too . <p> Of course , Proud 's passion for the 50s , as today 's events reminded us and as expressed in the quote that follows , remains palpable : <p> " It comes very naturally to me . I dive in the water and the water takes over . I do n't know what it is about the 50s , it 's something I have always been very passionate about . It 's a balance between personal strength and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for error . It 's a test of speed rather than tactics or anything else really . " <p> Ben Proud ( Swimming <p> Proud is reading sports development and coaching at the University of St Mark and St John , which , like Plymouth College , has a partnership with the Leander swim club to make sport and study possible . The trust between the sprinter and Rudd is evident . <p> " We are cut off from everything in Plymouth . It works for us because Jon knows what he is doing , " says Proud . " The faster I get the more he knows what does work and what does n't . Deep down Jon knows everything you need to know about sprinting . " <p> Rudd returned the compliment : <p> " Ben is a true gentleman , extremely humble , very modest . He 's extremely single minded and focused . He does n't just talk the talk he walks the walk . When you talk about international athletes living the lifestyle he is absolutely beacon standard with all the things that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a day I do n't see him . He is a great role model who wants to know what it takes to be at the top of the game . " <h> Comments <p> December 20 , 2015 <p> Ok coach Jon , but it 's time for Ben to shine in the big pool ! That 45.9 would give him bronze in the last World Short Course champs . <p> Craig Lord December 20 , 2015 <p> Indeed , , though 45.9 is v impressive for 21-year-old just starting to show the meat on his bones ... and shine in l/c he has , as a teen picking up two golds ahead of Magnussen , McEvoy , Le Clos and Schoeman , as noted in the article . You mean the biggest l/c pool of them all : a scenario that applies to most sprinters chasing honours in the Olympic pool next summer . The work is indeed for the l/c pool , Sheffield in December a fine try out , no more ( though we should n't be dismissive about four nationals records there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we know ) .

Each time I swim at local Masters meets I have thoughts like that . But that 's hard when it 's your natural state . As well as it 's hard for skinny guys to put on some muscle while swimming a lot . We all have to learn to use the advantages that nature has given us . <p> Craig Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note . It cuts to the fundamental mistake of folk who tell kids to " swim like Michael Phelps " .

 Ledecky of the United States of America - by Patrick B. Kraemer - This image is the SwimVortex choice of Photo of the Year , Patrick having captured a bulls-eye snapshot that summed up Ledecky , attitude , achievement and a target reached - thank you Mr. Kraemer , for that and so many other work-of-art shots that mirrored the whisper from the water . <p> It is more than rare to look back at the career of any of the greats of the swimming pantheon and find a ' 1 ' next to their name in every big race they ever swum . Katie Ledecky is one of those ' almost never beaten ' and for the 2013 , 2014 and 2015 seasons never beaten . You have to go back to 2012 at the USA Olympic trials to find Ledecky locked out of gold ( and race ) , with a third-placed big best time in the freestyle , on 4:05.00 at 15 years of age , Allison Schmitt and Chloe Sutton ahead of her . <p> Over seven days in Kazan at the World Championships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pantheon for Ledecky had their contracts extended along with double-time clauses and bonuses as risk gathered pace of them having to work through the night . <p> Here is our seven-day whirlwind trawl of Ledecky 's Nine Lives Before she landed on her feet back home from Kazan as the first swimmer ever to claim world crowns over , , and freestyle , as well as the 4x200m with teammates . <h> DAY 1 <p> And she 's off Katie Ledecky by PBK <p> freestyle <p> Heats : 4:01.73 <p> Final : 3:59.13 , Gold , Championship Record , victory by no other swimmer has ever swum faster barring the champion , with her 2 efforts on 3:58 <p> at 2:01.8 she was inside the world-record pace at the start of the duel over the solo in the 1974 ; <p> on 4:06.41 at , she would have finished 6th in the eight-lap final ( she won in 3:59 ) last night and was just off the pace at which Tracey Wickham set the world record in 1978 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janet Evans ( USA ) ever went over 16 laps , the Americans 8:16.22 standard having stood between 1989 and 2008 <p> at , she split in a time that no other swimmer has ever clocked over the distance in a textile suit , the 2nd best beyond Ledecky 's best seven efforts , courtesy of Jazmin Carlin ( GBR ) <p> And then she came home in from to . <p> By the close of play , she stopped the clock inside the time in which Stephen Holland ( AUS ) set the men 's world record ( ) for the Commonwealth crown in 1975 <p> Finals : an afternoon out of the lights <p> Katie Ledecky by PBK <h> DAY 3 <p> One of the most towering days for a single swimmer in world-championship history <p> Freestyle and Freestyle <p> Heats : 1:55.82 , fastest qualifier for semis <p> Final : 15:25.48 , Gold , World Record , victory by a margin of 14.66 ( a second every ) <p> Semi-Final : At 18.24 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world-title final . By the time they printed the free semi-finals summary at 18:58 , Katie Ledecky had fought her way from 13th overall on the clock at the last turn of her four-lapper to 6th for a place in her third final of the meet clear of facing a swim-off for the last lane in the showdown . <p> at 2:00.5 she had made up the bulk of the margin by which she would break the world record she set in the heats the day before ( see below ) ; was a stroke away from the world-record pace of the first sub-2-minute ever seen over solo , clocked by ( GDR , State Plan 14:25 and all that ) for 1976 Olympic gold . Only 15 women cracked 2mins over the solo in the year of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games ; more than 100 have done so this year , Ledecky qualifying for the final after her world record and on the way to a 1:55.1 victory over four laps the next day . <p> on 4:04.69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-lap final ( she won in 3:59 ) on day 1 at a pace just slower than Lauren Boyle 's eight-lap solo effort ; Ledecky 's split time would have won the solo world title in all years from 1973 to 2005 inclusive . <p> on 8:13.25 at the mark Ledecky was faster than any other swimmer has even swum 16 laps barring herself and up on the pace the world record had stood to Janet Evans ( USA ) 8:16.22 between 1989 and 2008 <p> at , she was inside the 2008 world record of 8:14.00 clocked by Britain 's Rebecca Adlington for Olympic gold in Beijing ; and inside the that stands yet as to the 2nd best performer in textile ever ( beyond Ledecky 's best eight efforts ) , Jazmin Carlin ( GBR ) <p> And then she came home in 8:14.10 from to . <p> By the close of play , she stopped the clock inside the time in which Stephen Holland ( AUS ) set the men 's world record ( ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace would have ranked her 18th in the world among men in 1990 ; by the year of her birth , 1997 , the pace would have ranked her 19th in the world among men ; and in the past season , a sprinkling over 100 of her male distance contemporaries would manage to keep her at bay . <p> By the time she entered the water , the gold had been all but won , a four-second lead unassailable , Federica Pellegrini 's 1:54.73 split making up a touch , Ledecky able to cruise home without risk in a race in which Sarah Sjostrom set off in 1:54.31 , a pace in which she could have won the solo . But you have to be in it to win it . <p> A stunning way to end a week of soaring achievement . She could have won it at a cruise but on the seventh day she did not rest up her goal ahead of her . <p> Stunning as that was , Ledecky 's improvement since Olympic gold at 15 in London was in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.31% . Contrast that with the 3.49% gain from lifetime best 2012 and lifetime best 2015 of Katinka Hosszu 's 2:06.12 200IM world record and on a personal level , Ledecky 's trail-blazing times are in line with the chart one might have expected to see . <p> In the moment and given the skew of shiny suits , however , the world records she established in heats and then the final in Kazan , rated all of Ledecky 's world records above that of Hosszu on points , Sarah Sjostrom 's 55.64 world mark in the butterfly the swim that gets a touch past Ledecky 's efforts on points but not the free , top of the heap , all swims male and female in Kazan . Points measure the amount by which a world record is set beyond the 1,000 level of the standing world record . <p> It was not as if Ledecky was up against no opposition ; it was more than she was racing ahead of the curve of her peers and her time . For example , the freestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and performances , textile and not . <p> The top four times , including the podium , entered the all-time top 10 performers in textile , Ledecky at No1 , Lauren Boyle ( NZL ) , at No3 with her Oceania record of , Boglarka Kapas ( HUN ) at No5 with her for bronze . <p> Beyond Lotte Friis ( DEN ) , whose 15:38.88 silver from 2013 remains No2 all-time in textile , fifth-placed Jessica Ashwood ( AUS ) set a national record of , good for No8 performer in textile . The picture is the same all suits but for a one-place demotion for Kapas , to No 6 , and Ashwood , to No9 . <p> Katie Ledecky gold and still smiling after a towering week of toil by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> When it comes to performances , Ledecky finds another measure for her dominance : each round in Kazan produced a new entry to the all-time performances list and a top 10 that requires no suit demarcation all swims are now textile . A 15:42 in heats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupy the top 2 slots and take her tally of entries to six out of 10 . The only other swim that made an impact on that score was the from Boyle , in at No7 and her second entry in the top 10 . <p> Ledecky ' s was the biggest margin of victory since the joined the program for women in 2001 ; the coached by Gemmell and the youngest winner of the 30-lap crown at her first attempt back in 2013 , is the only champion to have won the crown in world-record time and she did that twice , in 2013 and 2015 , her efforts in Kazan including a rare feat in women 's swimming a morning heats world mark as a warm-up for more global standard setting and gold in the final . <h> " I Did What I Needed To Do " Katie Ledecky <p> Reflecting on her week in Kazan , Ledecky said : <p> " There were some days where I was really tired , but I recovered very well . I did what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that I got up on the blocks . I 'm just proud of how I handled my races and how this week has gone . " <p> After the , she said : " I could tell that I was in front , but you never know when somebody is going to come charging home at the end . So I just wanted to keep pushing and maintain my same stroke , my same rhythm , my same tempo , and I knew that if I could do that , it would be a pretty good swim . " <p> Before Ledecky completed The Quad of 200 , 400 , 800 and , the closest anyone had ever come to completing the feat was Grant Hackett , the Australian having left the World Championships in Montreal in 2005 with gold in the 400 , 800 and 1500 freestyles , and a silver behind Phelps in the 200 free . Tim Shaw , of the USA , won the 200 , 400 and in 1975 in the days when there was no 800 to have a go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> " It means a lot . It 's really neat to say that you 've done something nobody has done before . I 'll enjoy this for a few days and then I 'll get back to work and hopefully there 's more to come .

But I 've never seen anything quite like this , and I 've seen a lot of stuff ... It seems like whenever it comes to a big meet , it seems like a world record is going down .

" <p> One of those who made the podium with Ledecky in the , Jazmin Carlin summed up brilliantly what Ledecky 's presence means in the ranks of the fastest distance freestylers of the age ( some of them all-time , too ) : <p> " She has really shown us distance girls this week you really do need the speed . She has even shown the 200 girls how it is done . She has shown us it is not just about distance anymore . It is about having the speed . That is a pretty incredible achievement . She has no fear .

 to be home for Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt for a few years to come . The Olympic swim champions followed coach Bob Bowman from Baltimore to Arizona State University this past year and have formed plans for their lives beyond the lane lines and racing . <p> In a Christmas article with reporter Jeff Metcalfe of azcentral sports , Phelps reveals that he is committed to being an ASU volunteer assistant coach in 2016-17 after he retires this time for good ( he said that last time , of course ) , while Schmitt wants to stay in Tempe to read psychology for a masters so that she might help others who , like the Olympic freestyle champion , have been affected by depression and other mental health issues . <p> " I wanted nothing to do with the water , " after London 2012 and a Games that delved gold No 18 and medal No22 as well as the first solo triples in Olympic waters among men , the butterfly and the medley . When he waved goodbye to London , he said a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't fibbing . Says Phelps , not far away from fatherhood : <p> " I wanted to be as far away from it as I could . Now , being around it more than I have in a long time , I do n't think I 'll be able to go far from the sport because it is a part of me . " <p> The 2015 season was a washout as far as international racing went because of sanction following a DUI charge . Phelps did race , however , and ends the year as world No1 in the 100 , butterfly and the medley . <p> Allison Schmitt by Peter Bick <p> Schmitt has overcome depression , has returned to better form of late but remains a long way from where she got to in 2012 . <p> The Arizona climate is helping the process required to be in the best place she can be . Phelps , a friend and teammate of Schmitt 's in the pool and beyond , explains : " For me , somebody who swam inside for 20 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 95 percent of the time , it 's just a good change . Our attitude towards workout is a lot better now than what it was in the past . I 'd be the first one to say this is one of the best places I 've ever lived . " <p> Schmitt provides AZ central with insight to her mood : <p> " It was in the 40s but so nice to be outside in the sun . I love change , and I 've really adapted well to it . I 'm just so happy to be here . " <p> " It 's kind of trite to say they 're growing up . They 've gone through some really hard times . It 's been a total life change ( in Arizona ) . The group we have is very good . The environment , staff , obviously the weather and the facility and being part of what 's going on at ASU . It 's just more fun . " <p> Goals from Padraig 
 , mentor to Michael Phelps , Allison Schmitt and others now based at Arizona State University , has joined the Board of the World Swimming Coaches Association , the body that formed the World Swimming Association last September with a view to replacing FINA as the global governing body for swimming . <p> Bowman , a USA Olympic team head coach , becomes the third American on the WSCA board , completing the quote allocated to each national member of the global body 's leadership group : the other two are WSCA President George Block and John Leonard , the director of WSCA and the American Swimming Coaches Association , the logo of which says much about what the appointment is about : " Leadership in American Swimming through Education , Certification , Collaboration " . Said Leonard : <p> " I am thrilled to announce that Coach Bob Bowman of Arizona State University has accepted a Board of Directors position with the World Swimming Coaches Association effective immediately . Coach Bowman of course , is the lifelong coach of the great Michael Phelps among numerous other Olympians and Olympic medalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the experience and achievement of Bob Bowman join the WSCA Board of Directors . Our thanks to him for accepting the position " <p> WSCA is currently in the process of what it describes as " shepharding the World Swimming Association into being as an alternative international organization , based on the concepts of " Athlete Centered , and Professionally Directed Sport " . <p> The WSA will host a constitutional convention in Washington , DC , in 2017 , to take the plan for organisation evolution to the next level . <p> Members of WSCA offered an olive branch to FINA when , led by Australian veteran coach leader Bill Sweetenham , they urged the federation to submit to independent review of processes and books in the wake of a series of blunders and politically motivated moves widely criticised as self-serving and not in the interests of athletes and the sport of swimming . <p> Bowman , who with Phelps has made several moves of late ( MP Foundation and the brand at Aquasphere ) included that speak to their wish to promote swimming beyond its current guise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine catch for the WSCA Board at a time when vision will be much in demand as the WSA lays down roots . <p> Bowman was influential in the timing of the end of shiny suits from January 2010 . FINA leaders had intended to drag the process on well beyond 2009 and seek ' compromise ' until Bowman stated that Phelps would not be seen racing at FINA events until the international federation retuned swimming to swimmers and ended the muddle that had caused schism in the sport . <p> The next day at the 2009 World Championships in Rome , FINA set its deadline for a return to textile only suits and an end to the full bodysuit : January 1 , 2010 . One of the most disruptive eras in the history of the sport , one short-lived but still being felt today , was over . <h> Offensive tweets force 
 not defend her world s/c crown over free in Doha this week , her withdrawal from an event that had been one of her goals for 2014 at the heart of a crisis in which New Zealand 's prime aquatic asset has been struggling to find a base and coach she can work with for the past two years . <p> The New Zealand federation has " spent six months trying and failing to find a coach for world and Commonwealth swimming champion Lauren Boyle , and admit an Olympic medal could be at stake " , according to the Sunday Star-Times today . <p> The paper reveals that High Performance Sport New Zealand has known since May that Boyle and British coach David Lyles , the Swimming New Zealand head coach appointed last year , agreed an amicable split . <p> And it notes the status of those in crisis as it writes : " The two taxpayer-funded bodies are still trying to find a solution " . Boyle 's troubles have prompted former ' fly ace Moss Burmester , who cited issues with Swimming NZ as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for New Zealand 's Associate Minister of Sport Murray McCully to step in and help Boyle find a solution that will deliver a podium finish for the triple bronze medallist at Rio 2016 Olympic Games . <p> Boyle trained with coach Fred Vergnoux and race rival Mireia Belmonte in Spain on the way to gold and silver at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow last July and has received advice from Bill Sweetenham , of Australia , in recent years . But no permanent coaching situation has been found . <p> In a statement to the Times , Boyle writes from heart and mind to say : <p> " The world short-course championships were definitely one of my goals for 2014 . I felt that getting a championship gold in the last time was very significant for me because it was my first world title . It is disappointing to not be defending my title . The success I had in Turkey in 2012 was with Mark Regan as my coach . My coaching arrangements have been unsettled since he left in January 2013 . My build-up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still committed to finding a long-term coaching solution with some support from HPSNZ and SNZ . " <p> HPSNZ boss Alex Baumann , one of the greats of medley swimming and a double Olympic champion for Canada in 1984 , believes that Boyle 's status as a swimmer capable of an Olympic medal come 2016 , makes a promise to the paper when he says : <p> " I 'd be lying if I said we did n't have some concerns . We want to make sure we do everything possible for Lauren . It will be resolved . I ca n't give you an exact timeframe because it also depends on Lauren . " <p> Burmester believes that time is running out : " This is a big concern , most Olympic build-ups are four years or more , it takes time for a coach and swimmer to get to know each other , how to work together , what motivates them , how they adapt . " He said that Boyle 's dilemma is one that others in New Zealand have faced and levels serious criticism at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it wrong and are n't prepared to admit it . ( The ) same thing was happening when I retired and then decided to speak out about it , though back then I did n't share many of the details of how bad it was . I wish now I had . Transparency is not a word in their dictionary . I have heard that Alex Baumann has run up against a wall . " <p> In its backing for Boyle this year , Swimming New Zealand this year approved a world-record application form that calls for " All FINA rules " to be met despite the fact that the pool in which the swimmer swam the swiftest short-course time ever over freestyle failed to meet FINA minimum pool standards . FINA approved the record and provided SwimVortex.com with an extraordinary response to a question on rules : facilities rules do n't apply for world records . It is our belief that such a statement would not stand up under legal scrutiny , the FINA rule book and the world-record application form very clear on the matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive , tells the Sunday Star-Times that the federation is chasing " opportunities " for Boyle . It may also need to find a solution for the nation 's top man , freestyler Matt Stanley , who also split with Lyles this week . <h> Comments <p> When a swimmer breaks cover like this and confirms what has been widely known for some time then it tells you how bad it really is . <p> The ' byline ' for Swimming New Zealand is apparently ' Excellence , Integrity , Accountability ' . I do n't see much of that in the way that this critical relationship with Lauren has been managed . <p> If they can treat their prime asset with such deep contempt , you can only imagine how bad it is for the rest of the swimmers . <p> The history book of swimmers who have spoken out in New Zealand and who have survived is a short one in fact it may as well be non-existent . They either wait until they retire ( ie Moss Burmester ) or they commit sporting suicide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is such that they may finally take some notice but they have n't for the past two years , so why will they now ? <p> Expect a whole bunch of spin from Swimming New Zealand 's Australian import , Christian Renford to explain this away , but nothing is likely to change . <p> November 30 , 2014 <p> Unbelievable ! I had heard a rumour that she was n't going and after SNZ posted a press release trying to spin their way out of it , there was enough to read between the lines that she was not a happy bunny . <p> She has effectively been coaching herself , such is the ridiculous line-up of different coaches and coaching regimes . Added to the <p> November 30 , 2014 <p> .... ( continuing my comment , sorry , keyboard fumble ! ! ) <p> Added to the clear tensions in the SNZ set up , it is even more testament of what a superb athlete Lauren is that she has achieved what she has " despite " SNZ and not because of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , the Anthony Mosse Classic which is probably one of the biggest meets in the country run by Auckland , where Lauren and some of the other senior swimmers under David Lyles were in attendance . Apart from the bad behaviour of his swimmers ( not Lauren ) , there was an unmistakeable " cold shoulder " . She did n't talk with him , sit with him , interact with him the whole swim meet , in fact , she sat with her club and their club coach the whole weekend . It was noted by many at the time that things were not good which was confirmed by the clear body language in evidence . <p> For Lauren to speak out in the way she has , things are clearly worse than what is being reported . <p> November 30 , 2014 <p> While NCAP is n't known for its postgrad groups , maybe some time spent with Bruce Gemmell and many time zones away from NZ politics would be a good idea provided she is okay with the idea of going back to the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do much worse than NCAP . It would help Ledecky too . <p> November 30 , 2014 <p> You know , the best thing that ever happened to Lauren in terms of transforming her from just a 4 x 200 relay swimmer on the national team ( which was all Jan Cameron ever saw her as ) to the mature adult swimmer at the top of her career , was spending 4 years at CAL under Terri McGeever . They lengthened out her events and saw the huge potential , and probably frankly kept her in the water . By the time she returned to NZ , Mark Reagan was in situ . He clearly was the finisher , picking up what CAL saw and had her believing that she was capable of being an Olympic medallist and ranked No. 1 in the world . <p> So why did Mark Reagan leave ? The same old rubbish of a national federation knowing " best " and he lost the political battles . The swimmers are just commodities . So at a time when Lauren was getting into her stride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear that the swimmers at the time even secured private pool time and were going to have Mark coach them privately outside of the SNZ High Performance set up , but the swimmers were threatened to have their funding and support cut if they did that . None of them were prepared to go cold turkey . <p> Some have escaped . Glenn Snyders decided he had had enough and is with Dave Salo at Trojans and by all accounts is loving the new lease of life in his swimming . A huge number of younger swimmers are now realising that they are not going to make it in the SNZ environment and have progressively headed to OZ or the States . <p> The spin machine is in over-drive at the moment , because SNZ High Performance Centre 's very existence is based on podium finishes , and the only genuine prospect for Rio medals has decided she has had enough . <p> David November 30 , 2014 <p> I do think we need to be careful not to confuse SNZ and especially their coach with the coaching policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funder , an organization called Sport New Zealand . We made that mistake last time and replaced all the personnel but have ended up with the same bad result . The policy is wrong . No one could make it work . They got rid of Jan Cameron because she could n't make Miskimmin 's policy work . They said it was her fault . It was n't the policy was wrong . She in fact was a far more able person than the lot they have at SNZ just now . If Jan could not make Miskimmin 's policy work , this lot have no chance . Change the policy ! Please ! <p> Craig Lord December 1 , 2014 <p> Thanks David ... important to understand what stands in the way of people doing the job they feel they ought to be doing to get the best out of athletes ( and funding ) <p> Swimming Mom December 1 , 2014 <p> It is a big shame . SNZ seems to sound more and more like SSA . <p> December 1 , 2014 <p> Is anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international consultants are setting hard and fast performance based policies that look good in a computer , but in practice , will never work because humans are implementing them . It 's a tragedy that one of the best female distance swimmers in the world is having her Olympic preparations ruined by back-biting and internal politics . Especially in a country that only finds a talent like Boyle once in a blue moon . <h> American Spieth runaway 
 head coach to England 's successful Commonwealth Games campaign in Glasgow this year and mentor to Ruta Meilutyte , the Olympic breaststroke champion , has joined the chorus of protest over the IOC , FINA and NBC plans to hold night swimming finals at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . <p> Adding his voice to the " No to night swimming " campaign as the IOC deliberates over a plan to have finals in Brazil start at 10pm , Rudd told SwimVortex.com : " It 's outrageous . The best way to describe it is that it is disrespectful to the athletes , disrespectful to the event and what the Olympics means . <p> " We 've got the wood before the trees really . " <p> His comments , made to Liz Byrnes for SwimVortex in Doha , follow an IOC statement in which it said that while the final decision had not yet been made , " the athletes are happy in the case of swimming . FINA are happy . " <p> This evening in Doha , Ranomi Kromowidjojo , the freestyle champion who also claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I think it 's really sad that they do n't listen to the athletes . If everyone has to swim at night everyone has the same circumstances . But I think it 's not good for sport and for professional sport : it 's really sad . " <p> Rudd rejected the idea that athletes and coaches fear and wide have had any say , noting : <p> " I do n't know anybody that was consulted . That 's not to say that they were n't but I do n't know of anybody . It is not an athlete-centred decision . " <p> The rock and the hard place between which FINA is placing the stars at the core of its own constituency was summed up very well by British sprinter Fran Halsall , who said that if 10pm finals were dictated , they swimmers would have to accept it and deal with it . <p> Rudd noted her position when he said : <p> " That is the attitude you have got to have . They are the cards that are dealt , it 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made and is not going to change , it is our job to learn how to deal with it the best we can rather than gripe . " <p> However , he added : <p> " But if you are asking me is it the right decision and were the swimmers consulted and were the swimmers ' performances thought about in that decision then no . Now we 'll get on with it but it 's a shame that that is the decision we 've come to as a sport . " <p> Head coach to Britain , Bill Furniss , highlighted his role as the man who would have to have the team in best condition " whatever they throw at us " . He acknowledged that swimmers and coaches had not had a hand in the decision when he said : <p> " I do n't want to be getting involved in stuff that I think we might not be able to influence . I know I can influence whatever we throw at us . " <p> Rudd believed that " the people who are being looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most are those that are competing " , adding that if a 10pm finals decision is taken , as many assume , despite the IOC statement saying that timings had not been finalised : <p> " It 's a really disappointing outcome . There also seems to be a lot of smoke and mirrors : IOC saying it 's FINA , FINA saying it 's IOC and then both saying the athletes are fine with it when they are clearly not . It 's a shame . For a lot of guys it will be the pinnacle of their careers and they do n't get the right environment to maybe produce the performances you 'd hope they 'd produce . " <p> Asked if 10pm finals that would also dictate a 2 to 3am finish to the day for those who excel and then face the process of anti-doping , warm-down , media tour , massage , dinner and so forth , would require an artificial adjustment of body clock , Rudd replied : " There is only so much of that you can do and you are exactly right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and switch your body clock around . It 's a synthetic adjustment we should n't be having to make . <p> He noted , too , that health was an issue : " There are problems for the immune system and all of that : if you are racing in the final day six , seven , eight it 's maybe when it 's going to catch people out . People are going to do a revised plan of how they their life for 10,14 days going in and then you have got the meet itself which is another week so it 's quite a long period of time to try and make those adjustments . " <p> On the issue of how it would affect multi-eventers , Rudd said : <p> " It will become a bit of a war of attrition . It will be the most resilient athletes that win the medals in the circumstances they 're dealt with rather than the best athletes . That might affect the number of world and Olympic records that are broken and that kind of thing which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at this competition . " <p> Looking ahead to a crisis pending while peering at a bygone mess of FINA 's making , Rudd added : <p> We are starting to put the shiny suit era behind us which is fantastic for us as a sport . It could be a farily dull Olympics in terms of how many records that will go because of the circumstances . There will still be champions , there will still be medals and there will still be stories but we might not see as many world firsts as we would if the circumstances were more natural . <p> When Meilutyte claimed Olympic gold in London she was 15 , under the age at which child actors and singers and others in the entertainment must not actors can be asked to work after 9 and 10pm in several countries that have leading contenders for the Rio podium in swimming . On music talent shows in Europe and the United States there have been performers who had to sit out rounds if the broadcast time was after 10pm because to have performed would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA and NBC believe , however , that it is not an issue to have 14 to 17 year old athletes and there will be a fair few of those in the pool at Rio 2016 appearing on a world stage , lights and all , after 10pm if the NBC plan is given a green light . <p> Asked how he would prepare Meilutyte , who added the breaststroke world s/c crown to her treasury in Doha , should 10pm finals be confirmed , Rudd through a smile , said : " I have a plan . It is going to stay as my plan . " <h> Comments <p> Anan December 7 , 2014 <p> Hi Craig , I do n't know about the decision mechanics , but if it is a matter of money as suggested in one of your previous article , I guess Brazilians hosts should point that they are the one paying the Olympic Games bill . And I believe that Olympic Committee should pay attention at not making a wrong move because , if you do n't respect your host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your OG in the future . Unless the OG are just a way to make money for the decisions makers . One funny thing would be Mr Putin , requesting his FINA 's friends to interfer and make the OG swimming finals appropriate for russian viewers ... <p> December 7 , 2014 <p> The planned time is not only bad for swimmers but also for viewers on the spot . <p> Why to ask anyone building huge stands for tens of thousands spectators if you are about hold competing at night-time . I mean if everything is done for TV , why to build any stands at all . <p> Of course everything must be done for people on the spot . To even suggest such a stupid time for competitions just shows how far the decaying process of IOC are already . <p> Craig Lord December 8 , 2014 <p> Anan , yes that would be funny ... and the point you make is sound about hosting ... the timing should be acceptable to the hosts in all respects ... anything else is lacking in respect ... its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lawrie Cox December 8 , 2014 <p> Here is a better idea why not recast the Games as Vampire games ( works late at night ) and consistent with sucking the lifeblood out of the event . The decision ( or lack thereof ) is an insult to the sport and its participants to suit tv in one timezone . It did n't work well in Bejing and whilst current swimmers will demur that we will get on with the job the rest of us should be open and publicly critical of the timing . We got to all other events with morning heats and night finals the Olympics should be no different . The lack of support at the blazerati is no great surprise but i encourage others to stand up and support the normalisation of the swim program . If we believe this so good why not put rowing on by torchlight at midnight and fencing at 3:00am to suit the downtime for the broadcasters ? Of course the blazerati at IOC would object . FINA needs some gonads and stop the rot . <p> The thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestation of Fina 's continuing dismissal of its core stakeholders the swimmers . <p> Jacco and Jon are to be applauded for their public condemnation of the plan . Their views are obviously the tip of a dissatisfied and increasingly disillusioned iceberg of opinion within the ' coal-face ' of the sport . The are distancing themselves more and more and the likely outcome will be a severing of the overstretched bureaucratic bindings . <p> Just in the past few years we 've seen : <p> * The shiny suit ( and I will repeat again what I said to Craig and Nick in private , " Without your persistent endeavor ' they ' would have got away with it . " ) and the Federation 's abject refusal to asterisk the shiny performances . * The slippery-slidy award to Vladimir Putin without even consulting their own governing Bureau . * The sanctioning of a world record in a pool which does not comply with their own competition rules ( which apparently do not apply to competitions ) . * The ignoring of legitimate questions from Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the world 's leading newspapers . This one is close to my heart because I have sent emails to the Fina education department which have been totally ignored , not even acknowledged , and also emails to specific individuals on the Fina TC which have also received not a single pixel in response . There seems to be a corporate policy to only communicate with * The deliberate refusal to sanction the implementation of video backup for judges . * The conscious ignorance of available video evidence of cheating and/or accidental mistakes ( let 's be magnanimous ) viz Katinka Hosszu 's huge double dolphin kicks during the breaststroke turns in the Doha 400IM , and Otylia Jedrzejczak 's blatant one-handed touch at the 2005 World Championships . I am sure many , many more examples of irrefutable evidence are out there on Youtube. * The refusal to recognize the toxic continuance of Lothar Kipke 's Silver Pin award . * The refusal to strike out the historical record of the DDR world records by swimmers whose documented history proves they were doped . This refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic champions and medalists , with the continuing disrespect to the swimmers who actually swam clean . <p> This mention of the IOC brings us back to the Rio nonsense . For the IOC to say the swimmers are happy with the plan for late finals can only produce one of two conclusions : either Fina has lied to the IOC or the IOC is as disrespectful to its constituents as Fina is . <p> Let 's assume the IOC is legitimate and that Fina told them they had consulted the sport and the sport was happy . Fina 's attitude on non-consultation and rough-riding over constitutional governance policies smacks only of one thing : uncontrolled and extreme arrogance . <p> A definition of arrogance which fits very well here is , " A false and offensive display of overbearing superiority or self-importance . " That really sums up the whole visible culture of the Federation , does n't it ? <p> Another definition says , " The assumption that your self-worth is far superior to others . A false sense of pride . Foolishly believing that everyone is inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow down to your grace .

At all costs . And the Rio plan indicates that they will chase the almighty dollar no matter what the cost to the swimmer . Swimmers are replaceable ; there will be another crop along soon . <p> The values and attitudes of the swimmers and coaches is that world records are a welcome aspect of development and advantageous to the sport if they are achieved under the right circumstances . The right circumstances have never comprised doped physiologies and they do not comprise swimming in the middle of the night and sleeping in the middle of the day . <p> One contributor astutely points out that basketball will usurp swimming anyway at that time of night for USA audiences .

 the former Commonwealth swimming champion and president of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) , is to head an independent commission investigating allegations of systematic doping in Russia and cover-ups in which money was taken to sweep positive tests under the carpet . The inquiry will includes a leading figure from the Court of Arbitration for Sport . <p> FINA 's ruling Bureau was asked by The Times newspaper and this author whether FINA had contacted ARD to seek further information about allegations that link Putin to doping and Russian swimming to the crisis afflicting athletics and its governing body , the IAAF . Six days on and no reply has been received . <p> Pound , a lawyer , will chair the three-man commission and will be joined by a fellow Canadian , Professor Richard McLaren , a longstanding member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport . <p> " The independent commission has the vital task of reviewing the allegations aired during the documentaries , as well as all other information received separately by Wada , to determine if there have been any violations to anti-doping rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is found that there have been violations or breaches of the rules , Wada will ensure that any individuals or organisations concerned are dealt with in an appropriate fashion under the World Anti-Doping Code . <p> " The commission will be given the resources it needs in order for the investigation to be carried out thoroughly , and so that , in turn , clean athletes across the world are reassured that the anti-doping system is working in their best interests . " <p> A third member of the independent commission will be announced by Wada at a later stage . <p> The timing of the inquiry is uncertain as yet but SwimVortex.com understands that the ARD Editorial Team will cooperate with the inquiry . <p> The development places FINA in an ever more awkward place . When Sir Craig says " ... if it is found that there have been violations or breaches of the rules , Wada will ensure that any individuals or organisations concerned are dealt with in an appropriate fashion under the World Anti-Doping Code " , it is assumed that the scope of the inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flies in the face of the WADA Code and international sports rules . <h> Comments <p> Almost as mush as you like the idea of getting to the truth ( that slightly bigger issue .. ) , one assumes , <p> December 16 , 2014 <p> Certainly , the truth is paramount . It 's just also nice to know the people seeking the truth are diligent , capable investigators . Ca n't wait to hear their findings . <p> Craig Lord December 16 , 2014 <p> Yes , it 'll be fascinating , ... he 's not tended to be among those associated with the realms of silence and sitting on fences ... <p> KeithM December 16 , 2014 <p> Good luck to them . They 're going to be dealing with the murky trappings of reinforced Russian red tape and some sly apparatchiks .

There are some big aspects of this that simply can not be hidden and washed over by Russia . Some back home will be sold on the PR and obfuscation and the Russian media have certainly attempted to portray it all as lies told by " a country that finished 6th in Nordic skiing " , as one report put it , without quite getting it that broadcasters in certain other countries do n't tend to take up investigations on the basis of where their nordic ski team finishes at the winter Olympics ... ultimately the view from within is somewhat irrelevant beyond Russia 's borders on this one . It will come down to how Pound and Co interpret what for me from what I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of 150 athletes and blood oddities ... something of a red herring for particular reasons ) . What will be interesting is to see what FINA does as the story reaches swimming , as it will ... <p> Something Fishy December 17 , 2014 <p> So they uncover the truth and all the rumours and allegations turn out to be fact . What then ? The " Putin bloc " Olympics with Russia and it 's cronies on the one hand , and everyone else at the " official " Olympics ? <p> Nothing of significance is going to happen . The guilty parties will feign remorse in the Press , and just run a tighter doping ship with fewer leaks in future . <p> I know its very George Orwell and Big Brother , but we 're fast approaching the day where all new-born children will have to have their dna registered at birth , blood samples stored and be bar-coded .

She then broke the individual freestyle world record in the semi-finals and went on to win the gold medal for the event , the first Australian to do so since Dawn Fraser 40 years earlier . <p> Henry retired at 25 years of age . She won three gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics ( , 4x100m , 4x100m medley ) , all in world record time and claimed four world titles in her career .

The world record now stands faster , courtesy of the use of performance-enhancing suits : 2008 Olympic champion Britta Steffen won the 2009 world title in a time faster than her Olympic victory just a year earlier . <p> Born on November 17 , 1983 in Brisbane , Queensland , Jodie Clare Henry , raced on after her 2004 Olympic successes , claiming silver in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Melbourne behind teammate Libby Lenton , the rival who had broken the Olympic champion 's world record over .

Mocanu later worked for the Romanian Olympic Committee . <p> And from the wider realm of Aquatics <p> LAO ( CHN ) : Lao Lishi , born December 12,1987 in Zhanjiang , Guangdong is a female diver from the People s Republic of China .

He played water polo for the Yugoslavian National Team winning the silver medal at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo and improving to the gold medal at 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City . Eight years later he coached the team from Holland to a bronze medal . <p> IRENE VAN DER LAAN ( NED ) : In her prime , Irene Van Der Laan was one of the fastest and most durable marathon swimmers in the world .

This number might have been much higher but for the American boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games . Perhaps of greater historical significance was his role as head of the delegation for the first American team to visit China in 1973 which helped pave the way for normalization of relations between the two nations and the re-entry of China into FINA family and the Olympic movement . <p> DONALD WATSON ( USA ) : An assistant coach to the legendary Doc , Don Watson became one of the most successful high-school swimming coaches in history , producing swimmers who earned 167 High ? ? school All-America , 4 Olympic medals and multiple world professional marathon swimming titles .

 , said after the test was announced that he was " shocked and depressed " . He maintained that he had made a mistake , as had his doctor , who was barred for a year but continued to work with Sun Yang on the China swimming team during his period of suspension . Dr Ba Zhen 's case if not the first of its kind in China , where coaches are known to have continued to work during periods of suspensions announced to the world . <p> WADA continues to press FINA and others involved on the cases of Sun and Dr Ba and is seeking further details of why is took so long for those responsible FINA and CHINADA to report the case . Spokesman for WADA Ben Nichols told : " Since it was notified of the decision in November , WADA has raised the concerns it has that relate to the case , including the delayed public reporting of the decision . " <p> Until FINA and CHINADA provide the answers WADA wants , the international anti-doping agency will make no further comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the substance was banned , and that he took it as part of prescription medication for heart palpitations . Trimetazidine is currently banned in competition but from January 1 will be downgraded in the WADA Code . <p> It was May 17 when Sun produced the test sample that would turn positive ; it was July when he sat in a hearing that resulted in a 3-month ban for him and a one-year ban for Dr Ba ; it was late September when Sun raced to three gold medals at the Asian games ; it was November 24 when the case finally surfaced , well beyond the reporting deadlines of the WADA Code and the rules of FINA . <p> If CHINADA 's delay may be explained by its own mistakes in not making clear the status of the substance that Sun Yang tested positive for , the roles of the CSA and FINA must be called into question . <p> The CSA must have known about the case at the very latest in July and would then have had a duty to report the matter to FINA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is negligent ; if the CSA did not report the case in timely fashion , then the question to FINA is : where is the penalty for having broken your rules and those of the WADA Code ? <p> WADA had considered action after Sun failed a doping test in May and was banned for three months by the Chinese federation but it was only announced in November after Sun had won more titles at the Asian Games . <p> Nichols confirmed : " WADA has written to CHINADA however , raising its concern over the delayed public reporting of the case . " <h> Comments <p> Justice December 18 , 2014 <p> Dennis Cotterell is disappointed that " Sun Yang was let down by his swimming federation " and after 8 years of working relationships with the prodigal son , he is confidence with his natural ability . WADA has reviewed the full case of Sun Yang has decided not to further pursue this unfortunate incident . <p> Craig Lord December 18 , 2014 <p> Justice , Dennis may say what he feels to be accurate but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation can not be seen to be working with people it can not trust in terms of full transparency , including the absolute need for a swimmer and a doctor to inform a coach of all substances being taken for medical conditions ( never mind banned substances ... for how can you set schedules without being sure that the swimmer in the water is medically fit for the training required for a 14:31 free ? No idea if the coach was fully informed but I do n't doubt that he should have been . As for WADA , it did not decide " not to pursue " the case further ; pursue it it did and further pursue it it continues to do in terms of its communication with those who delayed reporting the case well beyond the terms of the WADA Code . What WADA is doing is leaving the 3-month suspension in place as it stands , presumably because it believes that level of penalty fair under the circumstances that it knows more about than any of us . The unfortunate thing , as you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same light again by many in the sport , mistake or not and that is the case because the reporting delay has led to a significant loss of trust . In that sense , Cotterell is quite right . <p> Justice December 18 , 2014 <p> I hate to believe he was intentionally set-up because of his wayward and rebellious attitude towards the state . Imagine , he was jailed for driving without a license and had to apologize to the public . The event of which he was involved with a banned stimulant does n't make sense as he could have won easily and he need not to stride any sweat to be represented in Asian Games ! ! The Chinese swimming fraternities just could n't stomach his " arrogant and egoistic " character . I was observing him during Asian Games medal ceremony and he was the only one who positioned his bouquet flowers on his heart and singing national anthem ( most patriotic ) . Obviously he was entrapped and under pressured being reined in . As for Australia , the former prime minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable after L ' Equipe exposed the investigations by ASDA of his abnormal high levels of testosterone and LH hormones after being detected &gt; level 4 to 6 . Anyway , no Chinese prominent officials stood up for Sun Yang except Mr. Cotterell . <p> Craig Lord December 18 , 2014 <p> Justice , yes , it does look from afar as though someone does n't like him very much . As for Thorpe , his was an adverse finding in common with hundreds and hundreds of such cases every year when a reading raises a question . Further inquiry is then made and in Thorpe 's case , he did not test positive and experts concluded : no case to answer . I hardly think that it is fair to compare a " no case to answer " with a positive test and suspension . <p> Mariella Frostrup has

It would be an interesting exercise to list the high performance swimmers pre Commonwealth Games/Pan Pacs and compare the list to who is actually still training at the centre . Swimmers have voted with their feet . The fact that NZ 's best swimmer Lauren Boyle was without a specialist coach for 6 months and had to pull out of Doha is an indictment on the current regime and the lack of regard for providing our top swimmers with tailored coaching solutions . <p> December 20 , 2014 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So they decide to effectively close the two High Performance Centres ( certainly for senior high performance ) ; one in Auckland and the other in Wellington . The one in Wellington should never have been formed in the first place , but they ploughed on deviantly despite huge opposition to it . <p> They have wasted millions upon millions on the HPC white elephants and surprise , surprise , the swimmers have figured ( most of them , sadly , way too late ) that Swimming New Zealand can not deliver on what it promises . <p> I watched Lauren Boyle around pool deck at the Anthony Mosse Classic in Auckland in January earlier this year and it was obvious that she had no intention of interacting with Lyles and Loader .

 : The Skills Swimming Needs To Talk Of Progress <p> As we reach the end of 2014 , we reflect on a special day back in January in Lund , Sweden . On the podium was a sorority of swimming thinkers , doers and movers . One of those who took to the stage that day was Prof. Joan Duda . Below , is what her work has been about of late . It was and is my believe that swimming would be a better place if it listened to the messages and experiences related on that day and then harnessed the direction and good practice inherent in all that was spoken <p> I had the privilege , as moderator , to sit alongside Duda , Dana Vollmer , Caitlin Leverenz , Allison Wagner , and Dr Fiona McLachlan in end-of-day forum on a stage at the World Aquatic Development Conference . The questions from largely Scandinavian coaches were often bright and pertinent . <p> Here is what I penned at the time and I now publish it here at SwimVortex to mark the moment when we grant a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize is any single child through to any single program through to any single nation that has a better experience in sport as a result of the wisdom that was on offer in Lund last january . The small recognition we can offer here goes to : <p> Duda , Wagner , Leverenz , Vollmer and <p> the organisers and at the WADC and the Swedish Center for Aquatic Research , including CEO ? rn Holmberg and his team of Marianne Lager ? and Hilde Elise Hansen , together with Head of Research Advisory Board Milton Nelms , his wife Shane Gould and others who contribute to the fine work related to WADC . <p> FINA , if you 're out there forget Putin et al here 's the folk you should be talking to and working with if swimming and swimmers and getting the best out of young people in a way that shapes who we are and how we turn out are really what you 're interested in . <h> Aquatic Climate Change <p> At the end of a day of enlightenment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it struck me that I 'd heard one of the most important presentations that swimming has to hear . If the intelligence delivered by Prof. Joan Duda filters through to government agencies responsible for sports education , to FINA , domestic federations , down to clubs , schools and any organisation and peoples who serve as guardians to young folk passing through their governance , we will all truly be able to speak of " progress " . <p> We 're talking climate change in sport . Out with the squally , the damp , the inclement nature of chance and circumstance ; in with the ' come on in , the water 's lovely ' because we intend it to be like that and we 'll work on that being the case every single day for every single child that travels through a sports program . Utopia ? Not at all . <p> The best-practices that can make it happen are of this world , tried and tested , the mission remaining to spread the word and have decision-makers become pioneers on the pathway to having healthy experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life skills and a desire to keep sport a part of their regular routine . <p> Many a daily regime is supposed to make young folk " better " at what they do . Better is a big word : in swimming , it often means time on the clock , a gold medal , a gold-medal goal met in a world in which ' victory ' is for the few . <p> What of the way we get there ? What of the way coaches and others seek to get their charges there ? What of the culture and environment behind the scenes , stage left and right beyond the gaze of the public ( and in some cases even the parent ) ? <p> How much of the process of getting people to be " better " speaks to harnessing healthy motivation and coupling it to this process described by Joan L.

At least half the audience had its hand in the air . Second question : was acquiring psychological skills part of their official coach-training curriculum and qualification ? No hands . <p> That is to say that while many coaches go out and try to find the knowledge that they need to be as good as they can be ( sometimes in what might be described a random way ) , those governing what it is to be a coach , what it is to be a guardian of young folk in sport , do not recognise some of the most critical skills required for the job as essential to ensuring a safe , healthy and fruitful environment in the birthing pool of talent and potential . <p> The title of Prof. Duda 's presentation signposted the way forward : <p> The Need for Empowering Coaching ? to Promote Sustained and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done talking and the applause subsided , the key challenge was clear to me : how fast , how soon could that intelligence and the works of a **26;599;TOOLONG research project be converted to standard practice in swimming and a brighter place for many more children ? ( Among other challenges , another was also very clear we had heard from five fine thinkers in aquatic sports , all women , all with critical messages to deliver to a sport in which very few women indeed sit on the top tables at national and international level ) . <p> Hope rests in the logic , clarity and obvious truth of the argument . <p> It takes deep-seated knowledge and confidence , self and in subject , to stand and deliver a speech without referring to notes . To some extent , all the main speakers in Lund did that . Prof. Duda was the shining example . Not only did she know her stuff like the back of her hand but she was able to pass it on in a way that left so many in the hall that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central pillar of coaching and culture in the pool . <h> Speaking Beyond Performance <p> Professor of Sport and Exercise Psychology at the School of Sport , Exercise and Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of Birmingham , Duda was fuelled not only by intellect , knowledge , rigorously tested research and a passion to improve the lot of all who enter the world of sport at all levels . <p> Her presentation came at the end of a day when we had heard from Australia-based academic from New Zealand Dr Fiona and American swimmers Caitlin Leverenz , Dana Vollmer and Allison Wagner . Professor Duda noted that we had all heard the " good , the bad and the ugly " from those who spoke before her that day and some of what she had heard she said that she " never want to see this kind of thing happen ever again " . <p> She proceeded to explain how those who work at the cutting edge of sport , those at the interface between children , young adults and learning , could ensure a better future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , results that transcend a time on a clock , a medal in a trophy cabinet . <p> " We want to speak beyond performances today , " she said . <p> " We want young people to leave swimming as better people , people who have learned how to set goals and know how to strive for them , people who respect others as well as themselves . These are things that we all aspire to . Of course , we all know that talent can be turned off , that young people can be lost to sport , that instead of enhancing their experience , their journey through sport compromises it . We know young people suffer burn out and drop out . " <p> Many have fallen shy of best practice , as we heard from Wagner , while the learning curve delivers some fine examples of betterment of the environment in which swimmers swim , as we heard from Vollmer and Leverenz . <p> Prof. Duda described her roles as active researcher as well as practitioner in the field of sport psychology for almost 30 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In her work as a sport psychology consultant with coaches and athletes ( she also works with vocational and professional dancers and musicians , folk who must , like athletes , perform ) , she draws from existing research and major findings from her and other research groups around the world . That scientifically grounded practice is coupled to her observations as a practitioner , her experiences as an athlete , and what she observed as a coach . <p> Impossible not to grasp the thread of the day in hand and head as Prof. Duda referred back to the messages delivered by the sorority of thinkers who spoke before her . Dr. had laid out the the philosophical bases of realizing performance excellence as well as personal excellence in swimming and noted the need for transformation of the culture in the sport . From the three American high achievers from the pool who followed the Australia-based academic from New Zealand , we heard poignant tales from the book of consequence at the interface between coach and athlete . <p> This came down to what coaches do , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argued that theory and research help us to understand the stories we 'd heard and then pose critical questions , such as : <p> " Why are some coach and/or athlete behaviours maladaptive or ? What are the mechanisms/processes involved ? " <p> Prof. Duda painted a picture of the perfect world in which every child 's talent is optimized through positive environment and experience . Goals and practices geared to having youngsters rebound from mistakes and poor performance are attainable in a place that prizes , maintains and nurtures confidence and self esteem and helps youngsters to develop as people as well as competitive swimmers ( or athletes of another kind ) . <p> It is not hard to find examples of swimmers who do not maximize their ability , who are riddled with anxiety , who doubt their ability and exhibit low self worth . Young folk who too often suffer burnout and dropout , their talent and potential lost to the sport , their journey in life affected as a result of a poor experience in their formative years . <h> Motivation <p> What makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing outcomes . To explain , she trained her spotlight on the following : <h> The nature and quality of motivation <p> The Keys to unlock quality motivation including : <p> She advocated building and maintaining competence by fostering task involvement ( humans do n't thrive when they feel isolated ) <p> As in swimming , the type of goggles you choose counts for much in the world of goal theory . <p> A question for coaches and teachers which of these do you wear when you work with young people ? <p> Task Glasses are worn by coaches who work with their charges to set goals and find ways to help young people to achieve them : <p> Here the coach is socially supportive , caring , concerned , a coach who sees his or her role as one of helping the charge get the best out of themselves ; the swimmers is seen as a person not just an athlete in pursuit of a result . <p> Ego Glasses are worn by those apt to say ' my way or no way ' , apt to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach who is controlling ( through use of rewards , for example ) , intimidating and places conditions on performance . <p> If one is a world in which each of the participants has a role to play , has a goal to work towards , tasks to help them to get there and in which there is enjoyment , self-esteem , well-being and respect for self and others , then the other is a world on the opposite side of that coin , one that stretches to the darker reaches of bad practice in sport and life . Pygmalion practices , you might say . Said Prof. Duda : <p> " Cheating will take place in ego-involved environments . " <p> Many in aquatic sports may have examples of either or both that spring to mind . Some who fall into one category for some may well be another for others . A broad spectrum of experience , the extremities of which are wonderfully portrayed in popular works such as Roald Dahl 's Matilda : Miss Agatha Trunchbull , headmistress of Crunchem Hall Academy , an Olympic thrower turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honey , who values every child for who they are and seeks to free the magic locked in each of them . <p> Fabulous fiction . Reality can be darker still and void of humour . Swimming has been awash with bad practice , including the darker reaches of doping and other forms of abuse . Of late in the US , swimming has been steeped in a scandal of abusive coaches and the bad culture , one that transcends sport , that allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged for so long , decades in some cases . In many of those cases , the coaches concerned were assessed , judged and given status on the basis of how many big medals and/or world records could be counted in their shoal . Former Olympic coaches of leading swim nations are in the count of the prosecuted and the banned for life . <p> In some nations , you may be shown , by people with pride in their ' system ' ( as I have been ) , a diving pool with 200 and more children aged 6 to 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you may cringe as one young chap lands on the outstretched arm of another and you may wonder at method and motive when the injured child is sent crying and alone , uncomforted , to leave the pool and get changed . From such a system have Olympic and world champions emerged . They are the survivors , the shining examples . <p> Gold has too often blinded the eye to criminal , the bad and the ugly practice . <p> Prof Duda and her team are not dealing in the world of the criminal . Rather , they seek to tackle the kind of poor practice that leads to low quality motivation , low self-esteem , drop out and feelings of failure that can affect development of child and young adult for many years in life beyond sport . <p> There are , of course , myriad examples of world-class athletes who have only good things to say about those who have steered them through their formative years in sport . Read the words of Vollmer and Leverenz , speak to Ryan Lochte , hear the words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program as teenagers and you know that good work has been at play . None will tell you that it has been easy , soft , cushioned and many have tales of truths told that some in a squad handle better than others . In the course of any sports experience , there will be highs and lows . How those are handled will determine the direction in which the young sportsperson or even the mature athlete travels . <p> This year , our man in America John Lohn interviewed Olympic freestyle champion Allison Schmitt . As I read her words , it was impossible not to think of the work of Prof. Joan Duda and her team . Said Wagner : <p> " Bob Bowman and I have gone through a lot in the past six or seven years . He has seen me grow from a naive , happy go lucky to a mature 23-year-old and has always been there . I do n't know what his magic is , but he always seems to know exactly what to say or do to get me motivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training and it has always worked for me . He has helped me grow as a person and a swimmer . " <p> Which leads us to the research project that is lighting a path to a brighter future for young people in sport : Empowering Coaching ? and the PAPA Project . <p> What is motivation ? Is it the ability to get in a pool and appear to be working hard each day ? Is it being at the pool because a friend is there ? Is it being at the pool because you do n't want to let your parents down ? Is it being there because you love swimming ? Is it being there because what you can see what you get out of it ? <p> Deeper understanding is called for by Prof. Duda and her team . " We need to move beyond understanding motivation as a quantity to a quality , " she suggested on a fine day in Lund as she turned to the European Commission funded PAPA Project that she heads . <p> The project centred on youth football and considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in the sport . PAPA , spanning five European countries ( England , France , Greece , Norway and Spain ) delivered and rigorously tested with different methods the Empowering Coaching ? programme . <p> The sample was football . The gold in it glisters for all sport ( indeed , you may well read into it many a fine application in all aspects of a child 's education , sporting or otherwise ) . The training concept has evolved over the past 20 years and more . It draws from Prof. Duda 's research and applied work , including an earlier version of the programme that was embedded in the Healthier Gymnast scheme run by USA Gymnastics . <p> Why not swimming ? The sport is brimming with daily interaction , the world over , between teachers/coaches and kids setting out on the road to finding themselves . Many have good experiences and too many do not . <p> Evidence-based , the Empowering Coaching ? programme is grounded in contemporary theories of motivation , optimal development and behavioural change . Look through the topics covered by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box to tick the things that Duda and Co are getting at . <h> The PAPA project <p> A four-year research grant from the European Commission funded what is the largest ever research project into coach-created environments . It involved almost 10,000 children . <p> The point was to find the best ways to unlock potential psychological benefits from engagement in youth sport , including the promotion of children 's psychosocial development and feelings of self worth . <p> The vehicle and vision was to work with coaches to help them to understand how they can create a more empowering motivational climate in training and competition ; to make sport more enjoyable for all children in a programme ; to have children find good reason to stick at it and include sport in their lives for the long term ; and those to promote health through healthier experiences in sport . <p> The project run by Prof. Duda was partnered by seven European Universities , namely , Bergen ( as well as the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences ) in Norway , a nation with close ties to the EU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France , Thessaly in Greece ; and York St John in England . <p> The work focussed on football , If participation is high and the sample available for testing large and varied , then the beautiful game is a world in which many of us can recall witnessing bad habits and poor behaviour when it comes to providing the best experience for children . The demands of high participation dictate a need for large numbers of coaches and teachers . Not all are trained to the same standards , while in many an average local football club the youth side is often left in the hands of volunteers who lack adequate training for the role of ' coaching ' children . <p> Add to that picture the pushy parent barking commands , comments , opinions and even insults from the sideline of a game of eight-year-olds and you not only have a poor environment but one in which the potential for harm is high . <h> The Quality of Motivation <p> Let 's return to motivation ands the motivational climate in which young people thrive or not . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . It is often looked as being either high or low . PAPA adds the word quality to the mix . <p> High quality motivation = " I swim because I enjoy it " and " I swim because I value the benefits " <p> In Lund , Dana Vollmer related an example of a little girl who told her that she swam because it made her dad happy . That fits a different category : <p> Low quality motivation = " I swim because I would feel guilty if I quit and I know how much it means to mum or dad " <p> There is also emphasis on winning for winning 's sake to be cautious , as in : " I swim to win the freestyle on Saturday " . So , if the child finishes second in a best time by a big margin , all is lost . <p> Amotivation ( none ) = " I do n't know why I swim " <p> In an empowering climate , children recognise the importance of striving for mastery goals and doing their best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they find their voice and know they have a choice . <p> In a climate in which they are disempowered , children feel intimidated , controlled by coach or parent , They suffer feelings of rejection and isolation . Think about the program you know best : does the coach encourage swimmers to outperform others rather than emphasise the need for each swimmer to be take charge of and be responsible for their own progress and personal development and take pride in their achievements . <h> Findings <p> Recent findings from the PAPA Project showed that coaches who participated in the 6-hour Empowering Coaching workshop changed their behaviour to be more empowering ( and less disempowering ) based not only on the views of the young players ( as assessed via validated questionnaires ) but also via objective observations of the coaches in action . Coaches ( and their players ) who attended the workshop were compared to those who did not attend , the presence of a control group important to the strong evidence that is emerging from PAPA . <p> Feedback from coaches in the PAPA project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ' who won ? ' I asked them ' how did you do ? ' I got a very different response " ; and " my terminology is changing ... Its " can you try to ... " instead of " ok , I want you to do this and this is how you do it " . <p> The latter feeds directly into how Milt Nelms , a guiding light in the WADC and its related work , interacts with swimmers . You will not here him say ' do that ' , ' lift that ' , ' reach for this ' . What you hear is " how did it feel ... " ; " when did you notice a change " and other such inquiries that ask the swimmer to understand , interpret and feel their relationship with the water , their quality of movement and their ability to replicate what not only feels right but makes them more efficient , faster . The athlete is not following instruction , he or she is being guided through the encouragement to acquire skills through a direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they , and they in particular not they as part of a uniform group of people , can work with the element and harness those things helpful to efficient and fast swimming . Their goal is ' the best I can be ' . Focus , belonging , ownership , self-worth , vitality and fun all flow . <h> Conclusions <p> In her concluding remarks , Prof. Duda noted that coaches play a vital role in promoting athletes ' healthy , optimal and sustained engagement in sport . <p> : There is a need to work with coaches to enable them to foster an empowering motivational climate that will help to optimise and sustain young swimmers ' sport experiences , enhance their well-being , and promote their personal growth , " said Prof. Duda . <p> Her work , drawing from a large and compelling scientific literature , challenges the assumption that development of swimmers ' well being and personal growth is NOT in opposition to creating performance outcomes . She noted : <p> " If we get the motivational climate right ... and also give the athletes skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via systematic psychological skills training ... we have a win-win situation . We can realise both those goals and aspirations . " <p> In the forum discussion that followed her presentation , there was no denying the wave of strong feeling that the theory and research based Empowering Coaching ? programme ought to become a fundamental course required for all swimming , diving , synchro and water polo coaches and teachers in all countries , learn-to-swim teachers right through to Olympic coach . <p> Of all the comments made in the forum , this one stood out : <p> " If we do n't get the climate right , then how much swimming coaches know about technique , strategy , the physiological aspects of swimming training and so on does n't matter if we hope to empower our swimmers " <p> The large-scale and successful PAPA project is being rolled out , with more countries tapping into the betterment of sport . Prof. Duda and her team are now leading efforts to form the Empowering Coaching social enterprise at the University of Birmingham in Britain with hubs and partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This social enterprise centres on the dissemination and further development of such theory and evidence-based programmes at the interface of teacher and pupil in sport . <p> In collaboration with the university leaders involved or planning to be involved in the project , the Empowering Coaching ? programme ( and related schemes such as Empowering Teaching ? , Empowering Parents ? , Empowering Dance ? ) , negotiations are being held with various sports governing bodies to include the training ands skills set of PAPA in coaching and teaching qualifications and awards . <p> How about Empowering Swimming ? To achieve that requires an upgrade to the status of the coach and teacher in a way that many will want to embrace as a critical part of their work in helping to unlock the gold in every child that passes their way . <p> The little girl 
 home page this festive season to the best of the best of 2014 , our Awards and the choices of our readers sitting alongside a collation of all our coverage of the major international events this year as well as a reminder of the failings of FINA in its role as guardian of the sport of swimming . <p> We hope you enjoyed our coverage of swimming and that you found some of our work thought-provoking on topics ripe for debate in a sport searching for good direction . Thanks to those who joined in discussions and left comments and to those many more who communicate with us on a regular basis . <p> We also take the opportunity to thank those who support out work , including Speedo and its work with us and commitment to World Rankings powered by Fastskin , to FINIS , Arena , , private benefactors and those federations , press officers , fellow journalists , coaches and teams who provide valuable help . <p> Merry Christmas and a Happy , Healthy New Year To All <p> No awards can account for the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big to small around the world each day nor the devotion and dedication shown by athletes , coaches , parents and others who play an important part in the pursuit of podium places at the helm of world-class sport . <p> Even so , while recognising the many unnamed who deserve to take a bow , there are some obvious candidates for top honours , people who have travelled a steeper curve of excellence one way or another . And on that note , we start here with : <h> The Outstanding Achievement of the Year <p> Another year of excellence for a swimmer and her coach on a rare curve to the pantheon as a standout in world waters : Katie Ledecky , coached by Bruce Gemmell at Nation 's Capital , Washington , USA Still a teenager and two years beyond Olympic gold , she excelled in short-course yards , too , this year , but such things are mere footnotes to the global significance of Ledecky : she is the only swimmer in the world this year to set world long-course records in aOlympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two other efforts , over , had her chasing down the history of men 's swimming and writing history among women . <p> Ledecky 's pathfinding included : <p> a 3:58.37 world record as the only woman ever to have broken 4mins in a textile suit <p> an 8:11.00 world record in the 800 freestyle , four seconds clear of the only swimmer who matches her swimming pace but ca n't turn ( relatively speaking ... ) : Jazmin Carlin ( GBR ) , away in the second best textile suit time ever <p> a 15:28.36 stunner that left Ledecky nearly a half-minute ahead of Lauren Boyle ( NZL ) , world ranked No2 <p> There were two other world marks art either extreme of the spectrum above along the way this year , while Ledecky has dropped to a 1:55.16 in the 200 freestyle , world No 2 this year . The sport has not seen the likes of that range since trailblazer of distance swimming Janet Evans set standards in 1988 and 1989 that would see out the 80s and stretch well beyond the 90s too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains to be seen as she targets the defence of her Olympic crown over and seeks to add honours elsewhere in Rio by 2016 . <p> This month Ledecky was ti be found weighing up the possibility of delaying enrollment to Stanford University until after Rio . Intent is as obvious as air to those who breath no need to speak of it or even be too conscious of it : in the realm of nature and the things that are as they are but never to be taken for granted . <p> Ledecky is honouring the blessings bestowed upon her with dedication , determination , discipline . She came good under the tutelage of Yuri Suguiyama and is now flourishing and extending her range and skills under Gemmell 's guidance . <p> Nation 's Capital this season earned top place in the 2015 USA Swimming Club Excellence program that recognises USA Swimming 's highest-performing clubs in the development of athletes 18 years and younger . Ledecky and Andrew Seliskar are among the club 's assets . <p> " Nation 's Capital Swim Club is honored to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , " said Tom Ugast , Chief Executive Officer of Nation 's Capital Swim Club . " This is truly a team effort by our athletes , coaches and families to work hard throughout the year to achieve the highest level in our sport . This is the first time we have won this award because of all the great other teams throughout the country . We are all proud to carry this honor for the next 12 months . " <p> Having Ledecky as the signpost to the future of women 's distance swimming contributed greatly to Gemmell being named American Swim Coaches Association Coach of the Year for the second straight year . Bob Bowman , Gregg Troy , David Marsh , Mike Bottom and Greg Meehan were the shortlisted pipped by Gemmell . Fine company that makes the honour all the more meaningful . <p> What makes each of those names significant is not the one or two senior swimmers , like Ledecky , who stand head and shoulders about the rest in the realms of the world-class , but the development of such talent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the burning deck and fast waters on which are trained for all the world to see . <p> Lucky is the coach who has a Ledecky , a Phelps and Lochte walk through the door but only if they know what to do next generation after generation . <p> What we 've seen from Ledecky since 2012 is constant progress on a curve like no other in world-beating waters right now . This year brought further progress on a rare angle of trajectory that points to a special place in the pantheon one day . Decades from now , folk will read all about it but we get to live through it in the context of real time , out time , Ledecky and Gemmell 's ' time . <p> A Labour government 
 Game On ; Crest of Wave For Watanabe , Seebohm <p> On a day of swift swimming at the NSW State Championships at Sydney Olympic Park that saw Emily Seebohm register the first sub-minute backstroke of the year and Kanako Watanabe set the global pace on 2:22.46 at the helm of the breaststroke rankings , a cracking freestyle battle led by James for three laps ended soon after Park Tae Hwan and Cameron McEvoy flew by .

 always looks brighter from behind a smile , then best take your shades to the pool with you should you flow through the Aquajets program in Eden Prairie , Minneapolis . Those heading for the water , make sure your goggles have at least a hint of tint and do n't forget to bring a spring for your step . <p> Coach Kate Lundsten carries blue sky with her whatever the weather . Snow falling outside the conference room in Lund Sweden , she made sure the sun shone inside at the World Aquatics Development Conference as she rattled and rolled her way through creative ways to teach values and packed meaning into the power of team . <p> The badge you 'll need to get through the door to the three pools and the vast dryland hall next door at the club 's main training centre will need to prize ' determination ' and ' commitment ' . <p> There 's even a kick set called ' Determination ' , with which Lundsten tests the resolve of those folk who say ' I ca n't kick ' but need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a simple message : " The more you 're there , the better you 're gon na be . " <p> Lundsten transports us from a room without a view in Lund to the deck back home with a spell of ' atmosphere ' On the deck , its smile , walk the talk . interact and do whatever it takes to make learning and and the pursuit of progress a fun affair : <p> " It 's show time . No matter what I feel like , no matter what 's happening , I act like I 'm 20 . A lot of life , spunk , cheering . It 's OCM out there organised chaotic mess . " <p> Swimmer are encouraged to encourage each other through joint celebration of anything that can get them holding hands and sharing experience . So , National High-Five Day " or whatever it happens to be " , we 'll celebrate that , all together . <p> 's lust for reflects changing times with a helpful slice of pragmatism and recognition that the job still needs doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach said 10 ? 500 , you did it . Period . Nowadays , kids have to buy into it . Which kid does n't want to buy into an exciting experience ? Some kids you just do n't want to have buy in ; you want ' em to move on . The aim is elite athlete and they have to be a part of that process . " <p> That includes answering the ' why ' before it 's asked . Explains Lundsten : " I give ' em , I explain that I want an emphasis on high elbow , say , or breathing or listening to the water ; what 's it doing ? I get them to try to embrace what we 're doing . " <p> Lundsten likes to talk a lot . She will get her squads out of the water after every set some sessions , gather them round the white board and explain the meaning of what they 've just done and what they 're about to be asked to do next . One assistant coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , spent a year watching this through gritted teeth before telling Lundsten ' you 've driven me crazy pulling the kids out after every set ... but actually , now I can see what you do it ' . <p> If they understand what they 're doing and get to express their views on it , they 're engaged and they own the activity . More on ownership , belongingness , motivation and related issues in other talks from Lund down the line of stuff that speaks to the mood music in Minneapolis : Lundsten and the Aquajets like to smile . <p> Alongside side a picture of beaming kids about to celebrate their send off to college , Lundsten points to her next point : <h> The Power of A Smile <p> " A smile changes the atmosphere ... enthusiasm spreads , " she says before citing a feature by Forbes Magazine in which baseball cards showing the images of players and their longevity . To sum up in very general terms : the " really enthusiastic smilers " livered several years longer than the " smilers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out sooner " . Cue laughter . Says Lundsten : <p> " Adults smile an average of 20 times a day , research has sown ; kids smile an average of 400 times a day . <p> " 1 smile has the same uplifting effect as 2,000 chocolate bars or a cash win of in terms of brain stimulation ( researchers found ) ... just think how thin we 'd all be if we smiled more <p> " Smiling reduces blood pressure and stress <p> Mother Teresa said : ' Let us always meet each other with smile , for the smile is the beginning of love . ' <p> The power of smile <p> The Aquajets Circle of Love , in fact . If you 're visiting any time soon , watch for the daunting moment when you might be called to the middle of the circle to talk to up to 100 kids sitting on seats all about you , each with their own ideas of what they want to say ( if anything ) , how and why they want to connect and waiting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspire them with . Speaker , stimulator , source of inspiration , the man or woman in the middle gets to work on those smiles , the confidence , the belongingness , the stuff that binds and binds and gets them coming back for more . <p> Body language just how important cane it be ? Well , just as important as you can imagine . Take Amy Cuddy , a bright spark of a child whose IQ fell by two standard deviations ( about 30 points ) when she sustained a head injury in a car accident when she was a sophomore in college . <p> Her doctors told her that she was not likely to fully recover and should anticipate significant challenges finishing her undergraduate degree . One of the results of her experience was a loss of confidence and an inability to smile and feel a part of it all along with her peers . <p> At Princeton after an exam that did n't go as well as it might have , a professor , noting that Cuddy looked like a " timid little mouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... you may not feel like it but every day I want you to fake it ; I want you to show people you belong here , " said Lundsten . " So , she faked it , she smiled , every day even when inside she felt something completely different . " <p> Lundsten uses that in the pool in season . " I tell the kids ' we 're going to this meet at the weekend and I know you 've been working hard but I want you to fake this meet ( as in pretend you do n't feel fatigue and the challenge of it all ) . " One of the mechanisms to achieve that : a power pose , hands on hips , determination to the fore , a stance like the one you might wear when in peak form , tapered and ready to race in the Olympic trials , even though this is just a minor meet in the midst of long-term prep , school and the general challenge of it all . <p> Does it work ? Years later , Amy Cuddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School , in the Negotiation , Organizations &amp; Markets Unit . She 's an American social psychologist known for her research on stereotyping and discrimination , emotions , power , nonverbal behaviour . <p> For those who wish to be further inspired , here 's a little Cuddy magic : <h> The Power of Team <p> The Aquajets is a serious set up : coaching staff , dryland staff , a sports psychologist paid top come in work with the squads on a regular part-time basis , board members committed to the culture of the private enterprise and someone holding the purse strings and filing the accounts . <p> Back in 2007 , the set up was a very local affair . Today , the boast a fine set of achievements : 32 National Age Group Records , set by 19 different swimmers , with 26 of the records accounted for by relays ; more than 100 Scholastic All-Americans in 2015 placing the club 4th in the USA at that level ; a State Team Champion ; 5 times Silver Medal Team and 2 times Gold Medal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national teamster Rachel Bootsma . <p> Training starts with the six years olds and goes up to 16 and overs . Groups are divided by age , so that no matter how good an may be , you wo n't find him or her training with the 13 and overs . Beyond the actual age of a child , emotional readiness and physical abilities are also teen into account in the streaming process . <p> Lundsten talks through the test sets and expectations that have to be passed and met by those wishing to move on through the ranks . The process provides clues to the strength of the U.S. program . For example , to make the squad for 6-8 ( some 9 ) year-olds , you have to be able to swim all four strokes . <p> Those who make the grade will learn " the skills necessary to compete in the sport of swimming such as working with teammates , following directions and listening to the coaches , more advanced drills , learning and smiling a lot ! " <p> To make the cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Legally ' swim and kick 50 yards in 4 different strokes without any <p> Be comfortable in deep water and in a group setting away from parents and/or caretakers Swim 10 x 50 on <p> 05 Kick 10 x 25 on Attend three to four 75-minute sessions a week <p> Sprint ahead to those working for places on national teams at 15 and over and the commitment includes " ... practice being excellent examples of humble excellence to their teammates , younger swimmers on the team and competitors day in and day out at the skills necessary to compete in the sport of swimming such as working with teammates , listening to and obeying coaches , learning and smiling a lot ! " They must also be able to do 7,000 yards and metres sessions , reach time standards and attend between six and eight practices of two hour or more a week . <p> At this point , Lundsten puts up a slide showing a teenage crew in various stages of smile , laugh and facial expressions that might be summed up by the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional dog-sled team of huskies and riders zipping across a spectacular , snowy landscape . Says Lundsten : <p> " That 's what a team might might look like , ideally ... in reality this is what a team looks like . " <p> And there they are : an Old English sheepdog , a giant poodle , a hunter , a hound , one built to shuffle not walk , a Staffordshire not a single one about to trot and tango at the same pace and rhythm , not a single one with the same character or trait . <p> " That 's what a team looks like that 's what you work with , " she adds before a minion in a tutti-frutti bonnet beams back at us all to reflect the spectrum of skills and personalities that make up a coaching staff . <p> The nitty gritty of a program follows , at its core the expectations placed on the pupils : benign behaviour , being mates on the team , supporting each other and the values that the club stands for , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind of success celebrated in a Team USA flag framed on the wall at the Aquajets that speaks of long-term care and dedication : <p> Kate &amp; , <p> Thank you SO much for everything you have done for me . These past 9 years have been amazing and and something I will never fogey ! Thank you for all of your support and love . I would n't be half the person I am today without you ! Love , Rachel Bootsma . <p> Lundsten notes the generation Z phenomenon and urges coaches to embrace technology , be creative " every single day " . She films , she plays back video , she mixes it up for squads of 13 to 15-year olds at the heart of a generation that provides us with stats galore to show half of them are on social media for small bursts of activity often . <p> So , gone , perhaps the days of the 10 ? 500 without it being broken and explained and presented in different ways . Caution is always called for , however . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way home from Lund and counted at least 10 among 30 who sat and read books , long magazine articles , in print and on iPads and tablets , some of those with the latter moving from feature-style material of 1500 and more words to graphics of short-burst material and back . The generation is more sophisticated than or you 've lost ' em . <h> Explain , Show , Try <p> gather by the white board as coach talks ' em through <p> 's mantra is " Explain , Show and Try " , the white board gatherings , the iPad , the video , the selfie , cords , multiple stations in practice , working with music ( vertical kicking to the beat shows the fun and challenge to be had try static , vertical dolphin kicks while singing ) any device or platform that is useful all in the mix of OCM . The latter stretches to exercises , some with snorkels , The Brick ( a heavy float that alters the position of shoulders and arms during kick sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( more on chart later in this series ) and get the body used to the flip and flow that requires the body to react to change , of pace , movement and focus . Lateral thinking , mixing it up , making it all as interesting and challenging as possible . <p> Not all programs are bestowed with the best facilities , the best talent , the best pool and so forth . But the best of it all is right here in each of us , says Lundsten . Beyond an invisible limit , outside the box sure there may be something there but do n't forget what 's already in the box and the rich rewards to be had in embracing limitations and making the very most of them for surprising and thrilling results . <p> What does she mean ? This , from artist Phil Hansen provides the clue and inspiration : <p> The Power Of Smile a few words of inspiration <p> " Anyone who has a continuous smile on his face conceals a toughness that is almost frightening .

 deal of late- and early-year racing taking place at various locales around the world in recent weeks , there 's been a lull since started its periodic series that views the deepest battles slated for the United States Olympic Trials . Well , it 's time to get back on board and provide our latest analysis of some of the action to unfold in late June , and which will shape the final form guides ahead of competition at the OlympicGames in Rio de Janeiro . <p> Not long ago , questions arose concerning the state of the American women 's 100 breaststroke . With Rebecca Soni retiring following her double-medal showing at the 2012 Games in London , the onus of leadership within the stroke fell to Jessica Hardy , little additional support to be found elsewhere . While Hardy churned out impressive times at the 2013 World Championships , including a 1:05.18 outing , there 's been a dip in ensuing years . <p> A pair of medals from the Pan Pacific Championships in 2014 needed to be assessed in a greater context , the times nothing spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 breaststroke at the 2015 World Championships in Kazan , Hardy eliminated in the semifinal round and Micah Lawrence knocked out during the preliminary heats . Was the 100 breaststroke going to be a significant concern entering the Olympic year ? Not quite . <p> While struggles dotted the efforts in Kazan , a positive spark was found back in North America . In Toronto , while racing at the Pan American Games , Katie Meili assuaged worries when she bolted to the gold medal in the 100 breast , a prelim mark followed by a performance in the final . More , a few other ladies have joined the rush toward Omaha , and coupled with their veteran counterparts , the 100 breaststroke is in better position than once perceived . <p> Here 's a look at what has morphed into a quality showdown . <h> From Unknown to Frontrunner : Katie Meili at the Fore <p> Rare are the times in this sport when an athlete comes out of college as a relative unknown and manages to rocket onto the worldwide stage in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meili , and her story is just now being written . Although Meili was twice a top-five finisher in the 100 breaststroke at the NCAA Championships while representing Columbia University , it 's what she has done since graduating in 2013 that has defined her career . <p> Training with SwimMac Carolina and obviously benefiting from the tutelage of Olympic coach David Marsh , Meili has vaulted into the world 's elite . Her breakout moment arrived at the Pan Am Games , where Meili covered her two laps in 1:05.64 to earn the No. 3 ranking in the world , and while that effort was a prelim swim , her 1:06.26 mark at night backed up the fact that Meili was rising quickly . Add in a few more 1:06 marks , including in Austin this month , and Meili 's consistency and pop put her in the medal-contender category for Rio . <p> Meili is a fascinating story as her best performance in the 100 breast coming out of Columbia was , and here she is nearly three years later with three-plus seconds sliced from that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved she is more than just a speedster , thanks to a effort in the 200 breaststroke at the USA Swimming Pro Series stop . Behind enhanced endurance , Meili will be dangerous down the last lap of the shorter event . <h> The Emergence of Lilly King <p> As the 2014 Pan Pacific junior champ in the 100 breaststroke , Lilly King has shown potential for a few years . That upside is now shining through , to the point where King ranked as the No. 2 American in 2015 ( sixth in the world ) and is as good a bet as anyone to nail down a berth to Rio . King 's best last year was a time of 1:06.43 , produced at USA Nationals last month . <p> The silver medalist at last summer 's World University Games , King is not a stranger to racing internationally or in pressurized situations , an advantage when it comes to climbing the blocks in Omaha . With three sub-1:07 performances to her credit last year , King has been consistent , her next step a challenge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An argument can be made that of all the contenders in the 100 breaststroke , Molly Hannis is on the biggest hot streak and uptick . The University of Tennessee product has delivered the times of her career since October . More impressive , the personal best of 1:07.12 she registered in October has dipped all the way to 1:06.47 , the time Hannis produced at the Geneva Challenge over the weekend . <p> The experience Hannis ( eighth in the world in 2015 ) garnered by racing in World Cup action over the fall should prove beneficial and it makes sense that her competitors are aware that she is not just slicing bits of time from the clock , but is taking off chunks . For Hannis , improving at such a rapid rate is huge in the confidence department , and self-assurance is a major plus at any time , but particularly in an Olympic year . <h> Not Forgetting the Veterans <p> If Katie Meili , Lilly King and Molly Hannis are the upstarts in the event , then the veteran guard lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be said that the vets have gotten lost in the infusion of rising talent , but the truth is , these women will be right in the mix when Olympic invitations are doled out . <p> Hardy is easily the most experienced of the American 100 breaststrokers , her career marked by a decade-long stay in the upper echelon since breaking out at the 2005 World Championships in Montreal with a silver medal behind Leisel Jones and a world record in the semifinals . These days , the question is whether Hardy can put all the pieces together for a summer surge . <p> Approaching her 29th birthday , Hardy has had some uneven performances the past two years . While she was in the prelims of the 100 breaststroke in Kazan , she was in the semifinals and failed to advance to the final . Meanwhile , her winning time of 1:06.74 from the 2014 Pan Pacs was n't overwhelming . By this summer , she 'll be three years removed from her last time under 1:06.50 , so she 'll have to rekindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardy is n't alone in the category of ups and downs as Larson is looking to find some stability as Trials approach . Behind a best of 1:07.19 last year , Larson ranked 21st in the world . Obviously , that kind of time wo n't get the job done in Omaha , so the search is on for some blasts from the past , her best the 1:05.92 that punched a ticket to the 2012 Olympics . <p> Micah Lawrence of the United States . <p> In the case of Micah Lawrence , the 100 breaststroke has never been her primary event , the 200 breast serving that role . However , Lawrence has been as quick as 1:06.51 and figures to qualify for the final in Omaha and make a run at qualification . Leaving her out of the discussion would be an unwise move , even if she has some climbing ahead . <p> Also worth noting are Laura Sogar and Melanie Margalis , each of whom rated in the top-30 in the world last year . Still , Sogar 's better chance is in the 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod coming in the 200 individual medley . <h> Comments <p> Katie Meili is in a very good place . He perfomance at trials will give an indication of what she 'll do in Rio . For now getting her technique tweaked and focussing on the goals at hand is the way to go <p> Yozhik January 25 , 2016 <p> The US Olympic Trials are promising to be the fiercest meet of the year . The OG can be the only one stronger than that . I can not picture any of US swimmers who can allow themselves to look at this meet as just another intermediate excersise before Olympic starts . I do n't know anybody who wo n't be specially prepared for this meet by being partially or fully tapered . After Ledecky making this unexpected leap into American sprinting elite ( she got #4 ranking ever in textile era ) the competition at 100 can be very intense . Serious extra efforts will be needed to achieve desired goals for anybody entering this race . I think that Phelps is no exception neither . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Taylor announces smart 
 or so have got Olympic season off to a speedy and solid start for many elite swimmers who will almost certainly be in Rio come the Games in August , with Katie Ledecky and an 8:06 world record over freestyle and new highs of 53.7 and 1:54 over 100 and freestyle the standout Speedometer of a month on the wane . <p> Ledecky starts 2016 as she left 2015 : as the world swimmer of the hour , the month , the year and perhaps the era , her second Olympic Games rising up the aerial . <p> You can find links to some of the highlights of January so far below , while this last week of the month has started with the latest bomb to land in the realm of criminal to bad governance in international sport that has spelled the end of the era of autonomy , scandals FIFA and IAAF to the fore , with match-fixing in tennis and admissions that coincide adding to the list of woe in the past week or so . <p> The telling moment in a BBC interview with Geoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it to him that he was " not taking this too seriously " . <p> Many may well be left thinking that Montague was spot on when she suggested that Gardner had played down the significance of the adidas move , even though he acknowledged that there was no " argument that we find ourselves in a difficult place " ( thunderous insight ) . <p> Gardner is one of the big blazers in the IAAF , as the representative for Oceania hailing from ... Norfolk Island ( 2,300 inhabitants living on a rock about 35km2 or 14 square miles to the east of Australia and north of New Zealand sounds truly lovely , though whether that 's the best representation for Oceania in track and field is open to serious question and the same thought extends to swimming , with more than half of all ruling Bureau representatives from nations void of anything close to what the world 's leading swim nations would consider to be serious programs in the pool ) . <p> A truly significant moment that when the damage and self-harm of corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going along to get along by those on a gravy train that 's hit the buffers and catapulted them all into a swamp ( and the swim swamp is just as real as any other ) cross the line of reputation and perception to deeper wound of real pain in pocket and the place that needed and big kick . <p> Sport goes on and while the horizon may look very much the same for many who just get on with the business of training , coaching , preparing for the big moments , and while blazers continue to bunker down in the realms they 've built , the has shifted significantly . It will take time and more vigilance and a cultural shift that many blazers will pay lip service too without actually getting it that action tangible and transparent is what will be required ... but there will be no going back . <p> There has been a serious disconnect between blazers , athletes and programs and those whose investment in sport is often badly overlooked . <p> Basketball is the most expensive sport to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 153 ) , swimming ( ? 145 ) and horse racing ( ? 134 ) <p> Golf appears in both the top five tables for most expensive sports to play ( ? 214 ) per month and follow ( ? 118 ) <p> A quarter ( 23 percent ) of those surveyed lose track of how much they spend ( In fact , one in 10 golfers , tennis players and cyclists hide their expenditure from their partner ) <p> The research was commissioned to support the Santander app .

 the japanese ace who broke an elbow on training camp in the lead-up to world titles last year and had to skip the big meet , will make his comeback to racing at the Kosuke Kitajima Cup in Tokyo this weekend . <p> Down to race both the and medley and the freestyle , Hagino has told Japanese media that his injury is fully recovered and that he is on a good path for Olympic trials in Tokyo a couple of months down the 's race comeback has made chat forums in Japan in the last 24 hours as fans look forward to seeing where the Olympic medal hope might now be after a long break from racing . <p> Hagino , a title favourite over and medley , was forced to withdraw from the World Championships in 2015 after he fracture his right elbow in a fall from his bicycle on the way to training on camp in France . He was flown home to Tokyo . <p> Kosuke Hagino at his press conference today <p> Tests at the National Sports Science Center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a two-month break ahead of him . Hagino told reporters at a press conference soon after treatment in Tokyo that he regretted not having a shot at the world medley crowns in Kazan because the global gathering had been intended as a springboard to his bid for Olympic titles in Rio this year . <p> Japan offered Olympic selection to winners in Kazan . Now , the Team Hagino " strategy " with his coach Norimasa Hirai , head coach to Japan , has been rethought and focus was placed immediately on April trials , the swimmer noted . The Kitajima Cup was cited as a possible trial event on the way to trials . <p> Hagino was out of training for eight weeks , on doctors ' orders . Wearing a cast on his right arm , he told reporters last summer : <p> " I 'm grateful to all those who have helped me . That emotion is accompanied by the feeling of sorrow I have for everyone in Japan who would have been cheering me on . I feel very sorry that I wo n't race at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian Games champion in a stellar season in 2014 , has suffered bad luck this season : he has had treatment for right shoulder pain , which , he says , kept him from being at his best at nationals back in April 2015 . <p> In May last year , he suffered loss to domestic rival and world 400IM champion Daiya Seto at the Japan Open but talk of " poor physical condition " in the Japanese media stretches too far : Hagino leads the world rankings in the 200 and 400IM and has put in some of his best efforts ever in freestyle events of late . <p> His withdrawal from Kazan evoked memories of his 2011 campaign : at nationals and trials that season , Hagino suffered dehydration , left the meet in an ambulance and missed the cut for the big occasion . <p> A good omen , perhaps . One year later , he made his first Olympic podium , bronze in the medley behind Ryan Lochte ( USA ) and Thiago Pereira ( BRA ) at London 2012 . <h> Kosuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 2016 <p> Kosuke Hagino Photo : Aniko Kovacs <p> Kosuke Hagino soared at Pan Pacific Championships , pipping Michael Phelps in the 200IM along the way and then took on the Asian Games and emerged with seven medals , all but one ( 4x200m gold ) in in solo events . The 20-year-old tops the world rankings in the and medley , is ranked No the free and backstroke and is top 5 in the backstroke and versality is hard to find than that of Hagino . The multi-talentedness and its many applications were noted down as follows by our man in America , John Lohn : <p> In the 200 individual medley and 400 individual medley , which are unquestionably his premier events , Hagino tops the global lists with respective marks of 1:55.33 and 4:07.75 . Those efforts give him a cushion of more than a half-second in the shorter distance and more than a second in the longer event . <p> In middle-distance freestyle action , Hagino claimed the Asian Games championship in the 200 free , topping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second-fastest time in the world , 1:45.23 . Meanwhile , he ranks fifth in the world in the 400 free , thanks to a mark of 3:43.90 . <p> When Hagino flips to his back , the success continues as he is ranked second in the world in the 200 back ( 1:54.23 ) and sits fourth in the world in the 100 back ( 52.78 ) . Both of those events yielded bronze medals at the Asian Games . <p> John noted the choices and schedule at Rio 2016 and posers a question many are asking : what will he hone in on if Olympic gold is to the a part of his story , a different opponent at every turn , be that Phelps , Ryan Lochte , Daiya Seto &amp; Co ; Ryosuke Irie &amp; Co ; Park , Tom Fraser-Holmes , Sun Yang , Ryan Cochrane , David McKeon &amp; Co . <p> After 2015 was put on ice , 2016 comes into focus , including what events Hagino will focus on . <p> History is stacked with the tales of age and experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things will be no different in Rio , a recovered Hagino and Seto best placed , as things stand , to depose . Neither Ryan Lochte nor Michael Phelps will move aside quietly over , while Tyler Clary and Chase Kalisz are among those seeking berths in what may well be the first podium in history over . <p> All American runes come with an obvious caveat : trials that can leave a world top 5 swimmer watching the Games on the TV back home . <p> Looking back , the cycle was led by swimmers who did not then actually make it to the subsequent Games or fell shy of the podium , while some outside the top 10 stepped up to an Olympic medal . In 1990 , American Dave Wharton led the world ranks in the medley but did not make it to the Barcelona 1992 race ( he took silver in the 1988 400IM and finished 4th in 1992 ) ; Canada 's Curtis Myden was outside the world top 10 in 1994 but took bronze at the 1996 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1998 after 5th in 1996 but the 2000 final went without him . In the , Jani , of Finland , was ranked world No2 in 1994 and world No 1 the year after but did not make the Atlanta 1996 battle of best eight . <p> Just a few examples of why we should take nothing for granted , as Hagino understood well last year . <h> Comments <p> I hope the time out allowed his management team to come up with a streamlined program of events for him and maybe ; limiting individual events increases chances for individual gold ; Hosszu in Kazan , 200/400 IM , 200free , and " just " 2 golds and a bronze in returns . Something for Hagino to think about <p> I understand the importance of carefully selecting Mr. Hagino 's individual races . But I really hope that he participates in Japan 's 4x200m freestyle relay team . It 's somewhat frustrating that Australia and Japan ca n't seem to win this race , given the strength of their teams . Australia , Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awesome . <p> January 26 , 2016 <p> , <p> As I have shown above , the schedule for 4 ? 200 suit perfectly if Hagino decides to swim it . <p> And one of Australia , Japan and GB will have to miss the podium because , bar DQ or not qualify , USA will finish in the top 3. 2014 Pan Pacs was when all four Japanese 200 freestylers swam as fast as they were expected , and it will be very hard to repeat that , especially since Matsuda has retired . <p> January 26 , 2016 <p> : as per your suggested schedule , indeed there would be a great possibility for Mr. Hagino to avoid overlaps and swim the 4x200m freestyle relay race . I am well aware of the strengths of the US in this relay , as well as of the strengths of China , Russia , and even Hungary and France . I just think it 's high time that countries other than US begin to dominate this relay . Nothing against the US ; I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swam this relay in the Asian games and , if memory serves , he was second ( behind Mr. Hagino ) in the freestyle in Japan 's 2015 trials . I think Mr. Seto 's best time is 1:47 low , probably comparable to Mr. Masuda 's time in the relays in the last and Asian games . <p> paolo January 26 , 2016 <p> : Usa without a medal in the men 's 4 ? 200 free relay at Olympics ? No chanches it happens . A lackluster performance at last year Worlds was good enough for a silver , " almost gold " , medal . So , Usa squad remains the strong favorite for Rio . In my opinion , Australia could have a great potential if its major players would be in good/great shape when it counts . The Aussie " dream team " : McEvoy , Fraser-Holmes , Larkin ( I 'm sure he 'll be capable of a 1.45 leg at Rio ) and Horton ( he was already capable of a 1.45 at 2013 Dubai Junior Worlds ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quartet " but , unfortunately , there are question marks about Horton , yes , but above all if Australia as a team may perform well at the main event . In the past this did n't happen , but .. never say never <p> What makes relays exciting is that mystery factor of which swimmers will rise and who will crack ; Maggie the missile was defused by Adrian at London 2012 throwing off Aussies off the podium ( prohibitive favorites on paper then ) . Thorpe failed to run down Klete Keller on anchor Athens ' 04 ... USA women lost in Beijing when Aussie women had a perfect day in the pool . Only in Kazan four ' average ' Chinese women did their part to beat out , Australia and USA ( no medal ) ... That 's the magic if Olympic relay swimming , what I 'd simply call the mystery factor .... <p> Iain January 26 , 2016 <p> The 4x200m medals will got to three of : AUS , FRA , GBR , JPN , RUS , USA , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have the best chance of being there due to their strength in depth , but there is no guarantee the US will be there .

 on a stirring high and having taken down the meet mark with a 22.11 in the morning heats of the freestyle at the Euro Meet in Luxembourg , Britain 's Ben Proud picked up the pace once more with a 23.26 blast at the helm of the butterfly final at the start of the evening session . <p> That was just the warm-up it turned out .

Fourth Velimir Stjepanovic , with a great in the 200 free ( also Stjepanovic in the mix for perhaps the most open race in Rio ) . Koch , Hosszu , Cseh , Proud , Stjepanovic and the two Irish wins by Murphy and Ryan for a great second day of swimming at ( for Italy , good win by Martina Carraro in the women 's 50 breastroke ) . <p> Yozhik January 30 , 2016 <p> Statistics is a tricky thing . It all depends on the angle used when looking at data . Whatever was shown by Hosszu in 2016 so far indicates to me that she is slowing down . That this unexplainable push of 2015 is over and out of power . It is either the Mother Nature reminds her about her age , or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that helped her to progress that fast last three years is stopping to work .

 having fun on the podium with Laurent and Arkady Grigoryev <p> Germany 's World champion Marco Koch showed the January form of his life with a stunner of a 2:07.69 victory at the Euro Meet in Luxembourg this evening . Koch claimed the European title in 2014 in 2:07.47 . Today marked his third dip below 2:08 and the second-best effort of his career , inside the time he clocked for the world title in August last year , 2:07.76 . <p> The day of the sub-2:07 world record in the breaststroke is nigh , the dam of contenders building with every passing season , with Koch in the spotlight on the way to Rio 2016 as the European and World champion on a roll . The podium was completed by Laurent , back home for his home meet , on 2:11.61 , and Arkady Grigoryev , of Russia , on 2:14.79 . Germany 's Christian Vom Lehn disqualified , his hands at the turn " not simultaneous " . <p> The world record of 2:07.01 , held by Akihiro Yamaguchi since a freaky moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's effort today . <p> Faster than Kazan . What gives , asked Georges Kiehl poolside in Luxembourg . Says Koch : " I had lots of fun its a great crowd here , always , and I love coming here to swim . " It looked like that as Koch spoke ten to the dozen with any who would speak to him on the podium and clearly enjoyed every moment of doing what he does . <p> Koch 's was one of two meet records for Germany on the day , a 2:08.64 from Franziska in the butterfly accounting for the second standard . Judit Ignacio , of Spain , was next home in 2:08.82 , with Jakabos , of Hungary , in 2:10.32 , Mireia Belmonte , of Spain , on 2:11.02 . <h> Another Flying In January ... <p> Katinka Hosszu by Fabio Ferrari LaPresse <p> Double World medley champion Katinka Hosszu , the Hungarian heading for a fourth Olympic Games this August in Rio in search of her first podium visits at 27 , started the second day of meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medley heats a day after a 4:34 win over . <p> She started a schedule of seven finals this evening not only with her fastest freestyle ever in January but a swim inside the pace of efforts at warm-up meets in May and June on the way to summer peak away from nationals and bigger international moments in previous years . <p> Hosszu pummelled her opponents with a 56.56 first on her way to a 1:56.81 meet record that took down the 2007 meet record held by Germany 's World Championship silver medallist that year , Annika Liebs ( now Lurz ) . <p> Next home was Melani Costa , of Spain , on 1:59.20 , with Annika Bruhn , of Germany , on 1:59.29 , Mireia Belmonte , of Spain , 2:00.91 , ahead of Plymouth Leander 's Jessica Jackson . <p> There is little point in looking at the multi-event skills and speeds of most of those Hosszu competes against because there simply is no comparison to be had with the only swimmer in the world racing as much as the Hungarian does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a swimmer who counted 9 events on her list of world top 100 rankings and has wracked up personal best times in almost every world-championship stroke and distance in the past 3 years in the midst of something of a born-again career . <p> 1:57.83 2015 1:55.41 ( 31 times inside 2012 career high in 2015 season ) <p> 1:56.92 2014 1:56.30 ( 14 times inside 2012 career high in 2014 season <p> 1:56.19 2013 1:56.73 ( 11 times inside 2012 career high in 2013 season <p> 1:57.66 2012 1:58.94 <p> 1:57.83 2011 2:00.94 <p> 1:59.51 2010 1:59.10 <p> 2:01.07 2009 1:59.93 <p> 1:59.12 2008 2:02.04 <p> 2:02.12 2007 2:02.00 <p> It is not a question of focus for Hosszu : she 's making rivals in a whole range of events scratch their heads and wonder what they 're doing wrong . It is January and a career-high Hungarian record 26.62 win in the butterfly for another meet record that ended without Hosszu seeming to break a standard breath is how she followed the freestyle win . Pure sprinter Dorothea Brandt , of Germany , clocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it being January could not quite get to that today . Third place went to Emilia Pikkarainen , of Finland , in 26.89 . <p> Hosszu then clocked 1-minute flat to take another meet mark and keep Ukraine 's Daryna Zevina and a 1:00.65 at bay in the backstroke . On 1:01.74 in 2014 at the same meet , Hosszu was almost faster two years on at the same stage of the season . Third place went to Duane da Rocha ahead of Spanish teammate Mercedes Peris , on 1:02.33 and 1:02.46 respectively . <p> Katinka Hosszu by PBK <p> Hosszu then took on her world-record event , the medley . Never an unsharp moment whether she needs it or not . The race was not against the other lanes but the clock .

Hosszu has an lead over others when it comes to repeated , multiple , world-class efforts at any time of the year these post-2012 days . <p> It was swim down for Hosszu next , on 2:36 for 9th in the breaststroke . The race was won by bronze medallist Jessica Vall , of Spain , in 2:27.50 , with German challengers Jessica Steiger and Vanessa Grimberg next to the end wall on 2:28.32 and 2:28.40 respectively . Then a 2:20 over butterfly for Hosszu before her last final of the day , in the freestyle . <p> She ended her day on 25.72 in 7th , the dash going in 25.22 Dorothea Brandt , of Germany , ahead of Julie Meynen , on 25.31 , a Luxembourg record , third home in 25.58 Cecilie Johannessen of Norway . <h> Velimir Stjepanovic Rattles His Best 200 Pace <p> Velimir Stjepanovic echoes of 2014 by Patrick B.

 As A Warm-Up For Sizzler 48.50 In <p> Velimir Stjepanovic chatting to Georges Kiehl poolside today after two wins and a 48.5 free <p> The relative rest inherent in spending a few days at a meet gave us a glimpse of the speed and strength gathering in Mireia Belmonte and Velimir Stjepanovic at the Euro Meet in Luxembourg . <p> The closing session witnessed a 51.40 from Laszlo Cseh in the butterfly , but the drew the gaze to Stjepanovic , the Serbian based at Hamilton Aquatics in a 3:48 in the freestyle a stunning moment : 48.50 in the freestyle . <p> The time , cracking French 2008 Olympic champion Alain Bernard 's 49.20 meet mark from 2011 , follows a lifetime best of 48.86 on World Cup tour from Stjepanovic last year . There is the glimpse of what they 've been working on at Hamilton Aquatics : speed .

Proud lost a touch on the way home as the Serbian 200-400m man struck for home , but an unrested 49.15 for the sprinter bodes well for the season ahead . Third place went to Egypt 's Mohamed Elsayed in 50.13 . <p> warmed up for that blast with a in the , another meet mark at a meet where standards took on a new edge this year .

Marie Wattel , of France and Nice , dipped below the minute in heats but this evening settled for second in Justine Bruno third in 1:01.37 . <h> Women Butterfly <p> In the men 's backstroke , Marseille 's backstroke ace Camille Lacourt took the race in commanding style on 54.34 ahead of Stirling and Britain 's Charlie Boldison , 55.85 , and Thomas Avetand , of Beauvaisis Aquatic Club , on 56.29 . <p> Russia 's Anastasia Zueva <p> Katinka Hosszu ( HUN ) clocked 1:09.73 at the helm of the breaststroke , working on the weakest link in her medley , and then raced the medley in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Evelyn Verraszto ( HUN ) , on . <p> Hosszu making a molehill out of mountainous , times that others look to do as singular moments further down the hone of the season was back again for the backstroke and a 2:08.47 win ahead of Anastasia Fesikova ( nee Zueva ) , the Russian comeback mum , on an encouraging 2:09.67 , and Daryna Zevina , of Ukraine , on 2:09.75 , almost a match of the time in which she pipped Hosszu at the Euro Meet a week ago , indicating the Hungarian had a touch more rest in her . <h> Liverpool fan protest 
 of the United States of America ( USA ) by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The SwimVortex whirlwind tour of the landscape of the upcoming United States Olympic Trials is set to unveil its latest glimpse of the action in Omaha . Over the past several months , we 've routinely examined what are shaping up to be the most competitive events inside the CenturyLink Center , which is scheduled to host its third consecutive Trials in June . <p> The caveat to this exercise is the fact that almost every event on the American schedule will be hotly contested , and by the time the Olympic Trials roll around , each event will have received inspection . Our latest stop on the tour brings us to the women 's 200 individual medley , where four American ladies ranked in the global top-10 last year and where eight rated among the top-25 in the world . <p> Despite the depth in the event , the immediate question that arises is whether the U.S. has more than one ( Maya DiRado ) legitimate medal contender . Hungarian Katinka Hosszu , the world-record holder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy favorite for gold , while World Championships medalists Kanako Watanabe ( Japan ) and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor ( Great Britain ) have been . What China 's Ye Shiwen will bring in an Olympic year is difficult to read , but if the reigning champ returns to past form , it will not come as a surprise . <p> Here 's a look at the United States landscape : <h> American Hammer Being Wielded By Maya DiRado <p> Over the past three years , Maya DiRado has stamped herself as one of the fastest-rising American performers . DiRado has gone from elite collegiate athlete to world-class performer , evident in the silver medal she collected at last summer 's World Championships in the 400 individual medley . More , she has etched herself as an Olympic-qualifying contender in the 200 backstroke and qualified for the 2013 World Champs in the 200 butterfly . <p> Amid her status in the 400 medley and her recent surge in the 200 backstroke , DiRado 's excellence in the shorter medley has gone somewhat overlooked . At the World Championships in Kazan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish , her time of 2:08.99 established the 22-year-old as the third-fastest American in history , and the second-quickest in textile . That outing also moved DiRado into the top-10 of all-time on a textile basis . <p> A Stanford product , DiRado has made sizable gains in the 200 medley in the past few years , proof that her multi-event excellence has paid dividends over both eight laps and four . Surely , she has emerged as one of the United States ' most wide-ranging talents . At the end of the 2013 campaign , DiRado owned a personal best in the 200 I.M. of 2:11.92 , and that mark was from 2011 . By the end of 2014 , she was at 2:09.93 , and nearly another second was sliced from the clock during the 2015 campaign . <p> Heading into Trials , DiRado will be the favorite to nail down a ticket to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . Given her progression and the fact that most athletes put together their best efforts in an Olympic year , DiRado can be expected to lower her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as one of the true contenders for Olympic hardware . <h> Can Caitlin Leverenz Regain Magic Of Last Olympiad ? <p> At the 2012 Olympics in London , Caitlin Leverenz corralled a bronze medal in the 200 medley with an effort of 2:08.95 , a mark that stands as an American textile best . As the next Olympiad approaches for the 24-year-old , an obvious question arises : Is Leverenz capable of recapturing the magic that put her on the podium ? The answer is n't clear . <p> A look at Leverenz 's career shows that her best three years arrived from 2011-2013 , her performance from the Olympic year bookended by a swim of 2:09.39 in the year prior and a showing of 2:10.13 in the year following London . The past two years have been slower , a 2:10.67 from 2014 followed by a best of 2:10.35 in 2015 . The latter of those times ranked her eighth in the world , but also about two seconds shy of what it took to medal on the 2015 international stage . <p> Consistency has been a hallmark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the past six years . But if she wants to factor into the Rio medals race , it will require a return to London form and a little more . Time will tell if that scenario will unfold . <h> The Emergence Of Melanie Margalis <p> While Caitlin Leverenz is playing a game of catchup to the past , Melanie Margalis has been following the same path of Maya DiRado . Like her countrywoman , Margalis has put together the best three years of her career from 2013-2015 , using that timeframe to emerge as a legitimate threat on the worldwide scene . She finished last year ranked seventh in the world and as the second-fastest American , thanks to a time of 2:10.26 . <p> Melanie Margalis by Peter Bick <p> Margalis has raced the 200 medley at the past two major summer meets for the United States . Although she failed to advance to the final of the event at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships , her best time that year , a 2:10.20 from Nationals , remains her personal best . At last summer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Since finishing the 2013 season with a career best of 2:12.34 , Margalis has improved to a point where she 's dropped more than two seconds and is knocking on the door of going sub-2:10 . Look for Margalis to enter that territory for the first time and make a run , along with Leverenz , at a berth to the Summer Games . <h> The Rest Of The Pack <p> A standout for the University of Texas , Madisyn Cox enjoyed a breakout year in 2015 , first winning the silver medal in the 200 medley at the World University Games , then following up with a career-best 2:10.75 at the United States Nationals in San Antonio . That first marker landed Cox in the No. 8 slot in the world rankings and revealed promise ahead . <p> A pair of teenagers requires a close watch as Meghan Small ( 2:11.26 ) and Kathleen Baker ( 2:12.09 ) ranked 15th and 21st in the world for 2015 and figure to have their best days ahead , although Baker 's focus on the backstroke will be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah Henry ( 2:12.25 ) cracked the top-25 in the world last year . <p> From the veteran ranks , Elizabeth Beisel warrants an eye . While her best performances have arrived in the 400 medley , Beisel is capable of coming through with a 200 I.M. mark that puts her in the middle of the fight . <p> The warnings come 
 double victory at the Abu Dhabi round of the World Cup today when World champion Aurelie Muller and Marc Antoine Olivier stopped the clock ahead of the rest of the women and men in tight , fast battles to establish themselves as gold-medal hopes in the Olympic marathon in Rio come August . <p> Muller , as global champion , and Olivier , 6th at the world titles in Kazan last August , had already booked their berths in the Rio race . Today confirmed their candidacy for the podium . <p> Muller was always at the helm of the pace in the top 3 , third after the first , then 2nd , then 1st , then 3rd at the last turn of a lap buoy before she headed for 05.0 triumph over Brazilians Poliana Okimoto ( Cintra ) , , and Ana Cunha , who bided her time over the first before racing down her teammate for a finish a touch ahead of one of those who followed a similar pattern in the wash , Britain 's Keri-Anne Payne , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth in . <p> Muller , a sports management graduate , pipped training partner in France , Sharon Van Rouwendaal , European champion of 2014 , for the world crown last summer in Kazan . <p> Both are coached by Philippe Lucas , mentor to the first French Olympic swimming champion among women , Laure Manaudou . Muller joined Lucas ' program in February last year after 10 years with coach Olivier Antoine and granted self and Lucas another first : France 's first French world marathon champion . <p> Close to the helm of the race in Abu Dhabi today was the leader with a lap to go , Rachele Bruni , of Italy , on , with Kalliopi , of Greece , Olympic champion Eva , of Hungary , and Russian Anastasia Krapivina all on , Germany 's just beyond that mark a touch up on experienced teammate Angela Maurer . <p> Like Muller ( but not in the same fashion ) , Olivier produced a commanding victory by the close of business , on 39.6 ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time but declared third , Italy 's Simone Ruffini . That locked out Evgeni , of Russia , , and the winner 's French teammate Axel Reymond , away . <p> Jack Burnell , courtesy of British Swimming <p> Olivier played a waiting game in the pack , at 15th after the first round , 13th after the second , 22nd after the third before he raced through the shoal to enter the last lap in fifth place , on , a second ahead of Burnell in 6th , the race led by Reymond on . All the main protagonists raced the last lap faster than their opening lap , the pacing and tactics of open water like chess on water today . <p> Also close to the helm of the race by the close were Germans Christian Reichert , , and his shadow away by the end , Andreas , with Dutchman Ferry Weertman as second away and Brazil 's Allan Do Carmo , Hungary 's Mark Papp , Russia 's Kirill Abrosimov , Greek challenger Spyridon Gianniotis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy 's Matteo Furlan all inside . <p> The races were four-parters : the lead group , the chasers a couple to several minutes off the pace , and the stragglers and the non-finishers . If the women 's race featured two swimmers more than 18 minutes off the pace and one non-finisher , the men 's race had three non-finishers and included two swimmers from the host nation who finished almost 41 minutes behind the leaders . <p> The last qualifier for Rio 2016 lies ahead of all not yet with a ticket in their hand : Setubal , in waters this author knows well from a childhood spent swimming off the beaches thereabouts , June 10 . The conditions in terms of water temperature will be cooler than those off the UAE coast today but may be more temperate at that than the 14-16C possible off the Rio coast for the Games . <h> Exciting times ahead 
 It A Triple Triumph At Serbian Nationals in Belgrade <p> Velimir Stjepanovic chatting to Georges Kiehl at the 2016 Euro Meet after two wins and a 48.5 free <p> News Round-Up <p> Double European champion of 2014 Velimir Stjepanovic stole the show in the last session at Serbian Championships in Belgrade with a 1:47.95 victory in the freestyle . That marked his third freestyle title in three days after wins over and . <p> Out in 24.79 and via splits of 26.52 , 28.55 and 28.09 , Stjepanovic ploughed a lonely furrow out ahead , next home a 1:52.49 from Uros Nikolic , the bronze to Andrej Barna , 18 this year and on 1:53.11 swimming inside the European Juniors cut . <p> In other action , Caba added the breaststroke title , in 1:01.98 , to his dash win yesterday ; Ivan Lender took the ' fly in 24.53 , ahead of Sebastian Sabo ; and Tanja Smid took the breaststroke title in 1:10.11 . <h> Speed Building In Chad Le Clos <p> Chad Le Clos by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio 23016 is Chad le Clos . The Stellenbosch leg of the South African Swimming Grand Prix brought the series to a close today with Le Clos the dominant performer with efforts of 1:47.22 in the freestyle followed by a 22.69 in the freestyle . <p> On 1st first day of action , he clocked 1:56.60 in the butterfly and 48.92 in the freestyle . Plenty of evidence that the Olympic butterfly champion is building to a fine summer of speed . <p> Jarred Crous pipped Olympic champion Cameron van der Burgh 1:01.22 to 1:01.25 in the breaststroke , after the dash ended 27.72 to 27.82 in Der Burgh 's favourite over Crous , who was alsos second in the on 2:16.55 to Ayrton Sweeney 's 2:14.81 . <p> Tatjana Schoenmaker , on 32.33 , 1:09.39 and 2:26.50 respectively in the 50 , 100 and 200 breaststroke , Britain and Stockport 's Katie Matts on 32.44 , 1:09.49 with Kaylene Corbett on 1:09.90 ) and 2:30.73 for silver in all three races . <p> Lauren Quigley courtesy Swimming <p> The Brit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few other wins , Lauren Quigley on 55.95 and 1:01.22 in the free and back 0n day 2 after she 's won the freestyle , 25.70 , and backstroke , 2:13.89 , on the opening day of racing ; and Holly taking the butterfly , and freestyle in 2:14.68 and 4:16.48 and respectively . <p> Other winners include Matthew Meyer , on in the freestyle , 4:30.83 in the 400IM and in the 400 free ; Karin Prinsloo , on 2:01.46 in the freestyle ; and Vanessa Mohr , on 1:00.21 in the butterfly . <h> At the Hague Grand Prix ... <p> In The Netherlands , Marrit Steenbergen clocked 2:14.21 in the medley and then took on the freestyle , a 2:00.45 falling just shy of what it took for the win , Robin Neumann on 2:00.12 . The top effort among men came from Sebastiaan Verschuren , on 49.84 in the freestyle in the afternoon final after a 49.41 in the morning heats . <h> Speed test for James Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend , James Roberts clocked 49.58 to win the freestyle in the 17th swiftest effort of the year so far . Last week , the Australian sub-48 swimmer from 2012 , now based in Brisbane , clocked 22.65 in the at the McDonald 's Sprint Championships , which featured a 27.91 from Minna Atherton in the backstroke . <h> Comments <p> February 29 , 2016 <p> James Roberts ( remember him ? ) swam a 49.58 100 free over the weekend at a Brisbane meet . Could finally be over his injuries after 22.65 50 free the prior week . Competing at NSW states this coming weekend . could be a nice 4th wheel that probably was n't expected . But lots of question marks on this event in Aust re Magnussen and having at least one other low to mid 48 in case of injuries form etc . <p> Other impressive swims to name a few were Dan Smith 1:47 200 free ( in the 400 event ) along with Groves with a 2:08 200 fly , Ashwood 4:07 and D. McKeon 3:48 400 frees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all very nice re Roberts but let 's also recall his international record ....... one of non-performance in both individual and relay outings . Excuse me for not seeing him as any solution for the 4 ? 100 . <p> Ashwood seems to be tracking well this season and a pleasing time from Smith . McMaster has been around these marks earlier in the season and would seem to indicate she should make the AUS QT . <p> Re ; sadly over the past 4 years and abundant international outings ; he has proven incapable of delivering internationally and one sincerely hopes at least 2 others finish ahead of him in 200 &amp; 400 at Trials . Groves has not yet achieved " tourist " status but her international efforts of 2014 &amp; 2015 have been of that nature ; I sincerely hope she CAN turn this around in 2016. <p> Devastating images have 
 Of Super Foods , Grant Hackett Heads To 2016 Trials In A Body ' Transformed ' <p> Grant Hackett has shrugged off suggestions that his below-par showing in the 4x200m free at World titles last year is the bets of him on the way to Rio 2016 and what would be a fourth Olympics campaign . <p> Hackett , the 2000 and 2004 Olympic freestyle champion , shut down his career after silver a slither away from gold at the 2008 Games . In 2014 , he was back and since then , he tells the Courier Mail and other News Ltd titles , he has " transformed his body " thanks to a " big shift " in his diet compared to big career No1 all those speedy years ago . Hackett tells the paper that he : <p> now weighs but by the Olympic trials from April 7-14 he aims to be , his weight at Beijing 2008 <p> has cut out all white sugar and basis his intake on " super foods " and " good carbs " such as sweet potato , brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts <p> Grant Hackett Athens 2004 gold and laurel by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Hackett , who turns 36 in May , would be the oldest member of the Olympic Dolphins school if he makes the cut for Rio 2016 . He nods to his pioneering status before explaining his new regime : <p> " And the personal challenge of getting up at 5am and doing something that no one has really done at my age before . Where as before I was having a lot more carbs and probably way too much white sugar . I used to get sick a lot the first time around because I was training for a freestyle as well as trying to do an , , and a relay so I had a tendency to push myself too hard . " <p> Part of the new regimen speaks to Hackett 's rehab from a sleeping-pill dependency for a product that was one of the issues at the heart of the Australian team 's London 2012 woe and the subsequent penalties faced by members of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coached by long-time mentor Denis Cotterell at Miami , does yoga and has set all alcohol aside . He tells the paper : <p> Hackett , who returned to being a Dolphin at world-title trials a year ago , is bypassing NSW titles this week to focused on preparation for the Olympic trials . He will race the freestyle but believes the on day 2 will offer his best chance of a berth in Rio , as a member of the 4x200m freestyle squad . Says Hackett : <p> " The priority really is the relay and ... if I 'm going to compete at the Olympics again my best opportunity is in the relay . " <p> A medal at Rio 2016 would make Hackett the oldest podium placer among men in the Olympic pool in the modern era . <p> No chance of the overall , all-sports record : the oldest male Olympic medallist is Swedish shooter Oscar Swahn , a silver medal won in 1920 when he was 72 years , 281 days old . Bang . Game over almost 100 years ago . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 , became the oldest medallist in the Olympic pool , surpassing the record that had stood to William Robinson , of Great Britain , at age 38 when he took silver in the breaststroke at a home Games in 1908 . <h> Comments <p> It would be great if Grant could bring some hardware in the bag from Rio . <p> If he dips under 1:47 then the chance to be in the top 6 at the trials is a real one ( imo ) . <p> Is he going to be fast enough to swim the final of 4 ? 200 ? That depends on his prelim time . <p> I expect at least 3 other Aussies to be faster than Grant McEvoy , McKeon , TFH . <p> Commenter March 1 , 2016 <p> Never .... Ever ... write off a champion . The guy won Olympic gold with one lung in 2004 . <p> One thing is certain ... he 'll give it everything he 's got . <p> March 1 , 2016 <p> Commenter , with due respect that was 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 36 yo body competing . What we saw in Kazan was the cold reality ..... his spirit is there but its cashing cheques that his body can no longer pay . <p> Whilst it IS very creditable that a is still able to lay down a 1.47 ; the cold fact is that splits of that level are n't going to " do the business " in Rio where the standard is likely to be some levels above that of the Kazan race . <p> Could he make this relay squad ? Quite plausible but in many ways , that is a not particularly flattering indictment on the depth of the AUS men 's program . I would think the top 3 finishers in 200free most likely to be McEvoy , TFH &amp; Smith . After that , it gets a bit scrappy both regards to the competition and the quality . <p> Eugene March 1 , 2016 <p> I absolutely believe that 36 yo body is capable of much more than it is believed to . The main reason why the sport is dominated by younger people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , family and other things you may want besides training and competing when you reach 30 . If you are dedicated enough at 36 and have n't destroyed your health with alcohol , poor diet , injuries or excessive mental stress , you still can compete with younger athletes . Especially in such technical kinds of sport as swimming . It 's hard to introduce something new to the running technique and you can see it by taking a look at world record progressions of the past 50 years improvements are not so huge . Swimming is a developing sport . You can always find a way to get faster even if your heart is not as strong as it used to . <p> P. S. I just reviewed the list of national Masters records in swimming for my country . 30-34 age group records in most cases are weaker the the records for 40-44 guys . Should I explain why ? <p> P. P. S. I wish the best to Grant . I believe this dude can still kick some butt . <p> March 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this is someone trying to compete at the very highest level ..... against those 10-15-20 years his junior . <p> Granted , the quality of the 200 has been " down " for the past 2 years but there is no guarantee this will be the case this year . Hell , he could even grab one of the 400 spots for AUS ; the quality and depth is AUS is sod ordinary and the AUS QT is pretty soft . <p> However , for every Dara Torres comeback success story , there are at least 20 times more unsuccessful ones . For all the " message of affirmation " of this story , one has to look back at all three of his previous Olympic campaigns and think ; why should we have confidence that Cotterell &amp; he have got it right this time ? <p> March 1 , 2016 <p> I hope Mr. Hackett can contribute at least in the heats for the 4x200m freestyle relay . I have the impression that Daniel Smith has been systematically improving his over the last two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trials and Rio . I 'd love to know where Mr Horton is with regards to the freestyle . Contrary to an often expressed opinion about David McKeon 's individual performances at international meetings , I think his work in the Australian 4x200m relay has been competent , so I think he can be one of the swimmers too . I also trust that Mr. McEvoy can show as much improvement in his relay turn as in his relay turns last the past two years . And I somehow hope this will be the year when Australia , Japan and Great Britain complete the podium at the olympics . <p> March 1 , 2016 <p> We should have a fuller picture by Sunday night as to how most leading AUS swimmers are tracking . <p> , the AUS so often looks great on paper but the reality has been somewhat different . Yes , they picked up bronze in Kazan but the standard in Rio is likely to be much higher .... and the Euro teams that were " off their game " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The fact that you 've not included USA in your podium beggars belief . Yes , they got " rolled " by GBR in Kazan and their line-up for Rio may not necessarily be a " vintage " one but they 're going to be out for revenge in Rio and they would have to be on the front row of betting . <p> GBR should still be around the medals , JAP certainly could be ...... I 'd rate both ahead of AUS unless the top 2 Australians are swimming <p> With all due respect , McEvoy has yet to prove he is at the same level over 200 that he is at 100 . His international relay record in this one is erratic to say the least . TFH was ..... ordinary in 2015 ; there were promising signs in December at Qld titles but we 've seen nothing since . Prior to Kazan , 's relay outings WERE sometimes competent ; something has never been applicable to his solo endeavours but his Kazan relay efforts were on a similar level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success story of 2015 ; the 2nd solo spot is not beyond him if McEvoy &amp; TFH are n't swimming any better than the only 200 swims on record this season from Horton were a pair of at January 's Vic titles . <p> Craig Lord March 1 , 2016 <p> Eugene , masters is a different world ( speed and skill not comparable for the most big bulk of part with elite swimmers ) Hackett would rip the masters world to shreds with his 200 etc times : and yes , no doping tests , but also a wide spectrum of devotions , with some training more in their 40s than they ever did before and more time and disposable income to devote to it all . The younger age group is also that which is most likely to be in the formative years of career , family , children and umpteen related commitments , so no surprise to find a dip before a rise . <p> March 1 , 2016 <p> I thought the masters would challenge those times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WMR 35-39 against a lifetime best of . <p> Just noticed that he also deserves an asterisk under rules ! <p> Robbos March 1 , 2016 <p> , I too expect huge improvements in the 4X200 for the Australian team , I expect both McEvoy &amp; TBH to be big improvers in 2016 for the 200 free , McEvoy has matured as a swimmer since Kazan &amp; TBH beat Guy in the commonwealth games in 2014 &amp; has shown glimpses of returning to that form . Smith is also the big big improver &amp; I agree McKeon 's time is very good for a 4th swimmer , but poor for the individual favourite , now you throw in Horton , who swam a relay spilt of 1.45 a couple of years ago , Hackett , who I think can still get there , plus a smokie in Larkin . We have a potential another gold medal . <p> felix March 1 , 2016 <p> Aussie may get bonze in a scrap with Japan , USA win with Phelps back , Britain silver . I think Hackett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> March 1 , 2016 <p> If Hackett wants to pull out all the stops , he should have aimed for his physical condition/weight in 2005 or previous years . If I 'm not mistaken , in 2007 worlds he just came back from one year 's off , and there were pictures of him on the beach with far less than flattering physique . <p> And in 2008 he was not at his best , physical wise . Granted , that was his last year . <p> Does anyone know if Hackett is already on ISHOF ? I remember that already put Thorpe in the 2011 class ( 5 years after he announced retirement ) , only to be rescinded because Thorpe made a come back . I guess Hackett is also not yet on ISHOF as he retired in 2008 , so the earliest he could have gone in is in 2013 , but I think he already announced his comeback in 2013 . <p> Kelsey Huebner March 2 , 2016 <p> CW , with respect to Cotterell getting Grant 's Olympic campaign right I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 and 400 ? ? Given that Grant had to be tapered for the whole week it has always been thought that Grant 's taper was peaked for the 1500 thus explaining his performances in other events this is supported by Thorpe who believed the same . There was one year Grant came out and strongly challenged Thorpe in the shorter events and Thorpes belief was Cotterell and Grant were so confident of the 1500 result that Hacky targeted the shorter events with his taper .. <p> I certainly do n't think Hacky will be guaranteed a spot .. His comeback is likely to be more in line with **26;55;TOOLONG than Phelps but credit where credits due on Olympic campaigns . <p> Kelsey , there is a huge difference between the retirement of with that of Phelps . <p> Hackett etc retired , got married , had kids , allowed their bodies to go ballooning , went into one crises after another and then after 5 years or more , decided to swim again . <p> Phelps retired practically only a little bit over than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body as fit . Of course it 's much easier for him to come back and and go near his best . <p> March 2 , 2016 <p> Kelsey , I 'm not just referring to Sydney but to all three Olympics he attended . At each and every one , there seemed to be some sort of " misfire " . <p> Illness may 've been a part but one would think they 'd have " done a debrief " and examined their processes for what may 've caused problems . <p> In Sydney , he was " way off " in his early races ; so far so that he swam a 1.50 in the 4 ? 200 heats and was ditched for the final . <p> However , Beijing was the one where I feel they seemed to " sabotage themselves " . In the 400 &amp; 4 ? 200 , he comes out in a full bodysuit ( along the lines of the Thorpe model ) which was something he had never raced in before ! His performances in the 400 especially was well below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full suit . <p> I will readily agree that the odds lean strongly towards his comeback mirroring that of ; however the relative weakness of AUS men 's ranks at this time does give him some openings . <h> Jaime King reveals 
 Olympic Athletes ( ROA ) created by the IOC For Rio Olympic Games <p> The IOC today issued the statement below that talks to the theme of refugee athletes . Context : It comes on a day when 10,000 people a drop in the ocean of humanity on the move find themselves locked out of the EU on the Macedonian border as Europe attempts to control the flood . <p> The Executive Board ( EB ) of the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) today created a team of Refugee Olympic Athletes for the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . It will be treated at the Olympic Games like all the other teams of the 206 National Olympic Committees ( NOCs ) . <p> The EB also approved the operational aspects surrounding Team ROA . <p> The name of the team will be Team Refugee Olympic Athletes ; <p> Team ROA will get its own welcome ceremony at the Olympic Village , like all other teams ; The team will be housed like all the other teams ; <p> A team entourage will be appointed by the IOC to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Chef de Mission , coaches and technical officials ( as per official quotas ) ; <p> The team uniforms will be provided by the IOC ; For all official representations of the team ( including possible medal ceremonies ) , the Olympic flag will <p> be raised and the Olympic Anthem will be played ; The team will march behind the Olympic flag before host team Brazil at the Opening Ceremony ; <p> An adequate insurance policy will be contracted ; <p> A proper doping control process will be introduced through the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) ; and Olympic Solidarity will cover travel and other participation expenses for the team and will continue to support the athletes of the team after the Olympic Games . <p> As part of the IOC 's pledge to aid potential elite athletes affected by the worldwide refugee crisis , the NOCs were asked to identify any refugee athlete with the potential to qualify for the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . Such candidates could then receive funding from Olympic Solidarity to assist with their preparations and qualification efforts . <p> Forty-three promising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisting . In view of the complexity of the process and in order to allow sufficient time to finalise and consolidate all the necessary information about these candidates , the EB decided today to close the call for new candidatures . Only under exceptional circumstances requiring the approval of the IOC President will new candidates be considered . <p> " By welcoming the team of Refugee Olympic Athletes to the Olympic Games Rio 2016 , we want to send a message of hope for all refugees in our world , " said IOC President Thomas Bach . " Having no national team to belong to , having no flag to march behind , having no national anthem to be played , these refugee athletes will be welcomed to the Olympic Games with the Olympic flag and with the Olympic Anthem . They will have a home together with all the other 11,000 athletes from 206 National Olympic Committees in the Olympic Village . " <p> The ROA team for Rio 2016 is expected to number between five and 10 athletes . The participating athletes and the other members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its next meeting in June this year . The nomination criteria include sporting level , official refugee status verified by the United Nations , and personal situation and background . <p> Following the approval of Olympic Agenda 2020 , the IOC 's strategic roadmap for the future of the Olympic Movement , and in light of the current global refugee crisis , the IOC created a special fund of USD 2 million to develop relief projects through sport in collaboration with NOCs around the world . <p> Over 15 NOCs have already made use of this fund . Details of some of the projects under way can be found here and here . <p> The IOC already works with a number of United Nations agencies to help refugees around the world . For the last 20 years , the IOC and UNHCR in particular have been using sport to support healing and development among young refugees in many camps and settlements around the world . They have consequently seen thousands of refugees benefit from sports programmes and equipment donated by the IOC.@@7507850 <h> The Quiksilver In 
 Seebohm watching on from afar , illness having ruled out a trip down the coast to Sydney , her 15-year-old training partner at Brisbane Grammar , Minna Atherton , was there at NSW Championships in Sydney today to remind the other Australian on the World titles backstroke podium last August just how tough it is going to be to earn a berth on the Olympic team at trials a month or so from now . <p> Visitor in NSW terms , Madison Wilson , of St Peters Western and with a 59.90 behind her in heats , was out a fingernail ahead of the teenager 28.93 to 28.99 . The balance of speed on the way home was almost equal in equilibrium : 30.87 , 30.74 leaving Atherton ahead by last punch , 59.73 to 59.80 . Third place went to Hayley Baker in 1:00.95 just ahead of Sweden 's Michelle Coleman , on 1:01.19 , with Belinda Hocking the last inside 1:02 . <p> Atherton was delighted with her new high : <p> " I was n't really expecting to do a PB because I have n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy with that .

Australian trials are for all no preselection . <p> March 5 , 2016 <p> ASW , a wee bit premature with that pronouncement are n't we ? IF the situation arises that there are 3 sub in that final then it has some credence ..... at this point that is far from a certainty . <p> Overall a mixture of the good , the satisfactory ...... and the " concerning " ..... all in significant dosages . <p> Brad March 5 , 2016 <p> NSW State Opens also includes competition structure for swimmers with disabilities which is a great thing if treated respectfully . In tonight 's multiclass ' Maddison Elliott S8 won bronze in a time of 1:23.86 . This is just shy of 6 seconds over her PB which she set at IPC World Championships July 2015 winning Gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her IPC World Championships July prelim backstroke swim of as an S9 . This swim was slower than her entry time yet she was reclassed back down to S8 . <p> Elliott has proven that she consistently under performs at domestic competitions . I do n't see evidence of any other swimmer disabled or otherwise doing what she does and why would they ? <p> How can you swim so slowly domestically yet crack out World Records Internationally ? <p> March 5 , 2016 <p> There clearly may be some real issues with regards to the IPC classification regime , its operation and loopholes via which it may being manipulated . C <p> However , I really would prefer that aggrieved parties ( and/or their mouthpieces ) would actually go public with their concerns and to the mainstream media if officialdom is putting up a brickwall IF they have the evidence . <p> The practice of engaging in what could be described as " sniping from the sidelines " on various swim forums frankly does little for their cause as it comes across all too easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regards <p> Craig Lord March 5 , 2016 <p> The mainstream media has been approached CW ( I think we see these comments because of genuine frustration ... in the face of the same sort of ' look away and ignore ' approach to uncomfortable truths ) and I believe that on the way to Rio we will see exposure of some aspects of para-sport that the IPC will have to deal with ( and should be dealing with right now as a matter of urgency , as far as I can see ) . <p> March 5 , 2016 <p> Fair points , Craig . There is enough smoke to suggest this issue is real ...... and in all honesty , not isolated to one particular or country . Once someone figures out how to ' game the system ' successfully in any endeavour , it does n't take long for others to cotton on ..... much as some " snipers " would have us think differently . <p> I still feel my point is valid with regards to their methods . Rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone of their " contributions " serves to create a negative perception of them as " snipers " or worse . <p> Craig Lord March 5 , 2016 <p> I understand CW and think your points valid when I look at some of the comments out there . Hopefully we will get some sensible mainstream media discussion on an issue that has not been handled at all well , with federations at risk of being found to have been complicit in working the system to boost medal counts and create para champions out of unfair competition . <p> March 5 , 2016 <p> Absolutely , Craig . Methinks the fertiliser is likely to hit the fan in many circles post Rio both with regards to international sporting orgs and national bodies ...... and it would be most surprising if IPC competition is n't part of the equation . <p> As regards AUS , my instinct tells me that things are likely to be very ugly post Rio ....... with a number of " programs " /sports being effectively " binned " with funding slashed or even cut off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few are likely to escape unscathed or unbloodied . <p> lillian finch March 6 , 2016 <p> Genuine frustration is exactly the point Craig . The IPC and NPCs are well aware of the problem with cheating and they are in possession of evidence , but continue to turn a blind eye and in some cases are obviously complicit . These so called " athletes " continue to benefit financially , as well as receiving all the usual accolades , and the IPC and NPCs enable and condone this . Team mates are well aware that if they speak out publically it will be the end of their careers . There is a mountain of evidence but it needs an independent party to present it to mainstream media . <p> Brad March 6 , 2016 <p> Thank you . I made ( or at least I thought I did ) a valid comment on a swimmers performance . I researched IPC World Championship times and NSW State open times stated my opinion and asked a question based on my albeit quick research . I do n't consider myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ para swimming does have a place in mainstream competition but only if it has ethics and integrity . And , I am questioning what I have sat through these last few days . A podium position for swimming 6 seconds over your personal best think about it . <p> Incidentally , which bucket would you place your continual referral to certain Australian swimmers as ' serial tourists ' the ' I come in peace bucket ' or the ' watch your back sniper bucket ' ? I read your comments , mostly with great interest , but I cringe regarding the ' tourist comments ' as I regard them as unfair and personal but I certainly do n't feel the need to belittle you for your opinion or spend time wondering if you have a personal agenda . If I had something of interest to add your comments and engage in the conversation , I would but I certainly would not comment purely to shut you down . You are as entitled to your opinions as I am . <p> Lastly , I have written to NSW swimming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' open competition . I certainly do n't expect to receive a response . <h> FOOTBALL NEWS <p> 
 Marseille and the Golden Tour but Jeremy Stravius emerged from the freestyle with a smile on his face today after a 1:47.65 victory that kept at bay one Olympic champion , three World champions and the world record holder in the one four-lap battle . <p> With one length to go , World champion James Guy , of Britain , had a slither of an edge on Olympic champion and former World champion Yannick Agnel , with Stravius close and closest and Paul Biedermann , of Germany , next in line second away . <p> James Guy by Patrick B.

Dress rehearsals are essential but need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights , break a leg ' and rarely produce those improvisations that turn world-class into outstanding excellence when the super troupers are on . <p> Which is what has made Katinka Hosszu stand out like a sore thumb in world-class waters these past three years for with the Hungarian it is often a question of anytime , anywhere , any pool when it comes to delivering times at quiet moments that others have not reached on the biggest of occasions . <h> Hosszu Races To Rio Targets : 200 , 400IM , 200 Back <p> Katinka Hosszu by Fabio Ferrari LaPresse <p> In Marseille today , Hosszu honed in on her Olympic targets and set aside all the training appearances in other events . <p> A day after 4:29 in the 400IM , it was a 2:07.69 ( 27.88 ; 32.19 1:00.07 ; 37.64 1:37.71 ; 29.98 - ) in the medley . Only she has been that way in textile . Consider the drop on that time : Ye Shiwen , of China , is the only other ever to get inside over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2012 almost matched today in time-trial conditions in Marseille , where there are no rounds , not even heats at this particular meet . <p> Within 20 minutes , Hosszu followed up with a 2:07.36 ( 27.88 ; 31.75 1:01.78 32.79 and 32.79 for matched last 50s ) in the backstroke for victory ahead of a Russian who has something the Hungarian is after and Olympic medal . Anastasia Fesikova ( nee Zueva ) returned to sub-2:10 waters for the first time on the comeback trail following marriage and motherhood . At 2:09.83 , there was no coping with Hosszu but Fesikova just got her hand to the wall ahead of the 2:10.08 of Elizabeth Simmonds , of Britain and a swimmer who looks back at 2010 when she claimed the European crown in Budapest at a time when Hosszu 's career high was 2:15.53 , on her way to a best of in 2012 before the drop to 2:08.93 in the first season of a new career at world titles in 2013 . <p> That medley time today makes Hosszu the owner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those clocked in the past year as the Hungarian travels a unique curve of progress towards a shot at what would be her first Olympic medals at her fourth Games of asking on the way to her 27th birthday . <p> Alicia Coutts , of Australia , and Siobhan-Marie O'Connor , of Britain , complete the all-time textile top 10 but their best times from major peak moments are slower or only just as fast as two of Hosszu 's 2016 efforts . The Hungarian is a swimmer transformed . <p> Katinka Hosszu by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> At this stage four years ago , her best textile time was 2:10.09 , clocked at the 2010 European Championships at home in Budapest , a time well beyond the best 30 performances from performers ( multiple entries ) in textile ever . <p> Now , on the same basis , she owns almost half of the best 30 times ever swum ( 14 of the best 31 ever in fact ) . And that parallel to career highs in every stroke , all distances , established in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nothing in world-class swimming gets close to that level of transformation , not only among those in their mid-20s with a long career behind them but even among juniors on a curve of progress that rarely adds up to podium potential in three strokes and medley on big occasions . <p> Hosszu 's might is such that in such calm moments as Marseille in early March , Germany 's Alexandra Wenk and Spain 's Mireia Belmonte , on and 2:13.96 respectively are as close as any could get at a time of traditional work , with the winner 's national teammate Evelyn Verraszto next home in 2:14.24 . <p> Go back an Olympic cycle and both Belmonte and Verraszto were on a competitive par at in-season meets , all three having clocked a range of swims from 2:13 to 2:15 around this time of year . No more . <p> The helm of the world ranks 200 IM : <h> Women Individual Medley <p> 1 <p> <p> Katinka Hosszu HUN , 26 <p> Golden Tour FRA , Marseilles <p> 2 <p> <p> Sakiko Shimizu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 <p> <p> Alicia Coutts AUS , 28 <p> Victoria State Championships AUS , Melbourne <p> ... and 200 back : <h> Women Backstroke <p> 1 <p> <p> Madison Wilson AUS , 22 <p> Victoria State Championships AUS , Melbourne <p> 2 <p> <p> Katinka Hosszu HUN , 26 <p> Golden Tour FRA , Marseilles <p> 3 <p> <p> Emily Seebohm AUS , 23 <p> Aquatic Super Series AUS , Perth <p> Look along the result sheets in Marseille and Hosszu is the only established podium chaser who is not only setting European records but managing to get away from a world-record pace over . <p> Take Sarah Sjostrom , a Swedish ace who often swims fast in-season times . She did so today , though at 53.80 in the freestyle and 57 .. 01 in the butterfly , he pace paled by comparison to the Hungarian 's . <p> Sarah Sjostrom by Patrick B. Kraemer <h> Sjostrom 's Brace <p> In the freestyle final , closest to Sjostrom was Britain 's Fran Halsall , on 54.40 , with Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' fly final , Sjostrom 's winning margin was a touch bigger still , Britain 's Rachael Kelly on 58.11 , Commonwealth champion Katerine Savard , of Canada , on 58.15 and Nice 's Marie Wattel on 58.83 . <p> Marco Koch , of Germany , has put in a couple of 2:07s this season over breaststroke . Today , a 2:08.85 was good enough for a very comfortable victory margin ahead of national teammate Christian Vom Lehn , 2:12.52 , and Sweden 's Erik Persson and Italy 's Luca Pizzini , matched on 2:12.56 . <p> Coralie Balmy put in a fine freestyle effort , a establishing a meet record . Belmonte came home next in 4:07.01 , with Martina de Memme , of Italy , on 4:10.60 . <p> There was more speed consistency from Olympic and World champion Florent Manaudou , a 21.67 blast in the freestyle dash keeping at bay by at leads a stroke his Marseille teammate Cl ? ment Mignon , 22.24 , third place to Italy 's Marco Orsi in 22.40 . <p> Viktoria Gunes at world junior titles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( SWE ) <p> In the women 's breaststroke , World junior champion Viktoria Gunes , for Turkey , took the win in 1:07.5 a touch ahead of 1:07.98 from Italy 's Martina Carraro , third place to Britain 's Chloe Sutton in 1:08.31 . <p> A 54.32 was good for the men 's backstroke win for Germany 's Jan-Philip , with Simone Sabbioni on 54.77 and Camille Lacourt on 54.91 , ahead of his Marseille teammate Ben Stasiulis . <p> Spain 's Carlos Peralta took the butterfly in 1:58.00 , with Jordan Coelho on 1:58.51 and Hungarian David Verraszto on 1:58.54 , last inside 2mins Sweden 's Simon Sjodin in . Context : at a low-key meet , the Swim Cup in Gyor , Hungary 's Tamas clocked 1 ; 55.72 , for No on the current world rankings : <p> Hosszu is one of the most raced swimmers ever raking in millions from racing alone , that 's a class apart . I think her hard work is finally paying off when a 2.10 in the 200IM is a warm up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at peak in the 200IM . Scheduling is perfect for medley and backstroke events . Think she 'll throw her name in the hat for 200free , though 200free final and , 200I 'm final in same session . She 's so far ahead in IM , her effort in Marseilles today almost certain to clinch gold . She 's now like Ledecky in the way she dominates IMs . Even Ye at best will be no match for Hosszu <p> paolo March 5 , 2016 <p> Coralie Balmy very positive in the 400 free in every stage of the Golden Tour ( always under 4.05 ) . Curious to see if she can drop another chunk of time at French trials in Montpellier at the end of March . Sjostrom 's training a little different as regards previous years , when she performed perhaps greater times in-season . We 'll see , also for Sjostrom , her performances when counts most . <p> Craig Lord March 5 , 2016 <p> Bad Anon , you stretch your point raking in millions ... no , about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being a fast swimmer ( other egs , too ) ... so no uniqueness there ; that is reserved for the profile of her progress relatively late in a long career . Her ' dominance ' like Ledecky ' does not stretch to IMs , in my view .

The crisis extends to the choice of the new boss of RUSADA , the Russian anti-doping agency , in a man with a record of having informed athletes that unannounced testing agents were on their way , a new documentary suggests . <p> The week after next , the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and other authorities with influence , such as the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) , will determine whether Russian track and field athletes , and potentially other sportsmen and women from other sports implicated in the crisis , can compete in Rio this August . <p> This evening in Germany , the latest in a series of documentaries from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheating confirmed by two reports from a commission of inquiry established by WADA , alleged that Russia is failing to comply with clean-up demands that must be met if the country is to compete in the stadium in Rio this August . <p> ARD 's team also worked with The Sunday Times in London on evidence in a database that suggested that an official blind eye had been turned to many more adverse findings for banned substances in track and field ( from several countries ) than have made it to the public domain . <p> Now , " Doping Top Secret : Russia 's Red Herrings " , a 30-minute extension to the two documentaries already broadcast on cheating and corruption at the heart of the Russian sports system , is due to be broadcast in full on WDR 's " Sport Inside " program this evening . <p> The film , summarised on the ARD Sportschau , presents numerous examples of " violations of the regulations of IAAF and WADA " . <p> The program makers noted : " The two previous documentaries by Hajo Seppelt and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IAAF suspending Russia 's athletes indefinitely from all international competitions . <p> Suspended coaches continue to coach deep in the Russian provinces as if nothing had happened , the program states , adding : <p> " Other coaches are still active drug dealers . And , according to documents in the possession of ARD/WDR , a newly-elected leader of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA , had in the past informed athletes about dates for doping tests , as the documents seen by the ARD/WDR Doping research team prove . " <p> The evidence is show to Joseph de Pencier , Chairman of the International Association of National Anti-Doping Organizations ( ) , who responds by saying : <p> " When an official intentionally informs athletes in advance of doping tests , in order to defeat the doping control , disciplinary consequences must follow . This must be investigated , and a consequence would be that this person is fired . " <p> He calls on the IOC and WADA to take the issue seriously and continue to impose a ban until substantial reforms are in place and working : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Russian athletes should not be allowed to compete at the 2016 Olympic Games . " <p> Germany 's top athletics official , Clemens Prokop , President of the German Athletics Association ( DLV ) , is among those who have lost patience , telling ARD : <p> " Apparently , the situation as it has been called into question by the WADA Independent Commission , has not substantially changed . This can only mean that the conditions for the Olympic participation of Russian athletes is not satisfied . " <p> The scandal implicated former IAAF boss Lamine Diack and several other leading officials at the track and field federation , some of whom face corruption charges and/or are in the process of being prosecuted . <p> Evidence of that can be found in several polices , including of late a failure to intervene in doping cases from Thailand and Russia for precisely the same substance under circumstances in which culpability was accepted and yet the Thai swimmer was banned for four years , the Russian water polo player for just a year .@@7546868 <p> This website and

 roster of top-flight talent and depth , the University of Texas entered the NCAA Men 's Championships for Wednesday night 's single-event session as the heavy favorite to repeat as team champion . It did n't take long for coach Eddie Reese 's Longhorns to zip into first place , an NCAA record getting the job done . <p> The quartet of Jack Conger , Townley Haas , Clark Smith and Joseph Schooling covered the 800-yard freestyle relay in 6:08.03 to easily break Michigan 's NCAA standard of 6:09.85 from 2014 . North Carolina State and third-place finisher Florida also went under the former NCAA record , the Wolfpack touching in and the Gators going 6:09.84 . <p> Conger led off for Texas in , the ninth-fastest 200 freestyle performance in history , before giving way to freshman teammate Haas . In his first race at the NCAA Champs , Haas delivered a major statement by splitting 1:30.52 , the fastest split in history . He was followed by Smith 's outing of 1:33.28 , with Schooling anchoring in . <p> Although Conger had company in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the Longhorns were in complete control after the first few strokes of Haas .

Bilis and Dahl were joined by Ryan Held ( 1:32.06 ) and Justin Ress ( 1:33.64 ) . Florida 's best effort came from Jan Switkowski , who split 1:31.33 on the second leg . <p> NEW YORK 
 of the five swimming events on the second night of the NCAA Men 's Championships , the University of Texas put itself in commanding position atop the team standings . The Longhorns moved their point total to 209 to take a 46-point advantage over the University of Florida and a 68-point margin over California-Berkeley . <p> Texas followed its win in the 800-yard freestyle relay from the first night of the meet with two more relay triumphs while Townley Haas and snared individual championships . As much as Texas dominated , Florida 's Caeleb Dressel ( 50 freestyle ) and Cal 's Ryan Murphy ( 100 backstroke ) were also impressive and set American records to highlight a speedy night at the McAuley Aquatic Center . <p> The Longhorns opened the night by fending off North Carolina State in the 200-yard freestyle relay , the foursome of Brett Ringgold ( 19.07 ) , ( 18.53 ) , Jack Conger ( 18.74 ) and John Murray ( 18.54 ) touching in 1:14.88 .

Coming off the fastest split ever in the 200 freestyle from the opening night of action , when Texas won the 800 free relay , Haas prevailed in the 500 free in wire-to-wire fashion . Building an advantage through the first half of the race , Haas dug deep down the stretch and turned away pressure from Florida 's Mitch D'Arrigo , who finished second in 4:09.98 . <p> With solid long-course times to his credit and obviously benefiting from his work with coach Eddie Reese , Haas looks every bit ready to challenge for a berth to the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio .

Kraemer - inset showing the anti-doping app during an interview with <p> How Russia will rise to the challenge of cleaning up its house a interview with Evgeny Korotyshkin , who leads his campaign for clean sport in Moscow with the most important message for the youth of his country : I swam clean , so can you . <p> Evgeny Korotyshkin , Russian swimming team captain , Olympic silver medallist for Russia in the butterfly at London 2012 , and now president of the Moscow Federation , hit the nail on the head when he concluded : " ... the new generation must to lead this process and change things in a better way in my country . " <p> His point is good , too , when he says that doping is a universal problem in which the " crime " , for that it what it is , he suggests , can only be dealt with if flags are set aside and all in favour of clean sport stand together in the fight . <p> That will mean different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of dark forces and the willingness of federations not only to talk the talk but act as harshly as possible against those who fall foul of anti-doping rules are all a part of the fight . <p> Wisely , does not see himself in the role of accuser and prosecutor in Russia . He needs to build the environment in which clean sport , clean programs and clean athletes prosper free of the culture that has proved so problematic in specific ways in Russia . <p> " Doping is not just a Russian problem : all the countries , more or less , have athletes involved in a such shame . <p> " I remember when Milorad Cavic ( the Serbian who finished shy of Michael Phelps in the butterfly at Beijing 2008 ) in 2009 in a public press conference asked the international top level swimmers to join him in a strong battle against doping ... unfortunately , nobody took a position at that time and probably we lost a chance but it 's not too late : we must to stand together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against swimmers , coaches and doctors involved in this crime . " <p> Korotyshkin was glad the issue was being aired in public , telling SwimVortex : " ... in this way more people , for example parents and young athletes , can understand how important is to play true and respect the rules . Overall I believe that the new generation must to lead this process and change things in a better way in my country . " <p> He believed a cultural shift was both required and already happening . " In Russia a lot of people , including politicians , are ready to change things and they are working daily to fight doping . Just to give you an idea : with the support of the local government we made an APP to help all our athletes to avoid the risk of doping . " The App includes scanning your phone over the bar code on medical products : an alert is raised if the product contains banned substances , the WADA list built into the App . <p> Korotyshkin is taking the fight " to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in TV and Youtube ) with top level athletes as testimonials to fight doping and try to teach the youngest Russian generations " that you can win on training alone . He explained : <p> " Thank God , my coach in Russia was a clean and honest person . So I never got pressure or wrong proposals from my coach during my professional career in Russia . In 2009 I started to train in Italy with A.D.N Swim Project and everybody knows how strict his policy is : no doping in the Andrea Di Nino team . <p> Peter pops in to ADN to visit Evgeny ( left ) coach Andrea Di Nino ( right ) and team at an international squad that committed itself to drug-free sport <p> " From my move to Italy , and with the support of teammates such as Cavic , I started to be more involve in the media campaign against doping and that is still right now one of the missions of my present work in the Moscow Swimming Federation . " <p> How would clean sport be achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach educate the new generations of the Moscow swimmers is one of the main goals of my position as President of the Federation . How I can pass a clear and clean message to these young swimmers ? With my personal experience and sport life ... I gain my first senior international medal in 2003 ( Barcelona World Championships ) and the last one 10 years later ( Herning European Championships , 2013 ) and I was always a clean swimmer . So if I made these results for a such long time all the new Russian swimmers can reach the same results or even better . " <p> Were he not optimistic of achieving fundamental change , he would not have taken up the Moscow role , he said , adding : <p> " It will not be easy but for sure we are going to change things . Russia is a country with important values ... as more people become involved in this campaign , the easier and shorter a time this process will take . I hope some great Russian athlete , from any sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important battle . We are going to beat doping , for sure ! <p> Evgeny Korotyshkin anti-doping campaigner at ADN , with the Rusada paperwork from a test conducted on the swimmer while he trained in Italy <p> Asked if he felt he had the back of politicians , he replied : " We have several examples of strong reaction against doping . For example our President , Mr. Putin , recently passed a strong message to all the Ministers to be more active against doping . " <p> addressed the Duma to advocate clean sport in January 2014 . He recalls : <p> " I felt myself responsible , as Captain of the National Team and one of the most recognisable of the Russian swimmers outside my country . I wanted to ask for the help and support from our deputies parliamentarians to change what was wrong in our sport and at the same time tell everybody that most of Russia 's athletes are clean and get their medals through daily effort in the pool and gym . <p> Evgeny Korotyshkin ( RUS ) Courtesy : Gian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure other Russian swimmers are ready . We are proud of our country and tired to listen that all of us we are involved in doping . <p> " But now is not anymore the time for words , it 's the time to act strongly against doping , stop to use medicaments to improve in artificial way the sport performances , kick out from our environment the dirty people and be proud again to represent Russia in the most important sport competition . " <h> Comments <p> Oh please . Not all nations are guilty . Several nations are heavy users of drugs . And we all know who they are . And others are clean . So do n't state that it is a world wide problem . <p> Craig Lord March 25 , 2016 <p> , I think we all know and appreciate what you mean ( BRA , RUS , CHN all cases in point but each one of them where they are for distinct reasons that speak to the culture and environment in which sport takes place ) . There 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change is to come about : as Evgeny Korotyshkin is based in Moscow , that is not Sydney , London , Washington and Tokyo ... there are distinct cultural differences and in the Russia case with regards to doping and sport the system and those in it feel under enormous pressure ( and so they should ) . It does not require to land another sledgehammer of criticism on what 's already very obvious ( and then get hammered himself in return tit-for-tat style ) . His role is to campaign as he is in a way that instils good culture from grass roots upwards and cultivates an environment in which the rogues are shown the door not invited in . I think he makes his points in the most constructive way possible and I wish him luck in his endeavours as he suggests , it will not be easy . <p> Lawrie Cox March 25 , 2016 <p> yes there are some who are easily identified as problem federations . However the correct call is all nations need to ensure a clean sport and appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win or compete fairly . Whilst I am an Aussie if any Australian swimmer cheats then they need to be booted out and very publicly as the damage that is done needs to stop . We should all have zero sympathy for cheats . As is usual in anything so serious the Bureau is yet again missing in action ! ! <p> March 25 , 2016 <p> Au contraire , , you will cheat anywhere and everywhere that there are unscrupulous people and/or those who are desperate enough to " take that risk " to succeed . <p> Some countries testing regimes may be better resourced and more stringent than others but that does n't mean from those countries are n't doping but rather they 're currently " ahead of the game " with regards to what they 're using and how this is being managed . <p> RUS certainly has major issues and there appears to be clear evidence of some state involvement but this does not mean we have a mirror of the old 70's-80 's situation . Sport in that country , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed training in the West . <p> The most likely situation is that you have " rogue " groups and you can find them in any country and in any sport . <p> Yozhik March 25 , 2016 <p> is the interview with Evgeny Korotyshkin available in its original form . So I can read Evgeny 's answers in Russian . It is practically a crime not to be patriotical in Russia nowadays . It is very unusual to be the head of some state office and to not blame the West for current problems in Russia . The typical position would be : " Do you know where this rotten stuff that spoiled the entire generation of our youth came from . When we opened the door to western culture after Soviet Era what did we get in return ? ' Etc . It is hard to argue because some points are accurate . It is like epidemic that was brought to native Americans by Europeans . Their immune systems were not ready to withstand new diseases . With no sources of income with criminal mentality dominated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many problems . The Eugene 's ( not Evgeny 's ) mentality to succeed at any cost was the dominant one . I share Korotyshkin 's hope about new generation in Russian sport . P.S. it is kind of symbolic that Evgeny has such last name . ' ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ' ( ) is the funny name for very short person . When it is used as insult it means that the person can not achieve much . Hope it is not the case with Evgeny. <p> Suffolk-born Osborne memorably 
 from Bolles to Cal and rolling towards the world 's fastest waters <p> One man had been on the NCAA stage before . The other guy was new to the atmosphere . Despite the differences in experience , California 's and Texas ' Townley Haas shared something in common on the third night of the NCAA Championships at the McAuley Aquatic Center in Atlanta : They each put forth sterling performances that equated to American records . <p> A junior , Murphy lowered his own American and NCAA record in the 100-yard backstroke by covering his four laps in 43.49 , his effort not only the sole sub-44 clocking , but the lone sub-45 showing . Just a few events earlier , Haas , a freshman , broke the NCAA and American record in the 200 freestyle to help Texas pad its hefty lead in the team standings . The Longhorns ended the night with 366 points , 95 more than second place California , with Florida sitting third at 255 . <p> Since joining the Cal program of Dave Durden two years ago , Murphy has been everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolles School in Florida . But what he 's done this week at the NCAA Champs has been nothing short of sensational . His winning time on Friday night , coupled with the 43.51 he went in action a night earlier , makes Murphy more than a half-second faster than anyone else has ever been in the 100-yard back . <p> The junior made his third straight title in the event look like a stroll in the park . He emerged ahead off the start and enjoyed a .62 lead at the midway point , thanks to a 20.96 front end . Over the last two laps , Murphy simply added to his cushion , finishing well ahead of runnerup Connor Oslin of Alabama , who was timed in 45.32 . <p> For Murphy , this 2016 season has the potential to be a special campaign . While the American scene is loaded with backstroke talent , Murphy is a top contender to punch a ticket to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in both backstroke disciplines . More , he 's been during his career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest stage . <p> If Murphy 's exploits were expected , given his reputation and past accomplishments , the effort of Haas at least prior to the meet was unforeseen . Although Haas has been one of the country 's elite freshman and he was expected to score big for Texas , predicting NCAA and American records was not a snap judgment . <p> But in a matter of three days , Haas has elevated his status in a major way , his victory in the 200 freestyle the most impressive of his performances . After powering Texas to the 800 free relay title on Day One , thanks to the fastest split in history , Haas claimed the 500 free title on Thursday . In the 200 free , he basically raced against the clock . <p> Haas took the lead off the blocks and went through the 100-yard mark in 43.61 .

 American Youth Blossoming At An Opportune Time <p> A followup look at the young talent coming through the American scene and which will be charged with maintaining the United States ' superb history in the sport . <p> Eras in sports come and go , and not always in even fashion . Some years , a few more upstarts than usual will emerge , looking to etch their names as legitimate contenders on the international stage . Some years , an atypical number of veterans will wave goodbye , leaving gaping holes in rosters that must be filled . Year to year , the arrivals and departures are never easy to predict . <p> As this Olympic year continues to progress , the picture for the summer in Rio de Janeiro clarifies a bit with each passing day . Over the next several weeks , with numerous countries holding their Olympic Trials , the scene will be even clearer . A few individuals with medal aspirations will likely be dropped from that status , while previous longshots will see their odds much improved on the basis of a sterling performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hold its Olympic Trials for another three months , Omaha once again the home base for a meet that both elates and shatters . Still , it 's not difficult to foresee that a changing of the guard is on the horizon for the Stars &amp; Stripes particularly as it pertains to the male contingent . Already , Michael Phelps has confirmed that this Olympiad will be his last . The other great star of this American era , Ryan Lochte , could also see this Quad as his final foray at the biggest five-ring circus on the planet . <p> For all they 've brought to the sport , it wo n't be an easy day for Team USA when Phelps and Lochte depart . But as history has shown , American excellence does not cease just because a big name moves on . Take a few of these more recent examples as proof . <p> When Mark Spitz swam away , there was Jim Montgomery to take the slack , Rowdy Gaines and Matt Biondi eventually passing the torch in years that followed . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who yielded to Aaron Peirsol , whose excellence has been maintained by a deep field of varied talent . <p> As Tom Dolan 's days waned , Phelps was more than ready to fill the void . <p> Many more instances could be noted , but the bottom line is this : The pipeline will continue to feed USA Swimming as it tries to maintain its grip on global supremacy . Last week 's NCAA Championships in Atlanta showed that much to be true , the exploits of a handful of athletes providing promise for the future , and across several strokes and distances . <p> The immediate reaction by some members of our global readership will be to point out the fact that the NCAA Champs were conducted in a short-course format , a setup that does not lend itself to simple or wholly accurate conversions to the long-course pool . But there are ways to extrapolate whether those who excelled at NCAAs will be able to convert their success to the big rectangle . Simply , have those who put up big efforts in the little pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer is yes . Consider : <p> Caeleb Dressel <p> There was n't a faster man in the water at the McAuley Aquatic Center than 19-year-old Caeleb Dressel of the University of Florida . As he rocketed to NCAA and American records in the ( 18.20 ) and 100-yard freestyles ( 40.46 ) , Dressel obliterated the competition , prevailing by margins not typically seen in the sprint events . As someone who ranked third in the world in the 50 free last year , Dressel has shown he has what it takes to get the job done in the pool that matters most . The key for Dressel is to expand his long-course success to the two-lap event , thus simultaneously flourishing as an individual and giving the United States a needed relay boost . <p> In the case of Townley Haas , who claimed NCAA titles in the 200 and 500 freestyles , the University of Texas freshman flourished beyond expectations , especially in his American record of 1:30.46 in the 200 free . Haas was 1:47.55 in the long-course version of the 200 free before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten faster , which translates to considerable hype for the summer to come . While Phelps and Lochte are viewed as cogs for the American 800 free relay in Rio , Haas has certainly become a frontrunner for one of the other two positions . <p> The ledger from the NCAA Champs reveals that Jack Conger did not capture an individual title , and the disappointment on his face after the 200 butterfly where he was edged by teammate Joseph Schooling emphasized just how much Conger wanted a solo crown . But with a effort in the 200 free , another sub-45 outing in the 100 fly and an American record of 1:38.06 in the 200 fly , Conger packaged a terrific competition . He was faster than last year in the majority of his swims and considering he was among the top-ranked flyers in the world in both the 100 and 200 distances , Conger is well-positioned going into Omaha . <p> Ryan Murphy <p> If the United States is able to turn to just the three aforementioned names , it 's obviously in good shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even been mentioned yet . In leading California , Ryan Murphy was nothing short of phenomenal , his American records in the 100 backstroke ( 43.49 ) and 200 backstroke ( 1:35.73 ) among the greatest performances in NCAA Champs history . Murphy is already a proven commodity on the international stage , so continued improvement is fully expected for the junior , who is capable of medaling in both backstrokes in Rio . <p> Meanwhile , Josh Prenot and Will Licon have the potential to qualify for Rio in the 200 breaststroke . has already been 2:08.90 in long course , so his pedigree is undeniable . For Licon , he is not yet in the same territory as Prenot in the Olympic-sized pool , but his 2:10.02 from last summer came after a battle with mononucleosis that hampered his training and preparation . Bigger things , then , could be on the way . <p> Still to come to the NCAA circuit is Maxime Rooney , bound for the University of Florida and already a sub-49 performer in the 100 free and a performer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong chance to bolster the American relays . <p> A transition will take place in American men 's swimming in the not-so-distant future , as some legends leave the blocks and leave holes to fill . There will be no replacing the likes of Phelps and Lochte . Guys like that do n't come along too often . But the United States is not aching for up-and-comers . Rather , as the NCAA Championships showed , there is reason for confidence in the days , months and years ahead . <h> Comments <p> Large , wealthy population with expansive swimming facilities and deep swimming history and expertise means that there will always be youth swimmers blossoming at opportune time . <p> Yozhik March 30 , 2016 <p> Whatever you say , asf means only one thing if there is a unique talanted boy or girl he/she most likely wo n't be missed .

If shaves off another second which is within her ballpark combined with Coleman 's improvements this season that could mean a 2 ? -3 second team improvement from Kazan . However , Hansson failed to do sub 2.00 today so that 's a bit of a worry about her form . Very early but fun to speculate . <p> Yozhik March 31 , 2016 <p> If she swims under 100fs ( some indication of tapering ) then I will consider that 200 was still swum in the training mode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season .

MacLean was just under the former standard of 1:56.97 , set at the height of the tech-suit era by Genevieve Saumur . <p> MacLean got to the wall a little more than a half-second ahead of 15-year-old Penny Oleksiak , who took top honors in the 100 butterfly on the opening day of the meet .

BUT , normally , a swimmer with bad RT has bad twitch fibre reaction , and that means he will need to have some time to " get in " in the race.We are talking about precious time in the current state of affairs , a time a sprinter ca n't afford to course , there is always exceptions like Cate Campbell and Popov . <p> April 10 , 2016 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is consistently medaling in 50 free at every global championships since 2011. and that 's why sprinters like Cate sometimes missed out on medaling like in Kazan even though she has the 50 free textile WR. <p> 21st Ward Alderman 
 the podium alone and with teammates at the World Junior Champs last year TV still and made her mark at Canadian Olympic trials today <p> Early action at the Canadian Olympic Trials brought the name of Penny Oleksiak into the spotlight , her national record in the 100 butterfly ( 56.99 ) establishing the 15-year-old as a legitimate contender for a minor medal in the event at this summer 's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . As the Trials wind down , Oleksiak is again proving herself as a rising star . <p> On the penultimate day of the Canadian Trials , Oleksiak dropped a national record in the 100 freestyle , her time of 53.31 easily bettering the 53.83 standard set last year by Chantal Van . The performance also jumped Oleksiak to fifth in the world rankings and while it remains outside of what will be necessary for the podium in Rio , the teen is clearly on an upward career arc . <p> En route to another national record , Oleksiak claimed the standard in front of its former owner . Oleksiak went out in 25.71 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mainville in between at 25.82 . Down the last lap , Oleksiak again delivered the swiftest split , closing in 27.60 . Van got to the wall in front of Mainville , the pair touching in respective times of 53.91 to 54.14 . Fourth place went to Michelle Williams in 54.45 . <p> History has shown that teenage girls can quickly improve their performances in short timeframes , and perhaps Oleksiak is at a stage in which the clock will reveal favorable results on a regular basis . Still , there is a long way to climb for the upstart , given the fact that the medal hunt in Rio will include the likes of Sarah Sjostrom , Campbell sisters ( Cate and Bronte ) and reigning Olympic champion Kromowidjojo . <p> Brittany MacLean continued her dominance in the longer freestyle events , adding a win in the 800 free to her previous victories in the 200 free and 400 free . MacLean cruised to a time of 8:21.40 , not far off her Canadian record of 8:20.02 from 2014 . MacLean 's time sits third in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win of the week when she stopped the clock in in the 200 distance , finishing comfortably ahead of fellow Olympic qualifier Martha McCabe ( 2:25.13 ) . Smith had just a .13 advantage at the midway point and trailed McCabe by .03 at the 150-meter mark before closing in 36.75 , with McCabe struggling to a final split of 38.00 . <p> The only finals on the men 's side failed to produce Olympic-qualifying times . Jeremie DeZwirek covered the 200 backstroke in 1:58.31 , but that was time .09 shy of earning a trip to Rio . Meanwhile , Mack Darragh 's 53.37 triumph in the 100 butterfly left him 1.01 over the time required to race at the Olympics . In the prelims of the 100 fly , favorite Santo Condorelli touched first in , but was subsequently disqualified for a touch infraction . <h> Ryan Murphy Pops 1:54.94 Outing in 200 Backstroke <p> A few days after putting together a performance in the 100 backstroke , American Ryan Murphy shot to No. 2 in the world in the 200 backstroke while racing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior moved through his four laps in 1:54.94 , trailing only China 's Jiayu Xu ( 1:54.79 ) in the world rankings . <p> Ryan Murphy <p> Murphy , who is coming off NCAA and American records in the and 200-yard backstrokes from the NCAA Championships , has positioned himself perfectly for the leadup to the United States Olympic Trials . Not only should his confidence be soaring , he 's given his competitors something to think about as they prepare for Omaha . Murphy was followed to the wall by Cal teammate Jacob Pebley , who went a strong 1:56.40 . <h> Comments <p> April 10 , 2016 <p> 15 yo who swims 53.33 is insanity . I rate that both of her 100 free/fly swims this week rank her ahead of what Cate and Sarah swam in their respective event at the same age ( remember Cate had LZR in 2008 and Sarah had whatever advanced swimsuit in Rome ) . <p> By the way , that 53.33 destroyed the Junior world record . Finally , an official junior world record that is as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all the hype leading to the trials . There have been reports of an injury , but instead trimming down events because of injury , guess what she did ? Yeah , swam as many events as she gets her hands on . This is insanity at a different meaning . <p> April 10 , 2016 <p> Meanwhile , at the Australian trials prelims , a William Stockwell swam 49.32 in 100 free , almost a second faster than what his dad swam in 1984 Los Angeles . I do n't envy the pressure and expectation on him to swim fast , being an offspring of Tracy Caulkins and Mark Stockwell . <p> April 10 , 2016 <p> Penny 53.31 was impressive , but what surprised me more is how much muscle she has yet to fill her body.She will get to places ...@@8173186 <h> Austrian Government Planning

 ca n't stop Katie Ledecky , as the distance-freestyle sensation turned in another sterling performance on Friday night by winning the 400-meter freestyle of the Mesa stop on the USA Swimming Pro Series . The reigning world champion in the event and overwhelming favorite to capture the gold medal at the Olympic Games this summer in Rio de Janeiro , Ledecky turned in a time of 4:02.15 . <p> The fact that Ledecky was able to produce that time of outing on a night of adversity for the athletes was further proof of her excellence . The wind was one of the biggest stories of the night , as the outdoor venue was heavily affected by Mother Nature . With gusts upward of 30 mph and the flags whipping , swimmers were forced to deal with balance issues on the blocks , battling through a considerable headwind on the outgoing lap and timing their turns while accounting for the influence of wind . <p> Somehow , Ledecky made it look easy . <p> On the way to topping Cierra Runge ( 4:08.08 ) by nearly six seconds , Ledecky took charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went through the 100-meter mark in 58.45 , was 1:59.26 at the midway point and touched at the 300 in . Lotte Friis was the third-place finisher , going . <p> With six sub-4:00 performances to her credit and the only woman in history to break that barrier in a textile suit , Ledecky is pegged to capture the gold medal in Rio in August . Only illness , injury or an other-worldly swim from out of nowhere would derail Ledecky , whose path to the United StatesOlympic Trials in Omaha will include one more trip to Colorado Springs for altitude training . <p> As long as she remains on course , Ledecky will pursue a freestyle triple in Rio , attempting to win the 200 free , 400 free and 800 free , where she is the reigning champion . Ledecky will also be a member of the American 800 freestyle relay and could see duty for the Team USA in the 400 free relay . <p> For the men , Michael McBroom covered his eight laps in to beat Conor Dwyer ( ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top Of Podium With 1:58.14 in 200 Fly <p> Coming off a victory in the consolation final of the 200 freestyle from the opening day of the meet , Michael Phelps took the title in the 200 butterfly with a wire-to-wire triumph that ended with the clock reading 1:58.14 . Although the time was far from impressive , it comes with the context that Phelps is not looking to do anything spectacular at this point in the season . <p> Michael Phelps , by Peter Bick <p> The Olympic Games his focus , Phelps fought through the windy conditions and held off Pace Clark ( 1:58.71 ) , who cut into a sizable deficit and pushed the 18-time Olympic gold medalist to the wall . Phelps split 25.81 for the first lap and made the midway turn at 54.93 , before heading for home with a split of 1:26.21 at the 150-meter mark . <p> With many nations holding their Olympic Trials this month , Phelps ' time does not compare well with some of the marks being produced around the world . However , it 's critical to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only to headline Summer Nationals with a trio of No. 1 performances , including a 1:52.94 mark in the 200 fly . <h> A Crowded Field Emerging in Women 's 50 Freestyle <p> The United States ' status in the women 's 50 freestyle remains a work in progress , the need to get someone in territory among the biggest asks for Team USA . Whether that void is filled , though , could hinge on the fact that an event once severely lacking now features a field that should be highly competitive in Omaha . <p> Dana Voller Photo : Mike , courtesy of USA Swimming <p> Fending off a lineup that featured several big names , Madison Kennedy sprinted away from her competition to touch in 24.45 , good for the No. 6 slot in the world rankings . Kennedy needed a strong showing as she was followed by comeback mom Dana Vollmer , who registered a career best of 24.69 , just ahead of the 24.72 by Abbey Weitzeil . Simone Manuel also cracked the 25-second barrier , finishing in 24.78 . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although it is difficult to gauge just how much times were lowered by the boost from behind . <p> While Kennedy took top honors in the event , the effort of Vollmer can be argued as the most impressive . The winner of the 100 fly a night earlier with a sub-57 effort , Vollmer suddenly became a contender in the 50 free by producing a 24-mid performance for the first time . Picking up momentum with each meet , Vollmer is shaping up to be one of the most intriguing stories of the U.S. Trials . <p> As opposed to the women 's sprint , the men 's 50 free was a one-sided affair , with Nathan Adrian racing to the victory in 21.69 , well ahead of the 22.28 of Anthony Ervin . Adrian moved to third in the world and continued his dominance of the 50 free in Pro Series action . <p> In other action , Cammile Adams topped the field in the 200 butterfly with a time of 2:08.59 , a few tenths off her season best of 2:08.21 .

Balance of bulk and litheness is important . <p> Strength coach Paris Payne had done " an incredible job " with Proud , Rudd noted : " He 's bigger , stronger , leaner than ever . He 's also matured boy to man since 2013 . What we have to watch is balance : he lifts big weights but I also want him to swim fast . " <p> Sprint synergy was a balancing act , he suggested : the power from the gym was a must but instinct , feel and technical skills in water were " essential " . Says Rudd : <p> " You can lift as much weight in the gym as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need in water , you wo n't be swimming fast .

With 4 ? 200 being a strong relay they certainly have the spaces on the team to bring six , but if it came to it , one would surely hope Lloyd would n't get one of the 30 places over an individual swimmer . Even if there is plenty of space on the squad there 's little point having a sixth in a situation like this . They ca n't risk resting more than one in the heats and 2-5 are very close in times anyway -- and with no other swims to worry about . If the philosophy is small team of genuine contenders , there 's not really room for someone to sit around waiting for others to get sick . <p> The award is

Thanks . <p> Yozhik April 19 , 2016 <p> There is some similarity between progress of V. Andreeva and K. Hosszu . Both started to show visible progress in 200 free and after Olympic year 2012. 2:13.80 looks too fast for Andreeva in 2012 . <p> April 20 , 2016 <p> Craig caught a good one here . I thought Vikoriya Andreyeva was the same person of Ekaterina Andreyeva . <p> Unless they both same the same time in 2012 , that 2:13.80 belongs to Ekaterina Andreeva . She swam it at 2012 Russian national trials . <p> Yozhik April 20 , 2016 <p> Asf , you are talking about two different swimmers . <p> April 20 , 2016 <p> Yes , I know . That 's why it confused me a great deal in the first place . <p> But that 2:13.80 in 2012 was swum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian trials and represented Russian in London , where she swam inexplicable 2:17.84 , the slowest of all prelims swims . <p> April 20 , 2016 <p> The fastest 200 IM by Viktoriya Andreyeva in 2012 that I could find was 2:15.78 in Saint-Petersburg on 17 March . <p> felix April 20 , 2016 <p> I thought I had plenty of spare time on my hands .... ? ? <p> For all their doping this Russian team looks very weak , zero Olympic medals a real possibility . <p> It is equivalent to the drop of 47 seconds for Ledecky at or 2.6 seconds for Cate Campbell at It is huge . Where do swimmers like Hosszu or V. Andreeva find such resources ? She is getting 24 this sommer , so the puberty is not the factor . Maybe this is medley specific thing that is a blend of different styles . I can not recall anything similar in pure style competition among top swimmers.@@8355270 <h> Advertisement <h> Celebrations

Kraemer <p> Shiny suits make the Russian backstroke record a hard act to follow : 2:04.94 , Anastasia Zueva , back in 2009 , Rome circus and all that . None of which made a 2:09.70 Rio 2016 cut an impediment to Zueva , now Fesikova as wife of sprinter Sergei Fesikov , qualifying for the battle in Brazil at the Olympics in August : 2:08.74 . <p> And that was just the silver .

For Ustinova and others in swimming , national team photos of relay podium placers come with a hefty helping of asterisks that taint the unclean and clean alike . <p> In all the coverage of nationals from around the world , Russia , with China and Brazil , stands out as a place where you can not report on swimming without mentioning doping . <p> In other finals <h> Touch of drama In the Dash <p> Vladimir Morozov , right , had a 22.01 cut off to get to for Rio .

High Chance of 0 individual gold , maybe even 0 medal at all .. ( Maybe not even final on 100 back ) <p> Ger April 22 , 2016 <p> Only time will tell with regard to MF Rafael . Until we see her swim at the U.S. trials we just do n't know for sure . You may be correct . There are a lot of negative vibes around regarding her at this time . If she can improve on Kazan , she definitely has a very good shot at the 200 back . <p> Rafael April 22 , 2016 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad start and did not swim the rest of the meet .. <p> There is some chance she could be beaten domestically on 100 back and that get the top 2 200 free spots .. she would have the 200 back .. and the relays ( 4 ? 200 for gold , the other 2 could get locked out of medal ) <p> A " slow " final may see all medalists on 2.05 . Think Missy is the only one capable of a 2.04 judging by from historical performances . Hocking has a 2.06.06 high from 2011 , Seebohm touch faster in Kazan . Hosszu will have swum multiple finals before the final and do n't see her being too much under 2.06 . Think the race itself will be very competitive but the clock will tell another story <p> April 22 , 2016 <p> Until we get conclusive proof to that effect from US Trials ; I 'm not writing Franklin off , especially in the . <p> The 100back could most certainly be problematic for her should she not be able to regain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near full final of sub minutes at US Trials ; few have been threatening the 59 barrier . <p> Whilst it appears Ledecky has a mortgage on one of the 2 US 200free spots ; the 2nd is not out of play . Whilst Schmitt has been able to reattain 1.56 status ; that is still quite a jump to sub 1.55 or better . Franklin was 1.55 last year and may still be very much in business to at least qualify in this event . <p> My prediction this far out 1 . Franklin 2.05.16 2 . Seebohm 3 . Hosszu The speed of the American women at trials may give a better indication of Rio medal prospects . and Franklin my picks ahead of Beisel , Pelton et.al <p> felix April 22 , 2016 <p> Rafael , calm down . Missy is n't going to be slightest bit worried about some . Definitely the one to beat , &amp; she will be in Rio for the 100 . <p> Yozhik April 22 , 2016 <p> If people continue to push Missy with unfulfilled expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let her enjoy the success of what is achievable now , but not being constantly sorry for not meeting expectations created mostly by media that put her in the position like she in deep debt for giving too much promises and getting by that undeserved attention . She is a very appealing person and media started immediately capitalise on " Phelps in Skirt " . She 's never been Phelps . Yes , the seventeen year old set a world record . Nothing unusual . Yes for next three years she did n't break this record . It happens all the time with many . Yes , she is also a good freestyle sprinter that can get to the finals . It is not a rare situation to be confident with two long arm strokes . Is there a place for expectations ? Sure , but for cautious ones . Her medal tally and her availability for very successful at the moment American relays that what has made the trick . So , let 's take it easy , let make the media environment suitable for Franklin 's development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy with whatever she can do but not to be sorry by not meeting someone 's expectations . American swimming needs this first class swimmer . Have you seen Franklin jumping , dancing on the deck , or hugging and kissing everybody around this year ? If there would be no great mood , there would be no great results . <p> But now I must keep an eye on this Daria 17 yo at Olympics is ripe with significant progress . I wonder if the Russians will participate in race meets ( mare nostrum , seven Hills , Santa clara ) , to better gauge where they will be right before the Olympics . <p> April 23 , 2016 <p> Last year , Missy was still able to finish close second in 200 back . This year , after one full year training with her old coach at altitude , surely she will win 200 back ? <p> April 23 , 2016 <p> I know this is kinda out there , but one of the best things that happened to Missy since London is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotlight will be rightfully focused on Ledecky and this means less pressure on Missy to qualify in 4 individual events or the American media expectations that Missy would swept Rio , just as they did to Kathy Hoff in 2008 .

I <p> The swim-sprint men of Marseilles took time out to boost the French Olympic bid for the 2024 Olympic Games in their home-pool town today . <p> Why Marseilles ? To put wind in the sail of the Paris bid that if won will see the sailing events staged on the waters off the capital of its department of Bouches-du-Rh ? ne and region of Provence-Alpes-C ? te d'Azur . <p> Against the spectacular and historic backdrop of the 17th Century Fort Saint-Jean , incorporating the 12th Century Commandry of the Knights Hospitaller of St John and the 15th Century tower of Ren ? I , Olympic freestyle champion Florent Manaudou , with Camille Lacourt , Fabien Gilot , Fred Bousquet and other top French athletes beside him , said : <p> " Regardless of their sport , Olympians are the heart and soul of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown by the Paris 2024 delegation here in Marseille underlines the bid 's commitment to the athletes . It 's fantastic that Marseille will play a key role in the 2024 Games and it 's great to get a feel for the Games plan outside of Paris . As an athlete it 's inspiring to know that all the whole nation will be firmly behind Team France . " <p> Fighting talk in a place that has known battle before down the years since humans first inhabited what is now Marseille and its environs almost 30,000 years . <p> The water theme flows through history : palaeolithic cave paintings in the underwater Cave near the calanque of Morgiou date back to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC , while he founding of " Massalia " has been recorded as aquatic legend . <p> The origin Greek , it goes like this : Protis , while exploring for a new trading outpost or emporion for Phocaea , discovered the Mediterranean cove of the Lacydon , fed by a freshwater stream and protected by two rocky promontories . Protis was invited inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ligurian tribe for suitors seeking the hand of his daughter in marriage . At the end of the banquet , Gyptis presented the ceremonial cup of wine to Protis , indicating her unequivocal choice . Following their marriage , they moved to the hill just to the north of the Lacydon ; and from this settlement grew Massalia . <p> Graham Robb , in The Discovery of Middle Earth , gives greater weight still to the Gyptis story but notes that the tradition was to offer water , not wine , to signal the choice of a marriage partner . <p> That was no the end of the water and the wine . According to Proven ? al tradition , Mary Magdalen evangelised Marseille with her brother Lazarus . <p> The place has known death and destruction on grand scale . In 1720 , the last Great Plague of Marseille , a form of the Black Death , killed 100,000 people in the city and thereabouts . <p> Backdrop to today 's support for Paris 2024 , the 17C Fort Saint-Jean was built on a site earlier occupied by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from which the new building deprived its name . Fort Saint-Nicolas was constructed at the same time on the opposite side of the harbour . <p> Louis XIV 's take : <p> " We noticed that the inhabitants of Marseille were extremely fond of nice fortresses . We wanted to have our own at the entrance to this great port . " <p> He was a lad . The truth will out : the two new forts were built in response to a local uprising against the governor , rather than for the defence of the city . Evidence ? Their cannons pointed inwards towards the town , not outwards towards the sea . <p> The Paris 2024 crew <p> In April 1790 Fort Saint-Jean was seized by a revolutionary mob . They decapitated the chevalier de , commander of the royal garrison , after he was captured but refused to surrender the fortress . <p> During the subsequent French Revolution the fort was used as a prison , holding Louis Philippe II , Duke of Orl ? ans , and two of his sons , Louis-Charles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montpensier . Following the overthrow of Robespierre in 1794 about a hundred Jacobin prisoners held in the fort were massacred . <p> Things are calmer these days and on a blustery , sun-soaked day on the front , in conditions beloved of boatsmen and women relying on two elements not engines to propel them , Manaudou and his Marseilles teammates joined the senior Paris 2024 delegation in Marseille for their visit to the wonderful Marina Marseille the proposed Sailing venue for the 2024 Games . <p> The delegation included sailors Xavier Rohart , four-time Olympian and Olympic Bronze Medallist at Athens 2004 , two-time World Champion and Sailor of the Year 2004 , Dimitri Deruelle , two-time Olympian at Barcelona 1992 and Sydney 2000a and two-time World Champion , Lise Vidal , Olympian at Sydney 2000 in windsurfing , and Olivier Backes , Olympian at Athens 2004 , two-time World Champion and two-time European Champion . Virginie Dedieu , four-time Olympian and Olympic Bronze Medallist at Sydney 2000 in synchro swimming , was there , too , as were Nathalie Benoit , Paralympic rower , and silver medallist at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rohart : " It 's great to be here in Marseille to see first-hand the venue plans for Olympic Sailing in 2024 . This is a ready-made , world-class venue with an excellent track record in hosting national and international Sailing events , including the 2002 ISAF World Games . The views across the Marina are stunning and the conditions are perfect for Olympic Sailing . " <p> Vidal added : <p> " Marseille is my home city and I am proud to say that the Marina will be a wonderful setting for Olympic sport . The facilities now also include a wonderful Sailing centre which is open to the public for training and leisure and the state-of-the-art hub is also the home of the French National Sailing Team . Marseille already benefits hugely from the wonderful centre and hosting Olympic sailing and football here will do even more for the community . " <h> Hollywood comes to

The swimmer said that he will seek help to quit drinking . <p> Hackett said that his career was tarnished by " pure stupidity , making poor decisions at crucial times in my life " and he felt " a huge amount of regret . " <p> He had struggled being back in the public spotlight after six years away from competitive swimming , leading to " unacceptable " and " embarrassing " actions , in his words : <p> " I have to live with that . It is very difficult . A deep sense of shame , guilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my actions and the people it has impacted .

In 2014 , he travelled to the United States for dependency treatment , the sleeping medication Stilnox at the heart of his problems . Stilnox was banned by the Australian Olympic Committee on the way to the London 2012 Olympics and was central to the controversy that led to penalties being imposed on members of the Australia men 's 4x100m freestyle quartet and reserves , some of whom admitted to having used Stilnox ( among other questionable behaviour ) . <h> Comments <p> felix April 29 , 2016 <p> I have no sympathy for Hackett , that video of him coming off the plane was embarrassing for everyone involved in swimming especially the Olympic team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore their name within the media .

 , the one supposed to make the swimmer race sharp , has become part of the signature of Katinka Hosszu and yet todays events make no sense on that score : 4:32.68 over medley this morning in Lignano at an Italian federation invitation meet that will serve as no more than a time trial and exercise for the born-again Hungarian double World medley champion . <p> Next home was away , no ' race ' about it ( other than self ) , purely another moment to hone and send a message to her rivals that in quiet moments she can clock world-class times at a pace faster than she was ever able to muster in a textile suit before 2013 , faster indeed than her 4th place finish in the London 2012 Olympic final when she clocked a career best in a textile suit . <p> There was more time trialling out front alone later in the day with a 1:57.30 win in the freestyle , more than faster than she had ever swum before 2013 but now down on best ( see chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final at London 2012 , Hosszu has sum faster 14 times , four of those efforts this year and seven of them clocked in minor moments away from the big occasion of international battle . <p> The splits today : 1:03.86 ; 2:12.83 ; ; 4:32.68 <p> At the age of 26 , 27 on Tuesday , Hosszu , inside 4:30 for a European record and a line in history on a quiet moment in February this year , has made a habit of knocking spots off her pre-2013 bests . Indeed , she has done so in every single event , all strokes , all distances on the world-championship program , her career bests in 18 events all clocked since 2013 . <p> Swimming history offers very few examples of such all-encompassing improvement , particularly three Olympic cycles into an international career and heading to a fourth Olympic Games . Among the most notable stories when it comes to form long into an international career is one that turned sour when Michelle Smith de Bruin , a triple Olympic champion at 26 going on 27 , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hosszu has not . Her federation in Hungary has also leapt to her defence , noting that she has been often tested and never returned any adverse finding . <p> A valid point but one that will not stop speculation in a sport with a vast history of doping that never resulted in a positive test and left those known to have raced to the big podiums while enhanced by banned substances ( GDR , for example ) with prizes in their hands any off-the-chart swims and unique profiles will continue to result in skepticism . <p> Among fingers that have been pointed in public at Hosszu , that from Swimming World last year is the most notable . It led to Hosszu and her legal team making the issue a part of the story , a matter of jurisdiction . <p> After denying she has ever used banned substances , Hosszu filed a libel lawsuit against writer Casey Barrett and the parent company of Swimming World Magazine after an article appeared linking Hosszu to suspicion under the headline " Are Katinka Hosszu 's Performances Being Aided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada and an award-winner form his work on NBC 's coverage of the Olympic Games , is among key figures hired by USA Swimming to work on " The Last Gold " documentary that highlights the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 and its effect on swimming at the 1976 Olympic Games . The trailer of the film provides context to the atmosphere in swimming in a season of WADA Commission inquiry and a toughening of resolve from authorities on anti-doping : <p> Court documents show that Hosszu has sued for Personal Injury : Assault Libel &amp; Slander after filing with the Phoenix Division Office of the Arizona District Court . Bridget Bade is listed as the presiding judge in a case that will decide if comment was fair or not . <p> What the judge decides is for the judge . <p> What we can say for certain is that Hosszu is a swimmer transformed since 2012 .

If they called a number of witnesses , respected figures in swimming who concurred with CB 's comments , then that would n't help KH 's reputation , even if she won the case . I ca n't enthuse about what she has done the past few years ; there 's nothing like it . I 'm very suspicious and I feel I should be . Michelle Smith almost got away with it and to a certain extent she did : she still has her medals . If the testers had n't called on that day , then we still would n't know for sure . <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> God Bless Taffy C is all I will say to that , Ger . <p> April 30 , 2016 <p> I do n't know much about Ms. Hosszu , particularly on her career before the London Olympics . I 've only seen videos of her swimming here and there . But as a question to somebody that 's followed her progress more closely : could it be that she 's improved her swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how she swam before 2012 . That said , I 've never been too impressed with her butterfly : in my humble opinion she throws way too much water in from of her when her arms and hands touch the surface . <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> No , , I do n't believe there has been any significant improvement in technique relative to the gains made on the clock ( her core strength makes her more ' stable ' but that applies to a great many swimmers if you take 2010-2016 as the period to consider ) since I watched her at the 2006 and then 2010 European Championships ( 2008-09 not applicable the argument in terms of comparisons ) she 's long been an efficient swimmer ( Hungarians are taught good technique from a young age and many Hungarians have fine efficiency built in during their younger years ) ; she has clearly become much stronger since 2013 , and strength can and does change technique , not always for the better , of course ( your ' fly example a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Budapest Europeans , you may see what I : //www.youtube.com/watch ? ... It is not technique that has changed but power ( core much more rigid ) and endurance . Muscle definition is notably different 2010 to 2014-16 . The coach will doubtless be able to explain at some stage how that was achieved . <p> There 's something else : in 2010 she raced 6 all year and never looked like a swimmer who could do 10 top a year without feeling the impact . Look at what happened since : in a schedule heavy in races on all strokes , all distances she also swam the following number of per year : <p> And no breakdown at all in form , no apparent wear , nothing beyond the normal fatigue that many feel in periods of training when taking on a few events every couple of months , let alone 20 plus races every month , month after month after month . <p> As I 've suggested , it is a unique profile and approach in swimming <p> April 30 , 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as for the video . I agree that Ms. seems to be all about power nowadays . But it was great to watch Ms. Miley in the video ; I really hope she can have a great performance in Rio . <p> This season in the 400IM particularly she 's backing off the first 200 to have a strong back half and it 's working , lol 2.12 at midway and 4.32 at the end ... she 's been 2.07 at midway enroute to a 4.30 .... She 'll swim a near perfect split race in Rio for gold <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> Bad Anon , backing off the first 200 in a ' race ' with children is a pointless exercise when it comes to Rio . She will need a fast first half to have a chance to fulfil one of the most obvious predictions on the sheet . Why it is so obvious is of more interest in this place . <p> gheko April 30 , 2016 <p> Katinka swims year round and never seems to need to taper to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to produce good not great times , also the number of events she does with ease on the world cup circuit are beyond the norm for all other swimmers . <p> Blah Blah May 1 , 2016 <p> imho this one is more obvious than ye and has been for a while now . <p> May 1 , 2016 <p> A while back , the site Let 's Run had an athletics ' insider ' do a list of what he saw as red flags for athletes who may be of interest to anti-doping concerns .

 time is 54.36 for the men 's backstroke but perhaps Swimming Ireland will look kindly on the 54.41 in which 17-year-old Conor Ferguson claimed the national title in Dublin this evening . <p> Out in 26.41 , he was paced by Shane Ryan , on 25.78 and already qualified to race for Ireland at Rio 2016 . The return lap saw Ferguson edge past Ryan with a 28.00 to 29.15 for Ryan , the silver his in 54.93 . Ferguson 's swim set an Irish record , even though Ryan , two weeks from Irish swimming citizenship , has a 53.93 season best on the books from the Dave McCullagh Memorial meet earlier this year . <p> Ferguson will get another shot at the Rio standard leading an Irish medley relay quartet time trial tomorrow -- and then again at the European Championships in London from May 16 . <p> Ryan 's best is a 53.84 from 2013 when he was registered as a a swimmer in the USA . Ferguson 's best was a 54.64 from earlier this year , after a 55.6 as a 16-year-old last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 and , oddly , has been criticised for the move in some circles . He hails from Pennsylvania and has represented the USA , a nation stacked to the rafters with world-class backstroke contenders . Whoever takes the berths on backstroke at USA Olympic trials in June/July will arrive in Rio a medal , of not title , contender . <p> All the more reason for Ryan to look around him and seize the day : his dad is from Portarlington in Laois . May 13 is the date on which Ryan , 22 , will finally be fully eligible to race for Ireland in international waters and he 's ready to bat off the naysayers . In a fine interview , he told RT ? Sport 's John Kenny : <p> " I have every right to be over here . My father is from Ireland , my great grand-parents are all from here , I 've a lot of family and I 've every right to be here .

I know some people are not too happy about that but I 've lived here and I 've got Irish roots here . " <p> Ryan 's switch to Ireland falls three days before the start of racing at the European Championships in London . <p> " I came over here on May 13 and the European Championship is on May 16 so if all the paperwork goes through with FINA , I should be able to represent Ireland in the Europeans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other action in Dublin ... <p> Shannon Russell is just 14 and today she claimed the Irish national 400IM title in 4:52.80 .

Our soccer team has made the most of the grandparent rule and at one time mostly comprised players from the U.K. They were considered connections were more tenuous ; Ryan 's are very genuine .

I hope Conor Ferguson gets the nod for Rio . <p> Felix Sanchez April 29 , 2016 <p> I can understand people who do n't like to see the tenuous nationality switches , especially those where money comes into play , but a father ? That should surely be beyond reach of criticism . <p> Craig Lord April 29 , 2016 <p> Quite so , Felix , no issue , seems to me . <p> April 30 , 2016 <p> I remember the British fuss about Tiffany Porter and other ' Plastic Brits ' leading up to the London Olympics .

Though among longtime fans , there 's still a bit of amusement how Mike Cavic from southern California started out competing for Serbia purely as a passport of convenience because he was stuck behind Ian Crocker and Michael Phelps and morphed into some sort of hard core Serbian nationalist over the years . <p> felix April 30 , 2016 <p> I struggle to see your point . <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> , those long-term fans would have it wrong , the record shows : Cavic raced for Yugoslavia at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games at 16 ( he raced 100 fly , DQ in heats , and 100 back ) . His nationality , from birth , was set in his age group years ( first selection at 14 ) before we knew anything about the powers of Phelps and Crocker . Yes , Mike he was in southern California but Milorad he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pond from birth . ( At European champs , he was always Milorad Cavic to us , just as he was Mike over in the US ) . Shane Ryan is hardly a ' plastic ' Irishman : his dad and all his family on that side are Irish . He has every right to claim Irish citizenship , in just the same way our children can chose my nationality or their mother 's . I would n't wish anyone denying them that right , in sport or any other realm of life : they 've grown up with both cultures , languages , sides of the family , regardless of where we choose to live -- geography associates them with one place in the minds of some but they are definitively both Their legal right as things stand is to be both ( sport does n't allow that simultaneously , of course ) . Should they ever need to choose for any reason , there would be no sense of disloyalty to the side not chosen , if that makes sense . Seems to me Shane Ryan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympic Games to represent one of the two nations he had a right to compete for . <p> April 30 , 2016 <p> As someone who kept keen eye on US high school swimming even back then , we knew about Mike tearing up the very little pool in California even then . He made a perfectly reasonable choice to take an effectively guaranteed offer from Serbia to represent them while still in high school rather than rolling the dice at the US Trials where there are no sure things for any athlete . <p> And I also remember him talking about recently really getting in touch with his heritage when he stepped in it with the Kosovo is part of Serbia t-shirt , which was , IIRC at Euros several years past that . <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> Yes , , I remember it well -- they kicked him out of the meet ... as he stood on the podium for the 50 ' fly in his sloganed t-shirt , no-one in the venue barring the teams in question had any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He should n't have done it but a warning ' rules state etc , do n't do it again ' would have sufficed . But a body stacked with folk steeped in politics and deal-making ( going on right now as the latest LEN vote for leaders looms ) , some of it deeply unsavoury , decided that a naughty boy in a t-shirt needed to be made an example of because the red on his shirt was reflecting off their faces , and that would never do . <p> April 30 , 2016 <p> For those with no family ties to the " new country " , there is always a residency quotient ( to qualify for citizenship ) that must be served before being allowed to represent that nation . <p> Should this also be extended to those with dual " eligibilities " ? To my mind , yes . Whilst it is most certainly legal under current regimes , seeing people trial for a nation that they have sometimes never visited , let alone lived , is just a step too far for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status but if not current resident status , there needs to have been some real tangible connections ( ie in that country for X amt of years ) . <p> Darian Townsend made few ripples due to ( a ) his long term residency in the US and ( b ) he was not really a selection threat for a full strength US team . <p> However , cases like the Litherland brothers attempting to qualify for NZL via the CAN trials was to my mind pushing the envelope to the furthest extremes . Yes , they have a NZL born father but they were born in the USA , US educated and have never lived in NZL . <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> That scenario does not apply to Shane Ryan , CW he has fulfilled residency criteria . I agree with the sense of unease with remote qualification attempts ( which would , in the case you cite , not have worked anyway , residency criteria not having been met , seems to me ) . <p> April 30 , 2016 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so did n't venture an opinion . <p> I have no problems with nation swapping as long as there is a clearly defined process and standards , at least for international representative sports . At present , its a mish-mash across various sports . <p> felix April 30 , 2016 <p> Wombat at least the Litherland brothers have an alliance to NZ which could not be said about Vyatchanin who has failed to have been mentioned . Now that one to me is a joke , how someone can just pick a country &amp; swim for it with no allegiance &amp; no history &amp; has never lived there . <p> Craig Lord April 30 , 2016 <p> -- you also have to look at the circumstance that made him need to search for a new country or quit swimming .

 from the United States Olympic Trials in Omaha , Abbey Weitzeil came up with a pair of quality performances over the weekend that show her preparation is on track . The rising teenage sprinter raced in Southern California at the Fran Crippen Memorial Swim Meet of Champions , taking top honors in the 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle . <p> Among the leading contenders for sprint slots on Team USA , Weitzeil was timed in 54.13 in the 100 free , and followed with a 25.07 outing in the 50 free . owns a best of 53.77 this year in the two-lapper and has been 24.72 in the 50 free . In order to prep for the Olympic Trials , Weitzeil deferred her freshman year at California-Berkeley to continue training under Coley Stickels with the Canyons Aquatic Club . <p> Stephanie Peacock prevailed in the 400 freestyle ( ) and 800 freestyle ( ) , her time in the longer event ranking eighth in the world . Meanwhile , Tunisian Olympic champion Oussama ( gold , Beijing 2008 , ; gold , London 2012 , marathon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free in and capturing the 1500 free in . <p> Other victories over the weekend went to Tom Shields ( 52.15 ) and Kendyl Stewart ( 58.84 ) in the 100 butterfly and Katie McLaughlin ( 1:59.84 ) and Michael Domagala ( 1:49.31 ) in the 200 freestyle . The win by McLaughlin was a positive step forward after her freshman year at Cal was derailed by a neck injury suffered during a training trip . <p> * -- swimmer tested positive for a banned substance at the US Open in December 2006 . His defence was that he had taken Adderall , a stimulant , to keep awake in order to cram for academic exams in the week leading up to a competition at which he produced unspectacular in-season performances . His 18-month suspension left him with two weeks in which to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Games , where he claimed gold in the freestyle , having trained through his time in the sin bin . <h> Comments <p> Pavel Buyanov May 2 , 2016 <p> Why do n't  mark Ousama with a * ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the * is used on all who serve or served a doping suspension as you would know if you read this site regularly and know that it is my task as editor to place the asterisks .

 clear : unpalatable in the extreme to see a 19-year-old para-swimmer with cerebral palsy disqualified for bearing the Olympic rings on his chest . <p> The Olympic rings belong to the world , to the generations of athletes who aspired and aspire to the finest principles of the Olympic Charter . <p> The rings are not a brand , not the symbol of a private club or one to be buggered about with by blazers at the heart of an organisation that has enjoyed autonomy for far too long , a body with an uncomfortable Nazi past that made a mockery of that same Olympic Charter . <p> The story of the rings and the DQ is well known since it broke during the IPC European Swimming Championships last weekend : Britain 's Josef Craig , 19 , was disqualified because the British Olympic Association lion with the five rings , tattoed proudly on his chest , was visible . <p> Backtrack : Craig added an MBE to his growing list of honours after claiming gold at the London Paralympics at 16 . The Jarrow , South Tyneside , native emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace to say : <p> " It has been a really special day . To be honoured with an MBE it completes a trio : the gold medal at London 2012 , the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year and now the MBE . I am honoured to receive the MBE for services to swimming . It is something I never dreamed of having . " <p> Now , on his career record is DQ because he " breached advertising regulations " . <p> And there is the clue when it comes to seeking out those responsible for this scenario : " regulations " . <p> Was the rule there before this competition started ? Yes <p> Was the rule there before Craig had his tattoo etched on his chest ? Yes <p> Did Craig 's support team , the British federation and those around him know of the rule ? Yes , unless they 've been negligent <p> So , who sets the rules ? The IPC , a body made up for all federations around the world , a body with delegates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Olympic and single-sport level , swimming included , Britain included . <p> One can argue that the rule is an ass . One can not argue that it was n't there . <p> The IPC is not the IOC , the Olympic rings are not a part of the IPC logo . Had Craig worn a tattoo with the IPC logo he would have raced in the freestyle final instead of watching events from the deck after his DQ in heats . <p> Sarah Sjostrom and the Olympic rings on her arm by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Tyler Clary ( left ) and Ryan Lochte sporting the Olympic rings <p> A quick trawl of the internet confirms what we all know : the Olympic rings are etched permanently on the bodies of shoals of world-class swimmers , without that being an issue . They are to be seen on the arms of the likes of Matt Grevers , Ryan Lochte and Sarah Sjostrom , on the tie-line of Michael Phelps ' briefs , the hips of myriad women , the foot , the neck , the chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rings . All wear the rings with pride and the IOC would have good reason to be proud of that . <p> The question should not be about whether the IPC observed its rules in this case : it did ( and has got hammered for it ) . The question should be : why is the rule there at all -- and how could it be applied to the Olympic rings ? Answer : because the IOC has made the rings a commercial brand and just as Craig could not have swum with Land Rover running down his arm , he can not swim with the Olympic rings showing . A ludicrous situation . <p> They can be found far and wide and include such nonsense as the folk of the Faroes able to swim for their country if disabled at the Paralympics but disabled if able-bodied when it comes to racing under their flag at the Olympics , even though Denmark has no issue with the Faroes standing alone at the Games . <p> All of that said , just as it is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreaked as a result ( FINA is all of you -- let your domestic federation know that it is unacceptable and get it changed ) , so it is with the IPC and the IOC : they are ' all of you ' . The trouble is , ' all of you ' have rarely stood up for your rights , rarely put your foot down , rarely challenged those who represent you to get it right not after controversy but before it at the setting of the rules and conditions under which athletes are governed and in which they compete and , for some , earn a living . <p> Which brings us to the far , far bigger question that is hardly being raised at all as young Craig hits the headlines over a tattoo and the IPC state ' rules are rules ' : Intentional Misrepresentation . <h> Intentional Misrepresentation <p> My inbox is stacked with the complaints of parents , officials , swimmers and others who believe that Australia , Britain and other nations will arrive at the Paralympic Games in Rio this August with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorisation suggests . <p> The story is not new . It was last year that the IPC sent out a warning letter to all federations , all sports , around the world . IPC Chief Executive Xavier Gonzalez send a round-robin to the national paralympic committees and national federation presidents . It read : <p> " I am writing to you to address what the IPC believes is a serious issue which is in grave danger of undermining the credibility of the sport and overshadowing the performances of Para-swimmers . During the course of this season , we believe we have witnessed , and have heard of , a number of cases of alleged intentional misrepresentation during the classification evaluation process of athletes . We fear this alleged misconduct may have been encouraged by the athletes ' support personnel . " <p> His meaning was quite clear : coaches , official and federation folk , with the possible cooperation of doctors , are manipulating the medical profiles of para-athletes so that , in swimming for example , classification can be set at a level that all but guarantees podium places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will return to this theme in the near future with news but this editorial will not name the swimmers and their support staff who stand accused of playing the system in the interests of medals and the funding that flows from that . Gonzalez continued : <p> " Classification evaluation and the allocation of sport classes are unique and essential components of the Paralympic Movement , and allow Para-sports to present credible and compelling competition opportunities to athletes with eligible impairments . Wherever IM takes place it strikes at the heart of fair play , threatens the concept of excellence in Para-sport , and goes against the requirements of the IPC Classification Code and the classification rules of IPC Swimming . " <p> He also noted that the IPC is investigating a number of potential cases of IM and would " take action where necessary " . Rules would be considered to extend the possible penalties to support staff on ground son unethical behaviour . <p> " We ask you to support us in the initiatives outlined above and in safeguarding IPC Swimming from the negative effects of this misconduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask that you adopt specific initiatives within your NPC , working with the national swimming federation , to ensure that all athletes and support personnel fully understand what is expected from them when going through classification evaluation . IM , and any practice that interferes with the work of the classifiers , must be avoided if we are to continue to grow the sport , and to inspire and excite the world . " <p> His plea is clear : please do n't cheat . <h> So much for words . What of actions ? <p> has been privy to exchanges between complainants and the IPC and is investigating some of those . The issue has not yet triggered official inquiry for lack of what the IPC describes as " witnesses prepared to provide the evidence of what they claim " . <p> That there is evidence that raises the same " serious concern " expressed by the IPC in its round-robin last year is not in doubt ( photos and videos quite clearly show the same swimmer with a claw hand racing and walking and sitting with teammates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways that suggest little or no impairment ) , though some things are much harder to prove than others . <p> Among concerns are the profiles of athletes that seem to bend to the wind when it comes to the conditions claimed . Cerebral Palsy , which can alter in ' degrees ' but can not appear from nowhere , is among conditions that has shown up on profiles several years into careers that never mentioned CP before . <p> Complainants argue that not enough independent expertise is going into the classification process , while that process itself is being manipulated by the guardians of para-swimmers who race 10 and more seconds slower over during the classification check than they do when racing to medals and world records once placed in a group " below their true abilities " . <p> The IPC denies that there are such deep issues in its classification process . <p> Spokesman for the IPC , Craig Spence , tells SwimVortex : " It is very difficult to prove IM . If we suspect that someone is not telling us the truth , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it takes to assess the situation . <p> " We take all allegations very seriously but we also need witnesses to come forward and be prepared to bring the evidence to back up their claims . " <p> Given that many of those who may have wheat they believe to be evidence of cheating are often intrinsically linked to para-sport ( athletes funded by federations , parents who rely on that support , and so forth ) what level of reassurance could be given that all exchanges with the IPC would remain confidential , with no risk to those making the complaint ? <p> " They can be fully confident that what they tell us will be dealt with in absolute confidence . Those who come forward with evidence will be protected throughout . As we have said to some of those raising these issues : we are not the police . We have read the allegations , we are aware of them but what those people now need to do is bring the material that backs up their claims . " <p> Some of those complaining throw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body sets rules it must have mechanisms to do what Gonzalez said it would do : investigate and stamp out . As one complainant wrote : " I 'm not the policeman for the IPC . It is for them to go and investigate these claims and come to a conclusion . What they can not do is rely on federations and others not to cheat . They have to make sure cheating gets stamped out . " <h> Classification <p> Classification is a four-stage process in which independent experts , such as neurologists , can be called into observe and test if officials believe that to be necessary . <p> Step 1 : Review of submission of the medical diagnostic information provided by a certified physician on behalf of the athlete . <p> Step 2 : Dry land ( co-ordination ) assessment by a panel of independent and impartial international classifiers . <p> Step 3 : Water test -- classifiers assess the impact of the impairment on the athlete 's ability to swim in the water . <p> Step 4 : Observation during competition the focus primarily here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the impact of the impairment in a competitive environment . <p> Plenty of scope for spotting the fake , one would imagine . <p> And yet , the accusations continue to flow . If that is unfortunate , more so is the lasting perception that IPC sport is a world not only difficult for the average viewer to follow in terms of understanding the relative abilities of different categories of athletes but is open to doubt when it comes to the level of the playing field . <p> It is hard enough to fathom how dwarfism and partial limb can end up in the same category in swimming a sport in which balance is so toweringly important to the result but when the viewer is left wondering whether the winner is in fact less disabled than they claim to be , the entire IPC is the loser , as Gonzalez suggests . <p> On the way to Rio , as daft as the DQ of Craig may well be , it is not art that threatens to deal para-sport a body blow but the growing perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally misrepresenting abilities in order to have a greater chance of medals and funding . In other words , they would be the dopers of the Paralympics . <p> Not all claims and accusations are ' pure ' or well-intentioned in this world nor will all of them turn out to carry weight . But some will . <p> Good that the IPC has raised the issue with federations but that is the equivalent of having a quiet word with Josef Craig and reminding him and his support staff that the rings had to be covered up . What the IPC did next was DQ a young Paralympic Champion . What the IPC needs to do next is look more deeply into the IM accusations and then DQ any federations and support staff falling foul of best practice and ethics . <h> IPC Answers Some Questions From SwimVortex <p> Is the IPC investigating allegations that Intentional Misrepresentation is at play in paralympic swimming ? <p> IPC : In August 2015 , IPC Swimming sent a letter to all nations reminding them that Intentional Misrepresentation is deemed an extremely serious offence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This followed a number of results which IPC Swimming deemed out of the ordinary and allegations of misconduct in , or related to , classification in IPC Swimming . <p> Intentional Misrepresentation can occur : <p> During the classification process , if an athlete purposefully mispresents their skills or abilities in order to mislead the Classification Panel <p> By failing to disclose information about corrective treatment which may alter how an athlete 's impairment impacts on their ability to do the sport <p> Through participants who knowingly assist , cover up or are any way involved in any other way complicit in Intentional Misrepresentation . <p> The IPC takes all allegations it receives regarding its sports extremely seriously and all evidence provided is reviewed . In cases of Intentional Misrepresentation , the IPC must prove intent of an athlete , coach or supporting staff to cheat the system and therefore material evidence is required . <p> As with anti-doping cases , the IPC can not comment on any Intentional Misrepresentation investigations that may or may not be taking place until they have fully concluded and a verdict has been reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that cerebral palsy is being used almost like doping in elite sport , with profiles suddenly acquiring ' cerebral palsy ' as a condition that leads to reclassification into , for want of better terminology , ' easier ' or slower ' classification groups . Given the 5 examples I see before me that appear to indicate a trend , are you concerned on that specific issue ? <p> IPC : No , we are not concerned that cerebral palsy is being used almost like doping in elite sport . <p> Under the rules of IPC Swimming , classification panels do not assess ' cerebral palsy ' . Instead they look at how an athlete 's co-ordination impairment impacts on their ability to do the sport . <p> By nature , there is a very diverse and complex population of athletes with co-ordination impairments . This is why classification for swimmers is a multiple step process : <p> Step 1 : Review of submission of the medical diagnostic information provided by a certified physician on behalf of the athlete . <p> Step 2 : Dry land ( co-ordination ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 3 : Water test -- classifiers assess the impact of the impairment on the athlete 's ability to swim in the water . <p> Step 4 : Observation during competition the focus primarily here is not on the time an athlete swims , but on the impact of the impairment in a competitive environment . <p> A final decision is taken by the Classification Panel following assessment of these steps . It must be stressed that at any point during a competition , a Chief Classifier can protest the class of an athlete following observation in and out of the pool . <p> On where the allegations are being raised ... <p> IPC : The IPC treats allegations of misconduct in any of its sport with concern . All are treated seriously and all such claims are reviewed . Where necessary , we may request further evidence from those making the original allegation . <p> The IPC does not comment on individual allegations it receives against an athlete or athletes . As with anti-doping cases , the IPC can not comment on any Intentional Misrepresentation investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fully concluded and a verdict has been reached . <p> The allegations include video footage that appears to show swimmers claiming a particular disability , such as a claw hand in one case , actually using the ' disabled ' limb ' with no apparent impairment . Would you consider such evidence if it were put before you ? <p> IPC : As with any allegation made against an athlete in sport , a variety of materials are usually provided as supporting evidence for IM claims . All allegations and evidence are reviewed fully by the IPC . While classification assessments are highly technical in nature , various forms of evidence can form part of an investigation should it provide sufficient reason to believe that misconduct has occurred . <p> Critics suggest that an independent neurologist ought to be used to assess the disability of athletes in certain groups . Is that something the IPC is considering with a view to achieving your aims of ' fair play and excellence in para-sport ? <p> IPC : All classifiers are medically or scientifically trained personnel with a high level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Classification Panel can seek third party expertise of any nature if they believe it would assist in completing the process of an athlete classification evaluation . <p> There has been talk of ' deliberate go-slow ' performances by athletes who wish to be placed in a ' slower ' classification . While speed is by no means the only thing considered at classification , can you confirm that weight is indeed given to such obvious trends as swimmers swimming 8 to 12 secs slower over at classification than they swim for gold and world record , or other such successful outcome , come race day in their ' new ' classification group ? <p> IPC : An athlete 's performance time is not the deciding factor in swimming classification . If it were , the system would unfairly disadvantage an athlete who improves his or her race time through hard work and intense training . <p> Although time does contribute to the overall picture , during the observation in competition swim , classifiers focus more on an athlete 's ability to conduct the stroke and how their impairment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for consistency with the earlier water test part of the athlete evaluation . <p> If , following the observation in competition swim , the Classification Panel are unsure whether an athlete is in the correct class they have three options . They can either continue observation during further competition swims , instruct an athlete to retake part of the classification evaluation or request that an athlete undergoes a full classification re-evaluation . <p> Finally , it needs to be highlighted that the Chief Classifier can protest an athlete 's classification at any point during a competition should they have legitimate concerns . <h> Comments <p> Felix Sanchez May 3 , 2016 <p> Craig , I could n't agree more with your ' all of you ' comments . If one wants things run well , one has to take an active interest . The situation is much like when disgruntled voters complain that democracy is n't working because they did n't get exactly who they want , yet the only thing they ever bothered doing was turn up and vote on Election Day . However , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is also important that we do n't see a false solution to sports governance in a greater voice for certain interest groups . The right people should take a constant interest . <p> The classification problem in disability swimming is very tricky . The athletes themselves talk about it constantly , and always have done . However , an important difference now is the increased media coverage of receives . A few years ago the Paralympics was generally considered ' for them ' , a challenge and goal for the athletes themselves , but not of interest to the wider world like the ' real ' Olympics . Recently , whether through genuine interest or political correctness , the coverage has dramatically increased . Sadly , this turns the athletes , like Olympians , into pseudo state employees . The inevitable result is that like the attitude of many to drugs . Not so much a clear line between cheating and honesty , but an attempt to get away with what you can . <p> Craig Lord May 3 , 2016 <p> Good note , Felix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules are rules , well played IPC , the guy deserved ( ? ) to be punished for breaking the rules . Now then , let 's roll our sleeves up and address IM because rules are after all rules . <p> Silly me . The IPC only follow their rules as and when it suits them to . Let 's DQ over a tattoo but ignore eg annual review of short statured minors because that makes a whole lot of sense and wo n't affect competition in Rio at all , unless they have an Olympic tattoo of course . <p> The classification system used is woefully inadequate . They prove it time and time again . Is it the best that they 've got ? I doubt it . It is not a highly technical process , it is highly subjective and open to interpretation . To further muddy the waters , since September 2015 a new set of rules were introduced -- Passive Functional Range of Motion replaced Active Functional Range of Motion . Plus amendments made to the Technical ( water ) Testing where , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke . Remember learn to swim classes anyone ? Can you imagine passing your backstroke swim proficiency by performing a back float ? So , swimmers pre September 2015 have been classified under the old rules where a back float was sufficient testing for backstroke . To highlight this nonsense , a swimmer was controversially classed down during her backstroke swim in July 2015 . What were they comparing it to in the Technical ( water ) Test I wonder ? It is also usual for swimmers to be viewed in competition during multi-class races and , there maybe two or three swimmers that a single classification panel ( of 2 ) must watch to confirm classification in one heat of the 200 IM . Because that sounds highly technical and fair . <p> Some organising committees are pushing through questionable athletes and this should be taken seriously by the IPC . It is not . There sure are swimmers competing in classes who should not be there , period . There are also cases where swimmers on review are classed up , down and out does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not to me it does n't . <p> It takes a lot of perseverance to keep raising the same issues over and over and people naturally give up over time . The ones that are left poking away are the ones that are eventually listened to one way or another . <p> james bond May 3 , 2016 <p> It just beggars belief that the IPC can be presented with evidence extremely suggestive of intentional misrepresentation and their response is that people need to come forward with hard and fast evidence to prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt . Why on earth would that be the responsibility of members of the public ? Surely this is now the responsibility of the IPC to present this evidence to independent medical specialists and begin a thorough investigation of athletes and their support personnel . As for classifications being " highly technical in nature " I think most athletes and parents familiar with the ridiculously inadequate , biased and random process they call classification would have a somewhat different take on it . I guess another point to bring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPC would like us to believe , have so many neurologically impaired athletes been moved up a class or classes in the last 2 years , even when some of them have conditions which are progressive and others conditions which can not possibly improve ? That in itself is evidence that someone is getting it very wrong .@@8623537 <p> But Pellegrini says 
 a FINA star who has got no stripes for good behaviour of late - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Editorial <p> If I were Speedo , I 'd rip Sun Yang 's contract up and flush it down the nearest toilet . No , not because of the positive doping test from 2014 ( though that would do it ) but because of his latest PR stunt : two days ago he put fans and followers across China and Asia on tenterhooks with a social media announcement that he would make an announcement today but when it came it failed to conquer . <p> Speculation stretched from marriage to retirement . What it turned out to be was a chance to appear before cameras of the still and moving kind in his 361 degrees branded kit , not a hint of Speedo anywhere to be seen , in order to tell us all that he wished to issue a " special thanks to coaches , teachers , friends and leaders , and more sincere appreciation to all people not publicly thanked before ' . <p> Wow . What a thrill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a special mention for Park , a fellow member in the club of Olympic champions who subsequently fell foul of anti-doping rules . <p> Sun Yang* told fans on CCTV : " Thanks to every one of my opponents , thank you for the challenges you 've brought . In particular , Mr. Park , I challenged you but you did not get mad at me when Sun beat him for three golds at Incheon 2014 before the world was wiser on the banned substances front . " <p> Sun stated with a nod to Park : " We want to hold up Asian swimming together one day . " Tricky given that you have been so dominant on the Olympic podium in distance free events in 2008 and 2012 , made China and Korea a part of that history for the first but brought in tow the shame ( expressed by Park but havent heard the same from Sun ) of positive doping tests . <p> The ' announcement ' was followed in reports in China by explanations of how the two had battled in Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By then , both had tested positive for banned substances but the world was yet to find out . No mention of that in the dozen and more reports on Sun 's address to his nation . <p> Sun Yang and Dr Ba Zhen , back working with the swimmer after serving two anti-doping suspensions -- social media , Twitter , screen shot <p> Sun thanked three doctors by name none of them Dr Ba for helping him get through injuries galore . Sun had had a toenail removed , a left thumb contusion , severe sunburn , dislocation of a bone in his left thumb , the recent fracture of his right foot , the long-term heart problem that required him to taken what in 2014 became a banned substance , and " a variety of physical ailments " . <p> Gosh , a wonder he could crack 17 minutes , let alone shake the 14:30 mark over 30 laps and then win three world titles in 2013 and retain two of them in 2015 . <p> The thanks rolled on his personal assistant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears brimming . It was like a personal ceremony . <p> Parents got the biggest prize and praise : " Thanks Dad , thank you for my height and handsome genes ; thanks mom , thank you for your care and severity and telling me that I 'd love swimming and travel a lot . " Sun had often wanted to quit as a boy but mum persuaded him every time to persevere . This , said Sun , was the first time he 'd had a chance to publicly thank them . <p> London 2012 , first Chinese man to win an Olympic crown in the pool and then twice might have been the more obvious moment , perhaps . <p> And one for the sponsors , the spotlight on China 's key team 361 supporter : " With your love I set off to Brazil . " <p> 361 ? organised a conference for Sun and fans last year and stated : " Whether at peak or in trough , we will always be at your side to accompany you ! " Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Speedo should think otherwise . <p> A waterfall of coverage , TV and print . A grandiose PR exercise . A moment to get that Speedo logo in view , perhaps . Or not , it would seem . Two strikes more if you count serving a few days of jail time for driving without a licence ; being barred from Australian funded centres and being the direct cause of a rule change designed to stop the taint spreading ; smashing a locker up at world titles last year ; being the subject of a complaint from a Brazilian woman in the warm-up/down pool who said he used threatening and aggressive behaviour toward her ; failing to show up on his blocks at the 11th hour before the final , too late for Pal Joensen , the reserve , to step in and have a crack at Rio 2016 qualification .

 15 , and two blokes who have n't yet realised they 're in the presence of a boy who will become the most decorated Olympian in history <p> As the fifth Olympiad of Michael Phelps approaches , SwimVortex will take a few trips back in time and visit the defining moments in the career of the 22-time Olympic medalist . The walk through the past begins with a venture to Indianapolis and the 2000 Olympic Trials , the competition that officially jumpstarted a reign unlikely to be matched . <p> Numbers have long played a major role in the sporting landscape , and in the career of Michael Phelps . There was his chase to equal the seven gold medals won by Mark Spitz in Olympic competition , followed by his 8-for-8 tour de force at fittingly -- the 2008 Games in Beijing . His 22 Olympic medals , including 18 of the golden variety , are easily the most in history , and his 39 world records span five individual events and three relays . <p> There is another key number from the Phelps vault of excellence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbit . The 2000 United StatesOlympic Trials , like three occasions before , were held at the Indiana University Natatorium , a venue steeped in tradition and well-known for hosting epic performances . Phelps simply added his name to the star-studded list . <p> As Trials opened in Indy , there was little uncertainty concerning the top gun in the 200 butterfly . Not only was Tom Malchow the reigning Olympic silver medalist in the event , he set the world record of 1:55.18 just two months prior to the start of Trials . It was Malchow 's event to dominate , the battle for the second berth to the Olympic Games in Sydney the real question . Among the challengers were Jeff Somensatto , Andrew Mahaney and a youngster from the North Baltimore Aquatic Club . <p> A year out from Trials , as a mere 14-year-old , Phelps ' best time in the 200 butterfly stood at 2:04.68 , produced at Junior Nationals . But with a few inches added to his frame and continued successful training with coach Bob Bowman , Phelps resembled the proverbial freight train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March of 2000 , Phelps had gotten down to 1:59.02 , a mark that made him a hunter in the safari that is the Olympic Trials . It was n't long until his foes learned Phelps was working with some serious ammunition , although some big figures in USA Swimming knew what was coming . <p> " If anyone has a chance to be a sleeper ( and qualify for Sydney ) , it 's this young man , " said legendary coach Jon Urbanchek , in a 2000 article in the Baltimore Sun . <p> Michael Phelps by Patrick B Kraemer <p> The first two rounds of the 200 fly at Trials quickly erased that sleeper status . Through career-best efforts of 1:58.61 and 1:58.24 , Phelps ranked behind only Malchow in the preliminaries and semifinals . Still , the had to negotiate the final , which meant simultaneously dealing with his rivals and the natural nerves that accompany a pressure-filled moment . <p> As the final unfolded , Malchow expectedly surged to the front of the field , Somensatto locked into the second position and Phelps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field . As the contenders hit the 150-meter mark and turned for the last lap home , Phelps sat fourth and needed a big surge . Of course , it came in grand fashion and that 's where the numbers game comes into play once again . The digits that flashed on the scoreboard for Phelps ' last 50 meters were stunning . <p> 30.02 . <p> In what can only be cited as a precursor of what was to come during his stellar career , Phelps finished off his race in Indianapolis in style , splitting a mark that was ridiculously fast for anyone in the sport , let alone a teenage kid . Then again , this was n't a typical youthful star . Rather , it was the emergence of an athlete who would eventually go down as the sport 's GOAT ( Greatest Of All-Time ) . <p> At the finish of the 200 fly , Malchow secured his anticipated first-place finish , behind an effort of 1:56.87 , actually the slowest mark of his three rounds and more than a second slower than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing split of 30.02 brought him to the wall in 1:57.48 , ahead of the 1:58.07 of Somensatto and the 1:58.45 of Mahaney . In reeling in Somensatto , Phelps outsplit the Auburn star by 1.64 seconds on the last lap . <p> " At first , I could n't believe it , " Phelps said . " I thought I saw it , and then I had to take off my goggles to really see ... It 's been a lifetime dream of mine to make an Olympic team . " <p> Bob Bowman by Craig Lord <p> It would n't be the only time in which Phelps reeled in a competitor , using the last length of the pool to spin some magic . Ian Crocker and , like Somensatto , have been on the agonizing end of a Phelps rally . And while Phelps ' comebacks against Crocker and Cavic may have delivered Olympic gold and world titles , the besting of Somensatto started it all . <p> " That showed a whole lot more than 15 years ' worth of maturity , " Bowman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose chronicling of Phelps ' early days was second to none . " The last thing I told him before he left for the announcements was to keep coming on that last 50 , no matter what , and that 's exactly what he did . Michael 's always been good at getting mentally prepared for races . He has a structured relaxation program and practices a visualization technique . I think he had already replayed that swim 100 times in his mind . " <p> By finishing second behind Malchow , Phelps became the youngest American Olympian in the sport in 68 years and embarked on an Olympic career unmatched by any other man or woman . <p> But let 's get back to Phelps ' closing split , which certainly ranks as one of the most precocious efforts the sport has seen . For proof , take a look at some of the comparative performances over the last 50 meters in a major 200 butterfly . <p> Moving up from silver in Atlanta to gold in Sydney , Malchow wrapped up the pinnacle moment of his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 50 meters . Phelps was fifth in that final , notching his sixth straight career-best time , an outing of 1:56.50 on the strength of an ending split of 29.87 . <p> In Phelps ' triumphs at the 2004 and 2008 Olympics , he closed in 29.50 and 29.28 . The latter split arrived during the tech-suit era , but also came with Phelps fighting water-logged goggles . <p> On the way to defeating Phelps for gold at the 2012 Olympics in London , South African Chad Le Clos finished in 29.20 . <p> In the other World Champs contested since Phelps broke onto the global scene , Pawel Korzeniowski ( 2005 ) finished in 29.90 , Le Clos ( 2013 ) closed in 29.51 and Laszlo Cseh ( 2015 ) capped his performance in 29.94 . <p> Last summer , when Phelps cooked up a 1:52.94 showing at Nationals , he moved through the last lap in 29.95 . <p> All but one of the times listed above were faster than what Phelps produced in Indianapolis , but the fact that Phelps was able to generate a 30-low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sheer fantasy or so it should have been . More than anything , it was a signal . Over the next two years , Malchow and Phelps battled for the throne in the event , Phelps taking the world record away and securing the world title in 2001 , and Malchow getting the best of his rising rival at the 2002 Pan Pacific Championships . By 2003 , Phelps was firmly in command . <p> Although Malchow was able to keep Phelps at bay at times and managed to finish on top during the Olympic year , what transpired in Indianapolis was not lost on the veteran . He knew what was coming a sport-defining presence who would eventually branch out beyond the 200 fly . <p> " He did n't get caught up in the hype , " Malchow said of the 2000 Trials . " That 's a tremendous credit to him . He stuck to his game plan . He did n't get rattled . He 's awesome , way ahead of where any other flyer has been at his age . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exactly me four years ago . He does n't know how much his life is going to change , but it 's going to change real soon . " <p> Indeed , life did change for Phelps , and so did the sport . After becoming the world 's dominant 200 flyer , he became its best all-around swimmer , a man who shattered records pertaining to both his sport and the Olympic realm . He graced magazine covers , earned hefty endorsement deals and became a recognizable figure wherever he went . <p> And it all started in Indianapolis , a shade over 30 seconds for one length becoming a significant chapter in his career . Forever , 30.02 will share room with numbers like 8 , 18 and 22. <p> We can not 
 , together with others , would appear to leave FINA no choice but to investigate whether any such practices were at play during the 2015 World Swimming Championships in Kazan last year , then it also raises a question for WADA as the agency ponders whether to extend its inquiries to swimming in the light of revelations in The Times and that Dr Sergei Portugalov beat a path to the door of swimming to offer the kind of assistance he was providing to track and field : Rodchenkov will be able to confirm whether the practices he now describes applied to testing in general , including swimming . <p> To this extent , he already has : " The November report was primarily focused on track and field , but Dr. Rodchenkov described the whole spectrum of Russian sport as tainted by banned substances . " <p> And here is another damning link to FINA from the New York Times : <p> Dr. Rodchenkov described his own work at Sochi as a " strong accomplishment , " the apex of a decade-long effort to perfect Russia 's doping strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledgeable , experienced and perfectly prepared for Sochi like never before , " he said . " It was working like a Swiss watch . " <p> After Sochi , Dr. Rodchenkov was awarded the prestigious Order of Friendship by President Vladimir Putin . <p> FINA honoured Putin with its highest honour , the FINA Order , in 2014 just before ARD broke the storm on the systematic doping at play in Russia , with the apparent knowledge of leading politicians and the secret services ( as it was in the GDR ) . <p> With no comment , here is the opening of the New York Times article , with a link to the feature in full : <p> LOS ANGELES , The New York Times -- Dozens of Russian athletes at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi , including at least 15 medal winners , were part of a state-run doping program , meticulously planned for years to ensure dominance at the Games , according to the director of the country 's anti-doping laboratory at the time . <p> The director , Grigory Rodchenkov , who ran the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes , helping to facilitate one of the most elaborate and successful -- doping ploys in sports history . <p> It involved some of Russia 's biggest stars of the Games , including 14 members of its cross-country ski team and two veteran bobsledders who won two golds . <p> In a dark-of-night operation , Russian antidoping experts and members of the intelligence services surreptitiously replaced urine samples tainted by performance-enhancing drugs with clean urine collected months earlier , somehow breaking into the supposedly tamper-proof bottles that are the standard at international competitions , Dr. Rodchenkov said . For hours each night , they worked in a shadow laboratory lit by a single lamp , passing bottles of urine through a hand-size hole in the wall , to be ready for testing the next day , he said . <p> By the end of the Games , Dr. Rodchenkov estimated , as many as 100 dirty urine samples were expunged . <p> None of the athletes were caught doping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games , easily surpassing its main rival , the United States , and undermining the integrity of one of the world 's most prestigious sporting events . <p> " People are celebrating Olympic champion winners , but we are sitting crazy and replacing their urine , " Dr. Rodchenkov said . " Can you imagine how Olympic sport is organized ? " <h> Comments <p> Similar to the cover ups that have been going on in the USA for years ! <p> May 13 , 2016 <p> gheko , you need get over the fact the state sponsored doping is currently endemic in Russia and stop making these uniformed , unfunded statements regarding cover-ups or doping in other clean countries . <p> If you were a true supporter of sport , you would be applauding this article and all bodies and individuals trying to end institutionalized doping instead of throwing out some arbitrary ill-informed comment . <p> It must be hard supporting a country in sport when one is never sure whether the medal was real or was achieved through cheating . <p> gheko May 13 , 2016 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to compete -- and win an Olympic gold medal in the 2000 Sydney Games .

 has become commonplace for Katie Ledecky . Regardless if she 's competing in major international competition or at a smaller event for training and preparation purposes , the 19-year-old constantly provides epic moments . The latest excellence supplied by Ledecky came on Saturday night at the Atlanta Swim Classic . <p> A day after churning out a pair of sub-1:55 performances in the 200 freestyle , Ledecky posted the eighth-fastest 400 freestyle in history , an outing of . The mark handed Ledecky the victory by almost nine seconds and left her with seven of the performances of all-time , the exception being Federica Pellegrini 's former world record of 3:59.15 . However , Pellegrini 's swim was at the height of the tech-suit era , as was her No. 2 effort , which leaves Ledecky with textile times in history . <p> It seems repetitive , but Ledecky is headed for a special summer at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . Barring a huge upset at next month 's United States Trials in Omaha , she 'll arrive in Brazil as the favorite in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will attempt to be join Debbie Meyer ( 1968 ) as the only athletes to win three freestyle events at a single Olympiad . <p> Representing Nation 's Capital Swim Club , Ledecky was her customary self . She jumped on the race from the start , building a one-second margin on the first 50 meters and coming through the 100 with a two-second advantage . She moved through the 200 with a midway split of 1:58.38 and had a lead of more than four seconds by that point . Down the stretch , the only question was whether Ledecky could crack the four-minute barrier , a feat she has pulled off on six occasions . Saturday night marked the fastest Ledecky has been without going under 4:00 . <p> On Sunday , Ledecky is scheduled to race both the 100 freestyle and 800 freestyle . While the longer distance will bring an expected result , what Ledecky does in the shorter event is of the most intrigue . Ledecky is going to find herself in the mix in the 100 free at Trials , certainly for a relay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she can go in the is uncertain , but she has been 53.75 this year . The time is obviously not a dazzling mark from a global standpoint , but it 's sterling for a distance swimmer and for an American squad in need of a spark in the 100 free . <h> Cal Contingent Racks Up Trio Of Victories <p> Ryan Murphy , from Bolles to Cal ; watch out the world of backstroke aces <p> Already second in the world rankings , Ryan Murphy turned in his latest show of speed when he won the 100 backstroke in 53.08 , his California teammate Jacob Pebley going 54.27 for second place . Murphy owned a .70 edge at the midway point and added another half-second margin down the final lap . Murphy has been 52.57 this year , just behind the No. 1 world-ranked time of reigning world champion Mitch Larkin ( 52.48 ) of Australia . <p> Murphy will be in for a battle at the Olympic Trials , given the United States ' depth and tradition in the backstroke events , but he 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Murphy is inarguable and a push for an Olympic title would not come as a surprise for the 20-year-old . American men have won the past five Olympic crowns in the 100 back . <p> Josh Prenot produced a dominant triumph in the 200 breaststroke as he managed a mark of 2:09.49 , more than five seconds clear of rising teenager Reece Whitley ( 2:14.99 ) . Between Pro Series and NCAA competition , Prenot has enjoyed a superb year to date and will be among the favorites to reach Rio in the 200 breast , along with Kevin Cordes . <p> Nathan Adrian , an NCAA champ during his Cal days , took top honors in the 50 freestyle in 21.93 , comfortably ahead of the 22.29 by Brazilian Marcelo Chierighini . Adrian has been timed in 21.69 this season . <h> Simone Manuel Bumps To Top Of Podium In 50 Freestyle <p> Simone Manuel by Peter Bick <p> After finishing second to Katie Ledecky in the 200 freestyle on Night One , Simone Manuel topped the field in the 50 free in 25.21 , a half-second off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the victory as Smoliga was next to the wall in 25.21 .

Schooling was 10th in the event at last summer 's World Championships after narrowly missing out on the final . University of Georgia product Hali Flickinger notched a time of 2:08.61 , equal to 20th in the world , to take top honors in the women 's 200 butterfly . <p> Melanie Margalis raced to first in the 200 breaststroke in 2:26.66 and Walker Higgins was first in the 400 free in <h> Studies identify disorder

That talent was again on display on the final night of the USA Swimming Pro Series stop in Charlotte , as the 15-year-old Oleksiak put up a splendid time en route to victory in the 100 freestyle . <p> Oleksiak nearly matched her career best when she beat countrywoman Chantal Van Landeghem and American Dana Vollmer on Sunday night , a clocking of 53.41 doing the job . Oleksiak was timed in 53.31 at the Canadian Trials , where she also beat Van Landeghem , who was second in Charlotte in 54.13 . Vollmer placed third in 54.19 . <p> Ranked seventh in the world in the 100 free and fifth in the 100 butterfly , Oleksiak has waved goodbye to the days of anonymity or star power at the junior level . She 's now among the big fish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reach this summer at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , it 's not out of question in the fly .

But it was the young teenager who had the power coming home and was able to surge ahead of her veteran foes . While Vollmer was third in the evening , what she did in the morning was her highlight of the day . <p> Her comeback from maternity leave shaping up better each day , Vollmer led qualifying in the 100 free after a prelim performance of 53.59 . That time sits ninth in the world and is the fastest of 2016 by an American . On a larger scale , it puts Vollmer in the discussion for a spot on the 400 freestyle relay that will be bound for Rio .

In Charlotte , they finished the meet off with a down-to-the-wire showdown in the 50 breaststroke , the results slotting King and Meili at second and third in the world rankings . <p> Following her victory over Meili in the 100 breaststroke earlier in the meet , King made it a double by winning the one-lap event in 30.35 . Meili delivered an impressive mark of her own , going 30.42 . Jamaican Alia Atkinson , expected to have a strong presence in Rio , was third in 30.77 . <p> In the men 's 50 breaststroke , Cody Miller 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Block ( 27.64 ) , but Miller 's best time of the day came in the preliminaries , where he went 27.39 . <h> Freestyle Triple Wrapped Up By Leah Smith <p> Leah Smith wrapped up a sweep of the distance freestyles by claiming the 800 free title in , good for 14th in the world rankings and almost three seconds ahead of the of Ashley Twichell .

 set the pace at the start , out in 1:00.99 at the mark out in lane 1 , Carlin on 1:01.50 . The Dutch challenger out on the wing piled on the pressure , on 2:04.56 at the mark , Spain 's Maria Vilas Vidal in 7 on 2:04.90 , Carlin half a second away . At that point Boglarka Kapas , medallist last year , pressed the pace and turned first a touch ahead of all mentioned so far on the way to the half-way mark : 4:11.48 for Kapas , 4:11.91 for Vilas Vidal and for Carlin , Van Rouwendaal fading . <p> Kapas , no Olympic trials as such in the Hungarian schedule and racing more rested than Carlin , went through the mark in , the Brit on but looking unlikely to be able to make up the deficit . The top 2 stayed almost precisely where they were in relation to one another from that point on , while Oder broke through in the last to pass Vilas Vidal for a maiden podium at the long-course showcase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the helm of world pace , Katie Ledecky ( USA ) having taken the global standard down to 8:06 . <h> Comments <p> mark schwartz May 19 , 2016 <p> It 's interesting to see that not only has Ledecky burst through to a new level , but those who would give chase seem to have fallen further behind . If I recall , in 2013 Friis also swam faster than Adlington 's then world record only to finish second to Ledecky . Carlin swam as fast as 8:15 in 2014 . Neither of them has been able to come close to those previous achievements . It leaves one scratching the old noggin . Only Lauren Boyle has improved on her times since 2013 . I believe she is older than the other two so one ca n't attribute the struggles to age . Hard to fathom . <p> kevin roose May 19 , 2016 <p> Wrong you forgot Jessica Ashwood who in the 400/800 and 1500 inproved her times in 2015 ; While i certainly do n't  think Jessica will beat Ledecky in Rio she is a excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2016 <p> It takes a special athlete to have both body and mind hold up year after year in the distance lane . With someone like Van Rouwendaal , the mind is willing but the shoulder has apparently become weak- while Lucas gets good results for a season or two , not every swimmer can handle a regime like his indefinitely . <p> May 19 , 2016 <p> Jessica Ashwood has a chance to medal in both 400/800 but I would n't call it " excellent " , at all . In 400 , she has equal chance to medal as do six other swimmers ( Smith , Boyle , Carlin , Maclean , Balmy , a Chinese , and van if she 's healthy ) . In 800 , it 's the same thing : Boyle , Friis , Carlin , Belmonte , all have equal if not better chance to medal . Throw in Maclean , , van if healthy , and you have a crowded party behind Ledecky . <p> May 19 , 2016 <p> And of course I forgot Kapas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently sits in number 2 position times this year for both 400 and 800 free ..... i would certainly say she has a excellent chance ... <p> The leaked video 
 the Russian swimmer who has tested positive for more than one banned substance in the past three years , including an anabolic steroid listed on the label of the product she bought and consumed , is back in California training and , according to her agent , is heading back to coach Dave Salo 's University of program in Los Angeles . <p> FINA lifted the provisional suspension imposed on Efimova at the start of this week , according to the swimmer 's agent . <p> The Chairman of the FINA Doping Panel , Anti-Doping Panel , American Robert Fox , is said to have signed the paperwork confirming the withdrawal of the suspension that had been in place since March 14 after the Russian swimmer tested positive for meldonium . <p> A May 30 hearing of the FINA Doping Panel does not include the Efimova case . FINA has offered no explanation as to why that should be . <p> Vladimir Salnikov , the president of Russian swimming and FINA Bureau member told TASS : <p> " Her case is not on the agenda of the May 30 FINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have agreed to put all materials in one file and debate the case there in Lausanne . " <p> It was only last week that FINA opted not to lift Efimova 's suspension , a decision that locked her out of the European Championships as well as training in the USA . <p> Andrey Mitkov , Efimova 's agent , revealed the news to the the All Sports website in Russia , confirmed that the doping case against his client is not over but noted that Efimova flew back to the USA on Tuesday and has started to train " for the Olympic Games " on Wednesday in California . <p> " I am not in favour . It 's a bad signal . I talked to swimmers and coaches before it happened and they told me they would be very angry and now it has happened and they are angry . It should be a lesson for those who want to find a short cut . I think she should be still out until it 's decided . " <p> Salo is in London at the European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> Efimova 's agent suggested that the swimmer was visited by USADA testers on her first day back and " passed a regular doping test " . That is a dubious claim in that tests in general take at least two weeks to filter back through the system before and " all clear " is reported back to athletes , coaches and others who have access to that information . <p> Efimova 's suspension kept her out of racing at the European Championships in London this week and meant that she had been unable to train in the United States , where rules prevent coaches working with any athlete during a suspension period . The provisional ban lifted means that Salo can take Efimova back . Whether he will remains to be seen . <p> Salo , according to Efimova 's agent , will soon be coaching her , according to the swimmer 's agent , back in a program at Trojan that counts on its record at least five athletes who have fallen foul of anti-doping rules in recent years . Salo has insisted that his program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplementation , all the more so without having the substances checked first . He does not insist , however , that athletes who fall foul leave his program . <p> The news went down like a lead balloon at the European Championships in a week in which there has been a sense of relief that Efimova was not in the water to race the likes of Ruta Meilutyte , Rikke Pedersen and others affected by her choices . <p> On 26 August 2015 , FINA tried to conduct an out-of-competition doping control test on the swimmer , William Brothers ( CAN ) . The circumstances of this unsuccessful attempt constituted a potential violation of the FINA DC Rule 2.3 evading , refusing or failing to submit to sample collection . <p> Following further investigation and a hearing in this matter , the FINA Doping Panel decided according to the FINA DC Rule 10.3.1 to impose on the athlete a sanction of four ( 4 ) years ' period of ineligibility commencing on 26 August 2015 and ending at the conclusion of 25 August 2019 for his first anti-doping rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests for banned substances ? <p> ** -- swimmer tested positive for an anabolic steroid in 2013 and received a suspension , just over a year of that actually served out of competition but not out of training at the University of Southern program . This year , she tested positive for meldonium on four separate occasions according to the Russian media citing the swimmer 's agent . Meldonium became a banned substance on January 1 this year . WADA has offered a temporary reprieve to those who have tested positive for meldonium under certain conditions pending further research into how long the substance survives in the body after consumption . Efimova was tested by out-of-competition agents in January this year and that did not produce one of the positive meldonium tests . <p> Comment : If the news is true that Efimova is back in California Dreaming of Olympic upset over those who she has already denied their rightful rewards , then coach Dave Salo needs to bolt the door . If he does indeed take her back , he would make himself one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean sport , pastoral care and ethical behaviour when about to select a program to turn to . <p> And that thought stands regardless of any meldonium WADA waivers for those who fell foul : what happens next on that score is irrelevant to what appears to be serious outbreak of trust betrayed . <p> Why ? Well , not because coach Salo has cheated , not because he even condones cheating and not because he runs a dirty program for he does not . It is the weakness of stance that weakens him , as his professional peer Jon Rudd suggests this evening in London in a comment directed generally at any who work on with those who fall foul of the WADA Code . <p> By that I mean this : 2016 will see the release of " The Last Gold " the film about the USA women 's 4x100m freestyle quartet that finally got one over the GDR and its State Plan 14:25 for gold at the Montreal 1976 Olympic Games . The war on doping goes on but 40 years after Shirley Babashoff and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate solo victories in Olympic waters , the likes of Rikke Pedersen continue to be denied such moments by the like of Efimova . <p> There will be much celebrating in the United States when " The Last Gold " makes release . Will Dave Salo be among those nodding sagely in support of folk denied ? If he is and if he does indeed let the Russian return full time to Trojan as the agent suggests , he may instead wish to send Efimova packing with a clear message : we do not condone taking steroids but we gave you a second chance and you let us down not through a positive test alone but because you did n't even tell me you were taking meldonium after all that had come to pass . <p> A third chance is at least one too many if the fight for clean sport is to be won , coach Salo . <p> There is another dimension : there will be those in Russia at this highly sensitive time now shrugging their shoulders and saying ' see , and that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taint by association heavy in the air , the let-out clause ready to get the track and field team back in the race in time for Rio . <h> Comments <p> He may be great coach , and he may have great facade that he promotes clean sport and that he may be boastful how he is against even supplements . <p> But facts are different . No other coach in the past 10 years have had more swimmers tested positive for banned substances than Dave Salo has . <p> And now he is giving another refuge to Efimova after training her during the first ban ? <p> I am glad there is still swimming publication like and Swimming World that are taking strong , clean line against doping in swimming . <p> Ger May 20 , 2016 <p> So , is that the all clear for Rio ? <p> May 20 , 2016 <p> The thing that irked me to no end is that Efimova did n't have to go cross the line to be as successful as she has . She is really talented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as 15 or 16 yo winning gold in 2008 Euro . <p> Craig Lord May 20 , 2016 <p> No the case is still open , Ger . <p> May 20 , 2016 <p> Is this unprecendented ? Has anyone else ever been un-suspended when their case was still pending ? <p> Craig Lord May 20 , 2016 <p> Good question Kat . I ca n't recall such a case but then the whole meldonium issue is uncharted ... there may well be a reason why the lift was required for a legal process to proceed ... we shall see . <p> Outrageous does n't even come close ... This is madness . A double cheat being unsuspended is a blow to clean sport . Very sad day in swimming <p> May 20 , 2016 <p> With the suspension lifted , bypassing the Doping Panel , does adjudication come quicker ? CAS was the likely destination of many cases , especially with a case of weak knees from WADA and perhaps FINA . If this means swift resolution that may be a good thing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Efimova should not be cleared and not in Rio . Is there a patron saint of fairness or justice ? <p> May 20 , 2016 <p> Is it a case of weak knees by WADA or a case that WADA have gone " bull at a gate " and sought to make headlines for themselves before having a watertight case together with regards to this substance ? <p> The fact that they 've been having to engage reverse gear and backtrack in recent months strongly suggests the latter . <p> Sadly , they are proving themselves every bit as incompetent and politically motivated as most every other sporting institution these days which is regrettable as this is an institution whose probity and competence in which competitors , other institutions and the public should have confidence . <p> clive rushton May 20 , 2016 <p> According to another place " the case will bypass the FINA Doping Panel and go straight to the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) " . That sounds like they 're trying to get her cleared and back in the shortest possible time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special treatment ? <p> May 20 , 2016 <p> Efimova gets the special treatment because she needs to be able to train at Trojan swimming club . <p> Craig Lord May 21 , 2016 <p> The CAS case is not listed as yet , if CAS it is to be , Clive . If she returns , time for the sport , coaches , swimmers to protest at the injustice of justice if that is what CAS decides is reasonable for , of course , it would be no such thing . Meanwhile , the CAS hearings list includes no reference to Efimova nor meldonium cases:http : **34;1150;TOOLONG ... Perhaps they will announce schedule soon ... <p> Keith Best lives 
 looks somewhat bizarre at the Japan Open , the women 's freestyle led by a Japanese age record of 53.98 from Rikako Ikee , inside the standard she set at Olympic trials last month , one on 54-plus , four on 55s and a couple of 56s tacked on the end . Then we find the Australian sisters listed in the depths reserved for foreigners -- World champion Bronte third in 54.11 , Cate Campbell went a little quicker : 52.38 . Take that . <p> Campbell the elder was out in 25.09 , to Bronte 's 25.60 , Ikee racing to a caree high between then after having established a World junior record of 26.05 in the butterfly . <p> Campbell 's time did not impact the 2016 World rankings but only because , on one entry per person , on the performers list , she was already top of the heap with the 52.38 from Olympic trials last month . Snap . Which added up to this lot for the coached sprinter at Commercial : <p> inside 21 times , all in textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This year , she has preserved her reputation as Consistency Cate with five efforts of 53 flat or better , the slowest of her 52s a 52.85 , all the rest inside 52.5 at a time when Australia has two others inside 53 -- Bronte on 52.58 and Emma McKeon on 52.80 at Australian Championships and Olympic trials behind the 2013 World champion and world textile best holder at 52.33 leading off the Australian relay at those Barcelona championships three years ago . <p> The only other in the world racing consistently inside 53 is Sarah Sjostrom , the Swedish sprinter who will take on the freestyle in Rio along with the 50 and free , the butterfly and the freestyle relays ( the medley yet to be decided on ) . <p> Just as with Cate Campbell on freestyle , Sjostrom , speaking in London at the European Championships the morning after a third gold medal and just before leaving the meet for home , is focussed on the butterly when it comes to providing her best shot at gold . <p> In other events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were split by Katsumi Nakamura in the freestyle : 48.17 ( off peak , fast ) ; 48.54 ; 48.75 ( better ) . <p> Kosuke Hagino and Daiya Seto -- courtesy of twitter <p> Kosuke Hagino put in a sizzling ahead of world champion Daiya Seto and a 4:10.53 in the medley , while Ryosuke Irie dominate the backstroke in 1:55.89 . <p> The women 's medley went to Miho Takahashi in , Sakiko Shimizu on , while the free finals were topped by Naito Ehara , 3:48.09 , and Chihiro Igarashi , 4:09.36 , and the women 's backstroke went to Natsumi Sakai in 2:10.94 . <p> In dash finals , Masayuki Kishida claimed the ' fly in 23.49 , Masato Uneno the breaststroke in 27.52 , and Satomi Suzuki the women 's breaststroke in 31.35 . <h> Comments <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> To Swedish Olympics coaches who may read this website , please do not make Sarah to swim 4 ? 100 free and 4 ? 200 relays , to make sure she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free events . Thanks . <p> Yozhik May 21 , 2016 <p> Deserves the attention Kromowidjojo 's time at 52.27 with . If to remember that 's RT is consistently under then this race in relay with the 27.26 on the way home is an impressively fast swimming . I 'm taking my words back that we wo n't see Kromowidjojo under 53 in Rio . So the interesting battle for the two remaining podium steps after Cate Campbell between three swimmers awaits for us . Someone will be out of the podium . Despite some people argue that Sjostrom has to rethink her decision about 200 it surprisingly ( from sprinter 's prospective ) may happen to be the only her Olympic medal in freestyle . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> I agree with you , I also think Sjostrom 's chance to medal in 200 free is actually greater than in 50/100 free . And that 's why I just do n't get the argument by some who urge not to swim 200 . <p> May 21 , 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ; touchwood that this can continue through Rio . She certainly has been the pre-eminent figure in this event over this Olympic cycle and it would be great to see this crowned in Rio . <p> I 'm not sure that Kromowidjojo can get down to the but a time in the would not surprise . Whether that is enough for a medal may depend on the fitness of C2 &amp; Sjostrom 's program ... or perhaps some " intruder " . <p> Sjostrom is not racing 50free at Euros but it will be curious to compare C1 's time in Japan to Kromowidjojo &amp; Halsall . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> The thing about C2 is that she has proven she can deliver when it matters . Before teh trials , I was very pessimistic that C2 could swim anywhere near her Kazan 's time as she had been reportedly injured ( a minor one but that had hampered her preparations ) . And then she went 52.5 <p> C2 is a great racer and I 'd call her " scrappy " with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis star . <p> I do hope C1 will be at her healthiest in Rio . It will have been a long time coming . I started following her swimming career when I first heard she went 24.9 as a 14 yo in early 2007 and then I watched her beating the newly minted 50 free world champion Libby Trickett at 2007 Japan Open in 24.4 , in textile mind you . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> I agree with what you 're saying . ASF . By no means am I ruling C2 out of the equation ; like you her 100 at Trials was a ( pleasant ) surprise . <p> However , the indications we have so far are that big sister is " on " this year and I think that the 100 is C2 's best race . When it comes to the 50 , she may be reigning World Champion but I 'm just not sure she can break or at least do it this year . <p> Her time does look slightly disappointing as she has shown the capacity over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at big sister 's level , outside the big meets but then again , they are different athletes . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> cw , There may be some explanations as to why C2 swam that " slow " today , ranging from sickness to bad jet-lag . I just hope it 's not injury . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> Exactly , its hardly something to be reaching for the razorblades about . It may just be that her is different to big sister 's . <p> However , I do stand by my comments re the 50 . As yet she has n't really threatened breaking the 24 and I suspect that may be needed for the podium . <p> Fit n firing , one would like to think that she might do it but in a year with injury niggles , one would have to think those odds lengthen somewhat . But hey , I 'd be as happy as the next person if she did it . @ @ @ actor who 
 Winner Federica Pellegrini of Italy and Femke Heemskerk of the Netherlands soak up the result - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> European Championships <p> London , Day 6 <p> We 've seen it before , the Lioness of Verona stalking her prey before pouncing . She cut it fine today but when Federica Pellegrini ( ITA ) started to motor out as Femke Heemskerk ( NED ) started to show the first signs of vulnerability , the hunt was on . It looked life the defender had left it to late . Last stroke : whack 1:55.93 to 1:55.97 . The bronze went to Charlotte Bonnet ( FRA ) , on 1:56.51 . <p> Job done . The first successful defence of the day for Pellegrini , who celebrated a record fourth European freestyle crown in a race that went without Sarah Sjostrom " , the Swedish sprinter who confirmed before she lefty for home that the freestyle will be on her Rio 2016 roster . <p> Federica Pellegrini of Italy by PBK <p> Sjostrom , fastest freestyler at world titles last year with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a 1:55.30 championship record on the books from the 4x200m relay lead for Sweden two days ago , faster than the solo win today but without having taken on the four-lap fight . <p> Heemskerk set the pace , Pellegrini followed , Bonnet tried to stick like glue . The ebb and flow that led to another contribution to the Italian 's wish to be recalled as the greatest free racer in history when the racing if finally done some day . <p> 27.66 ; 57.10 ; 1 ; 237.04 ; 1:55.93 ( 28.89 ) Pellegrini <p> 27.02 ; 56.62 ; ; 1:55.97 ( 29.47 ) Heemskerk <p> 27.32 ; 56.75 ; 1:26.88 ; 1:56.61 ( 29.63 ) Bonnet <p> At a time of training for Rio , Pellegrini said : <p> " I 'm happy with the title . To be honest , I 'm a bit surprised with how things panned out today : I came to the championships off the back of a tough training camp and really did n't expect this result at all . " <p> was disappointed to have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not the first time I lost to Federica in a close race . My suit tore just before the race but I managed to stay cool . I 'm not too happy now but there are goods things to take way with me . " <p> For Bonnet , it was her first European medal in a solo event . She said : " I got bronze behind two great swimmers so this is a really fine result for me . " <p> La Fede <p> Pellegrini holds records galore over freestyle , including the world record of 1:52.98 from a time of shiny suits in 2009 . <p> Since 2004 , when she claimed Olympic silver at Athens 2004 , Pellegrini has assembled the finest collection of jewel in the sport , including Olympic gold ( 2008 ) ; World long-course titles ( 2009 , 2011 ) at the helm of six podium visits in all ; European long-course crowns in 2010 , 2012 and 2014 ; the Universiade gold in 2007 ; and five Euro s/c titles to boot , 2005-2015 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times , Pellegrini would have to stretch to the 2020 championships to rewrite one of the lines in the event 's history : the biggest gap between titles was the nine years between German Franziska Van Almsick 's first and last wins , 1993 and 2002 , the win producing a then world record of 1:56.64 in the midst of a 13-year reign as a world record holder who claimed Olympic silver but for whom gold remained elusive . <p> In Rio at the Olympic Games the battle is going to be much tougher , and probably much faster , the London race a mark of what everyone with an eye on the ultimate podium is working for , the season bests of Sjostrom , Pellegrini and Heemskerk all ahead of their best this week . Said Pellegrini : <p> " The Olympics will be a race in itself but I 'm pleased with the journey so far . " <h> Comments <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> I 'm so lucky I got to watch both greatest ever 200 free female swimmers : Pellegrini and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same city : Rome , 1994 for van Almsick in lane 8 and 2009 for Pellegrini in lane 4 . <p> Although I must give van Almsick 's swim as my most favorite 200 free swim , that swim has everything : drama in the prelims and afterwards , exhilaration , guts , amazing swim , super villains , and victory for the heroine . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> By the way , I should stop commenting on Heemskerk 's swim when it matters . I just hope she consults with sports psychologist or someone that can help her overcoming this mental hurdle . <h> Archbishop approaches end 
 pipped the specialists once more : Fran Halsall retained the crown in a Championship and English record of 27.57 over champion Mie Nielsen ( DEN ) , 27.77 , the winner 's teammate and Commonwealth dash champion for Wales Georgia Davies on 27.87 to grant the hosts bronze and a second bite of the cherry . <p> Halsall , coached by James Gibson at Loughborough , was just shy of the British record held by Davies . The champion then dashed off to the semis of the freestyle straight from the race , her sprint between sprints part of her journey to the defence of another Berlin 2014 crown on the curtain-closing day of the championships . Said Halsall beyond her second race of the afternoon : <p> " That was exciting . I really enjoyed that a lot . It shows I 'm in great shape at an important stage in the season . I managed to swim in a straight line and deliver a great time tonight , so I 'm really happy with that .

Also through : Anna Santamans ( FRA ) , Jeanette Ottesen ( DEN ) , Yuliya ( BLR ) , Therese Alshammar ( SWE ) , Theodora Drakou ( GRE ) and Silvia di Pietro ( ITA ) <p> Halsall 's two efforts left her at third on the world rankings for 2016 : <h> Comments <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> I have to be honest , watching this made me chuckle , the same way when watching Manadou winning 50 back at SC worlds .

At a glance , there 's some loss of peak form to come , if you can lose something before you 've had it . Suffice it to say that the 7:04.33 in which GBR claimed the global crown last year was well ahead of them and the race today . <p> But the race was good -- terrific , indeed . Here 's how the podium flew into place : <p> Maarten Brzoskowski by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brzoskowski <p> 1:47.88 Kyle Stolk <p> 1:45.47 Sebastiaan Verschuren <p> BEL : <p> 1:48.47 Louis Croenen <p> 1:46.12 Glenn <p> 1:47.70 Dieter Dekoninck <p> 1:45.99 Pieter Timmers <p> ITA : <p> 1:47.57 Andrea D'Arrigo <p> 1:47.82 Filippo Magnini ( who raced with cramp in his foot ) <p> 1:47.52 Luca Dotto <p> 1:45.39 Gabriele Detti <p> Poland , then France , then Britain , Hungary and Israel followed , noteworthy splits the 1:45.64 of James Guy , the only one in the field faster a 1 45.60 from Kasper of Poland , and a from Yannick Agnel , the Olympic freestyle champion still weighing up whether to take up the offer of a place in the Rio race that would allow him to defend his crown . <p> Speaking for the Dutch , Stolk said : <p> " This was the first time we cam together and raced as a quartet since Kazan worlds last year . We 've build som great team spirit and we 're looking foreword to the Olympics . " <h> Comments <p> Worth nothing Poland 's time being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the 2012 version , hard to see him even making final if he takes the swim . <p> May 21 , 2016 <p> 1 ' 45 ? 39 ! An impressive time for a long distance swimmer . It give me confidence he can swim a great 400 in Rio . This year he already swam a very good 3 ' 43 ? 9 . If he can go a second faster there is hope for a bronze medal . <p> May 22 , 2016 <p> It 's amazing that this is the Netherlands first m4x100 win . That 's was a great race indeed , which , for 4 ? 200 is quite special . 4 ? 200 is my least favorite event , but I was thoroughly captivated by this race . Ok , my hasty prediction after this race : the world champions will miss out on medaling altogether in Rio ? ?@@8960136 <h> Community Spirit <h> <p> For two years 
 race , David Verraszto , podium in the treasury last year , was the man with the form and a title to defend . He showed it over the eight laps that followed ' go ' . Gold was his in 4:13.15 , the silver to Richard Nagy ( SVK ) in 4:14.16 , the bronze to Federico ( ITA ) in 4:14.74 . <p> Butterfly was the only stroke Verraszto did not lead , a 58.27 leaving him adrift Max Litchfield , the 21-year-old Brit making his senior international debut , on 57.85 , Semen Makovich ( RUS ) on 58.04 , all others with a range . <p> The son of 1975 world backstroke champion Zoltan Verraszto made his dad proud by passing all and putting clear blue water between his feet and the fingers of others on the way to a 2:01.72 half-way split . Litchfield was closest , on 2:03.30 and putting in a fine effort under the weight of work but also about to feel the flow of medley strengths around him . <p> By the time breaststroke turned to freestyle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.52 over Nagy , Litchfield and Gergely Gyurta ( HUN ) about to be hunted down and passed by Turrini , the fastest last two-lapper in the race . clocked , Litchfield . <p> The champion anew said : <p> " With the early start of the afternoon session ( 4pm not 6pm for TV ) , we did n't get enough time to recover in between sessions , which is important in the 400IM .

 31 athletes whose retested samples from the 2008 Olympics in Beijing produced adverse findings are Russian , according to Tass , the state agency . <p> Tass also reports that the majority but not all of those involved are from track and field . The news will comes a s blow to Russia 's hopes of having its tack and field squad back from a whole-nation suspension in time for the Rio Olympic Games this August . The International Association of Athletics Federation ( IAAF ) will vote on the matter on June 17 after a taskforce process . <p> The International Olympic Committee announced last week that 31 individuals had tested positive for banned substances after 454 retrospective urine samples from the Beijing 2008 Games were reexamined . The IOC targeted athletes who were due to compete at Rio , using more advanced testing techniques than were available in 2008 . <p> The athletes , from 6 sports and 12 countries , in question will have the chance to request that their " B " sample is tested before their names are revealed . Nations involved have been contacted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it be known that they have no athletes involved . <p> Pressure to bar Russia from the Rio Games is growing , on the back of the latest ARD German TV Red Herrings , revelations in The Times and The New York Times and revelations from the UK Anti-Doping that its testing operation in the country had been hampered by a number of obstacles . <p> The UK agency said that of 247 tests overseen from November last year to early this month , 99 were unable to be carried out because it proved impossible to locate an athlete . One test was refused . It remains to be seen if all those cases have been registered officially as no shows . <p> Meanwhile , inquiries proceed . The IOC and the World Anti-Doping Agency are making further investigations into the laboratory used for testing at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 , amid allegations that Russian samples were switched to a shadow laboratory so that banned substances the Russians knew would show up could not be detected . <h> Comments <p> In light of this 2008 samples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ARD , one may wonder if any of those 2012 medals is clean . <p> Ger May 24 , 2016 <p> My worry about all of this is the excess of focus on Russia , where there are obviously problems . What about China and the clenbuterol warnings and the doping that is going on everywhere . The authorities can ban Russia and say how they are winning the war on doping and how we 're moving forward while sweeping the rest , somewhat , under the carpet . I 'm not saying that 's how it is , but just my concern . The U.S. authorities getting involved has a sense of cold war Olympic style about it . <p> May 24 , 2016 <p> Russian athletics has been particularly egregious for a decade plus now- honestly the worst program reputation of the 21st century and the known positives and number of athletes who turn in world leaders domestically but are mysteriously never selected for international meets . If they 'd retested all the Russian athletics samples from Beijing instead of only the ones from athletes still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more positives . ( Apparently the gold in women 's steeple is particularly suspicious ) <p> In the most likely WTF ? scheduled medal reassignment , let me be one of the first to offer congratulations to the 2008 gold medalists in the women 's 4 ? 100 relay : Belgium . ( And yes , there was a sister to go with the male triplets that make up so many of Belgium 's men 's relay squads ) <p> As for the US , they are hardly perfect , but have shown a willingness to eat their own young in pursuit of fair sport and anti-doping efforts . It was internal/domestic investigations that ' got ' Lance Armstrong and Marion Jones after all when many other countries would have fallen back on the line about how no one ever tested positive so they must have been clean . <h> Stung by loss 
 month remains until some dreams are fulfilled and others are broken at the United States Olympic Trials in Omaha . The competition , which will be held in at the CenturyLink Center for the third consecutive time , will account for the final piece of the Olympic puzzle and will allow for a clearer picture of what will unfold in August in Rio de Janeiro . <p> There 's no shortage of storylines heading into the meet , and in regards of what will transpire in Rio , the first South American city to serve as an Olympic host . Here is SwimVortex 's latest look at some of the top American storylines of the summer . <h> Will Natalie Coughlin Make History ? <p> Through three Olympiads ( 2004-2012 ) , Natalie Coughlin has accumulated 12 medals , a total that ranks for the most in history by a female swimmer , along with countrywomen Jenny Thompson and Dara Torres . Will the 33-year-old Coughlin get the chance to grab lucky No. 13 , and garner sole possession of the record ? <p> Coughlin 's record-breaking potential basically hinges on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an American medal in the 400 freestyle relay , where the United States figures to be in the silver- and bronze-medal hunt at the Games . For Coughlin to get the chance to race that relay in Rio , it will first require a top-six finish in Omaha , followed by an American medal at the Games . Last year , Coughlin rated as the third-quickest American , thanks to a 53.85 clocking from the Pan American Games . <p> The second option for Coughlin is to qualify for the Olympics in the 100 backstroke , thus giving her two more medal opportunities . Coughlin might not be the dominant force she was on the way to back-to-back Olympic titles in 2004 and 2008 , but she ranked sixth in the world in 2015 at 59.05 , and was the top American . After seemingly pushing the backstroke aside in favor of the sprint freestyles , Coughlin 's return to the 100 back was highly intriguing . <p> A berth to Rio in the 100 backstroke would not only provide Coughlin with an individual chance at more Olympic hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medley relay , where the United States is favored for gold . Obviously , it wo n't be easy for Coughlin to qualify in the 100 backstroke due to the presence of Missy Franklin , Claire Adams , Kathleen Baker and Olivia Smoliga , but last summer proved Coughlin is going to be a factor . <h> How Many 30-Plus Guys Will Reach The Podium ? <p> If not for the quality and quantity of youth coming through the American system , there could be some concerns that Team USA is going into the Olympic Games with an aging roster . But when the elder statesmen carrying the banner for the United States are led by Michael Phelps and , there 's no need to bring out the walking canes . <p> It will be interesting to see how many athletes will have medals draped around their necks when flights leave Brazil . At least two seem like a lock , since the aforementioned Phelps and Lochte are as dominant as anyone has ever been in the 200 individual medley . Meanwhile , it 's difficult to foresee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be a challenger in the 200 freestyle . <p> But there are more options , thanks to the presence of veterans such as Matt Grevers , Anthony Ervin and Cullen Jones . Obviously , they have to navigate the land mines of Trials , but if that path is successfully negotiated , Grevers ( 100 backstroke ) and ( 50 freestyle ) will be threats . The reigning Olympic champion in the 100 back , Grevers is the more likely candidate as he was the bronze medalist in his prime event at last summer 's World Championships . <p> Depending on what unfolds at Trials , David Plummer or Nick Thoman could also factor in the medal chase in the 100 backstroke , an event that can be argued to be as deep as any in the American arsenal . <h> Can Andrew Seliskar Fulfill Long-Standing Lofty Expectations ? <p> There was a time when he was viewed as a can't-miss future star of USA Swimming , potentially a guy who could thrive in multiple events for the Red , White and Blue . That potential still may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more of an enigma than as a young gun expected to nail down a ticket to Rio . <p> Andrew Seliskar Photo : Mike Visuals , for USA Swimming <p> As a and 17-year-old , Seliskar delivered performances that spoke of big things to come . There were several impressive efforts in the individual medley disciplines and the 200 breaststroke , but his prowess in the 200 butterfly is what garnered the greatest attention . And why not ? After clocking at the 2013 World Junior Championships , Seliskar followed with a 1:55.92 outing at the 2014 Junior Pan Pacific Championships . <p> The 2015 campaign , too , opened in promising fashion , Seliskar able to generate another 1:55.92 in January , followed by a 1:56.24 in March . Since that time , however , Seliskar 's long-course exploits have trailed off , and he was unable to put together a strong showing at last summer 's United States Nationals in San Antonio . <p> As Trials approach , the question surrounding Seliskar is simple : Will he look the part of the youngster with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-factor in the pursuit of Olympic berths ? A positive for Seliskar is the fact that he raced in a trio of championship finals for California-Berkeley during his initial NCAA Championships back in March , including a third-place finish in the 200 fly . But that was a short-course competition and the verdict is out concerning Seliskar 's summer prospects . <p> Outside of Michael Phelps ' ironclad grip on the top spot , the 200 butterfly 's second bid to Rio is hardly locked in . While Jack Conger put himself into an advantageous position last summer with a sub-1:55 marker , the likes of Tom Shields and Tyler Clary are also hovering . For Seliskar , perhaps the work he 's done with coach Dave Durden at Cal will come together at the most-opportune time , thus leading to the fulfillment the expectations that have tracked the teenager for several years . <h> Can Elizabeth Beisel Play the Role of Spoiler ? <p> Last year , Elizabeth Beisel looked anything like the woman who had been a staple for years -- on international podiums in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida product and when the curtain came down on 2015 , Beisel ranked outside the top-10 in the world in her main event , and her best time of 4:36.71 was pedestrian by her standards . <p> As Trials approach , Beisel has packaged a handful of encouraging performances , most notably a 4:33.55 effort in the 400 medley that has her ranked fourth in the world . The longtime prot ? g ? of Gregg Troy , Beisel has basically erased a year to forget and is surging at the best time possible , a fact that will surely be noted by her rivals . <p> The reigning Olympic silver medalist in the 400 medley , Beisel finds herself in a different scenario than last quadrennial . Entering the 2012 Games in London , Beisel was the world champion and woman to beat in the decathlon of the sport . This time around , she is joined on the domestic scene by Maya DiRado as a Rio medal contender while Ella Eastin lurks as a potential heir . Meanwhile , Hungarian Katinka Hosszu is the overwhelming favorite for gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to fill the void on her resume . <p> Beisel has everything on her side on the way to Omaha and Rio , from veteran experience to momentum to a lack of pressure . Put those characteristics together and Beisel is a dangerous threat for a big summer . <p> , N.D.

 is a cathedral shy of becoming Olympic City for the Rio Olympic Games : the home of 18,000 athletes and officials during the Olympic Games in August and the Paralympic Games in September , the village will be the largest in Games history , say organisers . <p> Supported by 13,000 staff and volunteers working around the clock at Barra da Tijuca , next to Olympic Park in Rio 's southwest , the Olympic Village features 31 high-rise buildings , 3,604 apartments , a shopping centre , banks , medical centre , gymnasium , post office , beauty salon and shops selling licensed products and nothing but ; a 200,000 square-metre recreation zone for athletes complete with lounge area , games room , green areas , a bicycle track and swimming pools ; and a restaurant " big enough to house a Boeing 747 jumbo jet " and primed to serve an estimated 60,000 meals a day . <p> All of that will be linked to a 24-hour of a bus service to get folk from one end of the empire to the other . <p> Olympic village director Mario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completed and of the apartments have been furnished . <p> On the eve of teams arriving in mid-July , the village condominiums will boast some 19,000 beds , 19,650 wardrobes , 11,152 air conditioners , 120,580 towels , 70,200 sheets and 19,000 quilts . Condoms , as you may well have read everywhere else you look , will be in abundant supply enough on tap , apparently , for a single athlete to have fun at the Games at least five times a day during their stay . <p> One aspect of village life that may not go down so well with teams who take control of food and drink supplies seriously : no fridges in the apartments . Organisers note that " all buildings have been fitted with machines that dispense free cold drinks " . And who control the supply of all of that ; who is keeping an eye on provenance , given the strict liability conditions of the WADA Code ? <p> " It may seem like nonsense but the showers , for example , are a little taller . When we open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world everything via social media . We want to make the best possible impression . " <p> Final checks -- doubtless a flush of insecticide in the mix are due on July 18 , six days before the first arrivals . <p> " The big difference with Rio , apart from the city 's beauty , is the warmth of the people , " Cilenti said . " That is what will make the experience unique and something that athletes are not going to forget . " <p> Comment : Actually , Senhor Cilenti , this correspondent recalls a warm welcome from the citizens of many Games , in Spain , the USA , Australia , Greece , China and Britain , for example . Much to be said for celebrating achievement and the Village looks immensely impressive without the need to claim the " best ever " best reserved for the realm of measurable athletic endeavour . <h> Comments <p> I think that 's precisely what they will do ( those who can afford it/have thought ahead ) , asf <p> kevin roose May 31 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its does n't  get much better ...... interesting most of the furniture has been supplied by a Australian company furniture made in China of course . <p> May 31 , 2016 <p> I 'm not sure the electrical grid could handle too many additional fridges . They already had to go back on the idea of only air conditioning the blocks of the national federations that were willing to pay for AC . <p> ( For all that is wrong with cycling , one good thing they do on the Grand Tours is control and rotate accommodations so every team , not just the big budget ones , gets its share of nights spent in four star or better hotels , and even Sky spends its share of Tour de France nights in the private rooms of a youth hostel. ) <h> Listen to Previews 
 her way to one of 43 world records , her 's in the breaststroke in semis , at the 2009 shiny suits circus in Rome by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The Zika virus , the risk of hastening its reach and spread as tourists flock to Rio for the Olympic Games , as well as the implications for the health and welfare of women athletes , is a story close to the heart of former world record holder Pierse . <p> At a time when many pro-sports athletes from golf , tennis and basketball are staying home to wash their hair or do other things rather than fly down to Rio for the Games , the ' choice ' is one Hobson would understand , a no-brainer for swimmers and others for whom the Olympics represents the pinnacle of their sporting days . They will go . Many will be as careful as it is possible to be , the risk to those on the wealthier and more professional teams backed by medical staff , managers and more reduced by circumstance and planning . <p> Some of those pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice of leading experts in the face of an ' all will be well ' approach from the International Olympic Committee and its partner the World Health Organisation . <p> has good reason to urge caution to her peers from swimming and the sportsmen and women for whom there is more to lose if they hand in their Olympic ticket . <p> In an article from Postmedia Breaking News , Pierse is described as : <p> " Exhibit A : a living testimony to the perils of competing in a hazardous environment . " <p> Now 32 , the 2009 medallist from Edmonton via UBC , contracted dengue fever from a mosquito bite while at the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in 2010 . <p> That , effectively , ended her career : she might never have got back to the world-record pace she mustered in shiny suit in 2009 but she would surely have been a contender for the Olympic final in 2012 had her career followed a smooth course . In textile in 2010 she was a swimmer , taking bronze at Pan Pacs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olympic champions , Rebecca Soni ( USA ) and Leisel Jones ( AUS ) . <p> Then came Delhi and Dengue . She never got back that way again , clocking 2:27.14 at Canadian Olympic trials in 2012 , what would have been her second time round the five rings at London 2012 Olympics no longer a part of her journey . <p> Annamay by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Press pause . Readers who recall Delhi 2010 will hear the chorus of voices from the telling the media day after day that there was ' no sickness in the camp ' , even when swimmers were throwing up in the mixed zone , rushing off to loos overflowing with the effects of whatever form of Delhi Belly they 'd been inflicted by . There were even farcical scenes in which official statements denying there was any issue with athletes were handed to media in the same hour as a doctor rushed out on to the deck to help a well-known sprinter climb out of the water because he feared she was going to pass out . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now , as officials push Zika to the back of the queue and in other ways , NBC 's night swimming included , impose conditions on athletes that fall well shy of representing the best interests of athletes in Rio , Pierse is there to remind all what can happen when sports and health officials downplay -- as they did with Dengue and in New Delhi -- risk . <p> " I do n't even remember being bitten by a mosquito , " Pierse told Postmedia . <p> " I was never the same athlete afterwards . A huge part of it for me was the mental part ... that would be the lasting effects . I got very depressed afterward , and then trying to pick yourself up and then missing London , going through the whole transition of stopping swimming . It was n't a great journey at all . But I made my choices and I believed in them at the time . " <p> Dengue is also one of the variables in the Rio equation . Pika has the potential to have far more devastating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrunken heads of babies who will never lead the normal life they would have had their mothers not been afflicted by Zika . <p> describes how hard Hobson 's choice can be : <p> " Every day I read an article that says , ' Oh , it 's terrible . ' And then I read another one that says , ' Oh , it 's not going to be as bad as everyone says . And each one is quoting the World Health Organization or a different professor who works in disease control . " <p> Then Pierse notes the drop for swimmers and others holding a ticket to the dream they 've worked so hard to follow : <p> " You think , well , it 'll be winter in Brazil , still warm but not really mosquito season . And you think about all the things you have given up in your life ... and I mean , if you talk to some of the people who lost out because the Games were boycotted in 1980 , some of them have never gotten over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dream . It was my dream since I was six , and I went when I was 24 . So if someone had said before Beijing , I think you should boycott , there 's no way I would have . " <p> Annamay by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> and her husband , Canadian Olympic canoeist Mark Oldershaw , a bronze medallist in London , welcomed their first-born , Josephine , into the world three months early last year . They understand well what a fretful time it can all be . <p> " The scary thing about Rio , " Pierse says , " is that it can affect your life forever if you have a baby that has , you know , a problem . " <p> She describes the pros sending their apologies " people for whom the Olympics is not the pinnacle of their life . It 's the people who are making millions on the pro tennis or basketball or golf circuit , and going to the Olympics for them , yes , is exciting , but for a paddler like Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to . " <p> The difference pro and new pro/amateur ? Says Pierse : <p> " A gold medal is an amazing thing for anyone , whether it is a tennis player or , in Rio , a golfer . But I kind of feel like if you asked a golfer , ' Would you rather win at Augusta or a gold medal at the Olympics ? ' , I 'm pretty sure it 's probably Augusta . " <p> I 'm sure 
 Yang* and Conor Dwyer did n't feel like waiting until August to engage in a major showdown in the 200 freestyle . As the Santa Clara stop of the USA Swimming Pro Series opened on Friday , Sun and Dwyer posted the top- and third-ranked times in the world in the 200 free , setting the stage for another duel at the Olympic Games later this summer . <p> Sun , the multi-time Olympic and world champion over various freestyle distances , ended up getting the best of Dwyer , his clocking of 1:44.82 the first mark under 1:45 this season . Sun was out in 24.87 , came through the midway point in 51.26 and touched at the 150-meter point in 1:18.12 . Dwyer was even with Sun through the first lap and just .27 back with a lap to go , but the dubious Chinese star relied on his trademark finish to hold on . Australian teen Kyle Chalmers was third in 1:47.64 . <p> By pipping Great Britain 's James Guy ( 1:45.19 ) for the top time in the world , Sun showed he is in fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during this age in sports in which doping concerns are found in headlines each day , Sun will not be able to outswim the fact that he once tested positive and served his suspension under a cloak of darkness . <p> If Sun makes the final of the 200 free in Rio and Korea 's Park Tae-Hwan is allowed to race after his doping ban , the race will be remembered for its tainted nature , particularly if either man reaches the podium . That possibility is just one reason why more stringent action must be taken against those looking for an advantage not found in hard work and dedication . <p> For Dwyer , his No. 3 performance surely opened eyes among Americans set to contest the 200 freestyle at the United States Trials in Omaha later this month . The 27-year-old just missed his personal best of 1:45.32 , posted at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona , where Dwyer earned the silver medal behind Frenchman Yannick Agnel . <h> Emma McKeon Flexes Aussie Muscle in 200 Freestyle <p> As American athletes prepare for their Trials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what is necessary to be prepared for Rio . Count Emma McKeon among those in a good position , as the led a one-two Aussie finish in the 200 freestyle and took second in the 100 butterfly . <p> Emma McKeon by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In the 200 freestyle , in which she ranks second in the world at 1:54.83 , McKeon hit the wall in 1:56.36 to edge countrywoman Bronte Barratt ( 1:56.65 ) . American Maya DiRado had a strong showing for third place in 1:57.70 . McKeon led throughout the race and only reaffirmed her status as an Olympic medal contender in an event that could include the likes of Katie Ledecky , Sarah Sjostrom , Missy Franklin and Federica Pellegrini , just to name a few . <p> McKeon was back in the water shortly after the 200 free and placed second in the 100 fly , going 58.31 . Canadian Noemie Thomas was the winner in 57.72 , breaking Dana Vollmer 's meet record by a hundredth of a second . <h> In Other Action ... <p> American Sarah Haase followed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finals of the 100 breaststroke , second place going to Jessica Hardy in 1:08.01 . For the men , Josh Prenot was quickest in the 100 breast in 1:01.15 . <p> The Cal Aquatics tandem of Seth Stubblefield and Tom Shields took the top spots in the 100 butterfly , thanks to efforts of 52.31 and 52.33 . <h> Pro Series -- Indianapolis <h> Leah Smith Continues Rise Up Ranks ; Melanie Margalis Shines <p> Showing signs of development at nearly every juncture of the season , Leah Smith delivered her latest warning shot in Indianapolis , in the form of a pair of efforts . After clocking in at 1:56.66 during the preliminaries , Smith was slightly quicker in the evening session , going 1:56.64 . She was followed to the wall by Melanie Margalis in 1:57.33 . <p> Leah Smith ( USA ) <p> There was a time when Smith was viewed as a contender for an 800 freestyle relay berth to the Olympic Games in Rio . These days , she 's looking more and more like someone who will certainly contribute to Team USA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems on a path toward a sub-1:56 performance . <p> " I 'm really pleased with my two races today , " Smith said . " I was pleasantly surprised with my 200 free this morning and just wanted to get faster tonight -- practice going faster in finals . I 'm really happy I was able to get two best times today . " <p> Although Margalis could n't reel in Smith in the 200 free , she dug deep a few minutes later to fend off the competition in the 100 breaststroke . The former University of Georgia standout , whose best chance at an Olympic bid figures to be the 200 individual medley , covered the 100 breast in 1:07.26 , comfortably ahead of the 1:07.95 of Andrea Cottrell . <p> By posting a marker , Margalis elevated the depth of the event , which might be the deepest at Trials in Omaha . In the hunt for invitations to Rio , Margalis will have to contend with a stellar crop that includes Lilly King , Katie Meili , Jessica Hardy , Molly Hannis and Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe a outing may be left off the American Olympic roster . <p> Finishing third in the 200 freestyle was Vietnam 's Vien Nguyen , who followed her 1:58.82 time by winning the 400 individual medley in . <h> Showdown Prep Done As Kelsi Worrell Claims 100 Fly In 58.10 <p> Preparing for a showdown with Dana Vollmer at Trials , Kelsi Worrell registered a tuneup mark of 58.12 in the 100 butterfly . That effort handed Worrell a triumph over Christina Bechtel , who covered her two laps in 58.73 . Worrell was actually a little faster in the morning , going 58.10 . <p> While most of the events in Omaha feature several contenders for Rio , the women 's 100 fly is largely viewed as a two-woman showdown between Vollmer and Worrell . The storyline of the event is intriguing , as Vollmer is the reigning Olympic champ and on the comeback trail after embracing motherhood . As for Worrell , the gold medalist at last summer 's Pan American Games , she 's been tabbed as Vollmer 's heir . <h> Santo Condorelli , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly a ho-hum night in the men 's events , Canadian Santo Condorelli proved his worth outside the events when he stopped the clock in 51.98 in the 100 butterfly . A medal contender in Rio in the 100 freestyle , Condorelli produced what was easily the best male performance of the night . Going out in 24.35 , Condorelli came back with a split of 27.63 to move to No. 17 in the world rankings . <p> Jay Litherland prevailed in the 200 freestyle , thanks to a swim of 1:48.41 , but his more impressive victory came in the 400 individual medley at the end of the night . Litherland posted a season-best time of 4:13.93 to move to 11th in the world . Depending on Ryan Lochte 's decision to contest the 400 medley at Trials , Litherland could be in the mix for an Olympic berth . <p> After cracking the minute barrier in the morning with a 59.93 effort , Nic Fink went 1:00.13 during finals of the 100 breaststroke to clip Cody Miller ( 1:00.41 ) and Kevin Cordes ( 1:00.51 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the likely target to extend summer action into South America . <h> Comments <p> June 4 , 2016 <p> Sun Yang must now be considered favourite for the . Dwyer , Guy and Hagino look to be the main challengers . Maxime Rooney is supposed to be the future for the USA in this event but looked slightly disappointing . Kyle Chalmers looked better . He did n't swim the 200 at trials but could very well be a wildcard in the 4X200 . Back to Sun Yang , could we see the first ever Olympic freestyle treble for men in Rio ? <h> Posted ! <h> 
 Phelps ' arrival in Austin for the Longhorn Aquatics Elite Invite , a Sports Illustrated feature noted that the 22-time Olympic medalist was intent on delivering a time in the 200 freestyle that would guarantee his presence on the 800 freestyle relay at this summer 's in Rio de Janeiro . Did Phelps achieve his goal ? <p> Not exactly . <p> Looking for a time that would make Phelps ' inclusion on the relay a slam-dunk decision , the four-time Olympian was fourth in the 200 free , beaten to the wall by a threesome with University of Texas connections . Phelps was timed in 1:48.73 and defeated by current Longhorns Townley Haas ( 1:47.86 ) and Clark Smith ( 1:47.97 ) and former Longhorn Clay Youngquist ( 1:48.48 ) . <p> The decision behind Phelps ' game plan was a simple and sensible one . If he could put down a strong marker that left no doubt about his participation on the relay , then Phelps would have the luxury of skipping the 200 free at the United States Trials in Omaha . For the 30-year-old , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks now , he 's going to have to race at least the preliminaries ( and maybe more ) in order to prove his worth . <p> During his comeback , which featured three No. 1 world rankings last year , Phelps has looked sharp in the butterfly and individual medley . However , his freestyle has not been on an equal level and remains a work in progress . With Trials fast approaching , Phelps has a few weeks to put the pieces together . Given his history , betting against that likelihood would be unwise . <p> Overshadowed by the status of Phelps in the 200 free , in which he was the 2008 Olympic champion , were the efforts of Haas and Smith . The Texas standouts certainly put themselves in relay contention for Rio , with Haas alleviating any concern that he could n't replicate the success he enjoyed in the short-course pool during the collegiate season . <p> As Texas won the team title at the NCAA Championships , Haas won the 200-yard freestyle in American-record time and left many fans drooling over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks shy of Trials , Haas showed he is in good position on the way to Trials . As for Smith , who had a subpar NCAA Champs , he followed a win in the 400 free on Friday with his quality showing at half the distance . <p> A medalist in the 400 individual medley at the past two World Championships , Chase Kalisz has been forced to wait around until the final day of the meet to race . If he successfully negotiates his prime event at the U.S. Trials , Kalisz will get the chance to perform immediately , since the 400 medley is an opening-day event . <p> Chase Kalisz Photo : Mike Visuals , for USA Swimming <p> Racing against nothing more than the clock , Kalisz registered the third-fastest time in the world in the 400 medley , going . Kalisz 's time trails only the 4:08.90 by Kosuke Hagino at the Japanese Championships and the 4:11.09 by Thomas Fraser-Holmes at the Australian Trials . Kalisz 's time was more than nine seconds clear of runnerup John Martens ( 4:20.85 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2013 and the bronze medalist in 2015 , Kalisz is a heavy favorite to qualify for Rio and battle with Hagino and his countryman , Daiya Seto , for top honors . While Hagino has been the fastest performer in the world the past few years , Seto has captured back-to-back world crowns . <p> Just after Kalisz bested the field in the 400 medley , Allison Schmitt came through in her duel in the 200 freestyle with Team USA compatriot Missy Franklin . The reigning Olympic champion in the event , Schmitt followed her victory over Franklin in the 100 freestyle from Friday night with a decision in the 200 free . Schmitt hit the wall in 1:56.87 , nearly a second quicker than the 1:57.78 of Franklin . Cierra Runge was next in 1:57.97 . <p> Allison Schmitt , courtesy of USA Swimming <p> Known for her approach that landed her the London 2012 crown , Schmitt trailed Franklin and Runge after the first lap but took control on the second 50 meters and went through the midway point in 56.89 , with Franklin at 57.55 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second . <p> With Katie Ledecky in the picture , along with Schmitt and Franklin , the trio will duke it out for the two individual bids to Rio . With Schmitt as the Olympic champ and Ledecky and Franklin owning world titles , a major figure is going to be left out of the Rio mix . If Schmitt is coming along , the same can be said for Franklin , who has long been known to produce middle-of-the-road times before dropping large chunks during her taper and when the pressure is on . <p> Not long after finishing second in the 200 free , Franklin was back on the blocks for the 200 backstroke , an event in which she 's the world-record holder and reigning Olympic champ . Franklin had no trouble prevailing as her time of 2:09.45 was a 1.53 seconds better than Karosas Tasija . <h> In Other Action ... <p> Triumphs in the 50 freestyle went to Bradley Tandy in 22.31 and Rebecca Millard in 25.39 .

That 's kinda strange ; we are used to seeing the Phelps of the mid-2000s swimming fast and destroying everyone untapered , then tapering and going faster and destroying everyone even more . <p> I 'm still putting my money on the GOAT . But it 's going to be a bit tricky navigating the double taper . Yes , that ' s my favorite topic to complain about . But here it is again . If there was just one taper to deal with , Phelps wins everything , . <p> As things are it 's going to be a bit more tricky . <p> On the flip side , a poorly trained Phelps managed to do decently in most events back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful ) .

 Olympic and World Championships medalist , Conor Dwyer has primarily lived in the shadows of his more well-known Team USA mates , notably Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte . But as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro approach , Dwyer is doing everything possible to take his profile to a higher level . <p> On the back of a clocking in the 200 freestyle from the opening night of action , Dwyer left Night Two of the USA Swimming Pro Series stop in Santa Clara with an extremely credible mark of 3:46.09 in the 400 freestyle . That time moved Dwyer to eighth in the world and set the stage for the veteran to race a pair of individual events in Rio . <p> Dwyer raced his eight laps mainly against the clock after China 's Sun Yang* scratched the final following a mark in the preliminaries . That time moved the reigning Olympic champion to No. 2 in the world rankings , behind only the 3:41.65 of Mack Horton . On Friday night , Sun clocked the fastest time in the world in the 200 free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Florida , Dwyer has been one of the United States ' most consistent performers , flourishing not only in the middle-distance freestyles , but also in the 200 individual medley . With his Santa Clara showings as support , Dwyer seems on track to be one of the stars of the Olympic Trials in Omaha , and then a medal contender in Rio . <p> Now training with Trojan Swim Club after stints with Gator and North Baltimore , Dwyer covered the first 100 in 54.53 and hit the 200-meter point in 1:51.55 . He was timed in at the 300 . Canadian Ryan Cochrane was the runnerup in . <h> Aussie Ladies Looking Dangerous With Rio In Sight <p> It was another strong night for the Australian women , who are clearly gearing up for big things in Rio .

Winning in 58.96 , Seebohm got the best of countrywoman Madison Wilson , who touched the wall in 59.87 . American Maya DiRado was next in 1:00.36 . Seebohm has been leaps ahead of the rest of the world since the 2014 campaign and heads to Rio as the top choice for gold in the 100 back . <p> Prior to Seebohm 's win , Groves picked up a dominant decision in the 200 fly , her winning time of 2:07.77 well ahead of the 2:10.38 by Ella Eastin . That event was followed by McKeon going 24.85 in the 50 free , .05 up in fellow Aussie Brittany Elmslie . The final Aussie triumph was claimed by Jessica Ashwood , whose places her sixth in the world rankings . <h> Josh Prenot Paces Another Big Night For Cal Guys <p> From the collegiate campaign to the Pro Series circuit , Josh Prenot has produced a sterling season , one not only grounded in quick times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California-Berkeley standout was on full display in Santa Clara , where Prenot put together his latest sub-2:10 performance in the 200 breaststroke , a 2:09.44 . <p> has managed five performances under 2:10 during the 2016 campaign , including a best of 2:08.58 as a guest at the Canadian Olympic Trials .

Adrian shaved a hundredth of a second off his season-best time in the 50 freestyle , going 21.68 to take sole possession of fourth in the world rankings . He was followed by former training partner Anthony Ervin , who is now working with David Marsh at SwimMac Carolina . Ervin checked in at 21.98 , followed by Australia 's ( 22.19 ) . <p> " It was a great swim , " Adrian said . " I take a lot of power in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Murphy just set meet records , so that 's exciting for us . We 're doing something right , so I 'm excited for Trials . " <p> For Murphy , he took advantage of an opportunity to race Aussie Mitch Larkin , the reigning world champion in the 100 backstroke and 200 backstroke . Not long after David Plummer went 52.40 at the Pro Series in Indianapolis , Murphy cranked out a 52.76 marker in the 100 back to top Larkin , who went 53.32 . Murphy 's Cal teammate , Jacob Pebley , went a career best of 53.57 for third . <p> There 's a chance Murphy and Larkin will see each other in Rio in a duel between two of the sport 's rising backstrokers . Larkin went 52.48 earlier this season and has the world record on his radar while Murphy has been 52.57 this year and boasts a best of 52.18 , which also puts him within striking distance of Aaron Peirsol 's world record of 51.94 . <p> " It was pretty good , " Murphy said . " Any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to up your game a little bit , so it was good to have him there . My adrenaline was a little higher tonight .

 backstroke scheduled for the final day of the Longhorn Aquatics Elite Invite , Matt Grevers had the chance to take a gauge of the event 's status heading into the United States Olympic Trials later this month in Omaha . He had the opportunity to digest the 52.40 of in Indianapolis and the 52.76 of Ryan Murphy in Santa Clara . On Sunday night , Grevers turned in his rebuttal at the Longhorn Aquatics Elite Invite . <p> Although the reigning Olympic champion did n't match the times produced by his countrymen , Grevers put together a sharp enough performance to verify he 'll be right in the mix when the bids to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are doled out . Grevers covered his two laps in 53.48 , not far off his season-best mark of 53.35 . <p> The silver medalist in the 100 back at the 2008 Games in Beijing , Grevers will be the most-decorated athlete to contest the event in Omaha .

Kraemer <p> A race before Grevers went to work , the other reigning Olympic champ in the 100 backstroke was in action as Missy Franklin picked up the victory in 1:00.50 . The triumph handed Franklin a sweep of the backstroke events and while the time was not spectacular , it 's key to note that Franklin has long been a swimmer who benefits massively from her taper . <p> The next three weeks leading into Omaha will be critical for Franklin and coach Todd Schmitz as the five-time Olympic medalist gets the rest necessary to excel against the deep fields present at Trials .

 A Glass To The White In The Gold Of An Olympic Dream Alive <p> Fine start for Elizabeth Beisel with the 400IM on day 1 of trials - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> With all the talk of supplements and much worse flying about in sport these days , refreshing to hear the effervescent Elizabeth Beisel talk about one of the legs on which the longevity of a world-class swimming career stand : milk . <p> You know the stuff , comes in cartons , bottles or , if you 're lucky enough , straight from Daisy . Along the lanes from where I write , the local dairy co-operative has just set up a village tap ( literally ) where folk can fill their own canisters with a product gone as local as you can get , complete with a note on how to heat it up for pasteurisation purposes , unless you like it neat . <p> It all reminded of the late comedienne Phyllis Diller , who once joked : " I asked the waiter ' is this milk fresh ? ' He said , ' Lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You half expect similar cracks from Beisel . She was 17 when we first met . Full of life , hope and drive . Talk to the 2011 World champion and 2012 Olympic silver medallist in the medley today and you hear a who has clearly matured but retains the same enthusiasm and balance of fun and focus as she did back down the trail of experience . <p> Next week , day 1 at USA Olympic Trials in Omaha will see her rise to her blocks for the medley . When she claimed silver at the London 2012 Olympic Games , her 4:31.27 was the fastest time ever witness by a woman in a textile suit , barring the controversy ahead of her ( take a deep breath ) in the form of 16-year-old Chinese schoolgirl Ye Shiwen , all but a bodylength back ( ) going into the turn to freestyle but up with Beisel just from the wall on freestyle and edging ahead half-way down the first freestyle lap on her way to a split that was as fast as five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including Beisel 's teammate at the Gators , Ryan Lochte on his way to the fastest time ever by a man in a textile suit ( breath out ) . <p> recalls London 2012 for what it brought her : <p> " I look back on London 2012 as the best time of my life : it was the best meet I ever had : I got two Olympic medals . I hope to repeat that in Rio . I 've set the bar high . " <p> Elizabeth Beisel by Peter Bick <p> Life is much the same now as then , too . A typical day in the life of ... well , for starters she goes for " ... we do doubles ... " . And do n't they know it , those Gators of Gainesville working under the guidance of Gregg Troy and team . <p> What a place .

Gazing down from the gallery the greats of yesteryear , Tracey Caulkins and Co , oversee the next wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavour in between the other work , study , play and rest of life . <p> Beisel breezes through it faster than she can rattle out a 200 medley : two-hour morning swim practice ; weight room ; light weights , dryland for 1 to 1 and a half hours ; home , relax , drink milk , eat , rest ; get set ; two more hours in water , then one a a half hours of conditioning work ranging through running , spinning , dashing up and down steps in the stadia nearby ; body weight work ; pull up and squats . <p> " It 's an intensive 6 to 7 hours but that 's something you know to expect when you 're going to the Gators .

The set , call it off set time X , had to be completed by the whole squad or the whole squad stayed in for more . Y 100s in and Lochte , who has plans for the down time of his day , notices that the bloke in the next lane is having a tough time making it . <p> Breath of fresh air ahead for Ryan Lochte photo : USA Swimming <p> In the few seconds left before go comes round again , he leans over the lane and says words to the effect of : " You screw this up for us and ...

There 's braun and brain with it , essential if you 're going to stick around as a contender as long as Beisel has and get up at the crack even when the pillow feels like the most appealing place on the planet . Says Beisel : <p> " Sure , it 's very difficult to be on it all the time . But I see it this way : if you 're doing something you really want to do and you 're fully invested , you 'll do it . If you 're faking it and lying to yourself , there 's no way you 're gon na get that longevity in the sport . Of course , there are many mornings when you think ' do I really have to go this morning ' but ... you 're investing in time well spent . " <p> Instead of swimming , she could be " in the real world doing a real job " . But Beisel had " developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it every single day . " The trick is to focus on what you can do when you can do it . There are days when the full-on hard set is just not going to happen , so " I focus on something every day , like walls , breathing , anything that I need to work on : find something to make you better than the day before . " <p> The club of class around her helps . " It is one of the most amazing environments to train in because we work so hard and its such a grinding program that it brings us together , it binds ... we would n't be able to train as hard if we were being negative about it and saying ' oh , poor little me ' . You ca n't look at it that way but see it as an opportunity to get better .

It is at times like these that she 's grateful " to have a team that is such a foundation for me that I 'm not concerned at all ... my body needs rest but I 've worked so hard throughout the year that I know I 'm gon na be fine . " <p> Helpful to move in numbers come crunch ? <p> " Oh , for sure . I am somebody who needs to be surrounded by people who do the same thing , take the same approach . I like having a great team pushing me and that makes it all so much easier when you 're having a hard day . To have someone like Ryan in the next lane saying ' come on , you can do this , you can get through this , come on ; holding you accountable .

China approached the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games with a double-digit ( 1996 ) and then 40-plus doping count to its name swimming alone but was allowedly the IOC and FINA to continue to compete . . <p> WADA welcomed the vote , president Sir Craig Reedie saying that " there is serious need for culture change in Russia within government and among sports leaders , athletes and athlete support personnel " . <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday in Lausanne a meeting of IOC leaders , international sports federations and national Olympic and anti-doping bodies will consider " whether and if individual athletes should be given individual justice " . The IOC executive board will meet over the weekend before the summit . <p> Among the things they will need to take into account : <p> Head of the WADA Commission Prof. Richard McLaren says that Russia 's Sports Ministry told the WADA-accredited laboratory in Moscow " to not report positive sample results over the period before , during and after " the 2013 world track and field championships . <p> Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko , a member of FIFA 's ruling council , has repeatedly denied allegations of a state-sponsored doping program . However , McLaren , a Canadian law professor , says he shared " credible and verifiable " evidence from his investigation with an IAAF task force . WADA appointed McLaren last month to try to verify allegations by former Moscow lab director . <p> McLaren says he intends to release his " findings in mid-July " , three weeks out from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media outlet speculated that the International Olympic Committee has struck a deal with the Russian political regime that leaves all over sports in the race at Rio 2016 in return for track and field the sport with the overwhelming majority of big-name doping cases and allegations running alongside those -- accepting that it has no place at the Games this year and must do much more doc lean up its act at home . <p> It was November last year when the IAAF voted to ban Russian athletics from international competition pending inquiries and clean-up . <h> The Ins &amp; Outs Still To Come <p> Sebastian Coe , the president of the IAAF , said : " In a system that has so badly failed the athletes in Russia that it is extremely difficult to define ... whether athletes " are in a secure environment . Against that backdrop , the budget Russia paid for a US PR firm to lead its campaign has not , at this stage at least , paid no dividend . <p> Russian athletes are to be heard today threatening to take the IAAF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to court , while some even went as far as to say it was all WADA 's fault for " destroying world sport " , in the worlds of one former triathlete . <p> John Coates , the Australian IOC member and president of the Court of Arbitration for Sport , another of many duel hats that critics point at and claim ' conflict of interest ' , told media today that he believed challenges to the IAAF decision would indeed follow . He added : <p> " We will look at the next step for us . The debate next Tuesday will be on the issue of individual justice and rights . I 'm president of Cas , I would think there would be appeal opportunities , I would imagine for someone who can establish their individual integrity . <p> " It may be that our meeting next week will set some guidelines for the international federations who again would have the task of deciding if there 's any individual within a federation that they 've put out who ought to be allowed in , what hurdles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they 'd have to establish they were regularly tested outside of Russia by an anti-doping authority and the samples were analysed outside of Russia on an regular basis . " <p> The Russian sports ministry , meanwhile , said that it was " extremely disappointed " over the decision noting that its lobbying would continue : <p> " We now appeal to the members of the International Olympic Committee to not only consider the impact that our athletes ' exclusion will have on their dreams and the people of Russia , but also that the Olympics themselves will be diminished by their absence . " <p> Questions that will follow any CAS decision to split the dopers from the non-dopers may well focus on the very evidence that suggests there is no way of really telling . <p> The sophistication of Russia 's doping operation , say whistleblowers , has been vastly successful in getting cheats first past the post and undetected , partly through surreptitious swapping of ' adverse ' urine samples or imbibing drugs with alcohol to minimize the period in which they can be detected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It <p> Self-pity and propoganda is a part of the mix when it comes to the coverage in Russia today . The " Championship " website has deputy chief editor Eugene Slyusarenko declaring that in Vienna this evening Russia will be told that " our athletes will not be able to participate in the Olympic Games of 2016 " . <p> The decision , he adds , will make Russian athletes " the biggest victims of bias in the history of world sports " . <p> Two of the first casualties of the WADA IC report : Lamine Diack , left , and Grigory Rodchenkov <p> There is no suggestion from the site that the rest of the world are the biggest victims Russia 's massive and systematic doping and related corruption as alleged in findings in investigations by ARD television in Germany , other media , the WADA Commission , police authorities and the Russians who have served a whistleblowers to all of that . <p> Former Moscow lab chief Grigory Rodchenko , one of the figures at the centre of allegations in swimming today , last week alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Sochi Winter Olympics in which samples were switched through a hole in the wall at the testing laboratory right under the noses of international observers . Rodchenko has made allegations that suggest the doping issue stretches from the locker room to the corridors of political power in Russia . <p> The Championship website basis its view on allegations made by an expert cited as saying that " in the amateur Olympic doping control is virtually absent ... and swimming has still not introduced biometric passports blood " . <p> Questions sent to FINA on the latter and the allegations that chiefs offered to remove swimmers from the testing pool of athletes in return for an anual fee have elicited no reply , even though the international issued a statement to say it took the allegations " seriously " and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence . <p> For the starting place for such investigations , FINA need turn to left and right , to what it calls the FINA Family . It need not dig deep , the top table of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered up and the fight the Russian federation has had when it came to keeping doping rogues from the door . <h> Lord Coe 's IAAF presidency questioned <p> Seb Coe , snapped by a colleague as he digests the report that rocked the IAAF last year <p> Jesse Norman , chairman of the culture , media and sport select committee and a Tory MP in Britain , said the " jury is out " on whether Lord Coe can survive after allegations that he misled Parliament when asked about what he knew of Russian doping and what he knew about allegations of corruption levelled at the son of the then president of the IAAF , Lamine Diack . <p> Coe , who won Olympic gold in 1980 and 1984 , denies any wrongdoing . <p> The BBC 's Panorama programme claimed Coe was aware of details of a Russian doping corruption case four months before it became public and may have misled MPs at a Culture , Media and Sport committee meeting last year . <p> Norman told the BBC radio 4 Today news program : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have Lord Coe back in front of the committee , I do n't want to get too far ahead of where the committee is going to be , but these are very serious matters . <p> " I think when Lord Coe appeared in front of the committee in December his answers were very general ones in many ways , specifically on this issue to my colleague Ian Lucas a Labour MP , and the idea he received this email and , as I understand from his account , not have opened it , having been associated with the IAAF in a senior position at that point for six years , and aware of the possibility of individual cases of dishonesty and corruption , is very , very disturbing . " <p> Lord Coe , 59 , became president of the International Association of Athletics Federations in August last year , succeeding Senegal 's Lamine Diack . It is Coe 's relationship with 's son , Papa Massata Diack , now wanted by Interpol , that is in focus . Panorama suggests that Diack Jr secured votes for Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IAAF . <p> Diack Jr. : And leave the doping platform ! ! It is a bad mantra for your campaigning . <p> Coe : Will do . <p> Coe is the man now in charge of the clean up of track and field , while Jr is sought by interpol <p> Diack Jr was banned from athletics for life for inflicting " unprecedented damage " on the sport following a 20-month investigation into corruption , blackmail and extortion at the highest levels last year . <p> An independent ethics commission , chaired by Michael Beloff QC , also banned Gabriel Doll ? , the former head of the International Association of Athletics Federations ' anti-doping unit , for five years in a damning 170-page report . <h> Comments <p> Craig , Is this the first time that a sports federation from a single country is banned at the Olympics for doping crisis ? <p> Craig Lord June 17 , 2016 <p> Yes , it is , asf , good call added a line plus a list of nations banned before ( for other reasons ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IOC suspension again for " undue government interference " in its national Olympic committee . Given that in many other countries , the government and committee are one and the same , it 's either a really bad situation or an attempt by the IOC to set an example of a country that is n't too important to them . <p> Kuwait 's athletes that have already qualified for Rio- largely fencers and marksmen- are invited to compete under the Olympic flag , but there are rumbling that they and their families will face sanction back home if they do that . <h> Orlando gunman had 
 's conclusion to his appeal for an end to what might be described as the hypocrisy of blazers and the start of common sense in New Zealand has any chance of becoming fact , we must wait and see . <p> When the Australian open water ace appealed for social-media support on his Facebook page for fellow competitor Kane Radford , of New Zealand , he closes his note with this : " ... there is an opportunity for an appeal to get the decision overturned ! Do n't worry mate , you 'll be in Rio ! " <p> The appeal is in the wings after Radford met the qualification criteria to race in the Rio 2016 Olympic marathon but was told by the Kiwi federation : we 're not confident that you 'd be a top 16 finisher so we 're not going to give you the chance to prove yourself . The chances of him being in Rio are slimmer than the likelihood of an appeal . <p> Let 's be clear : it is up to every nation to select their squads for the Olympic Games and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand has a right to do what the swimming federation has dictated . Whether that makes it right , wrong or places it in the realm of ' one of those deeply uncomfortable places in which the athlete gets told ' no go ' when the number of blazers from the same country may well stretch to indecent in measure depends on your point of view . <p> Can Radford win the Olympic crown ? Probably not but stranger things have happened . Can Radford finish top 16 in Rio ? Well , yes , previous form suggests that he has that in him . <p> Radford , of Rotorua , has pipped the likes of Poort and others at times in a sport in which the ebb and flow of result can depend on the environment , the condition in which the swimmers swim , including chop or mill pond , warm water , cold water , cool air or blazing sun on back , salt and spray , the clap and knock of hand , arm , elbow and the kick of foot and knee all a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming but very different indeed in many decisive respects . <p> The international selection criteria set by is not to everyone 's taste , some of the best in the world often left at home , both in pool , with its rule , open water this time round , and other sports , too . But Radford followed the rules and the qualification criteria laid down by the IOC and FINA and emerged a winner as far as eligibility for a ticket to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games goes . <p> Setubal , Portugal , last weekend , is when he qualified and this is where he fit in that race : the pace of the Olympic champion , Oussama Mellouli : ; away ; Radford 19th in . The gap between and and Radford over is the equivalent of about per in a pool race . Gosh , well , better clear the way , then , for a event in Rio that goes with just Cameron McEvoy , the others so far off the pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , perhaps not . It is not gold Radford must be in line for to get the ticket . The federation explained : " New Zealanders Kane Radford , Phillip Ryan and Charlotte Webby finished 19th , 34th and 31st respectively to miss out on direct qualification . FINA , the world 's ruling body , offer one additional quota place for the leading swimmer from each of the five global regions the Americas , Africa , Europe , Asia and Oceania representing nations not already qualified . With Australia qualified , New Zealand was the next highest nation from Oceania competing in Portugal , with Radford and Webby therefore earning an invitation spot for New Zealand . <p> " However the selectors were not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence that either of the swimmers is capable of achieving the published nomination criteria which is that an individual swimmer must be capable of achieving a top 16 placing at the Games with the potential to win an Olympic Diploma ( top eight placing ) . " <p> In a race of 25 , top 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulted Auckland barrister John Munro , a former New Zealand swimmer . Munro told the Rotorua Daily Post : <p> " We are considering an appeal at the moment . It has all happened very fast . There are good grounds to appeal and it will not be a long process whatever the outcome . " <p> If the appeal goes ahead , Radford 's chance rests on that view of whether he is capable of finishing top 16 in a race of 25 in Rio . The judges might also take into account the hypocrisy of a system that demands its swimmers make top 16 in the world at a time when : <p> the number one aquatic asset in New Zealand ( among others on the national team ) trains abroad having complained of the lack of support , coaching , facilities and a failure of the system to provide her with what she feels she needs <p> the swim federation sends blazers out into the world with a ticket to the gravy train of sporting governance , hotels , flights , food and more all paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any evidence that they are among the best 16 in the world at what they do but insists ( pray tell us that not a single Swimming New Zealand official who does not have a direct job as a time-keeper or other real function meetings do n't count in my book ; I 've been there and for the most part if is not work and in some cases is n't even honest work will be in Rio swanning around while Radford is left at home ) . <p> FINIS back Radford . What is the argument for New Zealand claiming it did all it could for the swimmer to make sure he was top 16 in the world ? Where does the federation 's responsibility behind and end as a body backed by the taxpayer ? <p> How does NZL justify having several swimmers on its pool team that are ranked well beyond the top 20 in the world , 2 per nation and well beyond off the pace of the reigning Olympic champion per 100 , while saying a man who need finish top 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Does New Zealand disagree with the continental allocation system of selection and if so , did it speak up against or vote against that policy at FINA and IOC levels ? <p> Does New Zealand agree with the continental allocation system ? If it does , then why would it want to deny Radford a ticket earned under that policy ( or why would it agree with a policy it never intended to adhere to or exercise itself ) ? <p> Munro will give Radford advice in the coming week and an appeal may well become a part of this story . Meanwhile , here is the view of a fellow competitor , Poort , and his appeal for Radford to be able to take up the ticket the IOC and FINA have granted him to Rio under the selection criteria agreed by a committee that includes John West as New Zealand 's Open water representative . West is a New Zealand selector : did he back the international selection policy ; did he speak out against it ? Legion are the examples of conflict of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane 's the one on the left and he like myself qualified fair and square last week in Portugal Jarrod Poort stands by his fellow marathon swimmer Poort , Facebook <p> Woke up this morning to some news that I ca n't really get my head around , it 's seriously beyond craziness . <p> My good mate and close competitor who I have had many good races with , The man from across the ditch , Kane Radford ( also goes by many nick names ) has been unrightfully not been nominated to be selected on the NZ Olympic Team . Really feeling for him , he 's probably one of the most passionate blokes around when it comes to representing his county and has worked so hard to fulfil his dream . <p> Kane 's the one on the left and he like myself qualified fair and square last week in Portugal . Kane finished 30 seconds behind a podium position in a field that contained the previous Olympic champion . Not bad aye . <p> Not good enough but apparently , according to NZ swimming .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rio is because they consider him to not be competitive enough .. You are kidding ! Over behind the previous Olympic champ not competitive ? I 've raced Kane many times and he 's always been competitive , I 've been beaten by Kane many times and had some epic battles with him ! So for them to say that you would n't be competitive is bullshit man , myself and many of your other competitors know your fricken more than competitive ! <p> After finishing our race in Portugal just last week , we got given trophies that said we had qualified and would be Olympic swimmers , I shared a special moment with Kane as we both looked at them and realised we would be off to rio together after racing against each other for many years we would get to do it at the biggest of dances ! We were buzzing . <p> So to hear this today sucks , and to make things worse this happened to Kane in 2012 where he qualified and was again deemed not competitive , and they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he keep pushing and aimed for rio , If that 's not one of the biggest displays of resilience and passion you have ever seen then what is ! To stay in the sport and keep killing it ; paying to go everywhere yourself representing your country doing the sport you love , inspiring man , they could make a good movie just about with a story like yours . Pity about your head but ... <p> Let 's share Kane 's story and get some attention building around it , there is an opportunity for an appeal to get the decision overturned ! Do n't worry mate , you 'll be in Rio ! <h> Related Articles <h> Comments <p> June 19 , 2016 <p> If only FINA let the next fastest swimmer period to represent their continent , and not the next fastest swimmer from a country that has no qualifier , then Australia and New Zealand ( in this case , but maybe also any other countries ) may have had different criteria as well . <p> Craig Lord June 19 , 2016 <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pose the questions as to where NZL stands on those policies its representatives have been in a position to back or oppose , asf . <p> June 19 , 2016 <p> Yes , the answer would be illuminating . If NZ reps backed the current qualification criteria when it was still in discussion and/or being proposed , then it just does n't make sense if NZ Swimming refuses to send swimmer on continental ticket . But probably it 's NZ Olympics committee that has they say who to send . <p> June 19 , 2016 <p> Sorry but I dissent on this one ! Whilst I have empathy for Radford , the fact is that his quota is a " roll-down " rather than a direct entry one . <p> When your NOC has taken an increasingly " hard ball " approach over the past decade or so like NZ , continental " roll-downs " rather than direct entry quotas are going to be seen as discretionary calls .... and highly uncertain ground for any competitor or team . <p> Arguably , a number of the NZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they DID tick off the first hurdle ; that of the FINA A times for a direct quota . <p> The NZ Swimming document is actually a poorly worded document with regards to the open water segment ; merely stating " performance and results at the marathon swimming nomination event " which was stated as the FINA Olympic Marathon Swim Qualifier 2016 ( June 11th and 12th 2016 ) . <p> If we are to use FINA 's own documents ; their parameters for open water are : <p> 2015 FINA World Championships : The ten ( 10 ) best ranked athletes from the event will directly qualify . <p> FINA Olympic Marathon Swim Qualifier 2016 : The nine ( 9 ) best ranked athletes will directly qualify . Only that have no swimmer qualified through the 2015 FINA World Championships may elect to send a maximum of two ( 2 ) athletes per event to the FINA Olympic Marathon Swim Qualifier 2016 . Each can qualify a maximum of one ( 1 ) athlete per gender . <p> Continental Representation The best ranked athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet qualified , from each of five ( 5 ) Continents will directly qualify . Should an have previously qualified one ( 1 ) or two ( 2 ) swimmers , the next best ranked athlete from the same continent , not yet qualified , in the ranking of the FINA Olympic Marathon Swim Qualifier 2016 event will qualify to ensure that each of these competitions yields a competitor . <p> Did ANY NZ open water competitor meet ANY of these parameters for a direct quota ? No , they did not ! They did not make the cut-off at 2015 Worlds . Nor did they make top 10 at last week 's Open Water Qualifier ? Were they the fastest even from Oceania .... no , they were behind Australians . Rather , they have received a " roll-down " on the grounds that they allocate a final additional spot to each continent . <p> 's line , like that of many nations with finite resources , is increasingly one of a smaller and much leaner team . Even in their power house sports of rowing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all boats but rather concentrate on ones with a track record of performance . Continental " roll-down " are increasingly NOT making the cut and the relative sporting bodies are guided by that . <p> Does open water get the rough end of the stick amongst the NZ swimming fraternity .... arguably yes . Is NZ Swimming inefficient and dysfunctional ; again strong evidence for the affirmative but these are not the point . <p> Radford 's performance on the day that mattered for selection was insufficient to place him in a position to " tick the requisite boxes " for a direct quota . By being the recipient of a continental " roll-down " , his position was far less secure than those pool swimmers who at least ticked the FINA A box . <p> its very nice of Mr Poort to stick up for his mate but as the recipient of " charity " at the last Olympics ; his performance in the 1500 was a veritable poster case for NOT doing so in future . <p> TBH , all the talk of " Olympic spirit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes that competition is conducted fairly and in the right manner but the days of amateurism are long over and top level international sport is very much a business .... and a very unsentimental one at that . <p> Yes , Mr Radford has the right to appeal and the of the NZ selection document may be his best grounds but the fact that he did not obtain a DIRECT quota may be the point on which this all hinges <p> June 19 , 2016 <p> Whilst there can most certainly be some painful individual " victims " of the NZOC approach ; as Mr Radford arguably may be ; their overall approach " works for them " and they are n't  likely to change what is proving successful . <p> Take London as a case in point ; they send an overall team of 184 competitors and fly home with 6 gold 2 silver and 5 bronze . Compare this to their neighbours across the ditch who send a behemoth of 410 for the return of 8 gold 15 silver &amp; 12 bronze . Even at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 184 ( NZL ) &amp; 379 ( AUS ) <p> Granted , AUS has a larger population and a larger economy and therefore will always be a somewhat larger team but there is an awful lot of " inflation " in those numbers with a number of sports there on continental basis rather than world ranking . <p> The following may not go down well but comparing the actual medal prospects of the two countries ; the prospective Rio gold medals for NZL look distinctly securer than the bulk of AUS 's . Should AUS Swimming not fire up or provide at least 5 golds , then AUS may very well be looking at a repeat of 1984 . <p> Given that the public funding for sport in AUS is likely to contract immensely no matter which party wins the upcoming federal election ; its more than likely that AUS will be increasingly mirroring the NZL approach . Rio will most likely to be the last of the 400+ teams .. think more low 300s at best in future <p> Craig Lord June 19 , 2016 <p> CW under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he qualified . My question is clear : did NZL reps argue against that criteria or agree with it or say sod all . I think you get my point . ( The arguments as to whether a swimmer can make a 16 , a medal or have the remotest chance of getting past a heat are manyfold given that nations set their own criteria beyond the into criteria and NZL is entitled to set its own policy , as I point out ... my questions are aimed at those who now stop a swimmer who has been given a ticket to the Olympics fair and square under the criteria but his home nation is saying that he can not take up that ticket ... at which point , legitimate questions arise as to where NZL stands on the policies that granted the swimmer that ticket in the first place in a system that automatically cuts out swimmers with a greater claim that some who will be racing in Rio ( swimmers who will not get to go to Rio regardless of whether NZL send Kane or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig 's ear . <p> June 19 , 2016 <p> Craig , whilst that 's a fine MORAL argument ( which I have no issue with ) ; the issue for Radford is whether his LEGAL case is sustainable or not . <p> The base FINA document itself differentiates between " direct entry " and continental representation and it is the latter category into which Radford fell . <p> NZ based their policy on the swimmer firstly meeting a performance benchmark with the top 16 piece being a further " potential " benchmark . <p> The NZ document IS a shoddy and somewhat evasive document and it will be the issue that the performance benchmark for open water was NOT directly specific ( did not specify a placing ) which will be the issue upon which his case is likely to hinge . <p> NZ Swimming DO deserve a good slap-down for having such an inadequately clear policy ( and NZOC indirectly for not ensuring greater clarity ) but had Radford CLEARLY met the FINA benchmarks for DIRECT entry , he would not have been in this position and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 , 2016 <p> Thank you Mr Lord for featuring Jarrod 's FB post . Sometimes when batting around opinions and commentary from the safety of our keyboard we forget the rawness that has been evoked in Jarrod 's post of a mate , for a mate , regardless of nationality , and their pursuit of extraordinary goals . <p> I know we have debated in an earlier article the merits or not of the FINA qualification system or the Olympic ideals , and could go on here , ad nausem . But that is best in a pub over a pint , rather than repetition here . <p> Whether we agree with the system or not , Radford was given the FINA nod " fair and square " . Yes , most certainly , it would have been easier if he qualified as Poort did through an automatic place , no question . But I have no doubt that had Poort only earned his place through a continental nod that Swimming Australia would have taken it , because their selection criteria specifically anticipated that possibility and therefore would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is then , did SNZ anticipate the possibility of a continental place ? Most certainly they did , because their selection criteria was , in my opinion , deliberately vague and woolly . I do not believe that this time around ( as opposed to 2012 when the possibility of a continental place was specifically excluded by stating direct qualification only ) they would have precluded an invitation outright , otherwise they would have stated it . <p> Therefore , we are then left with the messy business of applying the overriding selection criteria ( which theoretically applies for both Pool and Open Water in SNZ selection policy ) of potential " top 16 " capable . Much easier in Pool swimming as the subjectivity is taken out of the hands of Selectors by FINA publishing FINA ' A ' standards ( which they have only used since 2008 , previously they allowed ' B ' times ) , so do the time , get the place . <p> But how do you apply " top 16 " criteria and mindset to an event like Open Water that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so rightly point out is subject to the " ebb and flow " of so many factors . The only thing Pool and Open Water have in common is they occur in water . As I have stated in an earlier post , in Open Water race are meaningless , particularly when the top elite swimmers only compete en masse at FINA World Champs every 2 years . This makes it impossible to create any credible ranking system , unlike triathlon and the ITU series where the top elite triathletes compete each year over a series of events resulting in much more meaningful data . In Open Water a much better analysis of the competitiveness of a swimmer would be to look at the time differentials , for example , of the winner and everyone else , the leading pack , the split times , etc . How would you compare Radford 's podium finish at Pan Pacs in 2014 , with a poor finish at Kazan , to arguably a very good race in Portugal ? Frankly , despite what a 19th place would suggest in Portugal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 34 secs off the winner , 28 secs off the Olympic champion , 20 secs off an automatic spot . Top 16 capable ? Most certainly . <p> But here is the rub applying the overriding criteria of " top 16 " capable to Open Water only you can not avoid the obvious disparity that exists . Currently , according to FINA rankings of 2 per nation , going into Rio , NZL Pool swimmers have rankings of : B. Ashbee 200IM ( 20th ) ; M. Stanley 200Fr ( 30th ) , 400Fr ( 28th ) ; M. Hutchins 400Fr ( 34th ) ; C. Main 100Bk ( 27th ) ; G. Snyders 100Br ( 15th ) ; L. Boyle 400Fr ( 19th ) , ( 10th ) ; E. Robinson ( 20th ) ; H. Glasson ( 25th ) . Do the Pool swimmers deserve to be in Rio ? Of course they do and no-one is suggesting that they should n't go . They have achieved the FINA ' A ' time " fair and square " . But if applying the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis , most of the Pool swimmers claim to a Rio place would be no more deserving than Radford 's . <p> June 20 , 2016 <p> Someone has posted elsewhere the following ( with my edits ) : <p> " Kane has swum against and beaten ... the following top swimmers in major races during the last two years : <p> Speaking of the FINA gravy train . Did you realise that John West , one of two NZL officials out on the boats in Portugal , is also one of the SNZ Selectors ? Um , conflict of interest anyone ? There is no way he should be active in both roles . <p> June 20 , 2016 <p> Very rarely do you get to say that a swimmer would have been better off if they 'd been competing under a South African passport , and that seems to be the case with Radford here . <p> Craig Lord June 20 , 2016 <p> No , indeed not <p> James T June 20 , 2016 <p> Craig , as always you are right on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Kiwis come out to play . <p> May I add to the debate ( it was going to be a little , but in the end it is a lot . ) <p> First , the issue of the selection polices of the NZOC are a complete red-herring in this discussion as the issue of open water selection post Portugal did not even get to the NZOC . It stopped at the doors of the swimming federation and its appointed selectors . <p> It is well known that NZL has a rigorous overall Olympic selection standard which is intended to focus scarce resource toward where the greatest returns on investment are possible . Every Olympic cycle there are always examples of athletes on the fringe who either make it or not . This issue about Radford and Webby is not there yet . Any debate relating to the merits of that policy should be reserved for a forum that has its focus on National Olympic Committee policy and strategy . By all means debate the relative merits of bloated teams and medal returns or skinny teams and bang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this issue should be about yet . Unless I am mistaken is primarily a forum for swimming issues and this is a swimming issue because , and this is important it relates to how a swimming federation is dealing with selection issues before it has even got to the Olympic Committee . It is also about a pattern of behaviour that the same federation has displayed over time and as it relates to similar issues . <p> Also , thank you for raising and linking in your article the subject of FINA and those who swill at the great trough . I may comment on that further subsequently because there are important threads in that one too . <p> The important issue to me with this case is here there is a pre-published standard ( as others note , possibly poorly and ambiguously drafted ) which was materially and almost certainly intentionally different to that which was applied for 2012 qualification where acceptance of an open water continental place then was specifically precluded . 2016 was different , not only was the exclusion of the continental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this draughting was to deliberately allow consideration of a possible continental acceptance . The athletes now involved , rightly or wrongly swam in Portugal in the knowledge that acceptance of a continental place was possible . <p> We then go to the issue of top 16 and examination of evidence that an athlete to be selected is top 16 capable . That of course aligns with the NZOC criteria for Olympic selection . The issue with this provision and key to the treatment of both Radford and Webby is that the top 16 criteria has been applied selectively in their case and not with equality to pool selection and by the exact same panel of selectors . <p> Now I hear the argument from all sorts of " lawyers " and " bush lawyers " alike that the FINA A standard in the pool is top 16 -- well that thought process was possible back when the new FINA policy for Olympic space allocation was adopted for 2012 and that is what the NZOC accepted as a selection criteria from the subject matter experts ie the SNZ selectors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable . It was therefore accepted in advance for 2012 that FINA A meant top 16 . As it proved then , we learned that for most pool events that it was only an approximation with most events qualifying significantly more than 16 athletes under FINA A ( 2 per nation ) . Now onto 2016 where the same subject matter experts ( SNZ selectors ) manage to convince the that FINA A again means top 16 . To accept that premise for 2016 , based on 2012 experience was either wilfully dishonest or negligent or reflects a pragmatic approach by the NZOC . Either way to validate the top 16 facade , SNZ disingenuously set one of the earliest qualification cycles for Olympic selection and sure enough , at that point they can say to the that all selected athletes are top 16 capable -- look at their current world rankings , of course they must be . Well as all our " West Island " friends know , most major countries ( and minor ones too ) had hardly swum when NZL named their pool team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified athletes all ( excepting for two ) now rank outside of the top 16 and in some cases ' well outside ' top 16 . <p> Now let me be clear , I support rigorous selection criteria for the Olympics , as the great All Black captain once said , ' it 's not tiddlywinks ' . I also accept that it is reasonable to establish the FINA A standard as an absolute selection standard as it is calculated based around top 16 performances over previous cycles . That is all fair enough . What is not fair enough though is to then apply a different standard under the same provisions to a related but different discipline . This reflects a possible bias which in itself is an established ground for appeal under the NZOC participation agreement as it relates to team selection . <p> We might well ask could there be a bias on the part of such worthy subject matter experts toward one discipline or group of athletes as opposed to another ? <p> That is an excellent question to consider with some possible answers . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pool trials and an almost pathological need by the institution to prove to the public that they are spending tax payer money wisely and " have n't we done a fine job with all the money invested in us " ( ask Lauren Boyle if they have spent the money she single handedly earned the sport during this cycle wisely and in the areas where best return was likely ) and the almost total news blackout and PR mileage available through open water . Especially when the tax paying public comes to a realisation that next to none of the money invested on their behalf in SNZ has trickled down to this part of the sport . Maybe it also runs deeper maybe it was reflected in a failure to even acknowledge open water swimmers ( Radford et al ) when the team for Pan Pacs was publicly announced in 2014 and being called on the matter maybe it relates to the involvement of members of the present selection panel in various roles within the organisation on previous occasions when there has been conflict with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the institution was reprimanded for their selection failures . Maybe there are all sorts of other reasons known only to the selectors . Maybe , just maybe , their research was so diligent that they were able to establish that Kane Radford has never bettered any of the swimmers who qualified ahead of him and based on that research there was no realistic prospect of a top 16 place and maybe they had undertaken similar research on the pool swimmers that suggests they have a realistic prospect based on proven performance of being capable of improving their rankings to better those swimmers ranked ahead -- unlikely though because my research as simple as it is tells me a different story . <p> What then to conclude from this long post ( sorry , Craig ) there is more than a small bad smell coming from the SNZ cupboard it 's just that we have become so used to it that we accept it as normal . There is inconsistency in the application of selection policy between pool and open water that much is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not be sure but if I were the athlete the possible evidence of bias would leave me feeling very angry . I am not the athlete and I am angry I can only begin to think of how they feel . <p> Craig Lord June 20 , 2016 <p> Thanks James T ( no need to apologise -- you make lots of very valid points 
 In To " Prevent Violation of the Olympic Charter " . No , Its Not April 1 <p> Is Russia ready to chink glasses with the IOC oct more . Not a hope suggests the ARD film All images are stills from " Red Herrings " <p> Editorial <p> Alexander Zhukov , the head of Russia 's Olympic Committee , says his country will appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport against a blanket ban on Russian athletes . <p> In a statement to the IOC at its summit in Lausanne , the Russian member said that an appeal would represent athletes " who have never violated anti-doping rules " . <p> As the IOC confirmed that the IAAF ban on Russia athletes would stay in place , while leaving a small window open for some track and field representation , Zhukov appealed for fairness to " prevent the violation of the Olympic Charter . " <p> He appears not to have highlighted the very many athletes , coaches , doctors and politicians in Russia who have been spending their time violating the Olympic Charter and bringing shame on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> IOC president Thomas Bach has convened a special Olympic summit to take stock of the IAAF 's decision to maintain its ban on Russia for the Games and to take additional steps to ensure a " level playing field " for all athletes in Rio . He opened the summit of 20 sports leaders by saying : <p> " We want to co-ordinate our efforts to protect the clean athletes and strengthen the fight against doping , particularly in light of the upcoming Rio Games We will have some interesting debate . " <p> Seb Coe , snapped by a colleague as he digests the WADA Commission report <p> IAAF president Sebastian Coe was among those attending , along with Zhukov . Going into the meeting , U.S. Olympic Committee president Larry Probst told AP : " I hope all the constituents take this very seriously and move forward pro-actively and aggressively to eliminate the doping problem in the Olympic movement . " <p> On Saturday the IOC said that it " fully respects " the decision of the IAAF to maintain the ban on Russia . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Rio stadium come August . <p> The leaders are discussing guidelines for any process that would allow " a small group of Russian athletes who live and undergo rigorous drug-testing outside the country " to apply to compete as " neutral " athletes in Rio , potentially under the Olympic Flag . <p> Those who may end up doing so could find themselves teammates and fellow competitiors of : <p> the refugee athletes team <p> Russian whistleblower Yulia Stepanova , who one tested positve for blood doping but has since helped expose systematic cheating in Russia . The IAAF has now given her dispensation to apply to compete as an independent athlete for her " extraordinary contribution to the fight against doping " . <p> Yuliya Efimova and Natalia Lovtsova , two Russian swimmers nominated to the team for Rio 2016 who might race under the Russian flag despite the fact that both have tested for banned substances on more than one occasion and for different substances . The meldonium case of Efimova , banned for a 2013 DHEA positive , is pending . <p> Ann Antseliovich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mutko , the Russian Sports Minister himself accused of having played a role in covering up doping positives and a man who on Sunday called for the IAAF to be disbanded , said that would be " absurd " if Stepanova got to compete in Rio . <p> " Far less absurd than Efimova getting to race , " said one leading light in swimming who preferred not to be named . <p> An AP news file reads : " It is unlikely the IOC would allow an admitted doper to compete under the Olympic flag , so another solution would have to be found . " <p> Perhaps but perhaps not given that the Games will be awash with retuned dopers . Kenya is among WADA non-compliant nations , WADA has begin investigations into swimming in China and Russia ( facing probing questions in the weeks ahead ) , while weightlifting accounts for 20 of the 55 adverse findings from the IOC 's retesting of samples from the 2008 and 2012 Olympic Games . Russian athletes including 16 from track and field have provided 22 of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is due to report on the findings of inquiries into events at the Sochi Winter Olympics after Moscow 's former drug laboratory chief , Grigory Rodchenkov , alleged that he was involved in a state-backed conspiracy to dope Russian athletes and then switch their ' tainted ' samples for ' clean ' ones through a hole in the lab wall to a secret lab beyond . <p> McLaren , the Canadian lawyer heading the independent probe , has said that his preliminary findings backed the allegations . <p> If the final verdict on July 15 matches the allegations then Russian swimming which organised the 2015 World Championships that used the same system of testing for the event in Kazan as Sochi used for the Winter Games , complete with international observation on both occasions and other sports in the country could also find themselves locked out of Rio . That potential move was decsribed as the " nuclear option " by former WADA president Dick Pound . <p> The ARD Sportschau added to its library of evidence on Russian doping a week before the vote that barred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia 's parliament has mentioned the Spanish Inquisition in a warning to the IOC not to inflict " collective punishment " on Russian athletes . <p> The Russian State Duma said in a statement today that such a ban would " breed divisions and suspicion among the athletes from different nations " . <p> That division and suspicion has been very much a part of world sport for a very long time , dating back to the days of the GDR and the Soviet Union . No IOC decision required to sew the seeds of doubt over athletic performance . The Duma statement said a ban would represent " collective punishment " used by the Spanish Inquisition and totalitarian regimes . <p> The Duma does not say whether it believed the Soviet Union to have been one of those but does say that it counts on the IOC to make an " objective decision " that " will not put into question the ideals and goals of the Olympic movement . " <p> Those ideals and goals have been most sorely tested by Russian cheating of late , the response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Did drilling holes in walls so that anti-doping test samples could be switched with other samples in a secret faculity behind a wall with the help of special forces so that could not be detected at the Sochi Winter Olympics " question the ideals and goals of the Olympic movement " ?

 goodbye to racing for just over a year when after testing positive ... and that would not be the end of it - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The International Olympic Committee summit into the Russian doping crisis and its implications has concluded that athletes from Kenya and Russia , in all sports , will only be able to compete at the Rio Olympics if they have passed an " individual evaluation " to prove they have not been doping . <p> If that turns out to be so , then Yuliya , the world 100m breaststroke champion , today took a stroke closer to being locked out of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games depending on the eventual deliberation by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) on meldonium cases . <p> IOC president Thomas Bach said at the summit in Lausanne that athletes from Russia and Kenya , nations that are both non-compliant with the WADA Code , will only be eligible for Rio if they have been individually evaluated by their international federations . <p> " The conclusion of the summit was that this non-compliance declaration , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubts on the presumption of innocence for athletes coming from these two countries , " said Bach . <p> " Therefore , each athlete coming from these two countries will have to be declared eligible by their respective international federation following an individual procedure and evaluation of the situation . And in this individual evaluation , tests from laboratories that are tainted or non-compliant , can not be taken into consideration . The respective ( international federation ) will have to take into account other reliable tests , that means international tests , or tests supervised by international authorities . " <p> FINA must , then , decide Efimova 's fate and that of the likes of Natalia , another with a double dope case to her name . Efimova , who tested positive for DHEA in 2013 and was suspended for 16 months , tested positive for meldonium five times this year . The International federation postponed a doping panel hearing of her case pending WADA research on a substance that joined the banned list of substances in January this year . <p> If Efimova must pass an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doping " , then her chances of making it to Rio could well be slim , for fall foul of anti-doping rules she clearly has . It remains to be seen quite how FINA will engage in any " individual evaluation " of Russian swimmers . <p> The outcome of her meldonium case hangs in the balance . Ironically , it is not the Russian doping system that is being called into question in her case but the Salt Lake City laboratory that found her four times positive , once negative for meldonium but later changed its negative finding to an adverse finding to make it five positives . Efimova wants the lab suspended and an inquiry launched . As such , she may well have placed herself in the camp of those whose tests are looked on with suspicion and require " individual evaluation " . <p> Whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova with coach Vladimir Mokhnev who is alleged to have run a doping program <h> Clarification Sought By Russia On Rio Eligibility <p> Russians who are exempted by the IAAF to compete in Rio will do so as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " when it comes to the Olympic Games , all athletes then are part of the team of the Russian Olympic Committee . " <p> Bach also called on WADA to call a global conference in 2017 to find more effective ways to catch cheats . That gathering would follow the planned IOC summit of October . <p> The " presumption of innocence " of competitors Russia and Kenya had been put into question , the IOC summit concluded . More international testing of both nations was required across all sports given the evidence of " inadequate doping controls " by domestic agencies that might yet lead to more athlets being barred from Rio . <p> Both Russia and Kenya are deemed to be non-compliant with the WADA Code but it was up to international sports federations such as FINA to make sure athletes in all nations were clean , the summit leaders agreed . <p> The IOC opened the door to some Russian athletes competing under the Russian flag in Rio , but it is not clear what exact conditions they must fulfill . <h> Reaction <p> The British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ react to the news from Lausanne . <p> Bill Sweeney , CEO , said : " The BOA supports any measure that ensures clean athletes can have peace of mind when they go to the start line and that they compete equal to all others . The measures taken by the IAAF and supported by the IOC are both necessary and strong . In making these difficult decisions anyone that is doping , or is considering it , should take note you will be caught and sanctioned . <p> " It is important that between now and the start of competition in Rio the whole of sport demonstrates its backing both for the anti-doping authorities and the advancement of clean sport education throughout the world . " <p> The BOA Athletes ' Commission chairman Ben Hawes , added : <p> " British athletes unanimously supported a widening of the investigation into doping both in Russia and beyond , as well as the re-testing of samples collected from previous Olympic Games . However , whilst retrospective action is welcome , too many athletes have lost their moments of glory due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IAAF decision is bold and timely . <p> " We believe there must now be a renewed proactive approach to rooting out those who are doping whilst handing out appropriate and meaningful sanctions .

 plan , the World Olympians Association has joined the chorus of those calling for anti-doping services to be taken away from sports federations in favour of placing the whole realm into the hands of a truly independent organisation . <p> The International Olympic Committee , which today will announce its plan of action following the IAAF 's decision last Friday to maintain its ban on Russian track and field and therefore lock a whole squad out of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games , has made clear that it believes the time ripe to remove anti-doping from federations that struggle with what at times is a clear conflict of interest : how to ' promote the stars ' , pump up the volume with ever bigger prizes , while engaging in what can be -- and , some say , must be -- a forensic approach to tracking athletes and keeping sport clean ? <p> The answer is to be found on the record . A quick glance of the swimming doping case file , for example , confirms a clear pattern : ' stars ' are treated more leniently than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser known to unknown , those athletes who often get slapped with the full penalty possible when they fall foul of the WADA Code , while the stars are often allowed back in time , most conveniently , for the next major event . <p> The WOA 's three-point plan includes : <p> fully independent testing <p> a permanent mechanism to allow clean athletes to compete <p> dramatically increased funding for research into improved drug testing <p> In a statement , WOA president Joel Bouzou states : <p> " There can be no suspicion that a drug testing system is not trying its hardest to eliminate the cheats or is actually involved in helping cheats prosper at the expense of those who have worked so hard to reach the top while playing by the rules and respecting the rights of their fellow athletes . In the current situation it is impossible for an athlete to truly prove that they are clean . They can only prove that at a given point in time they are not dirty . " <p> Fully independent testing would not change the fact that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find support among politicians and others who lean towards preserving image and away from the " zero-tolerance ' policies that the likes of the IOC and FINA now say they operate . <p> International federations find themselves in further hot water precisely because of the relationships they like to build with politicians . FINA granted Vladimir Putin its highest honour on the eve of revelations and allegations about systematic doping in Russia ; FINA granted the same level of honour to various Middle East politicians just as Amnesty was pointing out , in the midst of the FIFA scandal , that scores of migrant workers were being kept as slaves , denied their human rights and dying in appalling numbers on sports construction sites in the region . <p> Scratching political backs has proved a dangerous game best avoided , witnesses such as journalist Andrew Jennings , have suggested to Senate Hearings such as that held over the FIFA scandal . The governance and cultural issues raised in that hearing are pertinent in deep measure to events in Olympic sports . <p> The IOC will now host a conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to a restructured World Anti-Doping Agency will the subject of debate . The general thrust of removing anti-doping from federations is backed by the World Swimming Coaches Association , among other organisations . <p> Now the World Olympians Association has backed that plan , too , its view included in a three-point plan of action it believes needs to happen if clean athletes are to be given a fairer chance . <h> The Three-Point Plan from the WOA , statement in full : <p> anti-doping testing that is fully independent of organisers <p> a permanent mechanism to allow clean athletes to compete even if their is sanctioned <p> dramatically increased funding for research into improved anti-doping testing <p> In order to protect the rights of clean athletes to compete and to totally eliminate drug cheats from elite sport the World Olympians Association , the organisation that represents the 100,000 living Olympians , has called for a three-point anti-doping plan to be adopted by sports governing bodies , governments and event organisers . The three point plan is designed to ensure that sport can eventually fully rid itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ensuring that those athletes who are proven clean can compete at major events even if their sport or country is sanctioned because of the deficiency of their testing systems . <p> WOA president Joel Bouzou said : <p> " The current system does not work for anyone . Athletes can not prove on an ongoing basis that they are clean , not enough drug cheats are getting caught which means those who do n't cheat are disadvantaged and there is no mechanism in place to separate the clean athlete from a sport or country with a corrupt or incompetent system which taints all their athletes , whether clean or dirty . <p> " The present situation presents world sport with a great opportunity to fix a system which patently does not fully function and to move toward a situation which everyone wants : a real level playing field for all . While WOA is fully committed to supporting the rights of clean athletes to be able to compete at all major events it is also fully committed to the total elimination of drug cheats as they affect the rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest . " <p> The WOA plan has three pillars : fully independent testing ; a permanent mechanism to allow clean athletes to compete and dramatically increased funding for research into improved drug testing . <p> Currently most drug testing is carried out under the auspices of countries , sports federations or event organisers . WOA believes that only fully independent testing can be totally effective and credible in the fight against drug cheats . <p> " No matter how good testing under the current situation may be , we believe that only fully independent testing can eliminate the drug cheats . It is also the only solution that would be credible in the eyes of clean athletes and the public , " says WOA President Joel Bouzou . <p> " There can be no suspicion that a drug testing system is not trying its hardest to eliminate the cheats or is actually involved in helping cheats prosper at the expense of those who have worked so hard to reach the top while playing by the rules and respecting the rights of their fellow athletes . <p> " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove that they are clean , " explains Bouzou . " They can only prove that at a given point in time they are not dirty . That is why we are calling for a massive increase in funding for research into improved anti-doping methods . So that a way can eventually be discovered to prove on an ongoing basis that an athlete is clean . That would have a huge impact on sport and would finally eliminate the cheats forever . <p> " As an interim step we must ensure that we stay one step ahead of the cheats and that needs increased funding to improve anti-doping technology and to increase the number and frequency of out of competition testing . " <p> The final pillar of the WOA three-point plan is designed to make sure that the rights of clean athletes to compete are fully respected . WOA is calling for a permanent mechanism to be in place so that if a country or sport is sanctioned their athletes can be quickly and efficiently tested in an uncompromised system and if proven clean can compete at the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proactive rather than reactive when negative situations arise , " says Bouzou . <p> " It is only fair to the vast majority of athletes who are clean that a system should be in place as soon as possible to allow them to quickly prove that they are clean so that they can prepare for and compete in major events unburdened by the additional worry that comes with the uncertainty of the current system . <p> " We are confident that the IOC will do everything in its power to ensure that the rights of clean athletes are respected and will take all possible measures to allow clean athletes to compete at the Olympic Games in Rio . Our aim is to support the IOC in that process , both in the short and the long-term . The IOC 's commitment to athletes is clear and well demonstrated by its actions including the Agenda 2020 Programme . " <p> concluded : <p> " Clean athletes have the right to compete no matter what . The current system allows the cheats to prosper and disadvantages the clean athletes in so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IOC and others toward the elimination of cheating in sport with determination and vigour .

I do not question the sincerity or motives of ( almost ) everyone who makes these statements . <p> The question of an ombudsman certainly crossed my mind and such an entity has frequently been an effective one in many industries with a " qualifier " , namely as long as their " terms of reference are sufficient to be legitimately effective and they are adequately resourced . <p> These are also generally if not exclusively domestic entities ; hard to think of too many international ones ... or effective international ones .

At the same time I have to agree with Mr. Lord that such criticism of any innocent or politically based attempts to make some changes is actually a conscious choice of doing nothing awaiting for the repetition of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah . Doing nothing is not a position of accepting the status quo . There is no such thing with the sport and surrounding it business . Doing nothing means helping things of getting worse .

I think that when we stop to full ourselves and treat the pro sport as any other business the the acceptable fair business equilibrium will be found soon .

Matthes beamed , put his hands under my armpits , swung me round in the air full circle , put me down , took the book , signed , ruffled my hair and went off to get changed . Father Christmas was leaned on the next time round and the suit like the one he 'd worn was mine . I still have it . <p> Matthes was a season shy of becoming the first man ( and he remains the only one ) to retain the Olympic 100 and 200m backstroke crowns . A year after Munich 1972 , he claimed the first two world backstroke titles and then in 1975 , seven years after his Olympic debut and eight years beyond his first world record at 16 , he retained the 100m crown , his 200m days all but done . <p> On the way to Montreal , Matthes had an appendectomy and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big kid called John Naber cracked the East German 's world 200m mark of 2:01.87 , set for the inaugural world crown in 1973 , with a 2 ; blast at USA Olympic Trials in Long Beach on June 19 . <p> A month to the day later and the king was forced to bow out . Long live the king . Naber was one of the biggest presences at the 1976 Olympic Games across all sports -- 1.98cm ( 6ft 6ins ) tall and weighing in at 87kg ( 195lb ) , he would leave for home with four golds a silver . <p> Naber had ended Matthes ' seven-year winning streak at a meet in Concord in 1974 but the 100m world record remained the property of the East German going into the final in Montreal . In the morning heats of the 100m , Naber gave warning of what was to follow with a 56.80 , to 57.78 for Matthes . In the evening semi-final , Naber made the first cut : 56.19 , a world record , 0.11sec inside Matthes at best ever . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he remains the only man to have achieved that in history ) . The next day , when the king and the pretender walked out for their race , the outcome was all but inevitable . <p> Naber made sure of it with a sensational 55.49 world-record victory , off a 26.55 split that compared with 27.14 for teammate Peter Rocca and 27.54 for Matthes . Rocca claimed silver in 56.34 , with Matthes holding on for the bronze 0.06sec ahead of Carlos Berrocal , of Puerto Rico . That medal made Matthes the only backstroke swimmer ever to win a medal at three separate Games . In 2008 , Aaron Peirsol ( USA ) matched that when he claimed silver in the 200m eight years after the same finishing place at 17 in Sydney and four years after ( double ) gold in the 200m . <p> For Naber , victory was the fulfilment of a childhood dream : at nine he visited Olympia in Greece and told his parents that his destiny was to be an Olympic champion . But Naber was not done that fine day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 200m freestyle 0.21sec behind Bruce Furniss ( 1:50.29 ) and 0.08sec ahead of Jim Montgomery in a USA sweep and the tightest podium finish in the history of the event . tests and interviews , Furniss and Naber , who had become the first swimmer to win Olympic medals in two consecutive solo finals , were finally able to swim down . The pool was all but deserted by this time . The teammates began to swim alongside each other and , stroke-by-stroke , they picked up the pace and found themselves racing each other in the swim-down , so keen was their competitive spirit . As Furniss told Sports Illustrated : <p> " It showed -- you did n't need 20,000 people to be there . " <h> Naber back then and on suits , money , doping and more <p> Two days later in Montreal , Naber took gold as a member of the 4x200m freestyle quartet ( , world record ) , one day after that another relay gold in the 4x100m medley ( 3:42.22 , world record ) , and on July 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lowering his 2:00.64 world record over 200m backstroke to 1:59.19 to become the first man below 2 minutes . He then retired . Naber later worked as lead commentator for Olympic sports broadcaster WSCN . <p> Many years down the trail , I gave him a copy of FINA 's Aquatics 100-year history and apologised for the single column entry that honoured him . The trouble was that after bronze in the 200m in 1973 , he never attended the FINA World Championships again and double-page spreads were reserved for Olympic AND World Championships . Naber handed the book back , smiled and asked me if I would n't mind signing it . Once a hero ... <p> Furniss , meanwhile , suffered painful arthritis and used swimming as a remedial exercise . The younger brother of Steve Furniss , Pan American champion and world record holder ( and future founder of the TYR swimsuit brand ) , turned his therapy into Olympic gold and in a 12-year stellar career broke the 200m medley world record , in 1975 , that had been held by his brother . Furniss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darr and Jon Urbanchek , before moving on to Dick Jochums and ultimately being honed by Peter Daland . <p> Two days after Furniss and Naber had warmed back up in their swim down , they were joined by two others who would not leave the Games without solo and relay gold , the latter as members of the 4x200m freestyle quartet ( , world record ) . Michael Bruner , the 200m butterfly champion in a global mark of 1:59.23 , and Montgomery , who this week 40 years ago qualified got race for the USA over 100m freestyle in Montreal . <p> A month on , July 25 and James " Jim " Paul Montgomery , of Madison , Wisconsin , 21 years old , became the first man to break 50sec over 100m freestyle , his 49.99 Olympic victory in Montreal marking the biggest winning margin since Johnny Weissmuller in 1928 . In the modern era , there is no other example of a 100m podium split by more than the 1.32sec gap from Montgomery to Peter Nocke ( FRG ) , with Jack Babashoff ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five gold medals at Belgrade , 1973 , Montgomery set a world record of 51.12 at Long Beach in June 1975 , the time 0.11sec inside the 1972 standard of Mark Spitz . In July and August , he then lost the world crown and world record to Andy Coan ( USA ) but 20 days after Coan 's 51.11 , Montgomery coached by Jack Pettinger in Madison and Doc Counsilman at Indiana clocked 50.59 . In Montreal a year later , he joined teammates in world-record victories in the 4x200m freestyle and 4x100m medley ( at a Games void of a 4x100m freestyle ) , broke his third world record of the Games , in 50.39 , in the 100m semi-final and then lined up for the final , a giant of performance and in stature , at 195cm and 88kg . <p> Montgomery 's achievement was secured down the first 50m : he turned in 24.24 , ahead of his nearest rival , teammate . When the champion hit the touch pad , the result that popped up on the scoreboard was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to standstill and the crowd drew breath before standing to cheer a turn of speed that only 12 nations could boast as their national record 20 years later . <p> Three weeks later in Philadelphia , Jonty Skinner , locked out of the Olympic Games by his South African nationality at a time when the hated apartheid regime held power , shattered the world record with a effort . He later became coach at the University of Alabama . <h> And at the other end of the spectrum a classic three-way <p> At US Olympic trials in Long Beach , California , 17-year-old Brian Goodell had thrown down the gauntlet to the world by defeating triple world champion Tim Shaw ( 200m , 400m , 1,500m ) in world records of 3:53.08 over 400m and in the 1,500m . While the year leading up to the 1976 had been golden for Goodell , it had brought woe upon woe for Shaw : he suffered tendinitis and anaemia , had to sit back while all his world records in the 200m , 400m , 800m and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Games in just one race , the 400m . <p> The 1,500m final in Montreal quickly turned into a three-man race featuring Goodell , Bobby Hackett and Stephen Holland ( AUS ) , who had broken the world record four times between lifting the inaugural world title in Belgrade in 1973 and Goodell 's US trials time . Hackett led the way until 950m , all three racing inside world-record pace for much of the race . Hackett turned in 57.55 , to Goodell 's 59.14 world-record pace ; 1:58.13 ( 1:59.81 ) ; 4:00.15 ( ) . <p> At the 500m mark his 5:01.38 compared with record-pace of and splits of 5:03.22 for Goodell and for Holland . was still in touch , on but from there the pack melted away . At 800m , Hackett turned in 8:03.50 , shy of the world record he had set on the way to 1,500m at the US trials . Goodell , on and behind Holland , on , had seen it all before and kept his powder dry . <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.5sec ahead of Hackett , ahead of Goodell and now racing faster than his first 500m , with a second 500m split of 5:00.72 . By 1,200m , the Americans were just over a second away , Hackett still ahead by a touch but they could sense opportunity . With 100m remaining , Goodell got his feet on the wall first for the first time in the race , at to Hackett 's and Holland 's . Then came the drop , the last 100m splits as follows : 57.73 for Goddell ; 58.96 for Hackett ; and 59.67 for Holland . The battle was over , the tightest 1,500m podium in history concluded in a world record of 15:02.40 for Goodell . <p> Two days later in the 400m final , Goodell won an another epic battle , against Shaw , to join Taylor ( 1908 ) , Ross ( 1920 ) , Rose ( 1956 ) and Burton ( 1968 ) in the club of men who won the 400m and 1,500m crowns at the same Games . Both Goodell and Shaw raced inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 3:51.93 to Shaw 's lifetime best , of 3:52.54 . <p> There were also wins for John Hencken , whose coach Howard Firby as being " like a fine sports car that needs constant tuning " , in the 100m breaststroke . In the 100m , Hencken turned in 29.48 , the only , with Britain 's David Wilkie back in fourth , on 30.45 . The Scot clawed back 0.7sec on the way home but the American had done enough to claim the crown in his third world record in two days , of 1:03.11 , with Wilkie also racing inside previous world record , at 1:03.43 . took bronze at the helm of six men inside a second of each other . <p> Four days after his 100m win , Hencken , who after graduating in design completed his MBA at the University of Phoenix , would race inside the pre-race world record in the final of the 200m only to find that Wilkie had got to the gold before him -- and how . <p> The American looked like a strong candidate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had retained an Olympic breaststroke title : Yoshiyuki Tsuruta ( 1928-1932 , 200m ) . Could Hencken be next ? Hencken went out hard in the 200 : inside world-record pace at 100m , on 1:06.09 , with Wilkie hanging on his shoulder , on 1:06.49 . The Scot had inched ahead at the final turn but at that point nothing had been decided , at least beyond the mind of Wilkie and those who knew the athlete best , coaches Dave Haller in Britain and Bill Diaz in the United States . <p> Scottish swimming legend David Wilkie and GB para-swimmer Scott Quin opened the street-art pool in Glasgow ahead of the IPC worlds in 2015 <p> Out of the turn , Wilkie began to open up what would become a yawning gap between him , Hencken and the rest of the field that was falling further behind with every stroke . Wilkie 's homecoming split , 1:08.62 , was phenomenal , a time that would have placed him just outside the medals in the straight 100m final just two Games before . It gave him an end time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic swimming history , one that prevented a sensational USA men 's team from winning every gold medal in the pool in 1976 , one that made the Scot the first British man to win an Olympic crown since Henry Taylor in 1908 . <p> Hencken looked up at the scoreboard to confirm a feeling that he had raced better than ever : he had cracked his own world record by , to finish on 2:17.26 . But he had lost the crown by . Colella gained consolation for his fourth place in 1972 by stepping up to the bronze as the third man to break the 2:20 mark , in 2:19.20 , with Graham Smith ( CAN ) the fourth to get inside that barrier , in 2:19.42 . Wilkie 's world record , 3.1sec inside Hencken 's previous best , would survive six years and the time would still have won a medal three Games later , in 1988 , and placed him in the 1996 final 20 years after his finest sporting moment . <p> Wilkie was the only non-American to win a swimming event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strachan 's world-record win of 4:23.68 in the 400m medley and Matt Vogel 's victory in the 100 ' fly as the only winner in the men 's events who did not claim gold in a world record in Montreal . The 54.27 world record was set by Mark Spitz when he claimed the fourth of his seven golds at Munich 1972 , the standard surving as the Olympic record until Los Angeles 1984 , when Michael " The Albatross " Gross , of Germany , clocked 54.02 in heats . <p> Back in 1976 , eight nations made the medals , four of them getting gold . In 2012 , 19 nations made the medals , nine of them claiming gold , precisely the same tallies seen at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta , the depth of nations capable of making the Olympic podium having stayed fairly constant for the past quarter of a century . <p> And so to 2016 , Omaha and the week ahead . John Lohn will be there for SwimVortex to witness the trials 40 years after the generation of Naber , Goodell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free relay . <p> Here they are : <p> And as you watch speedy efforts of their age , good to recall that they -- like the rest of us all started out as beginners : <p> The explosion in 
 New Zealand to hand back an Olympic ticket earned by Charlotte Webby under the international qualification criteria for marathon swimmers may add another swimmer with a doping record to a growing list ofthose back from bans and now heading to the Rio 2016 Games . <p> Webby has been told by the New Zealand federation that she does not have their confidence when it comes to a national policy for selection to the Games that grants tickets only to those capable of finishing at least in the top 16 in Rio . There are just 25 swimmers in the marathon , while many more swimmers will be entered in the heats of racing in the pool , where New Zealand 's team includes just two swimmers ranked in the world top 16 -- and that before the USA Olympic Trials that get underway in Omaha on Sunday and may well rattle the rankings like no othger event has all year . <p> Webby did not wualify as a tip 10 finisher at world titles last year , nor did she make the top 9 at a last-chance saloon race in Setubal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualify under the continental ( Oceania ) representation clause of the international selection criteria . Australia had two swimmers faster but to have both in Rio would have required both to finish top 10 at world titles last year . <p> With Webby out , the next swimmer eligible for the last of 25 slots in Rio is Portugal 's Vania Neves . Europe 's continental allocation is full without Neves but so is that of all others ahead of Neves . On March 29 , 2009 , Neves tested positive for Prednisone ( Class S9 . Glucocorticosteroids ) at the national long-course championships . A two-year suspension was imposed . <p> The Portuguese swimming federation is quoted by national media as saying that FINA will decide whether to award the last slot in the Rio marathon to Neves. <h> ' It gets 
 At United States Trials , Katie Ledecky Chasing Some More History <p> EPIC : Katie Ledecky of the United States of America - by Patrick B. Kraemer - This image is the SwimVortex choice of Photo of the Year , Patrick having captured a bulls-eye snapshot that summed up Ledecky , attitude , achievement and a target reached - thank you Mr. Kraemer , for that and so many other work-of-art shots that mirrored the whisper from the water . <p> The Olympic Trials can be harsh in nature , even the best athletes in the sport not immune to disastrous outcomes . <p> Remember when Ian Thorpe stunningly tumbled off the blocks at the start of the 400 freestyle at the 2004 Australian Trials ? The swimming world gasped at the prospect of the reigning Olympic champion and world-record holder missing the event at the Athens Games . Only the generosity of Craig Stevens , who yielded his spot to his mate , saved Thorpe 's chance at a repeat . <p> Remember the 1988 United States Olympic Trials and the calamitous result that greeted Pablo Morales in the 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holder , but a third-place finish at Trials left him off the plane en route to the Seoul Games . However , Morales found redemption four years later when he prevailed in the 100 fly at the Barcelona Games . <p> The odds are good that at least a handful of favorites ( perhaps an overwhelming choice ) will be forced to deal with disappointment at this year 's United States Olympic Trials , which are scheduled to begin on Sunday at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha . That 's the way this competition works , but do n't expect Katie Ledecky to be anywhere near the cut line . <p> Ledecky is undoubtedly one of the closest things to a lock that Trials has ever seen , subpar races by her standards still pretty much guaranteed to place the 19-year-old on the Team USA roster . The distance ace will storm to triumphs in the 400 freestyle and 800 free , likely challenging her world records along the way . Meanwhile , as the reigning world champ and global No. 1 in the 200 freestyle , she 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showdown with 2013 world champ Missy Franklin and 2012 Olympic titlist Allison Schmitt . <p> The most intriguing storyline related to Ledecky is whether she can pull off something that has not been achieved in nearly 45 years : Holding every world record from the 200 freestyle through the 1500 freestyle . That was the feat managed by Aussie legend Shane Gould in 1971 and 1972 , with Gould adding the 100 freestyle for good measure . <p> Because the world record in the 200 free sits to Italian Federica Pellegrini at 1:52.98 from the height of the tech-suit era , the standard is probably out of reach . But the mere fact that it is even considered speaks to the range of Ledecky and her vast talent . If she ca n't match the feat of Gould this summer , there 's plenty of time ahead to make it happen . <p> Another intriguing storyline with Ledecky concerns what she 'll do in the 100 freestyle . Will she secure one of the six slots afforded to athletes for the 400 freestyle relay ? Can she possibly beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a berth to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in the 100 freestyle ? Answers to those questions are on the way . If she finds a way , Ledecky will only enhance her legacy . <h> How Many Olympic Invitations Can Cal Coral ? <p> One of the highlights of the last day of competition is the announcement of the Team USA coaching staffs , primarily the assistant coaches who will work alongside head coaches Bob Bowman and David Marsh . The chances of Dave Durden being named an Olympic assistant are relatively high , given the number of athletes he 'll have in contention for trips to Rio . <p> Nathan Adrian By Peter Bick <p> As roster positions are filled throughout the week in Omaha , it 's difficult to see an American unit without the presence of Nathan Adrian and . Adrian is the favorite in the 50 freestyle and 100 freestyle while Murphy is at least a co-favorite in each of his prime events , the 100 backstroke and 200 backstroke . <p> Meanwhile , Tom Shields goes into action as the No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fierce battle with Michael Phelps and . Then there 's Josh Prenot , whose consistently speedy times have made him a leading pick in the 200 breaststroke , and who should also be part of the final in the 400 individual medley . <p> Often lost in the shadow of Murphy in the backstroke events , Jacob Pebley can not be discounted as a potential qualifier in the 200 backstroke . Although Murphy is the favorite , reigning Olympic champion Tyler Clary is an uncertainty and 2008 Olympic champ Ryan Lochte might not contest the event . Those question marks open the door for Pebley , who has enjoyed a superb tuneup season . <p> Keeping an eye on Andrew Seliskar is also a wise decision as the multi-event standout will have an impact on the 200 fly and 400 individual medley , the fly his best chance of earning a Rio bid . It might be an Olympiad too soon for Seliskar , but he should deliver a good showing . Quality performances are also expected from Seth Stubblefield in the 100 free and 100 fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aside from the anticipated challenges by Katie Ledecky to her world records in the 400 freestyle and 800 freestyle , what events possess the greatest chance of seeing a global standard go down ? The men 's 100 backstroke record of 51.94 , set in 2009 by Aaron Peirsol , features the best shot with Ryan Murphy , Matt Grevers and David Plummer set to clash . <h> Comments <p> Katie could possibly hold all 5 freestyle world records in the future , This year will be tough to achieve that feat , but definitely possible in the next 4 yrs , as long as she does not get injured ! <p> gheko June 24 , 2016 <p> Whether she can go a 51.9 in the 100m free remains to be seen ! <p> kevin roose June 24 , 2016 <p> i beleive the American girls are under real threat from the Australian girls in terms of medals at Rio .

BRING IT ON <p> June 24 , 2016 <p> Gheko , just a small correction : there are 6 freestyle word records now , not 5 . <p> It is interesting to see what events Ledecky will swim in Omaha . She is also entered in 50 free and 400 IM . As great as Ledecky is , she wo n't match Katie Hoff 's astounding feats at 2008 trials : qualified in all 200-400-800 free and 200-400 IM as well as 4 ? 100 relay alternate . Not sure if this feat had been matched previously by any US swimmer .@@9526457 <h> Woman in viral 
 of press conferences from the United States Olympic Trials revealed a few interesting tidbits from the athletes set to shine at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha . Here 's a look at some of the news that arose out of the question-and-answer sessions . A second round of pressers is scheduled for Saturday , with competition getting under way on Sunday . <h> Commitment to 400 Medley Defense Confirmed By Ryan Lochte <p> Any doubt Ryan Lochte would yield his Olympic title without an effort was erased when the 11-time Olympic medalist confirmed his entry in the 400 individual medley . Since capturing the Olympic crown in 2012 , the decathlon of the sport has been a sparse part of Lochte 's schedule , leading to uncertainty concerning the defense of his crown . <p> While he left much of his schedule up for debate , including whether he 'll contest another double of the 200 backstroke and 200 individual medley , Lochte let it be known he 'll race the 400 medley on Day One of the meet . Lochte heads into action as the No. 4 seed , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austin . <p> If Lochte finds his way onto the Team USA roster in his first event of Trials , it will not only serve as a good sign for what is to come , but will also mean he has taken down a few top contenders . Lochte will line up against the likes of Chase Kalisz and Tyler Clary , foes who have medaled at the World Championships in the 400 I.M. <p> " I tried to hide it all year , but I guess since Trials is two days away , I 'm definitely swimming the 400 I.M. , " he said . " It will be a fun event . It 's one of the hardest events in the sport of swimming , and that 's why I love that event . I enjoy it because you ca n't be great in one stroke . You have to be good in everything , and it 's a challenge . I 'm definitely up for it . " <h> Competing at Stanford Still On Katie Ledecky 's Radar <p> If the summer goes as expected for Katie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and potentially a few more world records , multiple endorsement overtures are going to be thrown at the 19-year-old . For now , though , Ledecky is intent on enrolling at Stanford University and being part of a team atmosphere . <p> A word with the water : Katie Ledecky at one with her sport , by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Ledecky originally committed to the Cardinal for the 2015-16 NCAA season , but the distance ace opted to defer her enrollment and continue training with coach Bruce Gemmell . Once the Olympics are over , she 'll move to Northern California and start working with Stanford coach Greg Meehan , whose squad will be positioned for an NCAA title run <p> " I really wanted to swim in college and have that opportunity , and to have the opportunity to go to Stanford and swim there and go to school there , I think , it 's going to be great , " she said . " I 'm really looking forward to being a part of an elite NCAA team and also having those friends and experiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a life outside of swimming is important , and something I really value . I think this path is going to be the best for me . " <h> Elizabeth Beisel Riding a Wave Of Confidence <p> Since making her Team USA debut at the 2007 World Championships in Melbourne , Elizabeth Beisel has been one of the United States ' most-consistent performers . But an injury to her groin caused the 2015 campaign to be a disaster for the two-time Olympian , and her confidence suffered as a result . But as her first race of Trials approaches , Beisel is feeling good . <p> A few weeks back , while racing at the Atlanta Classic , Beisel generated a time of 4:33.55 in the 400 individual medley , a mark that ranks No. 4 in the world . That performance gave Beisel the lift she needed on the road to Omaha , and a confident is dangerous . Four years ago , she was the Olympic silver medalist in the 400 medley . <p> " I definitely needed that performance in Atlanta , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming the Olympic Trials . But that being said , you ca n't ever really county anybody out , especially at this meet . " <h> Focus The Name Of The Game For Dana Vollmer <p> The reigning Olympic champion in the 100 butterfly , Dana Vollmer was n't sure she 'd even be at Trials after she gave birth to her son , Arlen , a little more than a year ago . But Vollmer 's comeback following her maternity leave has gone superbly and she enters the eight-day meet as the top seed in her prime event at 56.94 . <p> Vollmer 's family will be in Omaha to lend its support , including her baby boy , but a game plan has been devised to ensure the veteran Team USA member can focus on her goal of qualifying for a third Olympiad . Andy Grant , Vollmer 's husband and a former standout at Stanford , will oversee the care of Arlen , along with help from the family . <p> " My husband is going to be superdad and be in charge of Arlen all week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liz Pelton , and I thought it was really important for me to just be -- just with the team and with my teammates and really try to get into the meet . " <p> Vollmer indicated the plan is to see Arlen when she has some down time , can escape from her duties in the pool and focus on time with her son . <h> Conor Dwyer Leaning On Benefits Of Heavy Altitude Training <p> His count is not precise , but Conor Dwyer estimates that since last fall , he may have spent as many as 100 days training at altitude in Colorado Springs . The middle-distance freestyler , who has enjoyed a strong tuneup season , is hopeful his time spent at the United States Olympic Training Center will pay dividends this week . <p> Conor Dwyer by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Dwyer sits eighth in the world this year in the 400 freestyle at 3:46.09 and ranks even higher in the 200 freestyle , his best of 1:45.41 good for No. 3 in the world . Dwyer is also slated to contest the 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay berth , and will see action in the 200 individual medley . <p> " I 'm really looking forward to this meet , " Dwyer said . " I 've never been more prepared for a meet than I am for this one . I spent , I think , people are saying , maybe the longest altitude camp that 's ever been put together . So it was good being down at sea level for 16 days before this meet , kind of getting my speed up , tapering , and I 'm just excited to be here and excited to start this meet . " <h> Comments <p> June 25 , 2016 <p> Just as I predicted . His chances for 400 IM gold is slim , but he should swim it nevertheless just because there is no conflict with any other event on the first day so he can try his luck . This time around , It wo n't be nowhere as easy for him to qualify , but he should get it . <p> I just hope he does n't swim 200 back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 200 back medal is quite slim , let alone gold . <p> June 25 , 2016 <p> , it 's really disappointing that potentially American greatest female swimmer will not be able to earn money outside of scholarships and US olympics committee 's prizes . Ledecky could be ok with not getting all those millions because she 's from rich family , but what about those who want to earn and enjoy the fruits of their hard work by getting private deals but still want to compete NCAA ? <p> This is 21st century . Why ca n't NCAA work out a mechanism that satisfy both ameteur swimming college purists and yet still provide opportunity for the athletes to earn money from sponsorship deals etc. ? For example , athletes who choose to earn professional/private income is still allowed to train and compete within NCAA but must forego all scholarship funding . <p> June 25 , 2016 <p> I hope Ledecky swim 400 IM prelims AND final .

 together as teammates for a long time , to the point where they 've each referred to the other as a pseudo-sibling , as much more than a training partner . So , maybe it 's appropriate that the comebacks of Michael Phelps and Allison Schmitt will continue to be dominant storylines at the United States Olympic Trials in Omaha . <p> For Phelps , his comeback tale is one of redemption . He 's spoken about the need to confront himself and recognize the necessity for change . He 's the guy who , following a second DUI charge , spent six weeks at a rehabilitation center and came out with a better perspective on life and who he is . He sounds happy now . He 's enjoying life with fianc ? e Nicole Johnson and their newborn son , Boomer . He 's dedicated to his work in the pool , intent on finishing his career on his terms , and not through the ho-hum effort he gave to the 2012 Olympic Games in London . <p> For Schmitt , her comeback story is one about a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . But deep down , she was actually a woman who was hit with depression and did n't know what to do with the situation . But she ultimately found a way to face a disorder that affects many and can be crippling in nature , and she is again happy and seeing the rewards of her happiness in the pool . Most important , she knows she wants to speak out about depression , the opportunity to help others a meaningful and personal pursuit . <p> Whether at Club Wolverine or at the North Baltimore Aquatic Club or , now , at Arizona State University , Phelps and Schmitt have been closely linked , sharing a brother-sister relationship . While Phelps became the greatest Olympian in history with 22 medals , including 18 gold , Schmitt found her own vast success . At the 2012 Games , she walked away with five medals , including an individual title in the 200 freestyle . <p> But for all the success in the pool , Phelps and Schmitt each sunk into dark places . Phelps has spoken of spending five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even confirming that he did n't want to go on living . In Schmitt 's case , she has been open ( with the intent of helping others ) about the unhappiness that ruled her life . <p> The beauty part of their tales is that each has bounced back and find themselves in good places , happy and healthy . In the case of Phelps , fatherhood has been embraced as a special moment in his life . <p> " So it 's been a really fun journey over the last couple of years , and a journey that I think has made me the person who I am and helped me transform to me just being me , " Phelps said . " I think that 's the best thing about the journey that I 've been on , and it 's been an exciting one . " <p> What we 'll see from Phelps this week will soon be determined , but his preparation for this go-round has been significantly different from 2012 . Rather than skip practices for days at a time and go into Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dedicated himself to his training and is ready to wrap up his career on his terms . There will be no regrets , regardless of the outcome , due to Phelps ' satisfaction with his dedication to the task at hand . <p> " I mean , going into 2012 , I just did n't want to do it , " Phelps said . " That 's it . That 's pretty much the only thing that needs to be said . I was n't happy doing what I was doing . I sure as hell was n't training . We all saw that . I tried to fake it , pretty much . That 's what I was doing . And I did n't want to have -- I do n't like allowing myself to do that . I think , for me , that was something that haunted me for a while and it 's exciting to be back here again . " <p> If Phelps is on target , as was the case at last summer 's United States National Championships in San Antonio , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both butterfly events and the 200 individual medley . He 's also likely to race at least a round each of the 100 freestyle and 200 freestyle , the opportunity to confirm himself for relay duty the primary reason . <p> While Phelps learned about himself through his travails and fatherhood , Schmitt realized something similar . She looked into a mirror and came to terms with the fact that she was not happy . She needed to find a way out of the doldrums and wake up with reasons to be excited about the day ahead . To her credit , she did what was necessary to travel that path . <p> " I 've learned a lot about myself in the past few years , and I think that any failure , any disappointment I 've had , I 've learned way more about myself than I have through any successes I 've had , " she said . " As hard as those ( times ) may have been , I 'm grateful for them and I would n't be the person I am today without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Coming off an Olympic title in the 200 freestyle from London , Schmitt failed to qualify for the 2013 World Championships and was not the same swimmer who reached the top of her sport . It was a difficult situation , and one that continued on without end . <p> Her struggles were still evident in 2014 and she again did not qualify for the World Champs in 2015 . But through those down times , Schmitt has found a way to persevere and is , by all accounts , looking at a strong week ahead . In the event in which she 's the Olympic champ , Schmitt is staring at an epic showdown with Katie Ledecky and Missy Franklin . <p> " I think I 'm a whole 180 , a completely different person and a completely different attitude about everything , " Schmitt said . " I think that seeing a psychologist is one of the best tools that anybody , an athlete , or any person , could possibly use , so I 'm still an advocate of seeing one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , I have my days . There are good days , bad days , but there 's a lot more good days than bad days now , and , like I said earlier , I 'm very grateful . I 'm grateful for the support system I 've had throughout the bad times . They stuck with me all the way through , and I would n't be here today if it was n't for them . " <p> The success found this week by Phelps and Schmitt will certainly be rewarding of the work they 've put in with coach Bob Bowman , a man who is more than a coach to both . Yet , if there are a few bumps , there 's the knowledge they 've each found better places than they knew not long ago . <h> Could we really 
 set to add another gem to the vault ? - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The gauntlet is chucked : 2008 Olympic champion Federica Pellegrini , of Italy , just cracked 1:55 for the first time ever in one textile suit over 200m freestyle . <p> In the resplendent Foro Italico pool in which the Lioness of Verona claimed her first 200m world title on her way to retaining the crown in 2011 before missing the podium at London 2012 , Pellegrini cracked out a meet mark of 1:54.55 in a race with Sweden 's Michelle Coleman , on 1:55.88 . <p> Out in 27.20 , Pellegrini trailed Coleman 's 27.09 . At the half-way turn , the Italian , who yesterday confined her best and Italy 's record to history with a 53.18 in the 100m , had the edge , 56.46 to the Swedish visitor 's 56.53 . Down the third lap , Pellegrini piled on the pressure with a 29.29 to turn for home in 1:25.75 , Coleman on 1:26.33 .

Before today , a 1:54.82 victory for the Olympic crown in 2008 was her best : that was textile but she wore two suits at a time when the LZR Racer was the thing to beat .

Her sub-minute 100s have been noteworthy , while a 2:09.71 in the 200m at Canadian Olympic trials was 0.01sec shy of her 2015 and career best . Today , she cracked out a 2:08.79 victory ( 30.60 , 1:03.89 , 1:36.83 , 31.96 ) ahead of Italy 's Margherita Panziera , on 2:10.21 . <p> The men 's equivalent final went to Christopher Ciccarese , for the hosts , in 1:57.96 , the podium completed by Michele Malerba , 1:58.94 , and Luca Mencarini , 1:59.16 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Patrick B.

At 30 , Cseh 's a spring chicken . <p> The women 's butterfly produced a win for a Swedish sprinter closing in on 40 and still going strong on the way to what will be a record sixth Olympic Games : when Therese Alshammar , on 25.94 , today , was collecting silver medals over 50 and 100m freestyle at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games , the swimmer closest to her today , Canada 's Penny Oleksiak , on 26.08 , had just been born . <p> French 100m freestyle champion Jeremy Stravius took the two-lapper in 48.79 , off a 23.60 at the turn adrift Italy 's Luca Dotto , who was out in 23.32 and home in 49.18 for second ahead of national teammate and 2005 and 2007 World champion Filippo Magnini , on 49.51 . <p> After a 4:12.21 win in the 400IM yesterday , Hungarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his win list on 2:00.09 ahead of Italy 's Giovanni Sorriso , 2:00.93 , the third man with a smile on his face the winner 's teammate Benjamin Gratz , on 2:01.10 . <p> In the women 's short medley , Italian Ilaria Cusinato edged out Swiss challenger Maria 2:12.80 to 2:12.88 , third place to Hungarian Dalma Sebestyen in 2:13.08 . <p> The meet closed with a clash of training partners in the 800m freestyle , Gabriele Detti setting a meet mark ahead of Gregorio Paltrinieri 's . 's time , just shy of his career best from 2014 , also fell just shy of Paltrinieri 's topper for the year , of , the time in which he claimed the European crown in London last month . <p> Just like what I wrote in the previous Sette Coli article , now we know what kind of time Pellegrini will swim in Rio . Judging from recent past results , not faster than 1:54.5 , but in life and statistics , there 's always exception , so hopefully she can be faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lane next to Ledecky she 'll be a very close second and that may reflect on the clock . In Kazan she used Missy as her mouse and she out toched her to but was 0.16 behind Ledecky .... If she 'll going after Ledecky in Rio she can swim a much faster time than Kazan and even crack <p> June 26 , 2016 <p> US Trials will fill out the picture but La Fede has certainly thrown down a worthwhile " marker " . I do think BA 's scenario DOES have some credence . <p> Yozhik June 26 , 2016 <p> We have practically no fresh news from Sarah Sjostrom . After this race of Pellegrini I 'm beginning to believe that probability of Sjostrom getting no medal at all at freestyle is getting higher than probability to win gold medals from 50 through 200 . Very powerful and intimidating statement was made by Federica Pellegrini . But the same question from last year still puzzles me . Is it wise to improve personal bests at 100 and 200 just one months prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Yozhik June 26 , 2016 <p> Deserves a really close attention 0.4sec improvement of personal best by Boglarka Kapas. 1:58.05 does n't make her a contender for the medal at this distance but it is a strong indicator that the personal best at 400 will follow . And that is the distance where her chances for medal are high . <p> June 26 , 2016 <p> I think Fede ( and the Italian contingent ) regularly use Sette Colli as dress rehearsal for the Olympics or World Championships . Obviously not fully-tapered , but likely at least partially rested . <p> So I am not surprised at all with the fast results . There 's one thing that some people may forgot : In Sette Colli , there 's only heats and final , while in Rio there will be 3 rounds . On top of that , in Foro Italico , Fede could just float the prelims and got into final , so it 's basically a one off fast swim . While in Rio she will have to swim 2 fast rounds close to maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> June 26 , 2016 <p> Do n't think heats will need anywhere near maximum ; quick enough certainly but would tend to think should at least get you through to semis . From then on , certainly digital extraction required . <p> massimiliano gallus June 26 , 2016 <p> Fede came down from Sierra Nevada only a week ago , after 3 weeks of hard training . She 's in heavy training , no rest . Her last gym session on thursday : 2 hours . Hope much faster from her , 1 ' 53 , maybe faster if taper goes well . <p> Craig Lord June 26 , 2016 <p> " 1:53 maybe faster " I think that highly unlikely , massimiliano Federica was in terrific peak form at just the right age 2009-2011 over 200m free . If she cracks 1:54 in Rio , that would be a phenomenal swim . Cracking 1:53 would be otherworldly . <p> Yozhik June 26 , 2016 <p> It is amazing how just one race can change dramatically fan 's opinion . When Pellegrini failed to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pellegrini 's chances for medal looked grim . Now we are hearing about possible sub 1:53 and definite sub 1:54 . <p> June 26 , 2016 <p> it 's highly unlikely for Fede to even break 1:54 . I knew she had a textile sub 1:55 in her ( as did everyone else , truth be told ) , and she finally delivered . I think she has already done enough . If she can swim a similar time to this in Rio , she will go out not with a gold medal , but knowing that she gave her best , and thus with no regrets . <p> June 26 , 2016 <p> I agree with you , as everyone in know , Fede is my #1 200 female freestyler of all time . And yes , I 've been waiting for this 1:54 textile for a long time ( longer than I had waited for Cate 's 23.8 textile ) . Like you , I always knew she had 1:54 textile in her even though some detractors were trying to undermine her 200 free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits . Yesterday I said that this Sette Colli 's result would be indicative of her times in Rio , and I am keeping it as my prediction for her , which is pretty conservative as possible : No faster than 1:54.5 And if she goes faster than that , it will be very exciting and just another icing on her glamorous swimming cake . <p> Craig Lord June 26 , 2016 <p> Indeed , ... her legacy would be superb , no ( crikey ! ) required . <p> June 26 , 2016 <p> No she was not helped by rubber suits , or , rather , she was helped in the times , but not in the result relative to other swimmers : in 2008-2011 she was the best in the world and would have been with any suits . Fede has won medals in every WC and Olympics since 2004 except London , so her legacy is secured . She is now 28 and swimming textile bests in the 200 free : this alone is amazing . <p> In reference to 's post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went out faster in the first 100 and then paid for it in the last 50 . At Sette Colli she had a more balanced race . <p> Yozhik June 27 , 2016 <p> Please confirm that Michelle Coleman 's time is 1:55.88 . It maybe incorrect . <p> June 27 , 2016 <p> Checked the official results , Coleman 's is most definitely correct . <p> Yozhik June 27 , 2016 <p> So , Sweden has #4 and #5 at 200FR . The strongest duet by far . Unfortunately the relay needs two more swimmers and they are not even under 2 minutes . <p> Shane Duffy 's 
 earlier in the evening yielded Olympic trips to Rio , a semifinal to end the opening night of the United States had the risk of being underwhelming . Kevin Cordes made sure that was not the case , as the University of Arizona product left the CenturyLink Center crowd satisfied with an American record in the 100 breaststroke . <p> The multiple-time NCAA champion followed up his top-seeded morning performance with an even better showing at night , going 58.94 to slightly better the 58.96 that Eric Shanteau managed at the 2009 World Championships in Rome . Of course , Shanteau 's performance came at the height of the tech-suit era , a fact that puts Cordes ' effort in even greater perspective . <p> Cordes was actually out slightly slower than the morning , hitting the midway point in 27.58 , as opposed to 27.40 in the morning .

Andrew Wilson and Nic Fink also cracked the minute barrier in 59.87 and 59.88 , with Marcus Titus ( 1:00.19 ) and Will Licon ( 1:00.30 ) rounding out the finalists . <h> Dana Vollmer On Right Path in 100 Fly ( 56.90 ) <p> Reigning Olympic champion Dana Vollmer stormed to the fastest time of her comeback from maternity leave , going 56.90 to lock up the top seed for the final of the 100 butterfly .

 her feelings after her world-record form Photo : Peter Bick <p> Everyone in the building knew the outcome . She was going to win the race by a comfortable margin . She was going to secure a trip to a second Olympiad , this time in August in Rio de Janeiro . Yet , there was n't an ounce of boredom found in the 15,000 fans who packed the CenturyLink Center for the second night of the United States Olympic Trials in Omaha . <p> Simply put , when Katie Ledecky competes , it 's a must-watch moment . And this time around , she had a co-star in the form of . <p> Under world-record pace through the 350-meter mark , Ledecky put on a show in the 400 freestyle , registering the third-fastest time in history with a performance of 3:58.98 . Ledecky now owns the four-fastest times in history and eight of the top nine , the only other being Federica Pellegrini 's super-suit effort of 3:59.15 from 2009 . <p> Nearly as impressive was the runnerup finish of Smith , who burned her way to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history . Remove the tainted tech-suit era and Smith sits behind only Ledecky in textile . At the Olympic Games , a gold-silver finish is certainly within reach . <p> " It 's awesome , " Ledecky said . " I 'm probably more pumped about ( Smith 's ) race than mine . She pushed me there , and I know I need that . I know after this week , we 're going to have to get back to work , and we 'll get to train together . ( Smith 's ) a great trainer , fun to race at practice and at meets , and I know we 'll just encourage each other and have fun along the way . " <p> By winning the 400 freestyle , Ledecky avenged the third-place finish she managed at the 2012 Olympic Trials , held in the same venue . She was a 15-year-old then , a rising star on the American scene who was still relatively unknown in wider circles . Really , that anonymity outside the aquatic world was still intact after she won gold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> These days , her name is widely recognized , and she 's not just a premier performer in her sport . She 's been featured in large takeouts in Sports Illustrated and the New York Times , and she 's been part of Today Show segments aimed at promoting NBC 's coverage of the Olympics . It 's not a stretch to suggest Ledecky is the most dominant female athlete on the planet , at such a level that she knows no peer . On the tennis court , Serena Williams drops a match from time to time . On the golf course , Lydia Ko does n't prevail in each of the tournaments she plays . In the Octagon , Ronda Rousey learned that she is not invincible . <p> Ledecky ? She 's a machine . She has n't lost a distance-freestyle race since suffering that third-place finish in the 400 freestyle at the 2012 Trials , and she 's now the reigning world champion in the 200 freestyle , her range as great as any since the legendary Shane Gould of Australia in the early 1970s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll head to Rio in pursuit of three freestyle titles , something not achieved since Debbie Meyer tripled at the 1968 Games in Mexico City . <p> Winning , however , only tells part of the story of her dominance . A Ledecky race is typically over after the first few strokes , her aggressive approach vaulting the 19-year-old to the front of the field , and cutting the hearts out of her opponents . Last year , she was nearly four seconds faster than anyone in the world in the 400 free . Her margin in the 800 free was 10-plus seconds . In the 1500 free , she was 14-plus seconds clear of her closest pursuer . <p> If she was allowed , Ledecky could finish a race , get out of the pool and polish off a sandwich . It might be a bite-size sandwich , but you get the idea . <p> Outside of chasing her world records , there is no drama surrounding Ledecky when it comes to the distance events . Yet , her races continue to spark keen interest , fans yearning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any drama this week , it will come in the 100 freestyle , where Ledecky could despite being in a sprinter 's world land a berth on the American 400 freestyle relay . <p> " I felt pretty good , " Ledecky said . " I think the last 150 , I just kept telling myself , Rio , Rio , Rio . I just tried to keep myself fired up on that and did n't really care what the time was . " <p> Smith showed guts from the outset , not afraid to try to keep Ledecky within a reasonable distance . WHile Ledecky can demoralize other athletes , Smith embraces the chance to race against the best in the world . It 's a trait that surely serves her well , and paid dividends on the way to her first Olympic bid . <p> " Everybody always says that ( I ) never go faster and she 'll never beat her time from the morning , " Smith said . " I get super excited in the morning and have to race . My ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Federica Pellegrini do it , when I was little , I wanted to do it . So to be that close is unreal . I wanted to go 4:02 or 4:01 at this meet , so that 's really cool . " <h> Comments <p> Yozhik June 28 , 2016 <p> Leah Smith is the sensation of this meet by far . I do n't know to what extent both these swimmers ( Ledecky and Smith ) were but if this time is repeatable by Leah , then we have a race and Ledecky got finally a company . Any lost of concentration or deviation from race plan can happen to be costly . <p> gheko June 28 , 2016 <p> At the touch , Ledecky was 3:58.98 , Smith was a 4:00.65 . In major meets , Ledecky has never won by a shorter margin in the 400m freestyle . Smith actually split a faster second 200 than Ledecky , putting up splits of 1:58.16 and 2:02.49 compared to Ledecky 's 1:56.28 and 2:02.70 . <p> June 28 , 2016 <p> I do n't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I assume KL was not fully tapered and LS was . I doubt it will be that close in Rio . Great swim by Smith though . <p> Ledecky swims kinda crazy sometimes pacing wise . Did she really need to go out that fast ?

 easy to change . It 's not easy to pick up from a comfort zone and move to a part of the world that is a complete mystery . But that 's the path Kevin Cordes chose to pursue a little more than a year ahead of the United States Olympic Trials . With the way his evening unfolded on Monday night at the CenturyLink Center , Cordes knows his tough call was the right one . <p> Although he was unable to match his American record from the semifinals , Cordes dug deep and got to the wall in 59.18 , just ahead of the 59.26 of Cody Miller . Both men were slightly slower than the prior evening , but as the adage goes , the Olympic Trials are all about place and not time , and Cordes and Miller are going to the Olympic Games in Rio . Josh Prenot was third in 59.81 . <p> In the spring of 2015 , Cordes made one of the biggest decisions of his young life , opting to move from his training base at the University of Arizona to Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locales , since he had the opportunity to work with Sergio Lopez . The 1988 Olympic bronze medalist in the 200 breaststroke for Spain , Lopez was working as the head coach of Singapore Swimming and he had an opening for Cordes . <p> In Lopez , Cordes saw the chance to work with a guy who was highly successful guiding the tradition-rich Bolles School program and its club affiliate . He was also someone who could relate Cordes ' stroke and provide the feedback necessary to take the youngster to the next level . In a way , Cordes saw Lopez as The Breaststroke Whisperer . <p> It 's clear that the partnership of Cordes and Lopez clicked , as Cordes ' long-awaited growth in the 100 breaststroke has been found . While Cordes won the silver medal in the 200 breaststroke at last summer 's World Championships , he did n't even contest the 100 breast , as a disqualification during the 2014 selection process cost him a spot . As a result , how much Cordes had developed in the shorter distance was unknown . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out tremendously , " Cordes said of his time with Lopez . " Coach Lopez , he 's been amazing . Going from swimming college where it 's been a lot of short-course focus , now toward long course , has really helped me get a sense of my strengths about my stroke and applying that into long course . I think just gaining confidence along the way , it 's been awesome . " <p> Cordes posted a wire-to-wire decision as he split 27.49 for the opening lap and came home in 31.69 . The final mark was .22 off the American standard of 58.96 he posted in the semifinals . For Miller , he had some work to do on the closing lap , turning in fourth place in 27.92 before covering his last 50 meters in 31.34 . Miller 's closing lap was the fastest of the final , and obviously came at the perfect time . He 's the first Indiana-based American to qualify for the Olympics since 1976 . <p> " Back at the 2012 Trials , Cordes was the guy we were worried about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 breast at those Trials went on to claim bronze in the event in London . " He has a lot of talent and you can see that in what he 's done . He just has to stay confident in himself and believe in what he 's doing and in his training . " <p> Miller has been tabbed as an Olympic contender for some time , thanks to being among the most consistent Americans in the past year . He still had to come through in Omaha , exactly what unfolded during the three rounds . Miller never worried that others were out quicker , confident he would be able to bring the race home and real in some of his foes . <p> " I 've had a lot of closing speed this meet , " Miller said . " I was focusing on trying to hammer the last 20 meters , and try to get my hand on the wall . I got the job done , and got on the team . I 'm trying to soak it in now . It 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 <p> A very interesting result . His AR in semis had certain American enthusiasts on various fora sizing him up to challenge Peaty but his performances should just be seen for what they are ; highly creditable ones that ( 1 ) confirm US has someone truly internationally competitive in this event and ( 2 ) place him as a legitimate medal contender for this event . <p> Miller 's 2nd place MAY pose a wee selection poser re the medley relay in Rio . Given his track record of disqualifications for technical infringements ; will they dare risk him in heats ? <p> June 28 , 2016 <p> I 'm hoping Cordes can Brexit Peaty from the top of the podium . He 's in the mix now for sure . Wish he was more consistent tho . <p> Hopefully the underwater cameras will be out at at the games to stop weasels like Miller . Anyone know if that is happening ? <p> John Lohn June 28 , 2016 <p> I think there is a need to look at what Cordes did within reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job to go under 59 . But let 's not discuss him beating Peaty . He is a full second behind , and until he gets much closer , no reason to compare with Peaty . <p> During a live 
 potential in the men 's 100 backstroke wo n't be going to Rio de Janeiro in August . <p> The trio of David Plummer , Ryan Murphy and Matt Grevers put on a show in the 100 back at the United States Olympic Trials , each of the athletes dipping well under the 53-second barrier and easily advancing to the championship final on Tuesday night . However , with nations limited to two swimmers in each event at the Olympics , one of those guys will watch the action from Rio . <p> Murphy fired up the crowd inside the CenturyLink Center by winning the first semifinal in 52.28 , the second-fastest time of his career . In the next heat , Plummer proved he 's ready for any type of challenge as he uncorked a clocking of 52.12 , the fifth-fastest time in history and a half-second clear of the 52.64 delivered by reigning Olympic champ . <p> Because the final is always a pressure-filled affair , there is no guarantee that the headliners will go quicker . Yet , there 's also a chance of someone going under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or possibly even an Olympic berth . Hey , it 's a longshot , but it 's a scenario that is worth throwing out . <p> " I hope that some day I will be able to add to that legacy , " Murphy said of the American success in the 100 back . " I think the thing that pushes me most is that we happen to have some really good guys in the U.S. right now . That keeps me honest every day . It 's made me a better swimmer , just the competition that we have . " <p> Lost in the three-man Brawl For The Wall was the 53.10 mark of Jacob Pebley , who finished fourth . There was a big dropoff from fifth through eighth , positions covered by Michael Taylor ( 54.07 ) , Sean Lehane ( 54.08 ) , John Shebat ( 54.52 ) and Jake Taylor ( 54.63 ) . <h> Conor Dwyer Clocks 1:46.96 In 200 Free ; Texas Places Four In Final <p> The first battle for relay positions in Rio has shaped up to be a dandy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ( 1:47.15 ) and Townley Haas ( 1:47.18 ) just behind . Conger and Haas account for half of Texas ' representation in the final as the Longhorns also qualified Clark Smith ( 1:47.49 ) and Jonathan Roberts ( 1:47.84 ) for the final . <p> Ryan Lochte advanced in the fifth position in 1:47.58 , with Tyler Clary ( 1:47.66 ) and Gunnar Bentz ( 1:47.80 ) also earning the chance at nods . Max Rooney was the odd-man out , placing ninth in 1:47.98 . Dwyer was actually quicker in the morning , going 1:46.66 , and earned his place on Team USA in the 400 freestyle on Day One . <p> That Texas has four men in the final triggers memories of the 2000 Olympic Trials in Indianapolis , where Josh Davis , Scott Goldblatt , Jamie Rauch and Nate Dusing earned spots on the Olympic Team in the 200 freestyle . <h> On 1:05.94 , Lilly King Seeking Throne In 100 Breaststroke <p> Like many events on the schedule this week , the women 's 100 breaststroke shaped up to be a tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ticket to Rio .

MissyFranklin ( 2012 ) and Natalie Coughlin ( 2004/2008 ) , who have combined for the last three Olympic titles , squeaked into the final in seventh and eighth , as they touched in 1:00.45 and . <h> Comments <p> A lot of very enthusiastic Americans on other fora are making an ungodly mess of their underwear over these times ..... as if a WR in the final is purely a " matter of course " . <p> It may well happen but that WR is still the best part of 0.2sec away . Whoever wins tomorrow night will go into Rio as a deserving favourite but unless he somehow blows a new WR right into a new stratosphere ; he 's still some way from having his name engraved on that medal . <p> Firstly , his team-mate will most likely be too close for comfort . Secondly , those who can recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Larkin was technically ; particularly his wandering around his lane in both 100 &amp; 200 . If he swims like that in Rio , he 'll get beaten ; if he tidies things up then he 's very much at this party . <p> : Not looking good for either Franklin or Coughlin ; not impossible as the 2nd place time is n't exactly striking international fear ( nor is Smoliga 's ) but they 're are n't inspiring much confidence . <p> What is Smoliga 's " top side " ? Is there a ? Its plausible but the girls in that territory are going out quicker than her and coming home distinctly quicker . She 's certainly a positive sign , especially given the indifferent form of more illustrious names , but as yet she still has a significant gap to bridge to the " business end " internationally . <p> June 28 , 2016 <p> semis were frankly pretty " meh " .

They will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . <p> With Efimova 's participation being questioned and Ruta not looking as convincing in the past , the is looking a more open event than many first thought . US lacking a finalist in Kazan was a major shock to the system and the emergence of the likes of King &amp; Meili certainly bring relief . <p> Some US enthusiasts have been touting 1.04s from King but she 's only been sub 1.06 twice ( including tonight ) and a drop of a full second in 24 hours ? ? No , a more realistic scenario would be an incremental improvement on her PB ; maybe a tick below . This will most certainly see her as a medal contender for Rio . <p> 2nd qualifier ? Looking very open . Meili was sub 1.06 last year but has n't quite shown such for this year . Hannis has been prior to Trials so has to be considered . Hardy is the other sub 1.06 in semis ; not out of the question but will be needing to find something .@@9591402 <h> Services <h> Channel 
 : Ryan Murphy &amp; David Plummer On Top In Brawl For The Wall <p> Ryan Murphy takes the top ticket for the USA in the Rio 2016 100m backstroke battle by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> We 've been calling it the Brawl for the Wall , a three-man main event that was pegged as one of most-anticipated showdowns of the United States Olympic Trials . Unfortunately , only two guys walked out of the CenturyLink Center in victorious fashion , the third dealt a devastating knockout . <p> There was no mystery it was coming . With only two Olympic berths allotted per event to each country , the final of the men 's 100 backstroke was going to be heartbreaking for someone . There was no other way around it , not when a nation boasts the trio of , Matt Grevers and David Plummer .

Everyone was quiet . I was listening to music and everyone else was doing their thing , hitting themselves or stretch a little bit . But the tension was palpable in there . You could definitely tell there were a lot of nerves , a lot of excitement . It was super cool .

Murphy was the young gun , the former age-group star who has met the vast expectations dropped on his shoulders . An NCAA champion and American-record setter at Cal , Murphy has been tabbed as a long-term force for Team USA . <p> Matt Grevers by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Aaron Peirsol by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Grevers has been the king for the United States throughout the quadrennial , the reigning Olympic champion and man who took the torch from Aaron Peirsol .

Seventh in the 100 back at the 2008 Trials , Plummer finished in the agonizing third-place slot in 2012 , just .12 shy of earning a trip to London . Yet , he was a member of Team USA at the World Champs in 2011 , 2013 and 2015 , efforts that confirmed his place as one of the elite performers in the sport . <p> Grevers will be the one watching . <p> " My heart goes out to ( Grevers ) , " Murphy said . " I have a great relationship with Matt . He was born in Chicago . I was born in Chicago , so I kind of feel like we have that Midwestern upbringing connection . He 's been someone I 've gotten along with really well and he 's definitely been a role model of mine and someone I 've looked up to .

Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap , Murphy did just enough to pull ahead of Plummer , their splits a 27.03 for Murphy and a 27.09 for Plummer . Grevers fell off the pace in 27.39 . <p> Forty years ago , the result of the 100 backstroke would not have been a problem . Countries were allowed three entries at the time , but the United States ' dominance at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal was a game-changer . The American men won 12 of a possible 13 gold medals during their North of the Border trip , and they corralled 27 of a possible 35 medals . That overwhelming dominance in an attempt for greater podium diversity triggered a reduction to two athletes per country , and the effect continued to be felt in Omaha . <p> What unfolded in the 100 back solidified the thought process that the United States Trials is a more pressure-packed and difficult competition than the Olympic Games . Just escaping the American borders is a gauntlet that only two people can survive , and Olympic champions are not invulnerable to the harsh reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling on top of the world . <p> " You know , I 'm just in a really good place in my life , " Plummer said .

" <h> Comments <p> Well , there were some very deflated American fans when their " certain " WR failed to eventuate . Did n't detract one iota from it being a top race . <p> Commiserations to Grevers for a very stout defence of his title . Anywhere else , he would be on the plane . <p> How does this leave things looking at Rio ? Patently , both Murphy and Plummer have to be seen as likely medallists and more than fair to lay the favourites tag on Murphy ........ but a long way from being a secure one . <p> Larkin remains very much in the equation and he WAS very technically untidy at AUS Trials . IF he swims like that in Rio , he 's certain to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IF he has his act tidied up as it was in Kazan &amp; late 2015 ; the chances of the US party being spoiled are much higher than many Americans would care to admit . <p> kevin roose June 29 , 2016 <p> What a mouth watering race we have ahead of us the younger gun Murphy 20 and againt the old hard head in Plummer at 30 .....

I hope Larkin does n't  go into the final fastest qualifier he could have the Americans either side of him indeed a daunting scenario <p> Robbos June 29 , 2016 <p> Let 's remember Larkin did not need at his best , nor have the competition .

A freshman at the University of Texas , Haas was sensational for the Longhorns during the four-day meet , the highlight an American record in the 200-yard freestyle that helped his school repeat as team champion . <p> Now , Haas can add Olympian to his list of achievements . <p> After just missing out on an Olympic berth on the first night of the United States Olympic Trials , a third-place finish in the 400 freestyle leaving him short of a trip to Rio de Janeiro , Haas found a way to South America in the 200 free . And he did so in dramatic fashion , edging Conor Dwyer by the slimmest of margins , 1:45.66 to 1:45.67 , on Tuesday night at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha . <p> The 19-year-old Haas is one of the most promising prospects on the American scene , a freestyler with range from the 100 freestyle through the 1500 free and the tenacity to go after the established stars .

By placing three athletes ( Haas , Conger &amp; Smith ) on the Olympic Team via the 200 free , Texas coach Eddie Reese elicited memories of the 2000 Olympic Trials in Indianapolis . It was at those Trials , the last not to be held in an Arena-type setting , that Reese put four guys on the American squad bound for the Sydney Games : Josh Davis , Scott Goldblatt , Jamie Rauch and Nate Dusing . <p> Riding a huge wave of momentum throughout the year , including a 1:45.41 marker from the USA Swimming Pro Series stop in Santa Clara , Dwyer led the field through the 150-meter mark .

He can look to his decision to spend considerable time in Colorado as a wise move . <p> At the United States Olympic Training Center , boredom can set in . At least to a degree , it 's a solitary life , the athletes in Colorado Springs attending with a purpose : To put in the necessary work , and better themselves at their craft . When done for the day , unless other arrangements have been made , they 'll eventually retreat to a dorm-style room . <p> By his estimation , Dwyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between last fall and his final trip to the Centennial State in the spring .

" That 's three events so far this week , so I 'm excited . The week has gone well so far . " <p> Dealing with a groin injury suffered in the preliminaries of the 400 individual medley , Lochte has been in pain management ever since , and will continue in that mode through the remainder of the meet .

He was a high school standout with huge expectations placed on him . Those big hopes were met with Conger nailing down an Olympic slot . <h> Comments <p> As detached observors , we can view this race through two lenses ; those of " the race itself " and those of " the times and how do they impact the international equation " . <p> For the race itself , major thumbs up and who does n't like a nail biting finish ...... apart from those involved in the race itself and their support teams ? <p> The times ..... whilst having 3 sub 1.46 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with regards to who are the real contenders in a month 's time .

She had a disappointing sophomore season at the University of Georgia , failing to make the final of the 100 freestyle at the NCAA Championships and placing eighth in the 50 free , to go with a fifth-place finish in the 100 backstroke . She knew she was better than those performances , and there was a reason she was not on form : A bout of mononucleosis had hampered her training . <p> Recovering from her illness , Smoliga got herself in good enough shape to win the silver medal at the Pan American Games in Toronto , but she was unable to crack the minute barrier , an absolute must in this day and age in order to be a factor at the biggest events . So , Smoliga kept grinding , eventually elevating herself into a position to excel . <p> She had a superb NCAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship with individual victories in the 50 freestyle and 100 free . The confidence that left was back , and it returned in an all-important year . During the tuneup season for Trials , Smoliga was consistently impressive , the highlight an effort of 59.41 at the USA Swimming Pro Series stop in Indianapolis at the beginning of this month . <p> " It 's like a new wave , " Smoliga said . " Not out with the old , because that 's a bad saying , but it 's in with the new-type deal . I think looking at it collegiately , everyone had such a great NCAA season , and it 's an Olympic year . I think ( NCAAs ) were so successful because people we focused on the Olympic Trials . They wanted to get focused and stay focused . " <p> Smoliga established herself as the one to beat from the start of preliminaries , but she had to play a game of catchup in the final after Baker touched in the lead at the 50-meter mark in 28.68 . Smoliga , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 30.16 more than made up the difference on Baker , who closed in 30.61 . Finishing behind Bilquist in fourth was Ali in 59.69 . <p> Like Smoliga , Baker has been someone with major potential since her teen years , and it was fully realized . <p> Missy Franklin , one of six golds at 2013 world titles by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Natalie Coughlin , by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Between Franklin and Coughlin , they accounted for the past three Olympic crowns , Franklin in London in 2012 and Coughlin both 2004 ( Athens ) and 2008 ( Beijing ) . But instead of adding to their backstroke glory , Franklin and Coughlin could n't generate the speed necessary to put themselves in position to chase another gold . <p> Aside from dealing with the struggles that were evident in her first two rounds , Franklin carried the extra burden of racing the final of the 100 back only 26 minutes after the semifinals of the 200 freestyle . While it 's a short turnaround she 's handled before , namely at the 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavor in Omaha . <p> " I think I am feeling more pressure than I ever have before , " Franklin said . " But that 's all part of the process in learning how to deal with it and learning how to move forward . All I can do is the best I can do , and I had a race strategy and went out and did it . It just was n't good enough . " <p> Coughlin was seeking her third trip to the Olympics in the event , and following a 59.05 performance last summer at the Pan American Games , there was reason to believe she could be a factor . Instead , the 33-year-old could n't muster any of the magic that has dotted her career as a 12-time Olympic medalist . <h> Comments <p> June 29 , 2016 <p> Certainly a changing of the guard in this event but not entirely unexpected . Whilst Franklin is still a good chance to make the team via &amp; 4 ? 200 , its looking increasingly unlikely for Coughlin . Both have been class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kudos warranted for Smoliga who has been the form US swimmer in this event . As for her Rio prospects ; she 's certainly putting herself around finals country although still around 0.5sec off the likely medal pace . <p> Can she close THAT gap ..... whilst I can see her cutting a few more tenths , I 'm sceptical she can bridge the entire gap . However , some of those notionally ahead of her may not swim to their best . I 'd summarise her medal chances as a " possible " rather than a probable or likely one . <p> As for the US medley relay ; whilst clearly not a return to the Franklin levels of 2012/2013 , it is clearly a significant step up from the 2015 deficits . <p> kevin roose June 29 , 2016 <p> You would think from a mental and historic point of view Emilly Seebohm right now is feeling a little releived in not having to face Missy in Rio in the 100 Back . While the Americans will provide some test as will some other girls chances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2016 <p> Kevin , Why would Emily 's chances of gold went up a notch ? We all have established since Kazan heat unless Franklin returns to 2012 form , she was n't in the conversation . Nothing has changed since last year . <p> In fact , based on this trials , Missy 's form is actually worse than last year . This year it 's not just her start . Her swimming is also worse . Her strokes have always been choppy , but in this trials it 's looking spinny and more choppy than usual . Based on this 100 , she may not even get the 200 back . We 'll see . <p> June 29 , 2016 <p> Yes , Kevin , but Em still has to go out there and " do the business " . Her 2016 times , whilst very presentable , have n't exactly sent the message " I own this event " to her competitors . <p> Whilst she clearly deserves favouritism for the 100back ; Neilsen &amp; Hosszu are very real threats . IF Wilson can rediscover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . Barring illness or injury , Seebohm has to be seen as a highly probable medal in this one but the gold ... not sure its as secure a bet as some others <p> June 29 , 2016 <p> Largely agree , ASF . Over the past 2 years , Em has clearly buried any Missy " bogeys " that may once have existed . <p> Kazan certainly DID strike home that Missy 's issues we saw at 2014 PPs were more than just short term . <p> Missy 's route to qualification in the does look a much " softer " passage than the 100 . I 'm struggling to locate another likely sub 2.07 swimmer . <p> As for the international equation for the ; should she ( or any other American ) not be sub 2.06 then this event is really " game on " and somewhat of a lottery to predict . Seebohm is reigning WC but got rolled at AUS Trials . Hocking has never broken 2.06 and folded at the last Olympics . How will Hosszu 's race schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which as yet we have no clear answers . <p> kevin roose June 29 , 2016 <p> Of course it has changed until last night we had no idea how Missy was going to perform now we have real data ......... The fact is she is not in Rio 100 back thus chances have improoved ........ <p> Eugene Chc June 29 , 2016 <p> , after Santa Clara 2015 I did not expect great result from Franklin . After 2015 WC i wrote that she must withdraw from Schmitz , But she stay with him . <p> kevin roose June 29 , 2016 <p> i refer back to a article posted June 26 on Swim Vortex re " Missy " prospects American Trials .... You stated she will qualify for Rio 100/200 back 200 free ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Well so far you are 0/3 ............. <p> Robbos June 29 , 2016 <p> I 'm with you Kevin , no doubt . Missy not in 2012/2013 form . Emily is now not only favourite for 100 , but 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best 2 backstrokers in the world for the last 4 years , with Franklin the other . With Franklin out , Em is clear favourite , remembering Em was beaten only by a superstar ! ! ! In the 200 , not as clear cut , but a slight favourite , with Hocking , Hosszu &amp; not discounting Franklin just yet . <p> Remember at trials , she knew what the 3rd best Australian backstroker swimmer could do ( training partner ) . She did not have to taper or to be at her best to qualify . <p> I like you am very confident of her in the 100 &amp; quietly confident doing the double . <p> June 29 , 2016 <p> kevin , I did not state Missy " will qualify " This is what I wrote : <p> I think Missy can qualify in the individual events : 100/200 back and 200 free . <p> That was before Missy swam her first swim at this trials . I did n't realize how worse her swimming is even compared to last year . It is baffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did nothing but training and sponsors obligations . And yet her technique got worse . <p> Eugene Chc June 29 , 2016 <p> At 2015 it was with 3 months with crazy stupid Schmitz training , now its 15 months 
 he earned an invitation to the biggest sporting spectacle in the world , the competition was held in a 4,000-seat venue . It was 2000 and the pre-meet festivities were limited . Fast forward 16 years , to this year 's United States Olympic Trials , where 14,000 fans spilled into the CenturyLink Center in Omaha on Wednesday night . The pre-meet festivities featured a laser-light show and musical introduction , fountains spewing and flames glowing along the deck . <p> Much has obviously changed in the sport since the first time Michael Phelps tried to qualify for the Olympic Games . What has not differed is Phelps ' excellence in the 200 butterfly , the event that launched his international career as a 15-year-old , and the event that officially made him the first American male in the sport to qualify for five Olympiads . <p> Phelps put together a wire-to-wire triumph , going out in 24.95 and turning at the 100 in 53.07 , just .19 over world-record pace . He fell off on the third lap , going through the 150-meter mark in 1:22.94 . The wining time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went at the National Championships in San Antonio last summer , but all that mattered was qualifying . Faster performances can wait . At the conclusion of his race , Phelps held up five fingers to signify his number of Olympiads , and he wore an ear-to-ear smile during his medal ceremony . Following an on-deck interview , Phelps jogged over to the stands where his fiancee , Nicole Johnson , met him with new son Boomer , who received a few kisses from his dad . <p> " I wanted to go over . I 've always given my family my flowers and stuffed animal , and that 's , I guess , his first stuffed animal from a race , " Phelps said . " I just wanted to share that with them . I do n't see him every day . I try to , but if I do , it 's for a very short moment , so any time I have with him is always very special . " <p> Better known for his skills in the 100 fly , Tom Shields had the seventh-fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early margin he created over everyone but Phelps paid dividends as he held on for second place in 1:55.81 . Eighth at the final turn , Jack Conger made a surge down the last lap , but ultimately ran out of room , finishing third in 1:56.45 . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Men 200M Butterfly <p> 1 <p> <p> Laszlo Cseh HUN , 30 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> 2 <p> <p> Daiya Seto JPN , 22 <p> Japanese Championships JPN , Tokyo <p> 3 <p> <p> Masato Sakai JPN , 21 <p> Japanese Championships JPN , Tokyo <p> 4 <p> <p> Chad Le Clos RSA , 24 <p> Mare Nostrum Round 3 ESP , Barcelona <p> 5 <p> <p> Tamas Kenderesi HUN , 20 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> By qualifying for a fifth Games , Phelps equaled the record set by Dara Torres , whose qualifications actually spanned seven Olympiads . The 30-year-old , who will celebrate a birthday on Thursday , also earned the chance to bolster the record 22 medals he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present itself in Rio de Janeiro in early August . <p> That Phelps notched his fifth Olympic ticket in the 200 fly was more than fitting , given that he was an unknown commodity on the global scene until breaking through in the event at the 2000 Trials in Indianapolis . There , Phelps used a late charge down the final lap to place second to Tom Malchow and become the youngest American male Olympian in the sport in 68 years . He went on to place fifth at the Sydney Games , and by early the next year , the 200 fly had produced the first of Phelps ' 39 world records . <p> Now , he 's going to another five-ring circus . <p> " This is the first event I made the Olympics in 2000 , " Phelps said . " We 've had some good races and not so good races in this event in our Olympics history . " <p> Michael Phelps , 15 , and two blokes who have n't yet realised they 're in the presence of a boy who will become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Phelps vowed he was done with the sport . No more practices . No more dryland workouts . No more trips to Colorado Springs for altitude training at the Olympic Training Center . It can be said that Phelps was done with swimming even before London , what with the many practices he skipped and half-hearted effort he put in , an approach that irritated longtime coach BobBowman . Basically , Phelps pulled out six medals in London via a smoke-and-mirrors magic act , his incredible talent covering the shortcuts he 'd taken . <p> Following a year away , Phelps returned and begin his pursuit of a Rio bid . But a second DUI charge , incurred in September of 2014 , threatened to derail not only his comeback , but more importantly , the direction of his life . As a result , Phelps took the step toward rectifying his errors and took part in a six-week rehabilitation program in Arizona that forced Phelps to conduct a personal inspection . He left with a better understanding of himself and moving in a positive direction . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These days , Phelps is living a happy life , a wedding to Johnson ahead and the birth of his son a life-changing moment . As for the pool , Phelps has savored what he promises will be his finale . He has been dedicated to his craft and has enjoyed being on the deck , again excited to see what he can achieve . <p> One chapter remains . <p> The Rio Games are less than six weeks away , and Phelps will use that period of time for proper rest and for fine-tuning any shortcomings that may prevent him from finishing in style in the grandest way possible . Not only can Phelps add to the 22 medals he 's won in Olympic action , he 's two gold medals shy of 20 . As it stands , his records look unbeatable . He has the opportunity to put them even farther out of reach . <p> Phelps ' time sits only sixth in the world rankings and surely will not elicit jitters in two of his biggest rivals , Hungarian Laszlo Cseh and reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never lost a major international race to Cseh , who earned three silvers behind Phelps in Beijing , while it was Le Clos who reeled in the American for the 200 fly crown in London . <p> There 's no doubt Phelps wants that title back , and has a much-quicker showing is in his pocket . <p> " It 's been a hell of a long time since I 've had a best time , " Phelps said . " I have n't swam best times since 2009 . I would like to have maybe one before I retire . I hope . I hopefully can get at least one in the next couple the next , what four weeks or so . " <h> Comments <p> Richard Stevens June 30 , 2016 <p> BOY ! ! The match up between Cseh , Le Clos , Phelps and any other contender will be set for the history scribes ! ! <p> The Hungarian great has been a man reborn too with a love for the sport that ( dare I say it ) surpasses Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled me .

Maybe now everyone finally understand that there is a big difference between one off fast swim ( last year 's nationals , where prelims was basically just a warm up ) and three rounds of fast swimming ( US OT and the Olympics ) . US swim fans kept thrashing Le Clos and Cseh for having swum slower times in Kazan final last year . <p> This year MP talked about having done the best training and preparation since London . I believe him and I think he 's telling the truth . It is just age that is betraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If age were not a factor , Phelps would have crushed 400 IM , 100/200 free . And yet here he chose to avoid them . <p> Since his " comeback " , I always thought that he should have just abandoned 200 fly and focus more on 200 IM and 100 fly . I am still convinced that swimming 200 fly is a bad idea . But that 's why he 's the GOAT and I 'm not . <p> June 30 , 2016 <p> Correction : <p> This year MP talked about having done the best training and preparation since Beijing . <p> Anon June 30 , 2016 <p> ASF , Maybe he has n't fully tapered , he pulled out of the two freestyle events and maybe Bowman knew he would n't have any difficulty qualifying in butterfly and IM ? <p> Agree that the time wo n't scare or Le Clos . Hell , Murphy and Pebley will prob swim faster in the 200m backstroke <p> June 30 , 2016 <p> @ASF : hate to break it to you man , but Cseh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2016 <p> Anon , It could be that he has not fully tapered . We 'll see in 5 weeks time . But right before Texas Invitational 3 weeks ago , Bob already sad that they are starting tapering that week , and Phelps in interview stated that he wanted to swim fast 200 free in that meet to be considered as relay alternate . I think when you get older , it 's harder to predict how your body react to the usual training and rest . After 2012 US OT Coughlin was interviewed and blamed it on not resting enough before the trials where the only ticket she won was 4 ? 1 free relay alternate . <p> June 30 , 2016 <p> , but Cseh is only focusing and training on 100 and 200 fly . MP was trying in 3 individual events and was hoping to get into the relays as well . <p> Even Coughlin was able to split 52.9 in 4 ? 1 Barcelona as it was the only event she swam . Or that she swam one off 59.0 last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year after more training . <p> June 30 , 2016 <p> Lots of factors go into overall performance . I 'm not going to say age is irrelevant , but let 's not forget Michael 's training after 2008 was spotty at best . And he was drinking quite heavily during that time . During his first retirement , he was out of the pool completely for a couple of years . In fall of 2014 he was out of the pool and in rehab for 6 weeks . It was only after that he finally got things together and re-focused on his training . Pre-2008 MP never even went a day without missing a practice . I think he and Bob will make a final decision re : events based on the training leading up to the games . If this is just a partial taper things are actually looking good , would n't want him to peak too early . He was pretty wrecked at Texas meet not too long ago . Still have my money on the Goat . <p> June 30 , 2016 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one relay- maybe the 4 ? 100 this time .@@9628946 <h> The risks and 
 she prevailed in the 400 individual medley , consequently becoming a first-time Olympian , DiRado completed a sweep of the medley events at the United States Olympic Trials on Wednesday night . Her double was the result of a triumph in the 200 individual medley , which she covered in 2:09.54 for third in the world rankings . <p> DiRado left little in doubt after the opening butterfly leg , where she was fifth . Shortly into the backstroke leg , DiRado was into the lead , and there to stay . By the end of the backstroke leg , her advantage was nearly a second over Ella Eastin and after the breaststroke leg , she was more than a second clear of Caitlin Leverenz . <p> While DiRado enjoyed a no-doubt-about-it victory , Leverenz became this year 's heartbreak story . The bronze medalist in the 200 medley at the London Games in 2012 , Leverenz entered the final lap in second place and looking good for a return trip to the Team USA roster . However , Melanie Margalis had other ideas . <p> Coming off the 200 freestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely secured a relay berth for Rio , Margalis looked like the double was going to take a toll . She was eighth after the fly and sixth after the backstroke , leaving herself with a sizable deficit to overcome .

She used a powerful finish to prevail in 2:10.11 , at 2:10.16 after taking an extra stroke at the wall .

Margalis , too , has the potential to fight for silver or bronze , and without a 200 freestyle not long before the medley , she should be fresher for the event , provided she qualifies for the final . <p> DiRado and Margalis are far from done this week .

It has been the defining factor for me these past two days . " <p> As Adams was introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story about how she came to contest the 200 butterfly . When she was younger , her father told her there were n't many entries in the 200 fly , and if she entered , it would be her best chance at an award . That explanation by her dad was enough to convince Adams , whose decision is paying off . <p> On the way to victory , Adams turned to her trademark finish , which rates among the best in the world and which helped her corral the silver medal at last summer 's World Championships in Kazan . Adams covered her final lap in 33.04 , a half-second faster than anyone else in the field , while her third lap was also the quickest by more than a half-second . <p> There is work ahead for Adams , as seven women have been faster this season , including world leader Madeline Groves of Australia at 2:05.47 and Germany 's Fraziska at 2:05.77 . They are the only ladies under 2:06 and there 's little doubt Adams will be in contention in an event that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she not only achieved a goal of becoming an Olympian , she also added to what has been a spectacular week for athletes .

 USA : after Universiade success , he heads for the Olympic Games among title favourites <p> At every United States Olympic Trials , a few groups of teammates emerge as being on fire . Not just one swimmer , or two , but the majority of the squad . This week , athletes from Texas and Georgia have looked sharp , personal-best efforts the norm . The Longhorns and Bulldogs have been joined by the Cal guys in the ultra-hot category , and Josh Prenot kept the roll going for the Golden Bears . <p> With teammates Ryan Murphy and Tom Shields already on the Olympic squad , and Nathan Adrian joining the crew later in the evening , Prenot did n't want to be left behind when the plane leaves for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . Using a late surge that boosted him to the front of the field , Prenot established an American record en route to victory in the 200 breaststroke . <p> A 22-year-old , Prenot stopped the clock in 2:07.17 , bettering the American standard of 2:07.42 , set by Eric Shanteau during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's time also was good for No. 2 in history , trailing only the world record of Japan 's ( 2:07.01 ) . was followed to the wall by Kevin Cordes ( 2:08.00 ) and Will Licon ( 2:08.14 ) , Cordes earning a second Olympic berth to accompany his win earlier in the meet in the 100 breast . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Men 200M Breaststroke <p> 1 <p> <p> Joshua Prenot USA , 22 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 2 <p> <p> Marco Koch GER , 26 <p> Euro Meet LUX , Luxembourg <p> 3 <p> <p> Kevin Cordes USA , 22 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 4 <p> <p> Andrew Willis GBR , 25 <p> British Championships GBR , Glasgow <p> 5 <p> <p> Yasuhiro Koseki JPN , 24 <p> Japanese Championships JPN , Tokyo <p> 5 <p> <p> William Licon USA , 21 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 7 <p> <p> Ross Murdoch GBR , 22 <p> European Championships GBR , London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was tactically superb over his four laps , sitting fourth through the opening two laps before moving up to second behind Cordes at the 150-meter mark . Over the last lap , Prenot split a field-best 32.98 to run down Cordes and pull away from Licon . For Cordes , he also had a late surge to fend off Licon . <p> " That was good , " Prenot said in an understatement . " My focus kind of the mistake I made last night , was being a little too aggressive through the first 100 . I just tried to stay calm in order to finish hard my last 50 . It feels amazing ... That was probably the most nervous I 've ever been for a race , so staying calm was a bit of a challenge . It ended up working out ... This was my last race , my last chance to make the team . I did n't feel like waiting another four years , so the pressure was on . " <p> The United States now boasts three of the performers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While Prenot sits No. 1 , Cordes ranks third off his 2:07.84 from semifinals , and Licon is tied for fifth . The effort by Prenot was simply the latest in a long line of strong performances this year . And , it was the best . <p> Kevin Cordes , by Peter Bick <p> For Cordes , he was racing a freeroll of sorts , the pressure off his shoulders after qualifying earlier in the week in the 100 breast . Training under Sergio Lopez , Cordes blasted to the front of the pack from the start and was well under world-record pace through the 150 . However , that 's when Prenot shifted gears . <p> Cordes was stellar throughout the 200 breast , leading the way in each round and setting a U.S. Open record in the semifinals . His performance echoed what he did in the 100 breast , where he also paced each of the rounds and proved too much for a quality field . Establishing himself as a dual threat in the breaststroke , Cordes has accomplished a feat that is far from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feat , as did Brendan Hansen at certain points of his career , Cordes is in rare company , especially when it comes to the status of the breaststroke at the present moment . <p> While Japan 's Yasuhiro Koseki has proven himself capable of doing double duty , Great Britain 's Adam Peaty and South Africa 's Cameron van der Burgh are primarily 100 breaststrokers . On the flip side , Germany 's Marco Koch is mainly linked to the 200 breast . Meanwhile , Hungarian Daniel Gyurta rides the fence , his excellence in the 200 breaststroke , where he 's the reigning Olympic champion , occasionally complemented by strong showings in the 100 breast . <p> Looking back : <p> and Licon followed identical game plans into their work on Night Five . Both men were scheduled to race the 200 individual medley during the morning preliminaries , but scratched out in order to focus on the 200 breast . Their decisions were not based on a physical toll , as the 200 breast preceded the medley at night . Rather , the decisions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential distractions . It worked for both , and best for Prenot . <p> " ( Cordes ) has looked strong throughout this meet , " Prenot said . " He consistently gets it done every summer , so being next to him was a good thing for me because I knew where I was the whole race . " <h> Comments <p> Looks like trials will end with no WR , a sign of the times after the shiny suit ban ..... World records are now very hard to break which is great for the sport ? <p> July 1 , 2016 <p> Bad Anon , There was no WR either in 2012 US OT . In general , I agree that world records getting harder to break is great for the sport , but not in swimming . Thanks to a few WRs , some great swimmers who swam really great textile records have not gotten their prize money ( from breaking WR ) as well as recognition they deserve . eg. Agnel 's 1:43 , Cate 's 52.3 , Cameron 's 47.0 Those are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA recognized them . <p> July 1 , 2016 <p> Dave Durden really knows how to prepare his swimmers for major meets . He was even willing to pull out Murphy , Pebley and from Conference meet in order to swim them at LCM pro series , and then sent them to Canadian trials too . It 's all paying off . Instead of Bowman as the men 's head coach , they should have selected Durden. <h> Tony Blair urges 
 came from Down Under earlier this year could be heard in all corners of the world . There was no missing it , really . When Cameron McEvoy rocketed to a clocking of 47.04 in the 100 freestyle at the Australian Trials , the time standing as a textile record , the event instantly had its gold-medal favorite for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . <p> But reigning Olympic champion Nathan Adrian is not going to yield his coveted prize without a fight . <p> Putting his American dominance in the event on display , Adrian claimed victory by more than a half-second , his effort of 47.72 the second-swiftest in the world this year and comfortably ahead of the 48.23 turned in by rising sprint star Caeleb Dressel . Ryan Held ( 48.26 ) and Anthony Ervin ( 48.54 ) confirmed relay duty in Rio while Jimmy Feigen ( 48.57 ) and Blake Pieroni ( 48.78 ) will await word if they 'll be selected . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Men 100M Freestyle <p> 1 <p> 47.04 <p> Cameron McEvoy AUS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47.72 <p> Nathan Adrian USA , 27 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 3 <p> 47.96 <p> Ning CHN , 23 <p> Chinese Championships CHN , Foshan <p> 4 <p> 47.97 <p> Jeremy Stravius FRA , 28 <p> French Championships FRA , Montpellier <p> 5 <p> 48.00 <p> Florent Manaudou FRA , 26 <p> Golden Tour FRA , Marseille <p> 6 <p> 48.01 <p> Clement Mignon FRA , 23 <p> French Championships FRA , Montpellier <p> 7 <p> 48.03 <p> Kyle Chalmers AUS , 18 <p> Australian Championships AUS , Adelaide <p> When Adrian posted a performance of 47.91 in the semifinals , it marked the first time since the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona in which he cracked the 48-second barrier . Obviously , there were struggles during the 2014 and 2015 campaigns , particularly evident in the fact that Adrian went only a best of 48.31 in the year prior to an Olympiad . <p> Throughout the 2016 season , however , Adrian started to put together consistent efforts . More , his performances were quicker than the prior year , as he threatened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48.06 . It was a matter of time before he 'd put together something in the 47-second realm and return to the form he knew in London . <p> With back-to-back , Adrian also provided the United States with the comfort that it will have a stud for the 400 freestyle relay . With that squad bounced from the prelims at the 2015 World Championships in Kazan , there was a real need for an American morale boost . The question is whether Adrian will get the necessary support to put the American unit in contention for gold , or any spot on the podium . <p> A look at the relay landscape shows that the Aussies boast rising teenage star Kyle Chalmers to go with McEvoy , while the French boast a potential loaded lineup of Jeremy Stravius ( 47.97 ) , Florent Manaudou ( 48.00 ) , Clement Mignon ( 48.01 ) and ( 48.43 ) . Meanwhile , Fabien Gilot has long been a relay stalwart and could be called into action . <p> Outside of Adrian , the U.S. does n't have anyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free is at . Although sat out the 100 free , it must be assumed that he 'll be on the relay in Rio , provided he is on target and looks good during his preparation and at training camp . The addition of Phelps will go a long way toward putting the United States into contender status , defending champions France heading into Rio with a solid shot at a successful defence as the nation with three men in the world top 6 over 100m this year . <p> For Dressel , his second-place finish was the realization of the vast potential he possesses . For a few years , the University of Florida standout has been pegged as a future star in American and global sprinting , age-group records and short-course standards among his career highlights . The 19-year-old , which makes him a baby by sprinting standards , will now get the chance to race on the biggest stage available in his sport . <h> Lynx Infantry Fighting

Phelps is the three-time Olympic champion in the event and a three-time world champion . As for Lochte , he 's won the past four world titles and owns the world record at 1:54.00 . For 14,000 fans inside the CenturyLink Center , they 're going to receive a treat . <p> Adding to the hype , Lochte and Phelps are the only individuals to ever go under 1:55 in the event , and they 'll be chasing the top time in the world this year , a 1:55.07 from Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone back and forth a number of times in this race and during the big meets , " Phelps said .

On the tennis court , Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe had a good thing going , as did Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert . Simply , the sporting world relies on rivalries for enhanced intrigue and storylines . <p> The best rivalry in the pool added its latest chapter on Friday night . <p> For more than a decade , since they first clashed at the 2004 Olympic Trials in Long Beach , Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte have owned the 200 individual medley . They 've set world records , accumulated Olympic medals and corralled world championships . For every challenger to come along , international and domestic , it 's been quite obvious that Phelps and Lochte live in another stratosphere . <p> As the United States Olympic Trials wrapped up Night Six at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha , the dominance of Phelps and Lochte was on full display as they tore away from the rest of the field , Phelps prevailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The times sit second and third in the world rankings , but Phelps and Lochte appear to have a lot more to give once fully rested for the Olympics in Rio . <p> The tandem , which has combined for 33 Olympic medals ( 22 for Phelps ) , finished three seconds clear of third-place finisher ( 1:59.09 ) . It was Phelps ' fourth straight win over Lochte in the event at the Olympic Trials . <p> Although Phelps enjoyed a wire-to-wire triumph , Lochte never let him go and was within striking distance throughout the race . On the opening butterfly leg , Phelps took a 25.05 to 25.19 lead , but that edge narrowed to 53.96 to 54.03 after the backstroke . Following the breaststroke leg , Phelps was at , with Lochte at 1:27.83 . <p> The crowd was as loud as it 's been all week , both prior to the start of the race and as the combatants battled through the four laps . Each man seemed to have his equal share of supporters , but the fans -more than anything -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't as fast as they 've been , but it was a tight race , and that 's what was anticipated . More , it was the final meeting between the pair on American soil . <p> " Ryan and I always have a great race , " Phelps said . " Him and I have been racing since 2004 together , and I think when we race each other , we bring each other to a different level . We take each other to that next step , that race especially .

Statistics and history tell the story : <p> Between them , Phelps and Lochte boast the performances of all-time , and account for the only efforts under the 1:55 barrier . <p> Phelps and Lochte have each medaled in the 200 I.M. at the past three Olympiads , Phelps claiming gold on each occasion and Lochte collecting a pair of silver medals and a bronze medal . <p> They 've combined for the past seven global titles , dating to the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona . While Phelps walked away with gold medals in 2003 , 2005 and 2007 , Lochte has won every world championship since 2009 -- four in all . <p> At the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai , Lochte and Phelps engaged in their finest duel . While Lochte lowered the world record to 1:54.00 , Phelps posted the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I knew going into this race , it was definitely going to be a dogfight until the end , " Lochte said .

It 's been a long journey . The journey is not over . We have another month to get ready and show the world that the U.S. is still No. 1 . " <p> If anyone can give Phelps and Lochte a push in Rio , it 's Kosuke Hagino . The Japanese standout , who missed last year 's World Championships while recovering from a fractured elbow , nearly joined Phelps and Lochte in the sub-1:55 club when he generated a 1:55.07 showing earlier this year .

He really is the second best of all time behind Phelps . <p> My two cents on Phelps so far in this meet : he made it in his first two events so far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is completely rested , which partially explains the relatively slow times . But that 's not a full explanation . Seems like things are n't going as planned . <p> Bob and Michael have a month to try to sort things out . <p> kevin roose July 2 , 2016 <p> Apart from Ledecky i do n't  beleive any swimmer would go into this meet not fully rested . I have heard time and time again from swimmers and from people on this site " that the American Olympic Trials are the toughest meet in the world " . Missy Franklin said on a interview for Rio official website " that the Olympics themselves are a piece of cake compared to the American Trials themselves " . Yet i hear with great amusement in comments on this site she may not have fully rested and therefore has underestimated her rivals . <p> craig swanson July 2 , 2016 <p> Age does not stop these two greats . The same incredible passion , intense rivalry an killer instinct that has seen them dominate this event since Athens . <p> craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or disadvantage having your Olympic trials so close to the main event ?

Which is a fine line to walk . <p> Other swimmers who do n't really have a shot at making the team can do a major taper . They are hoping to do a best time , or better yet knock off a partially tapered top swimmer . <p> Robbos July 2 , 2016 <p> , the reason why so little people 3 peat , is because it 's difficult . Those who have achieved it , you will notice that they had a reduce schedule . Now Phelps is the GOAT &amp; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of events going for 4 peat .

I undertand that Australia 's swimmers do not go into a major meet unless they are tapered . At least I think that is the case . Not so with American swimmers ?

 the top ticket for the USA in the Rio 2016 100m backstroke battle by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Forecasts of greatness are not unusual in sports , especially those that hinge on a stopwatch . Not all pan out , of course . For every 11-year-old Michael Phelps who develops into an Olympic champion , there are many more young stars who fizzle , their best days realized early on . A familiar refrain : What ever happened to ..... ? <p> In the case of Ryan Murphy , he was someone who lit up the scoreboard at meets , his times almost difficult to digest as he broke National Age Group records even before his teenage years . And he did n't just break records while developing his vast backstroke talent . Rather , he took down records that belonged to some big names -- seven-time Olympic medalist Aaron Peirsol at the top of the list . Murphy was the definition of a can't-miss commodity . <p> And one of the few whose early excellence was maintained . <p> A couple of days after surviving the gauntlet that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro by prevailing in the 200 backstroke at the United States Olympic Trials in Omaha . Covering his four laps in a career-best of 1:53.95 , the 20-year-old vaulted to second in the world rankings and set himself up for a run at a backstroke double in Rio . <p> Making the victory that much more enjoyable was the fact that he had the opportunity to celebrate with California teammate , who earned the second Olympic invitation behind a time of 1:54.77 , good for fourth in the world . Pebley finished ahead of ( 1:55.33 ) , marking the third time this week that a reigning Olympic backstroke champion had a potential defense short-circuited . In addition to Clary , Matt Grevers was eliminated from the men 's 100 back and Missy Franklin was knocked out of the women 's 100 back . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Men 200M Backstroke <p> 1 <p> <p> Mitchell Larkin AUS , 22 <p> Australian Championships AUS , Adelaide <p> 2 <p> <p> Evgeny Rylov RUS , 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Xu CHN , 20 <p> Chinese Championships CHN , Foshan <p> 4 <p> <p> Ryan Murphy USA , 21 <p> Canadian Olympic Trials CAN , Toronto <p> 5 <p> <p> Jacob Pebley USA , 22 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> The 200 back unfolded very differently for Murphy than the 100 back . In a dogfight with runnerup David Plummer and in the shorter distance , Murphy 's victory was not assured until the clock flashed a .02 triumph . This time around , Murphy enjoyed a coronation of sorts , as he was ahead of the field for the last three laps , and comfortably so . <p> " It was awesome , " Murphy said . " I had a lot of emotion after that race . I was sharing it with one of my best friends in Jacob . I 've seen him fight every day . You guys do n't see it , but we push each other to the max every day . To see that , a dream come true for both of us . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold medal would be satisfying in itself , Murphy is gifted enough to suggest the possibility of a double . He possesses both natural speed and endurance , a combination not readily found . Equally important , the youngster is mentally tough and undaunted by a challenge or a skilled foe . <p> The above paragraph is not to state Murphy is the favorite in each backstroke discipline , only that he has what it takes to win . In order to stand on the top of the podium , Murphy will have to take down the likes of Australian Mitch Larkin , Japan 's Ryosuke Irie , Russia 's Evgeny Rylov and China 's Jiayu Xu to name just a few rivals . <p> Jacob Pebley <p> In the case of Pebley , his march toward a berth to Rio resembled that of Josh Prenot , his Cal teammate under coach Dave Durden . While Prenot built momentum during the year in the 200 breaststroke , ultimately winning that event in American-record time on Thursday night , Pebley spent the 2016 campaign producing better and better efforts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdistance Clary , who was not only racing for the right to defend his Olympic crown , but was staring at his last opportunity to qualify for Rio after several misses earlier in the meet . <p> " I had to look at the scoreboard several times to believe it , " Pebley said . " It was like I was in a dream the whole race . When I saw the " 2 " next to my name , I started freaking out . " <p> By adding his name to the Team USA roster , Pebley upped the number of Cal Golden Bears to wear Red , White and Blue in Rio to five . In addition to Murphy , Pebley and Prenot , Nathan Adrian and Tom Shields are also bound for Brazil . <p> For Clary , the race was his last .

Pebley 's PBs in the 100 looked solid precursors of a strong challenge in his stronger event . <p> How does this fill out the wider picture for Rio ? I feel John has summed it up well . Murphy is nigh assured of one gold , as he will at minimum swim the heats of the .... an event where USA will need to self-immolate to lose . <p> Both Americans should , at minimum , make the final and can be seen as medal contenders . <p> The show down with Larkin ? ?

In the pool nothing gets better than two quality swimmers from America and Australia go head to head for the BIG PRIZE ....... <p> July 2 , 2016 <p> Two Americans , one Aussie and maybe one Frenchman over the shorter trip .

 note , the fact that Abbey Weitzeil and Simone Manuel finished atop the field in the 100 freestyle during Thursday 's United States Olympic Trials signifies that a youthful push is unfolding in arguably -- the sport 's glamour event . And from an American standpoint , having some young blood flowing elicits hope for the future . <p> Now , let 's get to the bad news . <p> On a negative note , the fact that the Olympic-qualifying times inside the CenturyLink Center pool were only 53.28 and 53.52 indicates the United States has a long way to climb , especially as it pertains to relay potential at the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . To put into perspective where the U.S. stands , consider : Australia already boasts three ladies under the 53-second realm , with one Cate Campbell teasing the 52-second barrier . <p> After Weitzeil and Manuel finished in the top spots , securing the individual berths to Rio , Amanda Weir ( 53.75 ) and Lia Neal ( 53.77 ) occupied the third and fourth positions for duty on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dana Vollmer was sixth in 53.92 , also earning relay selection . On the outside was Katie Ledecky , the distance ace who was trying to move down and qualify for the relay . Ledecky had the fastest closing 50 , but dug too big a hole on the first lap and placed seventh in 53.99 . <p> " It was crazy , " Weitzeil said . " I knew I was going to have to put my head down and fight for it because I knew everyone would be right there with me ... I 've been to a lot of bigger meets or big meets , but this is a different one . The nerves and the vibes in the ready room are totally different . It 's a big , nerve-wracking meet . " <p> Weitzeil and Manuel share similar stories , as both deferred a year of college in order to prepare for the Olympic Trials .

Down the last lap , the 19-year-olds slowed slightly , but enough to allow their competitors to catch up . Weitzeil 's time was good for a U.S. Open record , breaking the 53.30 by Campbell in 2008 . <p> While the 21-year-old Neal counts as a youngster making the relay , the other three members were from the old guard . Weir earned her third Olympic trip , joining 2004 and 2012 bids , and Schmitt and Vollmer will also be competing in a third Olympiad . <p> " The last 15 meters were brutal , " Manuel said .

With the Australians well ahead of the rest of the world , silver or bronze looks most likely . However , to ensure that scenario unfolds , greater speed will be needed . <p> Racing the 100 freestyle was not a difficult decision for Ledecky , given her desire to add the 400 freestyle relay to her program . The question was whether she could simultaneously remain a distance force and muster the necessary speed to be a factor in the 100 distance . Obviously , it was a tough balancing act . <p> Despite placing seventh , it 's difficult to fathom that Ledecky opened the morning with a performance of 8:10.91 in the 800 freestyle and capped the night in sub-54 in the 100 free . As a rough analogy , that effort is akin to Jamaica 's Usain Bolt running a 9.75 in the 100-meter dash in the morning and coming back at night to run the 1500 in 3:29 . <p> " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and learn some things .

 Ledecky of the United States of America - by Patrick B. Kraemer - This image was the SwimVortex choice of Photo of the Year 2015 , Patrick having captured a bulls-eye snapshot that summed up Ledecky , attitude , achievement and a target reached <p> At some point , she is going to hit a ceiling , right ? Somewhere along the way , her times are going to stagnate , and stop dropping , right ? One day , she wo n't race alone , right ? One day , there will be someone capable of giving her a challenge , capable of making a race featuring Katie Ledecky a tight affair . Right ? <p> Maybe . <p> The freight train that is Ledecky , the 19-year-old phenom who might already be the finest distance swimmer in history , kept on chugging at the United States Olympic Trials on Saturday night . Actually , chugging is a poor choice of words . Rather , Ledecky kept barreling over the competition , her latest casualties the women who stepped on the starting blocks with her in the 800 freestyle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) schedule for the upcoming Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Ledecky scorched the pool inside the CenturyLink Center with a clocking of 8:10.32 , the third-fastest time in history . The effort wrapped up a dominant week in Omaha in which Ledecky , the reigning Olympic gold medalist in the 800 free , also claimed victories in the 200 freestyle and 400 freestyle . With the 800 free relay as part of her program , too , Ledecky has a chance to leave Rio with four gold medals . <p> What Ledecky has done over the past four years is simply mesmerizing , her talent something the sport does not see often . Her dominance is so incredible , it stands alongside that of Michael Phelps and Mark Spitz . Yes , those guys ruled in a multitude of strokes , but it 's her gap on the competition that runs parallel . <p> When Ledecky posted the third-fastest time ( 8:10.91 ; now fourth ) in the history of the 800 freestyle during Friday 's preliminaries and called the performance " easy , " the message was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14,000 fans in the building . And right from the start , she gave the people what they wanted to see . <p> " I did what I needed to do here , and it set me up to do what I want to do in Rio , " Ledecky said . " I 'm really excited to get back to work this week and see if I can get a little faster , and then taper down and rest up for Rio . " <p> Well under world-record pace , Ledecky covered the first 100 in 57.83 and was at 1:58.75 at the 200 , ridiculous splits for the 16-lap event . Ledecky was still under world-record pace at the midway point , checking in at 4:02.21 for the 400 . Only Ledecky and fellow American Leah Smith have gone faster in the open 400 this year . Smith , meanwhile , took second behind Ledecky in , with Stephanie Peacock finishing third in . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Women 800M Freestyle <p> 1 <p> <p> Katie Ledecky USA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 <p> <p> Jessica Ashwood AUS , 23 <p> USA Pro Swim Series USA , Santa Clara <p> 3 <p> <p> Leah Smith USA , 21 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 4 <p> <p> Boglarka Kapas HUN , 23 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> 4 <p> <p> Brittany MacLean CAN , 22 <p> Canadian Olympic Trials CAN , Toronto <p> " It does a lot for my confidence , especially because I did n't swim any individual events at Worlds last summer , " Smith said . " Swimming well here just gives me the confidence that I can be a medal contender , which is what the U.S. needs . " <h> A Higher Plinth in the Pantheon <p> Katie Ledecky by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Ledecky now owns the times in the history of the event , an impressive feat without question . Yet , it 's even more remarkable that her margin over the second-fastest performer , Great Britain 's Rebecca Adlington , sits at more than seven seconds . A little more perspective on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's best of 8:14.10 , Ledecky is about a half-second quicker on each lap . <p> The record book reveals that the legendary Janet Evans still ranks as the No. 5 all-time performer in the event , her 8:16.22 mark from the 1989 Pan Pacific Championships a world record for nearly 19 years . Next to what Ledecky has done , Evans ' swim seems pedestrian as farcical as that statement may sound . Closest to Ledecky ever in textile matches closest among peers heading for Rio : Jazmin Carlin , of Great Britain , with an . <p> When Ledecky gets to Rio , officials are not going to place any gold medals in her hand until she 's completed the required workload . But with Ledecky unbeatable in the 400 free and 800 free and the United States seemingly out of reach in the 800 freestyle relay , there is only one real question mark surrounding Nation 's Capital Swim Club star : Can she win the 200 free , as she did at the World Championships last summer , and complete the distance trifecta ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Debbie Meyer at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City , Meyer still the only person male or female to mine three freestyle gold medals in an Olympiad . <p> Ledecky figures to be much faster at the Games , her world records on high alert . <p> " I think the good thing from this week is I had a pretty good feel for everything , " Ledecky said . " What went right , what went wrong . In that race , I knew I did n't bring my legs . I was n't able to get them in the rhythm of my stroke and that showed up with the time and how I felt in the race . But just being aware of those things , moving forward , we can work on those things and be better in Rio . " <h> Comments <p> July 3 , 2016 <p> a 8:10 and many are not too impressed and slightly disappointed it 's not a WR , In some swimming websites many people have even claimed Ledecky 's 800 WR is a certainty after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in smaller installments ? , like 8:14 and then etc. so in half a second each time . But if she had done that , maybe she would n't have broken it . You take WR when it happens . <p> Kieren Perkins was told by his coach to take it easy in 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria , because 1994 Worlds was just 3 weeks later in Rome . But he felt strong during the 1,500 race so he kept going , and he broke 800 WR on the way to 1,500 WR . In Rome , he won gold of course , but not in WR . Had he not broken the WRs in Victoria , maybe he would n't have broken them that year at all . And that Victoria swim was the last time Perkins broke 800 and 1,500 WRs . <p> Cate Campbell also gave us a reminder yesterday that when a WR happens , it happens , you take it . <p> Back to Ledecky , it is obvious that if there is only one swimmer who did n't have to fully taper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can break the 800 WR in Rio , but unlike many people , I do n't think think it will be anywhere close to 8:00 because for that to happen , she needs her 400 to come down to 3:55 , and as great as Ledecky , I do n't think it will happen . <p> Many Ledecky fans seem to expect Ledecky to keep breaking WRs forever , but they forget that age is just not an abstract idea . Ledecky has done the most tremendous thing by breaking distance records at the age of 18 , because historically women swimmers had done breaking d records at that age . I hope she does it again in Rio , if only the place and occasion is more grand than Austin . <p> Craig Lord July 3 , 2016 <p> ? ? asf : " What dya go and do that for mate ? " John Carew ( Mr. John Carew , as KP always said ) post world-record . <p> kevin roose July 3 , 2016 <p> While Ledecky should romp home in the 400/800 at Rio ...... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class field in prospect Pellegrini , Mckeon and Sjostrom ( if she swims it ) Possibly Franklin ? ? ? BRING IT ON ...... <p> Yozhik July 3 , 2016 <p> It looks like 8:11 is the time that Ledecky is comfortable with . She got stocked around this time last year making many close but unsuccessful attempts to break it . She showed slightly better times at this meet doing it in different combinations . That 's why 8:07 in Kazan is still shocking to me and 8:06 in Austin is indeed a rock hard World record achieved with great pain . Looking back I am almost certain now that she was tapered for this meet . What was the reaon ? Maybe the presence of Sjostrom . Anyway , whatever it was we have to look at those times as what most likely can be expected from tapered Ledecky . There was slight improvement during the season that we had a pleasure to observe at trials . So I think that 53.6 ; 1:54 flat , 3:57 mid ; 8:06 flat is what realistically can be expected from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of being unpredictable . She made 8:07 when nobody , I repeat , nobody expected that . More of interest to me in this race was not Ledecky , but Leah Smith . She bettered her personal best again , but I expected much more . Splitting -- 4:11.40 Is kind of slow for the long distance swimmer who can make 4:00.6 at 400 race . Maybe she tried after very intensive meet , maybe she had no intention to impressed anybody , but this result did n't answer the question what her chances are to be at podium in Rio at 800m . No doubts that she was tapered for this meet . I wish her not to loose this form during next month . <h> National News <h> 
 remains at the United States Olympic Trials , Michael Phelps wrapped up his final competition on American soil on Saturday night , and he did so in style . Pulling the most popular tool out of his bag of tricks , Phelps ran down the competition and won the 100 butterfly in Omaha . <p> In what was a vintage Phelps performance , the five-time Olympian made the turn in fourth place before surging in the final 15 meters and posting a winning time of 51.00 . Phelps ' boost down the stretch enabled him to move ahead of midway leader Seth Stubblefield ( 51.24 ) , who was also caught by Tom Shields ( 51.20 ) , his training partner with Cal Aquatics , while Jack Conger was just 0.02sec away from Stubblefield .. <p> The spectators who filled the CenturyLink Center to capacity gave Phelps a resounding ovation after the 100 fly , and again showered the 22-time Olympic medalist with applause during the medal ceremony . For his part , Phelps took in the moment with appreciation , acknowledging the crowd with raised arms . Still in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit for a time when he does , finally , move on . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Men 100M Butterfly <p> 1 <p> 50.86 <p> Laszlo Cseh HUN , 30 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> 2 <p> 51.00 <p> Michael Phelps USA , 31 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 3 <p> 51.20 <p> Thomas Shields USA , 25 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 4 <p> 51.22 <p> Konrad Czerniak POL , 26 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> 5 <p> 51.24 <p> Li CHN , 17 <p> Chinese Championships CHN , Foshan <p> 5 <p> 51.24 <p> Seth Stubblefield USA , 22 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 7 <p> 51.26 <p> Jack Conger USA , 21 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 8 <p> 51.28 <p> Timothy Phillips USA , 25 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> Phelps ' finish put the perfect bow on his days as it brought back memories of past rallies . For Stubblefield , he joined a long list of guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crocker and Milorad Cavic . <h> Next Stroke ... <p> When Phelps arrives in Rio for his fifth Olympiad , and 16 years after he made his Olympic debut as a 15-year-old in Sydney , he 'll have three individual events to contest , with the possibility of seeing duty in three relays . More , Phelps will have a pair of opportunities to make Olympic history ( something he 's good at ) , as Phelps can win four consecutive gold medals in both the 200 individual medley and 100 fly . <p> In Olympic lore , only track and field athletes Al Oerter ( discus ) and Carl Lewis ( long jump ) have won gold at four straight Games . Phelps has a chance to do it twice . It 's not surprising , really , what with Phelps a human magnet for Olympic records . Remember , this is the guy who has more medals than anyone in history , more gold medals than anyone else and is the only swimmer to ever win eight medals in an Olympiad , pulling that feat on two occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Russian gymnast Aleksandr was the first athlete to win eight medals at a single Games , claiming three gold , four silver and a bonze at the boycotted Olympics of Moscow 1980 . <p> Seeing Phelps race in Lane Seven was a rare scene , the result of his sixth-place finish in the semifinals from the previous night . That race was called to the starting blocks just 28 minutes after Phelps won the 200 individual medley in his latest duel with longtime rival Ryan Lochte . Consequently , it was tough to get a read on how much energy was exerted , and the level of impact the medley had on his fly performance . <p> " Yesterday really hurt , " Phelps said . " That took a lot out of me . I was pretty much in the warmdown pool for 40 minutes . I have a lot of emotion here with Boomer ( his son ) and with family here , and being my last meet on American soil , there is a lot going on . I 'm happy we did everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( am a ) possibility for relays . We 'll see what happens . " <p> It does not take an expert on the sport to realize that Phelps was not in peak form this week . His times did not rival what he went at last summer 's National Championships in San Antonio , leading to the belief there is much more to come in Brazil . We 've seen that scenario unfold before , Phelps treating Trials as his tuneup meet before amping up the performances while under the spotlight . Although age has made things tougher , there 's no reason to believe the 31-year-old wo n't be able to replicate that approach in a little more than a month . <p> Shields actually pulled off a bigger comeback than Phelps . Turning seventh at the halfway point , Shields dug deep and put together a strong finish to squeeze out a second Olympic berth . Earlier in the meet , Shields held on for second place behind Phelps in the 200 fly . The 100 fly , though , is his best event , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio . Work remains . <p> " I 'm thankful to be done with this and get five weeks to figure out what comes next , " Shields said . " ... I do n't want to take away from what anyone else has done , but I do n't think anyone in particular would be too stoked with their performance here in the butterflies on the men 's side . " <h> Comments <p> kevin roose July 3 , 2016 <p> Well that was a standout swim from Michael pure quality ..... the way he has approached these trials and gone about his business has been first class . He has n't  bitten off more than he can chew and once again a headline act come Rio in the pool . <p> Lennart van Haaften July 3 , 2016 <p> also won 8 medals , in 1980 . <p> It 'll be very interesting to see how much Phelps can improve in Rio . He 'll need to be quite a bit faster for gold medals . I 'd say one individual gold would be a great achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 3 , 2016 <p> That was a gutsy swim by Phelps . Like Franklin in 200 free , the champion mentality got them to the finish line . And what a race ! ! ! I feel sorry but not sorry for Stubblefield and Phillips . They just do n't have it in them a champion mentality . <p> July 3 , 2016 <p> That last quote from Shields says it all . <p> I forgot , Conger also does n't have it . He did n't have it at NCAA , he does n't have it here . <p> Though the Azzurri 
 Name the female athletes who have collected three victories at the United States Olympic Trials this week in Omaha . One of the answers is simple : Katie Ledecky . The other answer is n't as obvious , but she 's had a sensational seven days at the CenturyLink Center in Omaha . Step forward Maya DiRado . <p> The underdog on paper in the women 's 200 backstroke , as she was racing next to world-record holder Missy Franklin , DiRado came through in convincing fashion , touching the wall in 2:06.90 for a triumph of almost a second over Franklin ( 2:07.89 ) . DiRado 's time vaulted her to fourth in the world rankings , .41 off the world-leading 2:06.49 of Australian Belinda Hocking . <p> DiRado was in control for the bulk of the race , turning at the 50-meter mark in second place before taking the lead and expanding her margin for the last three laps . It was a fitting way for the Stanford graduate to bid farewell to competitive racing in the United States . <p> On the way into retirement after Rio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Atlanta , DiRado will tackle a hefty schedule for the final competition of her career . Prior to earning a ticket in the 200 back , DiRado secured Olympic nods in the 200 individual medley and 400 individual medley . The multi-stroke disciplines are DiRado 's best chances at medals , but she is hardly out of the mix in the 200 back . <p> " This is a dream , " DiRado said . " I think it speaks to the changes that ( coach Greg Meehan ) has made to Stanford swimming . We were comparing our swims from four years ago to now , and we 're just a totally different program . I 'm so happy to go out and represent Stanford . Someone made the comment this is the last time we will be wearing these ( team ) caps , and so I wanted to go out and have a great last race for Stanford .

The five-time Olympic medalist and darling of USA Swimming is not in peak form . She has n't been there for a couple of years , and for those who thought the return was coming this week ( including this writer ) , it did n't . Plainly , the 21-year-old 's stay in Omaha was a tough one . <p> However , maybe the troubles of Franklin will serve as a blessing when the Olympic Games open in Rio de Janeiro in August . Maybe a lessened workload will prove beneficial as she tries to pad her count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , and the Team USA training camp just might be the place it gets sorted out . <p> Despite what did n't work for Franklin at the Olympic Trials , there were a couple of highlights . Earlier in the week , a gutsy effort in the 200 freestyle landed Franklin second place to Ledecky , and an individual trip to Rio . Adding a second event via the 200 backstroke was a bonus . <p> By qualifying to contest her prime event in South America , Franklin became the only reigning Olympic backstroke champion to earn an opportunity at a defense . While Franklin lost her chance to defend her 100 back title , Matt Grevers ( 100 back ) and Tyler Clary ( 200 back ) were denied on the male side . <p> Speed was certainly a missing element in the Franklin arsenal over the past seven days , but she was able to rely enough on her endurance to succeed in the 200-meter distances . A late surge is what aided Franklin in the 200 freestyle and Franklin was able to keep things together just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot at this meet about how to deal with ( pressure ) , " Franklin said .

Schedule is close to perfect for Dirado and I hope she ends her career with multiple Olympic medals <p> Well , Hosszu , Seebohm and Ustinova are not losing too many sleep now after this result . <p> Missy 's start and stroke looked much better here than in 100 back , but she still does n't have much speed . Did she flirt with disaster and did n't fully taper for the OT ? Will full taper in Rio be enough for her to catch up with Hosszu and Seebohm ? That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , because if she wins an Olympics gold , she 'll got bonuses not only from USOC , but much more importantly from her sponsors . <p> Not fully tapering for Omaha was a huge and costly miscalculation . Missy really cut it close ... in 2012 she was at trials and fastest in the world that year . her 2.07 high barely scrapes into the top 10 which is a cause for concern . If Seebohm ; Hosszu , Hocking all swim best times in Rio Missy may miss the podium altogether ... if she cracks 2.06 in Rio that 'd be an incredible improvement from trials . my conservative prediction for gold is unless someone uncorks a show stopping perfomance . Seebohm and Hosszu will be favorites for gold <p> kevin roose July 3 , 2016 <p> has tapered for god sake stop making up excuses for her ......... She said herself in a interveiw Rio Olympic Website " that the American Trials are a piece of cake compared to the Olympic Games themselves " well you got 2/3 correct you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ...... <p> Kevin Roose , I think she said the opposite , there is definitely more pressure at trials to make the team than at the Olympics to make the podium for American swimers . We wilk know for sure in Rion if she was fully tapered at trials in a retrospective comparison of times , because no 200free and will be enough for outside lanes in the Olympic finals and no more ...... <p> July 3 , 2016 <p> I watched the video of the race again . Maya is quite high on the water while Missy sitting low , so Missy had to fight water instead of riding on it . This is from the start to finish . Definitely a technical issue . <p> Craig Lord July 3 , 2016 <p> Maybe so , but that should not affect a swimmer of Franklin 's standing and experience and is most likely irrelevant to what we 're seeing .

While the American squad bound for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will have some all-important veteran influence , more than 20 rookies will dot the Team USA roster . It 's an interesting mix , with a changing-of-the-guard feel . <p> A few events , however , have been immune to the influx of youth , including the 50 freestyle . <p> In what was a statement of sorts for the veteran contingent , former training partners Nathan Adrian and Anthony Ervin went one-two in the one-lap dash , Adrian edging out Ervin by the slimmest of margins , 21.51 to 21.52 . Call it a good night for the old fellas , Adrian a 27-year-old and Ervin a 35-year-old who made his first Olympic appearance at the 2000 Games in Sydney , sharing gold in this event . <p> Posting the third-fastest time in the world this year , Adrian atoned for what shook out in the same venue four years ago . In 2012 , Adrian was shut out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall by Cullen Jones and Ervin . This time around , it was Jones who finished third , his mark of 21.75 not enough .

But by the 2004 Olympic Trials , Ervin was gone from the sport , taking a seven-year hiatus in which he worked odd jobs and taught swim lessons .

 made is not one that is unusual . Every Olympiad , a handful of athletes opt for a redshirt year from their collegiate programs , or choose to delay the beginning of their collegiate careers . By traveling that route , a yearlong focus can be placed on training and it is ensured that all attention is paid to the goal ahead . <p> As one of the top sprinting prospects in the country , Abbey Weitzeil could have spent the past year racing for the University of California-Berkeley , under the direction of coach Teri McKeever . She would have been an immediate star , challenging for NCAA championships as a freshman . Instead , Weitzeil delayed her enrollment , deciding to prepare for the United States Olympic Trials under the watch of Coley Stickels , her coach at Canyons Aquatic Club . <p> The move proved to be wise . <p> Firing off the blocks on the final day Trials , Weitzeil surfaced with the lead and never yielded control of the race , claiming victory in the 50 freestyle in 24.28 , the sixth-fastest time in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simone Manuel , who checked in at 24.33 , ahead of third-place finisher Madison Kennedy ( 24.48 ) . <p> The helm of the 2016 world rankings : <h> Women 50M Freestyle <p> 1 <p> 23.84 <p> Cate Campbell AUS , 24 <p> Australian Championships AUS , Adelaide <p> 2 <p> 24.07 <p> Ranomi Kromowidjojo NED , 26 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> 3 <p> 24.17 <p> Sarah Sjostrom SWE , 22 <p> USA Pro Series Austin USA , Austin <p> 4 <p> 24.21 <p> Francesca Halsall GBR , 26 <p> European Championships GBR , London <p> 5 <p> 24.24 <p> Bronte Campbell AUS , 22 <p> Australian Championships AUS , Adelaide <p> 6 <p> 24.28 <p> Abbey Weitzeil USA , 19 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 7 <p> 24.33 <p> Simone Manuel USA , 19 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> 8 <p> 24.39 <p> Madison Kennedy USA , 28 <p> USA Olympic Trials USA , Omaha <p> " I 'm really happy with it , " Weitzeil said .

" <p> The path Weitzeil followed to a Team USA roster spot was also one followed by three of her teammates on the Olympic Team . deferred the start of her freshman year at Stanford to continue to train with Bruce Gemmell , while Manuel took a redshirt from her sophomore season at Stanford . In the case of Chase Kalisz , he put his senior season at Georgia on hold to train with , and alongside Michael Phelps . <p> The 50 freestyle was the final women 's race of the week , and the outcome ( along with what transpired in the 100 free ) verified Weitzeil 's call to make the Olympic campaign her focus . Earlier in the week , Weitzeil alleviated the pressure she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of 53.28 . It was a triumph that handed Weitzeil the chance to race the event at the Olympic Games in Rio , along with giving her a spot on the United States 400 freestyle relay .

" So she knows what the pressure is like . I think she just maintained her head and maintained good awareness going into her races . " <p> While the United States has considerable work ahead in order to have Weitzeil or Manuel in contention for a medal in the 100 freestyle , the 19-year-olds are a little closer to the podium picture in the one-lap dash .

Missy Franklin was mentioned not because she is bad , but because other four girls are better .

Where does this team stand compare to other teams ? Where was a progress and where is decline . Is it generational issue or just some swimmers . Such analysis will be interesting to know . The above reading by itself is prety much obvious . <p> Although she previously 
 is never easy to play . Rather than sit around as a spectator , athletes would prefer to be in their domain , taking care of their business . For Connor Jaeger , the past week at the United States Olympic Trials has been a drawn-out waiting game , the 25-year-old itching for the opportunity to get in the pool again and race . <p> On the opening night of competition at the CenturyLink Center , Jaeger took care of his primary goal in Omaha . With a come-from-behind finish in the 400 freestyle , he tracked down Conor Dwyer for victory and earned his spot on the American squad bound for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . Nonetheless , his work was not complete . <p> Jaeger has spent the past year , ever since claiming the silver medal at the World Championships in the 1500 freestyle , targeting his next tangle with the mile .

Wilimovsky entered Trials on the American squad for the 10K open-water event , and now has a pool event to contest , too . <p> " That 's what I 've been working toward , to represent the United States in two event , " Wilimovsky said . " So I 'm happy about that . " <p> For the first 1400 meters , Jaeger and Wilimovsky were separated by less than second , Wilimovsky only .31 back with three laps to go . But Jaeger pushed the gas in the final stages , pulling away for a comfortable decision . Third place went to Michael McBroom in , evidence of the chasm the front runners have created in the event in the United States . <p> " I was hoping that I was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jaeger said . " I never really broke him . That 's awesome . I think it speaks to what a competitor he is . And we all saw what he did last summer in that 10K . At the end of the 10K race , he broke the field and drove the legs for a 500 or whatever it was , and if you 're capable of doing that , I think you can do anything . He 's a fantastic swimmer , and we 're lucky to have him on the team .

Meanwhile , Australian Mack Horton has also been under 14:40 this campaign , with countryman Gabriele Detti consistently looking fast .

 intensity , in which the athletes faced scenarios , came to an end on Sunday . The United StatesOlympic Trials wrapped up for the third time in Omaha , this latest version producing an American squad of 47 bound for the Olympic Games next month in Rio de Janeiro . As always , there was elation and heartache , no Trials in the world featuring as much depth as what the United States brings to the starting blocks . <p> Here are a few initial thoughts on what went down at the CenturyLink Center , with further analysis to come as the week progresses . <h> A Gauntlet As Unforgiving As Any Other <p> Some wore expressions of pure joy , their lifelong goal realized . Some shed tears , forced to accept a fate that is brutal in nature more so in certain situations . While 47 of the best swimmers in the United States were introduced for action in Rio , many more left Omaha wondering what went wrong , and what to do with the rest of their careers . <p> For every individual in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of the meet with a 2:07.17 clocking in the 200 breaststroke , there was a Will Licon . realized his Olympic dream , on the strength of the second-fastest time his prime event has seen . As for Licon , he fell .14 shy of runnerup Kevin Cordes , and now must look ahead -- well ahead -- to the opportunity to qualify for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo . Enhancing the heartache of the University of Texas star was the fact that his time , a 2:08.14 , ranks fifth in the world . <p> A similar fate stung Cal 's Seth Stubblefield , who put together the performance of his career , an outing of 51.24 in the 100 butterfly , but was shut out of Rio by .04 . Never mind that Stubblefield 's time ranks fifth in the world . There are no exemptions . Sure , a handful of countries boast similar depth in an event here and there , but no nation sees it like the United States . It 's harsh . It 's the way it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cutthroat nature , " said Bob Bowman , the head coach of the U.S. men for Rio . " If you win nothing at the Olympics , hey , you 've still made the Olympics . Here , if you do n't make it , that 's it for four years . There are so many nerves . I think we saw that come through with Chase ( Kalisz ) on the opening night . He had one to bullet to fire , and when he came out , his eyes were huge . I 'm thinking , just hold it together . " <p> Indeed , Kalisz came through , winning the event in 4:09.54 , good for second in the world . But Bowman thought his charge could have been faster , and the pressure of the moment likely impacted how he swam his race . All that matters , however , is that Kalisz earned his first Olympic nod , and will have a month to prepare for his job in Rio , where he 'll enter as a favorite for the podium . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain experienced by Matt Grevers was exacerbated . The reigning Olympic champion in the 100 backstroke and silver medalist in the event from the 2008 Games in Beijing , Grevers was part of a three-man showdown in the 100 back along with Ryan Murphy and David Plummer we called the Brawl for the Wall . <p> After 52 seconds of battle on Night Three , Murphy and Plummer came away with the tickets to Rio , Grevers in third in 52.64 . His time rates fourth in the world , but the 31-year-old Grevers now finds himself at a crossroads retire , or forge ahead with no guarantee he can outrun Father Time for one more chance at glory . Without using the word specifically , Grevers suggested that the end is here . <p> Omaha , too , served as an unintended farewell stop for veterans Natalie Coughlin and Tyler Clary . For Coughlin , a trip to a fourth Olympics could not be attained , an eighth-place finish in the 100 backstroke and a semifinal bow-out in the 100 freestyle likely marking the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed Grevers ' approach , saying she did n't want to officially use the word retire , but the message was clear . In the case of Clary , he did not mince words . After a third-place finish in the 200 backstroke , in which he won gold in London four years ago , Clary said he was done , seeing no reason to stick around . <p> The dynamic of elation and melancholy made for an interesting week from an emotional standpoint . Then again , that 's the nature of the Olympic Trials , where a pair of athletes finish first in each event , with third through 100 enduring the same fate . <p> " I think one of the things about this meet is that it 's iron sharpening iron , " said U.S. women 's coach David Marsh . " There 's a lot of blood shed in that pool ... What makes the U.S. strong is that not only do you have to go through a really tough test to get to represent the United States , but along the way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . So we will leave Omaha with a lot of tears , a lot of joy , ( with ) a giant challenge . " <h> A Makeup <p> As the week in Omaha unfolded , there was a sense that the team being constructed was more youthful than the squad put together in 2012 . In actuality , though , the 2016 Team roster boasts only one more rookie than four years back 29-28 . The average age of the men going to Rio is 23.9 , with the women checking in with an average age of 22.3 . <h> The Collegiate Influence : Not Bad At All <p> Much is made outside the United States about the perceived detrimental nature of the collegiate system , in which short-course racing is the setup . A look at the number of Olympians who either are still in college , or just finished their eligibility , suggests otherwise . In fact , just under half of Team USA just benefited from the college experience . <p> Ryan Murphy By Patrick B. Kraemer <p> For the men , 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cal triumvirate of Ryan Murphy , and Jacob Pebley . As for the women , a half-dozen are tied to the college system . With a one-month turnaround until the Rio Games , the college setup could prove beneficial . Certainly , the coaching staff is confident a second taper will not prove to be a problem . <p> " I think a little of that is from the college systems , where generally they all have come through a conference and then an NCAA championship , " David Marsh said . " They 're pretty comfortable with , in essence , a double taper , and also an emotional meet , and then taking time to come down off it to be emotional again . "@@9715098 <p> It 's not 
 the water at the United States Olympic Trials goes well beyond this simple assumption : They were ready to produce fast performances . Sure , hitting a taper is a key element for success , as only a handful of individuals can go into the pressure-filled , star-studded competition and escape with an Olympic invitation in less-than-peak form . <p> There 's a huge mental component to Trials . How well does an athlete handle the stress of the meet , particularly its do-or-die nature ? Did the swimmer get off to a good start ? Did he/she start poorly , consequently generating negativity ? Can the athlete put a shaky performance behind ? Is momentum running through the team ? <p> Following eight days of action inside the CenturyLink Center , it was n't hard to pinpoint which programs were speeding downhill , collecting Olympic tickets in rapid fashion . While the California-Berkeley men placed five guys on the Team USA roster , the University of Georgia matched that number Dave Durden and Jack Bauerle each earning obvious appointments to the United States coaching staff for the Olympic Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the week signified what was to come from the Georgia bunch . <p> With all eyes on Chase Kalisz and Ryan Lochte , the 400 individual medley wasted little time supplying the first surprise of the week . While Kalisz claimed victory , Bulldog Jay Litherland stormed down the final lap of the championship final , leaving the reigning Olympic champion behind , and generating a feel-good vibe that clearly resonated with his teammates . <p> After Litherland stamped his passport for Brazil , Georgia placed Olivia Smoliga ( 100 backstroke ) , Gunnar Bentz ( 800 freestyle relay ) , Melanie Margalis ( 200 I.M. ; 800 freestyle relay ) and Hali Flickinger ( 200 butterfly ) on the Olympic Team . Meanwhile , Kalisz is set to return to Georgia in the fall for his senior season , while his current North Baltimore Aquatic Club training partner , Allison Schmitt , is also a Georgia product . <p> The coaching nod earned by Bauerle for Rio is the third of his career , complementing a 2000 selection as an assistant and his 2008 role as head coach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , benefited from the guidance of longtime assistant coach . <p> " It was a simple equation , " Bauerle said . " Everyone saw what ( Litherland ) did , and they felt they could do it , too . I think they thought , We 're in the pool together . We 've done the same work . ' We got on a roll . " <p> The same could be said for Cal . <p> From the time Ryan Murphy prevailed in a showdown with David Plummer and Matt Grevers in the 100 backstroke , the Bears were storming . Durden 's troops notched five victories , another from Murphy in the 200 backstroke , an American record from in the 200 breaststroke and a sweep of the sprint events by Nathan Adrian . Meanwhile , Tom Shields was runnerup to Michael Phelps in both butterfly events , and Jacob Pebley followed Murphy to the wall in the 200 back . <p> Although an Olympic berth eluded him , Seth Stubblefield was also emblematic of the Cal success , clocking a No. 5 global time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Anthony Ervin was just a hundredth of a second back of Adrian in the 50 freestyle , the former training partners sitting third and fourth in the world rankings . <p> Ryan Murphy Patrick B. Kraemer <p> For good reason , Durden was named Coach of the Meet , and it reasons the man behind three NCAA championships will be among the leading candidates for a head-coaching job with Team USA for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo . Like Bauerle , Durden benefited from a top assistant , in his case having Yuri Suguiyama at his side . <p> " In 2008 , Cal had a couple of guys get night swims , " Shields said . " In 2012 , it was better . This time , we put someone in a majority of the finals . From a team perspective , we had a great meet . We were able to bed the rumors that we were a short-course team . He had things going really well from the star to our last swim . " <h> A Moment To Remember <p> The reactions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best response was the way Jacob Pebley realized he was an Olympian . After touching the wall for second behind Ryan Murphy , Pebley stared at the jumbotron and covered his eyes in disbelief . As Murphy embraced his college teammate , an emotional Pebley continued to gaze at the scoreboard , almost like he was waiting to wake from a dream . <p> Pebley goes into the Rio Games ranked fourth in the world in the 200 backstroke , and as a contender for a podium finish . While Murphy received the majority of the attention in the event heading into Trials , Pebley quietly went about his business , routinely turning in consistent efforts during the tuneup season . That consistency , and the confidence it built , paid off for Pebley as he edged reigning Olympic champion Tyler Clary for the second bid to Rio . <h> A Climb Ahead <p> The lowest-ranked winning performance from Trials on the female side was Lilly King 's 2:24.08 in the 200 breaststroke , which would have made her the 16th-fastest performer in the world , if she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the semifinals . While King seems to be a longshot for a medal in the event , the fact that she 's still a novice over four laps in the long-course pool could make King primed for a big drop in Rio . <p> Townley Haas YouTube still <p> For the American men , the lowest world-ranking outing from Trials was the No. 8 showing registered by Townley Haas in the 200 freestyle . Haas covered the event in 1:45.66 , clipping Conor Dwyer by the slimmest of margins , .01 . The 19-year-old is a rising star for Team USA , having also clocked 3:45.04 in the 400 free for ninth in the world rankings . <h> Comments <p> July 7 , 2016 <p> I think Dave Durden is underrated . He has successfully helped transitioning quite a number top SCY swimmers to LCM swimmers . In addition to the swimmers ' own talent and drive , that takes quite a skill and experience from the coach . As a comparison , Eddie Reese who was more highly rated at NCAA only has one swimmer ( Haas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gutted when some of his big guns missed the team ; Madison Kennedy ( 50free ) , Micah Lawrence ( 200breast ) , Clary ( ) and Jones ( 50free ) ...

Deibler said : " I 'm just really happy that I was able to be so fast today . That was my goal and I 'm really relieved .

And that was what he wanted to test today unrested ahead of final honing and taper leading into the Games , the 200IM a part of his program . <p> In other action , there was a solid 2:09.18 from Jenny Mensing , SC Wiesbaden 1911 , in the 200m backstroke , tomorrow holding the promise of Olympic selection for her over 100m , while Lisa H ? pink , SG Essen , took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stuttgart , took the 100m breaststroke in . <p> Viktor Bromer by Patrick B.

 our month-long countdown to racing in Rio with a look at some of the most significant swims of Olympic season so far on the clock , we turn our attention to consistency ; the rate at which contenders stack up quality efforts in the top 10 , top 20 and top 25 performances . <p> We began with men 's sprint freestyle . Today ; 200 , 400 and 1500m freestyle and the leading contenders among those who have shown they have what it takes to step on to the ultimate podium . <p> Racing gets underway in Rio on August 6. <h> : A War Zone <p> Impossible to ignore the backdrop . At the helm of the 200m world rankings is the asterisk that highlights the issue set to haunt the Rio Olympic Games , one that sits right there at the heart of the 200 , 400 and 1500m events in the pool : doping . Sun* ; Park* ; Olympic champions back for more beyond testing positive for banned substances . <p> Park Tae Hwan makes a public apology in Seoul TV still last year <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what for some is a tainted image and for all who care to tell the truth an altered image when it comes to comparing Sun Yang 2012 and Sun Yang* 2016 , when it comes to comparing Park Tae-hwan 2008 , 2012 and Park 2016 . <p> The CAS case having gone his way , Park is set to join Sun in Rio as two of the biggest contenders for honour and two leading contenders with doping bans to their name after they returned positive tests in 2014 . The system has worked well for those who fell foul ; not so well for clean athletes who had been hoping to race without the drag of the doping that will now play a part , one way or another . <p> Go back a year and we find Sun retaining the world 400m title , then Sun eclipsed by James Guy in the 200m freestyle as the then 19-year Brit claimed a debut global crown ; then Sun down and out of the 1500m final at the last minute after he was seen smashing a locker in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing rooms they sought to evacuate . <p> The truth of what actually happened in Kazan on the last day of action may never be known but what we do know is that FINA director Cornel Marculescu referred to the ' heart problem ' that had kept Sun from the race ; what we do know is that Marculescu told Germany 's ZDF TV station that " you can not condemn the stars for a minor doping offence " . <p> At that stage despite all the evidence building in a series of ARD television documentaries pointing wuite clearly to systematic doping in Russian sport ; despite pleas from the World Swimming Coaches Association to move anti-doping for Kazan 2015 beyond the reach of the Moscow laboratory on its way to being shut down by WADA and , via revelations from its Grigory Rodchenko , worse FINA 's director , FINA leaders and leading domestic federations that could and should have done something about it sat on their hands and told the world all was well with Russian , their championships and swimming as a whole . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Marculescu . Since then , in the wake of WADA Commission inquiry reports ( more to come next week ) , FINA has declared a " zero-tolerance " stance on doping . That will be impossible to deliver , of course , under the current frame of the WADA Code , related rules and the stance of the Court of Arbitration for Sport ever since it allowed dopers and repeat dopers regain access to the Olympic Games on points of law and definition when ruling " Osaka " out of order , when ruling cheating in the bounds of what international sport tolerates . <p> Where Park 's case , for testosterone , took some months to come to light , then Sun 's case was all the more troublesome in terms of the timing of events : it was May 17 when Sun tested positive ; it was six months before the case came to light after WADA reporting deadlines were missed and after , it would turn out , FINA had had to insist on China observing the WADA Code and imposing a suspension on the 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retrospectively imposed , never served , a token that spoke to tolerance not zero-tolerance of doping . <p> Sun Yang in Kazan by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Sun drove without a licence , served a token jail term , left his China coach in a row over discipline , then returned , and in Kazan was the subject of complaint from Brazil after one of its women swimmers said that he had verbally abused her and been overly physical in the warm-up/down pool . But it was the doping case that sealed the Chinese swimmer 's status as ' tainted ' on the way to Rio 2016 . <p> Sun had , it was revealed , been taking triamterene for some years before its ban on January 1 , 2014 . Apparently , he continued to take the substance for a heart condition after the deadline because in China , neither , nor coaches , nor the federation , nor the swimmer , nor anyone else , noticed a substantial change to the WADA Code ( lack of translation was blamed ) . <p> The case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are hundreds of healthy athletes taking meldonium ? The answers : because they are so sick they ought not to be engaged in elite sport ; because they sought to enhance their performance . <p> For Sun , triamterene was ' critical ' to his care . And yet , since the taint , since his right-hand man on the medical front , Dr Ba Zhen , received a second suspension for having worked at the Asian Games during his own one-year suspension on the deck with the swimmer at a major international with what can only have been the full knowledge and acceptance of the Chinese swimming federation and its FINA Bureau member , Sun has thrived , the 400m world crown kept , his 200m speed improved in the past year to make him the sole sub so far this seaosn and favourite for the 200m title in Rio . Whatever alternatives Sun 's medical team have found for his ' heart condition ' appear to be working well . <p> Both Sun and Park worked closely with coaches in Australia but in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bar any who test positive from training at funded centres and oblige all visitors training in Australia to submit to testing by the Australian anti-doping agency at their own cost . <p> Sun yang with Brian King -- Chinese sportspeople website <p> Sun moved on from Denis Cotterell but not far : Miami 's former assistant coach Brian King , a man suspended by Swimming Australia after parents complained that he had verbally andf psychologically abused their offspring at swim training , was wholly acceptable for the Sun team and China . <p> It was against that backdrop that FINA made Sun its male swimmer of the championships based on a woefully inappropriate points system challenges to which have been ignored by the international federation . The swimmers of Kazan 2015 were in fact Katie Ledecky ( USA ) -- swimmer of the year in 2014 and 2015 despite FINA having , ridiculously , decided otherwise -- and Adam Peaty ( GBR ) and the message for FINA was clear : you can stick your trophies where the Sun do n't shine because they make a mockery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , with Sun and possibly/probably Park in the frame , here is a look at the other contenders in the Rio 200 , 400 and 1500m free . <h> 200m freestyle <p> In almost all events across the Olympic spectrum , the top 10 ( and more so top 25 ) performances lists are stacked with multiple efforts from the biggest contenders . Not so in the men 's 200m free , where you have to glance down to 9th to find a double , courtesy of Conor Dwyer ( USA ) , 11th and 12th also marking multi-entry , Sebastiaan Verschuren ( NED ) that man , his 1:45.87 a touch away from Dwyer 's No3 1:45.41 . A tight tussle ahead , the prizes to those who can press wll down into the 1:44s , perhaps . <p> French hero Yannick Agnel photo : Patrick Kraemer <p> The Olympic champion , Yannick Agnel ( FRA ) , does not make the top 50 performances in the world , his 2016 best of a far cry from the world textile best of 1:43.14 he clocked for London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with six of the best 20 efforts in the world that year , leaving him with three entries in the all-time top 10 in textile , including Nos 1 and 4 either side of two of the giants of the sport , Michael Phelps and Ian Thorpe . <p> Sun 's 1:44.47 best from 2013 , seven months before his positive test , is at No 7 on the all-time list , while his 1:44.82 from the USA Grand Prix series this year tops the 2016 pace . <p> Closest to him is the man who beat him for the world title last year , James Guy , on 1:45.19 at British trials in April . Betweem 1:45.41 and 1:45.87 are the next 8 men : Dwyer , Paul Biedermann ( GER ) , Kosuke Hagino ( JPN ) , Tom Fraser-Holmes and Cameron McEvoy ( AUS ) , Townley Haas ( USA ) , Jack Conger ( USA and so , no place in the Rio race ) , and Verschuren . <p> Momentum is with Guy and Haas in terms of youth on a roll . Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haas has moved up from 1:47.55 to 1:45.66 in the past year . Up-front speed is with McEvoy , no question . What he does with it and where that leaves him on the way home is another question , to be answered only in Rio . <p> Among 2016 contenders <p> On the clock of best times , Agnel , should he opt into the Rio race , is a league apart but has come nowehere close his best pace since claiming the 2013 world title in 1:44.20 . Sun is next , 1:44.47 ; then Park , on 1:44.80 ; then , whose textile best is 1:44.88 , his world record of 1:42.00 from 2009 and shiny suits on the record but hardly relevant to the pace of 2016 ; and then Guy , seeking a maiden voyage inside 1:45 , the dam he 's built including three and nine 1:46s , his first sub-1:47 at 17 at the Commonwealth Games in 2014 , every one of his best 200m swims in international racing having been clocked in finals . <p> Consistency abounds when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podium invites contenders to what for most in the Rio race will be uncharted waters . <h> 400m freestyle <p> Mack Horton by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> At 3:41.65 , Mack Horton ( AUS ) finds himself all but 2sec clear of reigning Olympic and World champion Sun Yang ( CHN ) and . Sun has been faster but has been slowing down since his best in 2012 for London gold in a season that ended with his ownership of four of the best 5 and six of the best 10 performances that year . In 2015 it was ; in 2014 it was four months after he tested positive , and in 2013 it was 3:41.59 . <p> Park ( KOR ) accounted for three entries in the top 10 , leaving Peter ( USA ) and Li Yunqi ( CHN ) the other entries in the 2012 top 10 .

That remained his peak age for performance : in 2015 he failed to crack 3:50 . <p> In 2016 , Horton has two enries in the top 10 performances , his at-ease 3:44.90 in heats at Australian nationals auguring well for a better Olympic campaign than a 2015 world titles knocked by issues related to recovery . <p> In between Horton at No1 and No10 are Sun , Connor Jaeger ( USA ) , James Guy ( GBR ) and Gabriele Detti ( ITA ) , all on 3:43s , then again on a 3:44 flat before Park at Korean trials that will now serve as a selection moment not a battleground Conor Dwyer and Florian Vogel ( GER ) complete the 3:45 club . Just over 3:45 we find David McKeon , while the top 20 includes three Americans locked out by virtue of being American , Jaeger and Dwyer the two with the Rio tickets . <p> For consistency of speed , we look back at 2015 and find Guy with five of the best 15 efforts of the year , dam building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Ryan Cochrane ( CAN ) and Connor Jaeger ( USA ) were the other two in the top 20 who saved their season best for the moment it counted most . <p> In 2014 Velimir Stjepanovic took the European crown in 3:45.66 but has yet to get back down that way , while the list of fresh challengers gathering momentum with 2sec gains on best per season of late include Henrik Christiansen ( NOR ) and Stephen Milne ( GBR ) . <h> 1500m freestyle <p> Gregorio Paltrinieri of Italy by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The king of consistency is the World champion : Gregorio Paltrinieri . His four of the best six performances of the year are topped by the European record of 14:34.04 he clocked at Italian nationals and trials in late spring . That marked a gain over the 14:39.67 in which he claimned the world crown last year a seaosn beyond the in which he claimed the European crown in 2014 . In each of those year , Paltrinieri ended as world No1 on the clock and in big racing . <p> Turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt this year , is poised for his big-shot Games four years after 5th place at London 2012 , when Sun Yang ( CHN ) scorched the field with a 14:31.02 world-record victory ahead of Ryan Cochrane ( CAN ) . <p> Closest challengers are not only those who make the top 20 list . Sun , if he enters the 1500m a year beyond being sick to manage 30 laps in the world-title final , will be seeded with a 14:55.11 , the time he clocked in kazan heats . He has no sub 15mins registered since nor any world-class swim this year . <p> 's 2016 company on the clock takes the form of Mack Horton ( AUS ) , , and , beyond two more efforts from the top Italian , a from training partner Gabriele Detti . Then the man who chased Paltrinieri home for world silver , Connor Jaeger on at U.S. trials . With no international form over 1500m , the list of the swiftest efforts then boasts a from Australian Jack McLoughlin and ( beyond two more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the world 10km champion who made the pool cut , too . <p> The possibility of having a final in which three countries account for six lanes is fairly strong . <p> attacks from the front and has a back end that none have been able to cope with of late . Sun 's best back-end was once a killer , of course , but his 2012 form appears to have been left to history unless history repeats . <h> UIC nurse accused

 not the only Russia to test positive on the eve of the Kazan 2015 FINA World Championships last year , a four-year suspension for Vitalina confirms . <p> There is no news from or on Alexandre Ilyin , Simonova 's coach in Novosibirsk , nor has FINA revealed any details of a case that in the absence of any statement from the swimmer that she acted alone is almost certain to have involved others not yet called to account , the system appearing yet to be incapable or unwilling to stretch anti-doping rules to the full spectrum of people involved in the preparation of athletes . In the absence of full disclosure of case details , questions abound , such as who supplied the doping and was the swimmer under supervision or guidance of any who knew she was taking a banned substance ? <p> FINA notes in its latest case file : <p> On 29 June 2015 , WADA conducted an out-of-competition doping control test on the swimmer , Vitalina Simonova ( RUS ) .

 , three golds for Ajna Kesely as the 14-year-old Hungarian added the 200m freetsyle to her 400 and 800m wins with a 1:57.96 victory in a tight tussle on the fourth day of action at a home European Junior Championships in H ? ? s ? . <p> The battle was stroke for stroke before Kesely denied Barbora ( CZE ) , 1:58.14 , and another born , like the Hungarian , a year later than the silver medallist , Janja Segel ( SLO ) on 1:58.38 for bronze . 's time places her just inside the top 40 in the world this year . <p> Kesely claimed the 800m crown on the first day of action and followed up with 400m gold yesterday in a championship record . <p> The 200m ebb and flow : <p> 28.10 ; 57.70 ; 1:27.82 ; 1:57.96 ( 30.14 ) Kesely <p> 27.76 ; 57.82 ; 1:28.20 ; 1:58.14 ( 29.94 ) <p> 28.11 ; 58.01 ; 1:28.45 ; 1:58.38 ( 29.93 ) Segel <p> There was also a keen clash in the men 's 200m backstroke before Hugo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory ahead of Jakub Skierka ( POL ) , 1:57.97 , and Jacopo Bietti ( ITA ) , on 1:57.99 .

In the final of the dash beyond the boys ' 800m freestyle final , Kolesnikov , 16 , delivered astonishing speed for one so young : the crown was his in a third world junior record , 24.94 , joint 9th in the world on a list swamped with men well into their 20s . <p> Whatever may be behind the speed of Russian youth , there can be no doubt that the juniors are pushed to speedy performance very early in their careers .

The bronze sent to Germany 's Thore Bermel in 8:00.45 . Derbeyshire led until the 700m mark , after which he maintained 30sec laps , while Johansson picked up the pace to 29sec laps before a last 50m of 28.39 , Derbyshire finishing on 29.51 . <p> The closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver to Russia in 3:51.33 , Britain taking bronze in 3:52.89 . <h> Comments <p> Barnabas Mandi July 9 , 2016 <p> Ajna K ? sely 's PB in 200 and new Hungarian Record for 14-17 years old girls . <p> July 10 , 2016 <p> Since they brought to European seniors , I 'm assuming they 're also going to bring her for the 4 ? 200 FR in Rio as well .

 going to win a European junior 400m medley title , then to do so ahead of two Hungarians in Hungary is always going to be a sign of quality : Hugo Gonzalez , the 200m backstroke crown in the bag , ended his youth years at the continental showcase curtain-closer in H ? ? s ? with a victory . <p> The Spaniard , 17 this year , led from take-off to triumph , Marton Barta and Zoltan the home challengers from the land of Hargitay , Darnyi , Czene and Cseh chasing him on to the podium in 4:18.51 and 4:20.84 respectively . <p> The same age as Gonzalez , Nicolo ' , of Italy , also produced a speedy win , his championship record if 1:00.30 secured with a sizzling back half to the race : on 28.50 at the turn he was matched precisely by teammate Federico Poggio but a 31.80 return settled the argument in decisive fashion , Poggio on 32.63 down the second lap for silver in 1:01.13 .

 On : Kalisz Searching For Time Drop in 400 Medley To Contend In Rio <p> Now that the United States Olympic Trials are a week in the rearview mirror , it 's appropriate to look ahead . The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will be here in fewer than 30 days , so preparation is surely in its final stages . Team USA will have the chance to fine-tune its troops in a pair of training camps -- San Antonio and Atlanta ahead of Rio , and then it will be time to work . Here are a few storylines to follow as the United States gets set for the biggest competition of the quadrennial . <h> Kalisz On The Chase For A Few More Seconds <p> The moment Chase Kalisz steps onto the starting block for the first Olympic race of his career , there will be plenty of narratives accompanying the North Baltimore Aquatic Club standout . With the 400 individual medley opening action , Kalisz will have the opportunity to give Team USA an early momentum boost . He 'll have the chance to follow teammate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He can extend the United States ' stranglehold on the 400 medley to six Olympiads . <p> A 22-year-old who took a redshirt year from the University of Georgia in order to focus on the Olympic year , Kalisz will also open what figures to be several showdowns between the Red , White &amp; Blue and Land of the Rising Sun . For Kalisz , his competition will start and finish on Day One , and earning a podium finish would undoubtedly make the remainder of his Olympic journey a celebratory affair . <p> En route to winning the 400 I.M. at Trials , Kalisz clocked the second-fastest time in the world for the 2016 campaign , an effort of 4:09.54 that left him a second and a half clear of runnerup Jay Litherland . It was Litherland who ran down reigning Olympic champion Ryan Lochte and touched in second in 4:11.02 , good for No. 4 in the world rankings . <p> The silver medalist in the 400 medley at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and the bronze medalist at last summer 's World Champs in Kazan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio . But to make that possibility a reality , he 's going to have to find some additional speed , likely in the front half of his race . Kalisz is as good as anyone in the world in the back half of his specialty , so if he can cut some time over the butterfly and backstroke legs , it would make him even more dangerous . <p> Simply , 4:09.5 is not going to get the job done in Brazil . Not only does Japan 's Kosuke Hagino boast a career best of 4:07.61 , his countryman , Daiya Seto , has won the past two world titles in . With it being an Olympic year , count on not being enough . Meanwhile , Hungarian David Verraszto won silver at the 2015 World Champs , and is lurking . <p> " We 've got to get the time down and I do n't think ( the Trials ) time is representative of what he could do , " said Kalisz 's coach , Bob Bowman , at the Olympic Trials . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there . The 4:09.5 is great , ( and it ) got the job done , but I think he 's got a couple or more seconds in him in the next month , and that 's what it 's going to take for him to win a medal . " <p> If Kalisz can find his way to the top of the podium , it would continue an impressive streak by American men in the 400 individual medley . Between Tom Dolan ( ) , Phelps ( 2004/2008 ) and Lochte ( 2012 ) , the United States has owned the event . For the streak to stay alive , Kalisz is aware that work remains . <p> " They 're unbelievable , and those two have been the best for the past few years , " Kalisz said of his Japanese foes . " If I want to be competitive with those guys , I know I 've got a lot of things I need to work on , but obviously those are the two guys I 'm shooting for . They 're going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hagino has done awesome and he 's posted some good times , and Seto has done the same . They 've both proved themselves on an international stage , so it 's not going to be an easy task , but I 'm just looking forward to getting on the team and start preparing . " <h> Women 's Medley Relay : A Work In Progress <p> Think back to the 2012 Games in London . As the United States headed into action , there was n't much debate over the makeup of the 400 medley relay . The opening three legs were a foregone conclusion , Missy Franklin ( backstroke ) , Rebecca Soni ( breaststroke ) and Dana Vollmer ( butterfly ) firmly slotted for duty . The only to-be-determined slot was the freestyle leg , and Allison Schmitt 's excellence throughout the week ultimately made that decision an easy one for the U.S. coaching staff . <p> This summer , the formula for the medley relay is a little more clouded . Really , there is n't a single leg that is a lock . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into Rio , but each of the duties is a tight battle , and will come down to who produces the fastest times in the individual events at the Games . <p> Abbey Weitzeil by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Olivia Smoliga goes into August with the upper hand in the backstroke , but Kathleen Baker is right there , the same scenario emerging between Lilly King and Katie Meili in the breaststroke . On the freestyle leg will be either Abbey Weitzeil or , whichever woman is chosen facing the daunting task of fending off Australian Cate Campbell on the anchor leg . <p> The most interesting leg and hotly contested is the third , where Kelsi Worrell and Vollmer will vie for work in the final . Worrell comes in at 56.48 , the No. 2 time in the world , while Vollmer ranks sixth at 56.90 , but feels like she has much more in the tank , and could challenge the sub-56 realm she pioneered in 2012 . <h> Is American Drought In 200 Fly Set To End ? <p> Not since Misty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly at the Sydney Games in 2000 has an American woman medaled in the event on the Olympic stage . That 's the longest drought in any event for the United States , but one that could <p> Cammile Adams . Photo/Matthew Bold Action Media <p> come to an end behind the efforts of Cammile Adams . <p> The winner of the 200 fly at the Olympic Trials , Adams was the silver medalist at last summer 's World Championships . That podium finish followed a gold medal in her prime event at the 2014 Pan Pacific Championships . In search of a streak-ending performance in Rio , Adams heads to the Olympics ranked seventh in the world and in the middle of what is expected to be a wide-open battle . <h> Comments <p> July 11 , 2016 <p> I think John has summarised Kalisz 's situation quite aptly . He is in the invidious situation of being the man expected to maintain a massive US tradition in this event but from the usual position of dominance . <p> He is , in effect , an underdog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal contender without quite being a sure bet ..... and needing to find a new level if he 's to uphold the tradition . <p> Adams ? ? Plus point is that she has demonstrated a capacity to perform at the highest level having finalled in London &amp; medalled in Kazan . <p> However , the issue that she faces is that she has never broken 2.06 and the race in Rio will most likely require something significantly below that mark to be in the medal picture . Whilst Groves is a question mark at international competition , other lead contenders have marks in major meets significantly quicker than Adams . <p> July 11 , 2016 <p> Unless Adams pull a Hyman , I do n't see her taking gold , and she may not even medal what with Hoshi , Belmonte , , Grovers having faster current swims ahead of her . I could see more possibility the two Chinese girls pull a vintage 2008 than Adams pull a 2000 Hyman . <p> kevin roose July 11 , 2016 <p> Looking at the four finals night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for gold ...... Not discounting jaeger hopes either cause you just do n't  know what Yang and Horton will do , Guy and in the mix ...... <p> July 11 , 2016 <p> Fair summation , ASF . I 'm not seeing her as anywhere near a front-line gold contender and she 's most likely needing a slow race or significant PB to medal . Not impossible , of course , but definitely a Hyman Mk II required .@@9813158 <h> QPR offered Pilkington 
 our month-long countdown to racing in Rio with a look at some of the most significant swims of Olympic season so far on the clock , we turn our attention to consistency ; the rate at which contenders stack up quality efforts in the top 10 , top 20 and top 25 performances . <p> Today : backstroke and the leading contenders among those who have shown they have what it takes to step on to the ultimate podium . <p> Racing gets underway in Rio on August 6 . <h> Backstroke : Two Crowns Will Pass <p> Mark Tewksbury ( CAN ) <p> The backstroke events are marked by a top story line in which the pressure is on when it comes to the opposing forces of status quo and regime change . Double World champion Mitch Larkin , of Australia , seeks to topple a towering tradition , while Ryan Murphy , David Plummer and Jacob Pebley seek to keep the Stars and Stripes flying over the backstroke realm Americans have dominated in Olympic waters for the past five Olympic Games . <p> In the 100m , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a non-American winner , the Canadian pipping American world record holder Jeff Rouse . <p> In the 200m , you have to go back to Martin Lopez-Zubero at Barcelona 1992 to find a non-American winner , the Spaniard , a product of the U.S. swim program , the first and only champion to this day for his country in the pool atop a rare result : no American on the podium . <h> The swingometer <p> The backstroke events in Rio are on the frontline of the battle between the United States and Australia when it comes to which nation can claim the lion 's share of gold by the close of eight days of racing . Other nations will have a say , too , of course but between the aquatic superpowers , the USA No 1 by some way in many a season , must hit most of its targets in Rio , Australia must hit just about all its targets to emerge with the biggest pile of gold . That the Dolphins even have a chance speaks volumes for the strength of swimming Down Under . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way or the other , the London 2012 tally 16 to 1 in favour of the USA . Things promise to be much close this time . <h> 100m backstroke <p> David Plummer USA Swimming <p> Ryan Murphy , from Bolles to Cal <p> The domestic backstroke battle in the United States drove the seasonal standard higher , David Plummer and Ryan Murphy locking Matt Grevers out of what would have been the defence of the Olympic crown and registering at trials in Omaha four of five efforts over 100m faster than the 2016 best of World champion Mitch Larkin . <p> The 51.98 world mark of Aaron Peirsol , a giant of backstroke with or without a shiny , proved more elusive than some had anticipated amid predictions far and wide than the global mark was about to be sunk in Omaha . <p> So near , so far : 52.12 for Plummer in semis , 52.26 for Murphy in the finals , Plummer on 52.28 , the time Murphy clocked in semis . Plummer had arrived at trials as world No1 on the clock this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52.48 of Larkin in semis at Australian nationals that hardly stretched the double world champion of Kazan 2015 . <p> Larkin clocked 52.54 at trials , while Murphy is next on the 2016 performaces list with a 52.57 from Canadian nationals . In Omaha semis , Grevers clocked his best pf the year , 52.64 , 0.1sec down on his best of 2015 , his peak-form years behind him as things turned out . <p> Beyond one more effort each from Murphy , Grevers and Larkin is another American who wo n't be racing two laps in Rio but will be a contender over four laps , Jacob Pebley , on 52.95 . Camille Lacourt ( FRA ) and Xu Jiayu ( CHN ) complete the sub-53 club , with Russians Grigory Tarasevich and Evgeny Rylov and Guilherme Guido ( BRA ) completing the performers on the top 25 performances list . <p> Turn the clock back a year and we get a stark reminder when it comes to the man holding the title : Larkin , on 52.11 for the swiftest effort in the world at the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best 15 of the year . Murphy , Lacourt and Plummer gave warning of their 2016 trials success by repeatedly swimming faster than Matt Grevers , while one other name appears on the list of the best 20 performances : Britain 's . <p> How much does consistency count ? It varies , of course and is not always relevant but in the men 's 100m backstroke , some headline reasons for believing it worth taking note of : <p> 2012 : Matt Grevers , top 4 of the year and 7/20 of the best performances <p> 2004 : Aaron Peirsol , top 2 of the year and 5/12 of the best performances <p> 2000 : Lenny , top 4 of the year and 8/13 of the best performances <p> 1996 : Jeff Rouse , top 3 of the year and 6/12 of the best performances <h> 200m backstroke <p> Mitch Larkin by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Nothing in it at the helm : Larkin , ; Murphy , 1:53.95 ; then Larkin 1:54.21 and 1:54.68 ; then a gap to a 1:54.76 from Evgeny Rylov , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:55 club is completed by Murphy 's second entry on the 2016 peformances list , at 1:54.94 . <p> Murphy , Larkin and account for the next four efforts , with 2012 Olympic champion no longer in the defence game , Tyler Clary in at 13th best effort of the year with his third place at U.S. trials . <p> Larkin accounts for six of the top 14 swims on the list , while the top 20 also includes others who have excelled in international waters , Ryosuke Irie ( JPN ) on a season best of 1:55.89 , Radoslaw Kawecki ( POL ) on 1:55.98 as the last man inside 1:56 . <p> Go back to last year and we Larkin dominant with the top 5 efforts of the years , topped by a sizzling 1:53.17 -- four of those efforts were faster than anything so far this year , the big swims to come next month . Beyond him , a 1:54.55 from Kawecki , 1:54.60 from Rylov , 1:54.62 from Irie , Murphy closing the door to that zone at a 1:55.00 . <p> Roland Matthes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find solidity when it comes to the consistency of champions : <p> On the swingometer of USA Vs Australia gold a battle that will also be shaped by other nations , of course , a double success for Larkin would be significant . The last double winner : , after 100 and 200 wins at the same Games from two other Americans , Krayzelburg ( 2000 ) , John Naber ( 1976 ) and the pioneer and pace-setter before him , Roland Matthes ( GDR ) , the standard bearer with a double double in 1968 and 1972 . <h> Comments <p> For Aussie to have most golds in Rio ; Larkin and Seebohm need to sweep backstroke events and Campbell sisters to sweep sprint freestyle relays as well as 2 Aussie relays to win gold ie both sprint freestyle relay .... Larkin and Seebohm look doubtful to be doubling like in Kazan ; Ryan Murphy and Hosszu respectively likely to throw a spanner in the Australian works .... Any double by anyone will be ; my safest bet would be Ledecky 400/800 free ; C1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roster a double looks super tough ; MP ? McEvoy ? Hagino ? On paper competition looking very fierce ; but races will be swum in a Rio pool close to midnight ; the toughest and most will prevail <p> kevin roose July 12 , 2016 <p> With heats at midday and finals commencing 10 pm at night it brings a whole new feel to this competition . i beleive we will see the fastest heat times ever for a major competition . Katinka Hosszu looks good for a double in the medley ..... <p> Robbos July 12 , 2016 <p> I think the male backstroke event epitomises the whole US v Australia ' OLD FIRM ' rivalry for top nation supremacy . US has won the gold in both events since 1992 , we have not had any success since the 1950s , apart from a few minor medals . However , this year Larkin will take it up to Murphy &amp; Plummer . <p> Australia best gold medal haul was in the 50s ( 1956 ) , we won 8 golds , a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US won 16 golds to Aussie 1 . This year after Kazan &amp; Aussie trials , we have in Campbell sisters , Seebohm , McEvoy , Larkin &amp; Horton , we have a real shot for a few golds &amp; maybe get close to the US 's haul this year , but like Larkin in both backstroke events , we are up against a big history . <p> Hosszu will be stronger in the 200IM where she 's 2sec faster than the rest of the world at best ; her one of the strongest on the women 's program .. 400IM ; Miley , Belmonte , Dirado are all sub 4.30 contenders and gold will be one in that sort of time ; unless Hosszu will uncork a 4.26 in fashion ; yet to be seen ... Though AUS-US battle looks stiff on paper me thinks if one AUS swimmer fails to deliver is Larkin , Campbell sisters , Seebohm it 's advantage USA <p> Robbos July 12 , 2016 <p> Seriously , do n't really care about beating the US . The rivalry is a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the East German girls &amp; maybe in the near future China . <p> I would just like to see Australia get as many golds as possible . Swimming apart from relays is an individual sport . I understand that each federations can implement , spend etc on their swimmers . I would much rather see Larkin , Campbell sisters , Seebohm , Horton &amp; McEvoy all get gold , or even double then to topple the US . <p> One thing that is for sure , racing will be tough , those who do get gold will have earnt it . <p> Indeed Robbos , even in Kazan where team USA was n't full strength with some faster swimmers at pan pacs and failing to win medals in relays , and MP on suspension , they still came out tops . Not to say team USA are invincible but they are well rounded and contend in multiple events , Australia just as an example have a huge deficiency in medley events both men and women ... If Steph Rice was also at peak and in the mix Aussie would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell , McEvoy and Steph Rice , lol ... <p> Craig Lord July 12 , 2016 <p> I agree and disagree with " The rivalry is a bit of a myth " in this sense agree that that is irrelevant to the kids and coaches when they approach their individual race with folk from many nations among last things they should have on their mind , if at all , is the national medal tally ? ? .... and yet , and yet , on a different level and on the deck among folk who do n't get wet and the folk who do get wet but only think about it when the day is won ... I recall Fukuoka 2001 and led victorious Australia , I recall Sydney 2000 a year before ; and I recall many a moment when the USA topped the lot ... and no , the rivalry was no myth ... it was us to do so . <p> It was recently 
 Omaha at USA Olympic Trials in pursuit of more glory in Rio at a fifth Games - by Matthew Bish - Bold Action Media <p> After we started our month-long countdown to racing in Rio with a look at some of the most significant swims of Olympic season so far on the clock , we turn our attention to consistency ; the rate at which contenders stack up quality efforts in the top 10 , top 20 and top 25 performances . <p> Today : butterfly and the leading contenders among those who have shown they have what it takes to step on to the ultimate podium . <p> Racing gets underway in Rio on August 6 . <h> Butterfly : The Threat In The <p> And so we reach the GOAT and the three silver linings behind the Alien : eight years beyond the water in the goggles and American signature salvaged from the Magyar threat to those eight golds in Beijing . <p> Both men now thirtysomethings and challenging for butterfly honours once more in Rio ; one man having ebbed and flowed from the sport these past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold-medal chase when it counted ; one man never away but sharing with his certain tangibles on a journey of longevity of excellence , his focus shifted and shaped for a new chapter and his best ever speed achieved this season at 30 years of age . <p> Laszlo Cseh by PBK <p> Michael Phelps , Laszlo Cseh . We 'll come to Chad Le Clos and Co in due course but as we consider the butterfly bonanza ahoy , let us recall the pathway to the Rio races for those whose peak performances on the clock makes for uneasy measure because shiny suits coincided with what may have been the best times in their lives back in 2008 . <p> We 'll never know precisely where the clock would have been without shiny suits but we do know that on butterfly Phelps hit a high on the clock in 2009 , 50 , 100 and 200m , while Cseh has reached a high on the clock in 2015-16 seasons over 50 and 100m , his best 200m swim ever his 1:52.91 European crown from May this year a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock and literal PB still ahead of him from that race in which he chased down a blinded Phelps at Beijing 2008 , the immortal on 1:52.03 , the human on 1:52.70 . <p> Eight years on and motivation may have shifted ; it may also have just as sharp and edge , the decision to return , the decision to stay , a status as a father and many other aspects of their lives that have changed with the passing of time . What each of them have in common going into battle rejoined is a history , a record , the thing that for the new fight means both everything and nothing . <p> Here 's how the butterfly head-to-head season bests have flowed down the years . <p> THE CLASS OF ' 85 <p> bold italic = shiny suit best ; bold = textile best ) <p> PHELPS <p> <p> Year <p> 100 <p> 200 <p> 200 <p> 100 <p> 2000 <p> 55.01 <p> 1:56.50 <p> <p> <p> 2003 <p> 51.10 <p> 1:53.93 <p> <p> <p> 2004 <p> 51.15 <p> 1:54.04 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:57.13 <p> 53.16 <p> 2008 <p> 50.58 <p> 1:52.03 <p> 1:52.70 <p> 52.62 <p> 2009 <p> 49.82 <p> 1:51.51 <p> 1:56.69 <p> 52.49 <p> 2010 <p> 50.65 <p> 1:54.11 <p> 1:56.88 <p> 52.66 <p> 2011 <p> 50.71 <p> 1:53.34 <p> 1:55.87 <p> 51.98 <p> 2012 <p> 50.86 <p> 1:53.01 <p> 1:54.95 <p> 51.77 <p> 2013 <p> <p> <p> 1:56.35 <p> 51.45 <p> 2014 <p> 51.17 <p> <p> 1:56.86 <p> 51.89 <p> 2015 <p> 50.45 <p> 1:52.94 <p> 1:53.48 <p> 50.87 <p> 2016 <p> 51.00 <p> 1:54.84 <p> 1:52.91 <p> 50.86 <p> Of the two men , Phelps has the better record on two key levels : consistency of speed and quality through the years -- and when it comes to having delivering season best on the biggest occasion of any given season , 2012 providing a stark glimpse of that when Cseh peaked at the European titles before swimming slower at the London Games . <p> For consistency of excellence down the years and for dominance on te historic rankings , Phelps is a class apart . <p> Ian Crocker by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In textile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king on 50.40 from 2005 ( imagine that ) . Phelps has 6 of the best 12 ever .

Cseh has logged 5 of the best 11 ever in the past year alone , the best four ever reading : <p> 1:52.09 Phelps 2007 <p> 1:52.91 Cseh 2016 <p> 1:52.94 Phelps 2015 <p> 1:52.96 Le Clos 2012 <p> There will be others in the race , of course , but here 's a hint at where the battle may be won and lost -- textile bests <p> Michael Phelps and Tom Shields , Photo/Matthew Bold Action Media <p> 100m <p> 24.10 ; 50.45 ( 26.35 ) Phelps 2015 <p> 24.14 ; 50.86 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26.84 ) Le Clos 2015 <p> 200m <p> 25.26 ; 53.62 ; ; 1:52.09 ( 29.22 ) Phelps 2007 <p> 25.10 ; 53.79 ; 1:23.38 ; 1:52.91 ( 29.53 ) Cseh 2016 <p> 25.27 ; 54.06 ; 1:23.76 ; 1:52.96 ( 29.20 ) Le Clos 2012 <p> 25.08 ; 53.70 ; 1:23.18 ; 1:53.01 ( 29.83 ) Phelps 2012 <p> And against that backdrop , we turn to each race and the consistency to behold in the ranks , this year and through the years : <h> 100m butterfly <p> Chad le Clos ( RSA ) is the World champion ; Michael Phelps ( USA ) the man with the three Olympic titles , three World titles , the world record and the swiftest effort of 2015 . <p> They are the only two heading into Rio who have known 50.5 or better . Cseh tops the rankings this year with his 50.86 victory at European titles in London in May . <p> Phelps , at U.S trials comes next , at 51.00 , with teammate Tom Shields on 51.20 and Poland 's Konrad Czerniak on 51.22 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Li Zhuhao on 51.24 . <p> The sharpness of challenge in the United States follows , Seth Stubblefield , Jack Conger and Tim Philipps all locked out of Rio by Phelps and Shields . <p> Piero Codia ( ITA ) and Steffen Deibler ( GER ) the sub 51.5 club this year , while the 2015 rankings and results remind us to watch for podium placer Joe Schooling , of Singapore , on a scorching 50.96 in Kazan and leaving his teenage years behind this season . The other significant last year not already named was France 's Mehdy Metella at 51.24 . <p> Joseph Schooling of Singapore by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The balance of there and back will play a key part in the battle , Phelps a master of chronometry , coach Bob Bowman a master of calculation when it comes to knowing where his charge must be if he is to win in the specific conditions prevailing in any given race . Such calculations are pure speculation until they come from the likes of Bowman in the wake of semi-finals , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Experience and form and fitness and drive are among the weapons in the armouries of the likes of Phelps and Cseh and Le Clos , the momentum of youth and time with Schooling and the school of those arriving at their first Olympic challenge in the company of giants . <p> In terms of consistency in this season and last , Phelps , Le Clos , Cseh , Schooling and Shields are the obvious podium contenders above all others . <p> Le Clos , at 51.56 in the 100m so far this year ( 20th best among performances ) , will feature in a film " " to be premiered in the coming week . It highlights the struggle behind the struggle , as highlighted by Le Clos in a statement this week : both his parents , Bert and Geraldine , are battling cancer . <p> Here is Bert , here is Chad , here is a glance at Unbelievable : <p> Winning and towering challenge : <p> And on that note , we turn to ... <h> 200m butterfly <p> The moment Chad le Clos pipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensational of the London 2012 Games , not only because of the race , not only because the GOAT succumbed in his signature at his swansong but because of Bert and all that followed . <p> Phelps then left the stage and a new era was to begin . It did n't turn out that way . If Le Clos faces specific challenges because of the personal circumstances outlined above , he also faces familiar foe in a world and realm less changed than we 'd all imagined in 2012 . At thirtysomething , Phelps and Cseh are not only back but threatening to produce towering performances once more . <p> Cseh ( HUN ) defeated the 2012 Olympic and 2013 World champion for a debut world title in Kazan last year . In May this year , he went faster still and in the past year has placed 5 efforts in the all-time top 12 in textile . On a roll . But will he hit it right for Rio . Csh will look back at London 2012 and know that it all went wrong from the moment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the last 8 by a touch in the lane next to him in a slow risk-laden heat . <p> This time , Cseh carries no such baggage and threat , his focus on ' fly . Period . Phelps last year gave warning that his was no modest comeback that spoke more to pride and personal pleasure than dangerous performance when he clocked the best 100 and 200m times in the world , a drink-drive charge and USA Swimming suspension for that having ended his hopes of racing at the world titles . <p> Michael Phelps , 15 , and two blokes who have n't yet realised they 're in the presence of a boy who will become the most decorated Olympian in history <p> The rankings tell a tale of serious challenge for the thirtysomethings . Cseh has set the pace with that 1:52.91 but we look to Japan to see Daiya Seto and Masato Sakai in fine form and occupying four slots in the best 10 performances this year , all in the top 6 . <p> Le Clos , Cseh 's teammate Tamas Kenderesi , leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club this season . <p> The dynamics of age versus youth , of longevity vs longevity of against-theodds challenge and the spike of a London 2012 and Beijing 2008 rematch makes the 200m as tantalising as it is . <p> For Phelps , ownership of the 200m was denied him in 2012 and yet his sense of belonging must surely be strong still : at 15 he was 5th in the Sydney 2000 final and after that , the spur of teammate Tom apart , he dominated the four-lap ' fly like no other ever had , with Olympic crowns in 2004 and 2008 , world titles in 2001 , 2003 , 2007 , 2009 , 2011 to his credit . <p> Whatever the outcome , the battle of Rio is set to unfold in the spirit of Russell Crowe 's Gladiator : Are you not entertained ! ? <h> Comments <p> July 16 , 2016 <p> I 've got a feeling that 1-2 in both 100 and 200 fly in London will repeat their roles in Rio in exactly the same positions . <p> Attila Riez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old , this time Laszlo Cseh will not swim in the role of the ' silver man ' . Having in mind his continuous progress over the last one and a half years , his current super strong mental and motivational focus ( with which he can handle the now or never to complete his helm with an Olympic Gold ) , probably he swims a PB that can be even better than his old shiny one . We will see then where that time us to do so . <p> The Pride of 
 July 17 , 2016 <p> I quite like Lochte 's chances as it 's his only focus individually ; no tired muscles from earlier races ( save the 4 ? 2 ) . Hagino swimming faster than ever ; Bob Bowman saying the lessons have been learned from Omaha and he will be right in Rio . It all adds up to a Battle royal . <p> Ger July 17 , 2016 <p> Bob Bowman of course , will not be swimming the IM ..... Phelps . <p> Craig Lord July 17 , 2016 <p> ? ? <p> July 17 , 2016 <p> Ger , I agree with you , this is also in line with what I 've been saying all along in the past year . I think Lochte has pretty good chance to win 200 IM , now that he 's been unshackled from the burden of both 400 IM and 200 back . <p> July 18 , 2016 <p> certainly CAN win the 400IM but he 'll have to pull out something special ; I 'd currently shade that one as Adv JAP . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trickiest on that card to pick . You go against the likes of Phelps &amp; Lochte with considerable trepidation .... their CVs demand that <p> However , one can not help thinking that their aura of invincibility has gone and what remains are mortals . Still extremely formidable mortals capable of at least one last hurrah but mortals nonetheless . <p> stabilo July 18 , 2016 <p> I would put Lochte as a slight favourite at the moment , mostly because of their respective schedules . Someone needs to talk smack about the GOAT , he looks too happy and relaxed ! <p> July 18 , 2016 <p> I really think that 400 IM is Hagino 's to lose . <p> Just like Lochte and Phelps before him , he has the most balanced strength , with deadly fast 200/400 free . Breast is still a bit of weakness , especially that his two main rivals , Seto and Kalisz are outstanding in breast . As long as he loses no more than 2 seconds in breast , he 'll win it . <p> Seto is the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has 1:54.0 200 fly and 200 breast . His backstroke remains a weakness . <p> stabilo July 18 , 2016 <p> Agree with ASF if Hagino is on form , he is the top dog in 400IM . <p> I am not so convinced with Seto , which is maybe a bit disrespectful to someone who has won the last 4 global 400IM crowns ( inc SC ) . But SC is not so relevant , 2015 clearly does n't count ( as far as his record vs Hagino ) , and in 2013 Hagino had 6 individual events + relay duty ending with the 400IM ; Seto had 2 . Kalisz would need a hefty drop to get to Japanese speed , and Pereira I wonder might suffer a bit from Old Man 400IM Syndrome . ( In any case he just lacks that extra bit of quality I think to challenge for Gold ) <p> July 18 , 2016 <p> Pereira is going to swim 400 IM ? I do n't think he 's a factor in 400 IM ad he has not swum anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal in 200 IM , but only if the race is slow ( he 's capable of going ) <p> stabilo July 18 , 2016 <p> Ah yes , looks like you 're right ASF . I just assume a 400IM will have Pereira knocking around the minor like usual . ( He did " win " Pan Ams in 2015 before a DQ , but maybe was us @ @ @ @@@9939763 <h> Empiric Student Property 
 Omaha at USA Olympic Trials in pursuit of more glory in Rio at a fifth Games - by Matthew Bish - Bold Action Media <p> By nature , world records are not easy to come by . Typically , we 'll see a handful each year , and to establish one is a pinnacle achievement , a pronouncement of unique status in that athlete 's chosen profession . For this reason , it remains satisfying to see global standards from the shiny suit days get the whiteout treatment . <p> Sure , some records from the artificial era will remain for quite some time . It 's difficult to foresee Liu Zige 's mark of 2:01.81 in the 200 butterfly or Paul Biedermann 's 1:42.00 in the 200 freestyle going anytime soon . Yet , the rapidly approaching Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro will likely bring at least a few world records , and one under pressure is the men 's 400 medley relay . <p> When the American collection of Aaron Peirsol , Eric Shanteau , Michael Phelps and David Walters stormed to a clocking of 3:27.28 at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the previous standard . More , the performance figured to last in the books for quite a lengthy time , such was the aggregate effort put forth . Seven years after it was established , the medley relay standard is attainable . <p> For starters , anything less than a gold medal in the 400 medley relay would be a surprise for Team USA . While other nations have the ability to match a portion of the American arsenal , no country can bring the accumulated power of the United States . Although Great Britain has Adam Peaty on breaststroke , his superiority on the second leg is not enough to offset the Stars and Stripes . Other squads , too , have stalwart legs , but also feature glaring weaknesses -- Australia and France , to name a pair . The United States ? Strong across the board . <p> Ryan Murphy Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Each member of the presumable U.S. entry for the medley relay is considered a medal favorite in the 100 distance of his specialty stroke . As the Olympics beckon , Ryan Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( alongside Aussie ) while Phelps is the top choice for victory in the 100 butterfly , an event he 's captured at the past three Olympics . In ( breaststroke ) and Nathan Adrian ( freestyle ) , they are expected somewhere on the podium . <p> As fast as the American medley relay was in 2009 , the anticipated quartet for Rio matches up in impressive fashion , particularly considering the difference in assistance rubber vs. pure skill . Seven years back , Peirsol covered the backstroke in 52.19 , with Shanteau following in 58.57 . The back end was handled by Phelps in 49.72 and Walters in 46.80 . <p> An assessment of the potential of the 2016 unit shows that the front half is as dynamic as the past , Murphy and Cordes more than capable of being quicker than their predecessors . On the back half , matching the 2009 times seems a bigger challenge , but there is reason to believe Phelps and Adrian can deliver . After all , Phelps is Phelps , and Adrian has been gearing up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympiad . <p> A question facing this year 's squad is how much will be left to bring after seven intense days of racing , each of the relay members set to race at least two individual events . Simply , will the physical and mental strain of the Olympics be too much of a toll to overcome ? The answer will be provided on the final day of competition , but there is little doubt the United States will give the world record a scare . <h> Streak Watch <p> The longest streak of male podium finishes for the United States in Olympic competition is found in the 100 backstroke , with American athletes earning medals in every Olympiad since 1984 . That stretch of eight Games features a total of 12 medals , including six gold . If the analysis excludes the 1980 Games , which the United States boycotted , Americans have medaled in the 100 backstroke at every Olympics since 1936 , when Adolph Kiefer won gold . <p> David Plummer Photo : Peter Bick <p> With Ryan Murphy and David Plummer entered for Team USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Murphy is the Olympic Trials champion and sits second in the world rankings , his time of 52.26 trailing only the 52.12 that Plummer produced in the semifinals of Trials . <p> On the female side , the longest streak of podium placements for the United States is six in the 200 breaststroke , where Amanda Beard ( 2004 ) and Rebecca Soni ( 2008/2012 ) have combined for the past three titles . Unlike the men 's 100 backstroke , the streak in the women 's 200 breast -- alive since 1992 is in danger of being snapped , as Lilly King and Molly Hannis enter the Olympics ranked outside the top-15 in the world . <h> Five-Time Olympian Michael Phelps Among Team USA Captains <p> Nathan Adrian by Patrick B ; Kraemer <p> USA Swimming announced the selection of six captains three male and three female for the Rio Games , including 22-time Olympic medalist Michael Phelps . The five-time Olympian was named to the role in a vote by his teammates , with three-time Olympians Nathan Adrian and Anthony Ervin also earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , the veteran contingent of Allison Schmitt , Elizabeth Beisel and Cammile Adams will handle captain duties . While Schmitt and Beisel will race in their third Olympiads , Adams is a two-time Olympian . <h> Third Olympic Journey Set For Amanda Weir <p> Credit must go to veteran Amanda Weir , now a three-time Olympian and a woman who has proven herself consistently able to produce under pressure at the United States Trials . By qualifying as a member of the American 400 freestyle relay , Weir complemented her previous Olympic appearances in 2004 and 2012 . Weir heads to Rio with three Olympic medals . <p> Heading into Trials , Weir was n't frequently discussed as a relay option for the U.S. , but the 30-year-old remained steady in Omaha , and will turn to her experience in the search for a fourth Olympic medal . With Abbey Weitzeil and Simone Manuel pegged for evening duty in the 400 free relay , Weir will get her chance in prelims us to do so .@@9970552 <p> The rallies in 
 The Balance After Years Of Collective Punishment For Clean Athletes <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides - yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> Editorial &amp; Olympic Essay <p> Today I 'll be taking our sons swimming at a fine and fun facility not too far away from Kreischa in Saxony where once the town clinic was one of the key hubs at the heart of the German Democratic Republic 's State Plan 14:25 doping program . <p> How times have changed . There are no world-class swimming programs pumping out Olympic and World champions and record holders in these parts nowadays . Thank God for that . <p> Hereabouts , you do n't have to look far to find both those who would defend criminality ( and even do so on the basis that ' the rest of the world was n't clean anyway ' ) and those who tell how life as an ambassador in a tracksuit ruined their lives and those of their loved ones , too , in far too many cases ( see the archive file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant is the GDR in 2016 ? Vastly so as we stare at the wreckage of the Russian doping crisis and await the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport and then the International Olympic Committee . <p> The little blue pills back in the 70s and 80s were Oral Turinabol . And the Russian doping cocktail of the hour ? " The Duchess " contains ... yes , , as well as oxandrolone and methasterone . <p> I ask the same question as that posed by a colleague I find common ground with on many issues but with whom I fundamentally disagree when it comes to the Russian doping crisis and response to doping and bad governance in general . The question posed by WADA Reports and the McLaren Report of this week : what 's to be done ? <p> The answer from Alan Abrahamson , FINA 's first journalist of the year and a man who heartily defended Justin Gatlin 's right to be racing still when so much of the rest of the world points to him as American hypocrisy personified , appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket ban that would catch the innocent with the guilty , would be unfair , even illegal and would be damaging to the Olympic Movement . <p> My reply : a soft line on Russia , allowing most ( for that is what would happen ) of the show to go on as if nothing had happened would surely be unfair , too , and might even be deemed illegal some fine day it would also catch the innocent with the guilty , only in this scenario the damage would be done to clean athletes from round the world yet again -- and to the Olympic Movement . <p> From Abrahamson comes this question : <p> " If you 're going to ban Russia , you might want to ban Kenya while you 're at it . Unlikely ? If so , how is it remotely fair to ban Russia ? " <p> In a tweet he also raised the issue of Turkey , as in why Russia if you do n't ban Turkey from Rio 2016 because of its 40 positives in 2013 . <p> Abrahamson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the woe in those nations ? <p> Answer : the state . <p> That status raises the temperature and quite rightly so -- beyond anything else that could do so barring the bright thing up above at midday on a clear blue-sky scorcher . <p> Russia no longer ready to chink glasses with the IOC once more . All images are stills from " Red Herrings " by ARD <p> Abrahamson goes to lengths to cite friend of Olympic bosses and Russian President Vladimir Putin chapter and verse . The President doth protest too much , methinks . <p> Cast your eye over this lot : <p> " Russia is well aware of the Olympic movement 's immense significance and constructive force , and shares in full the Olympic movement 's values of mutual respect , solidarity , fairness and the spirit of friendship and cooperation . <p> " This is the only way to preserve the Olympic family 's unity and ensure international sport 's development in the interest of bringing people and cultures closer together . Russia is open to cooperation on achieving these noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Noble goals . What , like issuing a decree to border control so that all samples be opened and checked before leaving the country ? <p> If Putin is serious , it 'll surely be the Gulag for Yuri , Russian Olympic Committe Executive and Deputy Sports Minister of the whole of Russia . Vitaly Mutko , the Sports Minister , too , came in for very steep criticism and stands accused of knowing about the system he has said did not exist . <p> Their fate will , ultimately , rest with Russian attitudes . As Putin puts it , this is all about the " ... values of mutual respect , solidarity , fairness and the spirit of friendship and cooperation " . <p> Shame he did n't ask if that 's how he felt about his jobs before appointing him , given that the minister now stands accused being a king-maker in a doping process involving cover-up , the Olympic Committee member 's name and thumbs up on the paperwork granting the all-clear for clean urine samples to be collected for later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less polished <p> Abrahamson sets off on his trawl of McLaren Report day with the words " The most important note from the compelling report released Monday is that ... there is no recommendation about what , as Lenin might have put it , is to be done " . <p> The most important note ? Perhaps he overlooked the following : <p> The Moscow Laboratory operated , with the intention of protecting doped Russian athletes from detection , within a " failsafe system " <p> The Sochi Laboratory for the Winter Olympic Games of 2014 operated a unique sample swapping methodology to enable doped Russian athletes to compete at the Games <p> The Ministry of Sport , the report states , directed , controlled and oversaw the manipulation of athlete 's analytical results or sample swapping , with the active participation and assistance of the secret services , the FSB ( the Russian federal security service ) , the CSP ( Centre of Sports Preparation in Russia ) , and both Moscow and Sochi IOC-accredited Laboratories <p> Yuri -- Russian Olympic Committee executive and deputy sports minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then used as swaps for samples of urine that contained banned substances <p> Swimming is listed on a chart with 18 ' disappearing positive tests ' ( see chart below and for explanation ) : 9th worst of all 30 sports listed with such cases , track and field and weightlifting by far the worst , with more than 100 cases each . <p> The Moscow laboratory was asked to keep all 10,000 athlete samples in a letter of December 2014 , but by the time WADA investigators got there , 8,000 had been destroyed . <p> Here are a few more things in Abrahamson 's campaigning editorial that demand scrutiny : <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> He asks whether Russians given " The Duchess " were even aware . Great question , for many in the GDR did not know what they were being given . Does that mean that Surley Shirley ( Shirley Babashoff to those who know her as an outstanding athlete ) should forever be considered sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the greatest of all-time ? Would it have meant that the GDR should not have been collectively punished , even if that had extended to sports where doping was not seen as part of the problem ? <p> And on that score , Abrahamson raises gymnastics and synchronised swimming as he stares as the chart of ' disappeared positives ' and notes ' no issue ' and therefore how could such innocents be lumped in with the rest if the state-run saga . Well , not with too much of a struggle , in fact , gymnastics and synchronised swimming both sports that belong to the club of those with doping positives on their score in world sport , including Russians . <p> Abrahamson raises this , too : " McLaren ' did not seek to interview persons living within the Russian Federation . This includes government officials , ' page 8 . So the report is deliberately one-sided ? " <p> To raise the question is reasonable though not in those terms : on what basis does he reach for the word ' deliberately ' , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who know just how dangerous all of this has been for the whistleblowers , according to the people who genuinely fear for their safety would be : were your investigators disappointed with the appalling lack of cooperation they experienced in Russia when the first two WADA reports were being compiled ? <p> Is it the case that some who you might have spoken to in Russia did so on the basis that they would not be referred to in the report , let alone named ? And was that because they were terrified ? <p> WADA noted how important it was to protect and support those who find the courage to speak out about very dark things . None of which is good enough for Abrahamson , who simply asks how Rodchenkov " finds himself now in Los Angeles ? From what source or sources might he have money to , you know , pay rent and buy dinner ? " <p> He might have asked all manner of things of Rodchenko , including how is he faring in hiding and is he relieved not to have suffered the sudden-death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former boss and his former colleague ? I only ask because that , too , would be a reasonable question for an inquiring mind . <p> Abrahamson then picks up in this : " At page 25-6 : " The compressed time frame in which to compile this Report has left much of the possible evidence unreviewed . This Report has skimmed the surface of the data that is available or could be available . As I write this Report our task is incomplete . " And concludes : " By definition , " incomplete " means exactly the opposite of " beyond a reasonable doubt . " <p> Stasi ( secret police ) documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped <p> Er , no , it does n't . It could mean , for example , here 's the tip and it is 10-storeys high ; we believe that may indicate a colossal edifice below the surface . The 10 storeys in view are no less significant for all that , of course . <p> Same point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . A " glimpse " does not make for proof beyond a reasonable doubt , writes Abrahamsson , with some certainty where none appears to exist , that being the nature of secret services ... <p> Abrahamson concludes that you could " drive a truck through the report " and then writes : " See you there , Russian delegation . Behind your red , white and blue Russian flag . " <p> That thinly veiled appeal to patriotism and pride at a time when heads should be hung in shame is the worst of it . <h> The Evidence Is Out There : In Abundance <p> State-run and pre-meditated is what it looks like from the great body of evidence put together by the media doing sterling investigative work and from the investigators following through . <p> And what it sounds like is the ghost of the GDR coming back to haunt with a whisper no less chilling for its lack of surprise : " Told you so -- we were not the only ones ... " <p> None of which is good enough for Abrahamson and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have forgotten that she exists . <p> Here is what Abrahamson writes : <p> " But -- and this is the key the report does not tie specific athletes to specific misconduct . At least yet . Without that , it fails law , ethics , morality and common sense to bar anyone from Rio . " <p> Fails law ? Where is the law that protects clean athletes , Alan , and if you can find it , do you think its done a good job ? <p> Morality ? What is moral about returning doped athletes like Gatlin , Lovtsova and more to the Olympic arena only to send a message to the youth of the world that screams " it 's ok to cheat and even cheat again " ? <p> Common sense ? Where is the common sense in teaching our children that the Olympics is a place where cheats prosper and even if they get caught , they 're good for at least two more chances ? Where is the common sense in teaching our children that they should never question anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run and there are valid points on both sides of the coin but almost all of those posed by Abrahamsson in his editorial seem to run one way to a cul-de-sac conclusion : Russia should remain because there are other cheats in the world and in the absence of a positive test you have to assume innocence and so on and so forth . <p> You can almost hear an Olympic clerk somewhere whispering ' sure , there 's the issue of state involvement but hey , can that really be proven and anyway , there 's the official word to consider ; I mean should n't we take the politicians ' word for it . Thing is , we accepted the word of Lothar Kipke and Co and FINA even gave them awards for services to sport , prizes that they keep to this day years beyond being criminally convicted so how can we jump tracks now ? Far safer to stick to the law , blame it all on CAS and let bygones be bygones ' . <p> Abrahamson tweeted : <p> " What we have are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No due process . " <p> The Stepanovs <p> Whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova with coach Vladimir Mokhnev who is alleged to have run a doping program <p> Beyond that being wrong it is deeply insulting to the teams at ARD , the New York Times , the whistelblowers who showed the courage , the investigators who followed up and the men and women who worked on hundreds and hundreds of hours of evidence and had to cope with folk pouring 8,000 samples down a sink , evading , telling fibs and seeking any obfuscation possible to cover up their old clothes with new ones . <p> More significantly , it takes us back to the start and point of this article : a blind eye is being turned to history . Take the tweeted words and timewarp them back to 1973 , to 1976 , to 1980 , to 1986 , to 1988 , to 1989 , to 1990 through to 1999 . Guess what ? GDR doping , serious allegations , no cross-examination , no due process . <p> Guess what ? It was all true . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reunified Germany pressed the matter to a degree and went after some Mr Bigs ( far too many got away by virtue of living outside Germany by that time , coaching folk from other countires and back in the Olympic realm ) . <p> What did the people running the Olympics and worlds such as FINA do ? Nothing . They did absolutely nothing of any consequence whatsoever ; no moves made , no words spoken with a mind to reconciliation and healing deep wounds . Not even after the guilty were criminalised . They let the sleeping dog snooze on . They refused to drive a stake though its heart . Hark the snarl of a waking beast . <p> Dear Alan , If only that were the case . You argue yourself for Russia to remain because you ca n't chuck ' em out in a world stacked with cheats from elsewhere . All too easy , then , to drive a truck through such platitude . Core is truth . Fair Play has far too often been left gasping for air at the edge of Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is that the IOC and FINA and others failed in a monumental and miserable fashion to deal with the ghosts of the GDR past and lawyers and apologists have made their case and been listened too . And all of that has heaped pain upon pain for the victims of state-sponsored doping on both sides of the divide and made it far easier for people to take up cheating and consider it ' normal ' and even ' acceptable ' . <p> When Abrahamson writes that " ... calls for bans or more sparked by the McLaren report amount to howling from the mob . Not justice . The Olympics are better than that . The Olympics , at the core , are about fair play " he could not be more wrong . <p> Shirley Babashoff , Kornelia Ender and Enith , 1976 <p> Tell that , Alan , to Margaret ( Margie ) Kelly ( who , you ask ? look her up she might have been an Olympic champion but for the GDR and , dare I say it , Russian drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the podium was URS three times , then came three from the GDR , then Kelly and her teammate Debbie Rudd ) ; tell it to generations of European women who were beaten into submission by the GDR for the best part of 20 years ; tell it , too , to the USA women 's team of 1976 , tell it to Shirley Babashoff : you 'll know her . She hails from your neck of the woods . Would have gone down as one of the greatest swimmers and athletes in history . She went down as Surley Shirley instead by folk who said she and those raising serious questions about the East Germans constituted the mob ( and more on that when in a review of Babashoff 's terrific " Making Waves " ) . <p> You 'll know Shirley , too , because the USA has recently celebrated the launch of The Last Gold . You might have seen it . Did you get to talk to the girls , Alan ? Did you listen to what it all meant to them ? Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frustration of a life that left the rails when doping won the day ? <p> Shirley , Alan , was not surley nor was she the mob . She had no evidence ; there were no positive tests to turn to ; what she had were deep voices and male-like muscles thrashing about the other side of the lane line . What she had was a deep feeling for her sport and its possibilities and parameters : she held nothing like ' beyond reasonable doubt " but she was certain that something was deeply wrong and unjust . <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> Nothing was " beyond reasonable doubt " , either , for young Rica Reinisch , winner of three Olympic golds , Alan . The certainty that then did come her way must have been a shocker for a young teenage girl . Imagine being told at 16 that your ovaries are dangerously inflamed and that sterility is a serious threat . Take the thought and place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive for doping in swimming ... and the 15-year-old and the two 16 and 17-year-olds ... and ... I think you get my drift . <p> Russia excels not in senior swimming so much as in junior swimming , the perks and prizes on the lucrative side in the context of local economies and the pressure to perform intense . In junior swimming , Russia has thumped well above the weight of what follows in senior waters , in fact . <p> In the midst of that story is what amounts to abuse . That 's what I call it when 14-year-olds test positive for banned substances supplied to them by a team doctor and/or coach . Worse still when the kid goes down and those in the shadows either walk away or , woe upon woe , remain and work on with the same athlete beyond the warning or suspension . <p> It is against that backdrop and the one in the archive at the foot of this editorial that I feel it reasonable to question some of Abrahamson 's choice of words . <h> From the Horse 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to clean sport <p> Abrahamson , a member of the IOC Media Commission , accepts without question the words of Olivier Niggli , the new WADA director general , when he says that " ... senior Russian politicians have started to publicly acknowledge the existence of longstanding doping practices in Russia , and have conceded that a significant culture change is required . The McLaren Report makes it ever more clear that such culture change needs to be cascaded from the very top in order to deliver the necessary reform that clean sport needs . " <p> There 's some of the evidence you 're looking for Alan , right there . Or are all those senior Russian politicians lying from another angle as they " acknowledge the existence of longstanding doping practices in Russia " ? <p> There will of course , be good and bad people in the mix of all this in Russia , precisely as there would be the world over . The truth is , however , you can go the world over and you 'll struggle to find other major world leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scale of the Russian crisis . <p> Can you imagine Obama and his team signing a decree to border patrols to have doping samples intervened and checked ? Can you imagine a top official in the sports ministry of your country being involved in any way whatsoever with the collection of clean urine samples as part of a swap club come the Olympics to ensure the best possible result through ilicit means ? <p> And can you imagine in Britain a local police chief popping along to the pool to inform federation folk that the two EPO tests that showed up and the name of the doctor that supplied the drugs to two teenagers will go ' no further than these four walls ' . All in the know in that scenario comply because failure to do so would endanger their personal safety . Not happening in many part of the world , really not . Yet in Russia it did happen , just a few short seasons ago . <p> I know that without a shadow of a doubt , Alan Abrahamson . No , there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all what happened . Why ? Work it out Alan . That does not mean to say that McLaren did not find the same evidence as I did , as The Times did , as did . <p> One of the first things a correspondent working in a war zone understands is that the slightest mistake in identifying a source can lead to that person 's death . Same for the translator , the lady who brings the meals in and anyone else helping the journalist in pursuit of truth . <p> Sport is not war , Alan , but think about it as you drive your truck through McLaren 's report : evidence supplied to him and his team may have been provided on the basis that the source can not in any way be identified . <p> That is reasonable and that is standard practice and yes , it demands a degree of faith in folk like McLaren but given that you granted your faith to and you can surely spare a drop for McLaren and Co . <h> The Court Of Arbitration : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry Russian doping saga makes the Olympic world a depressing place on several levels and all the more so at a time where FIFA and football and the IAAF and track and field and mired in inquiry and the prosecution of leading officials . <p> The latter is also the good news so far in the Olympic tale : high rankings officials are being targetted . But will their removal and punishment make any difference to the culture and education and the environment in which young athletes grow up in ? <p> The bigger question is what to do about the athletes . Every answer requires compromise and pain and the legal challenge runs far deeper than some legal eagles would like us to ponder at the choppy surface . <p> The Court of Arbitration for Sport will make its judgment on Russian track and field tomorrow . That decision will , in turn , weigh heavily on the next move the IOC may make . <p> If it removes officials but let 's the athletes in , then Russia would hardly feel punished , while many in the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punished . Fair ? Of course not . <p> If it removes some athletes but not all , on what basis will it do that ? Could the IOC really claim fairness by removing swimmer X whose sample was tampered with a few years ago while leaving in the race a swimmer who has a definitive steroid positive to her name and 5 positive tests for a banned substance this year which count for nothing on what may or may not be a technicality , the rights and wrongs of which will not be known until later in the year beyond the Games ? <p> All the more worrying if that first swimmer turned out to be , as real life confirms has been the case , a 14-year-old who had no clue that she had been doped and will now be made a victim all over again , while someone who actively took a product that listed the banned substance on the tin gets to muscle in on the action in Rio to the sound of depressed and damaged rivals all about her ? <p> Fair play ? Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers . CAS decides tomorrow . A fair and just solution and one that complies with the basics of law and order can not be a collective punishment in which all get dropped in the same soup regardless , runs the argument for keeping Russians in the Games . <p> Alas , in the context of sport , clean athletes have been collectively punished for decades . Who stands up for them ? Which law protects them from collective punishment ? <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> If anyone doubts that State Plan 14:25 did not involve collective punishment then I recommend they read right down to the bottom of this file , including the archive repeated here and the consequences for generations of swimmers , most poignantly women , many of them girls not women , who have been rendered victims of laissez-faire attitudes and deliberate blind eyes for many decades by a world sports governance regime and realm that remains to this day very much a man 's world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic doping is appropriate given all we know about the GDR state plan 14:25 and its consequences then it and its fans should have thought about that a long , long time ago -- and done something about it . <p> Compromise , as noted , is apt , in this case , to deliver as much unfairness as fairness as any hard line could when taken in the interests of a complete change in the culture of Olympic sport that is long overdue . <h> Watershed . Tipping point <p> Call it what you will . The Olympic Movement 's survival hangs on a thread . <p> Whatever the decision may now be , a percentage of the audience has already been lost not because of inquiry and hard and soft lines but because there is a fundamental lack of faith in any result as a result of cheats . <p> When the cheat is a state , then clean athletes in that state need to challenge their state , not the rest of the world . And the rest of the world , the IOC included , needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four years and we will help you be a better you -- and if you 're serious you 'll accept a generous offer " . <p> The IOC has already partly dispensed with the principle of presuming innocence until found guilty . It has done so because of history and prevailing evidence . The presumption of innocence was eroded by a meteor storm a quarter of a century ago when what many had believed had been happening turned out to be fact not speculation . <p> Fact : no GDR swimmer ever tested positive in international testing <p> Fact : many hundreds if GDR swimmers tested positive for anabolic steroids in internal tests kept from the world as part of State Plan 14:25 <p> Fact : Zhou Ming was banned for life China and FINA have since stuck with a line that he was suspended for eight years in 1998 despite the existence of contemporary record of a press conference at the Perth 1998 World Championships which the coach was said to have been sent home and would be banned for life . <p> Fact : the count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that was the tip of an iceberg in terms of the numbers passing through his filty hands . Do we assume half his squad was clean , the other half not ? I 'm afraid not -- we assume they were all on doping because among those who never tested positive officially were " Golden Flowers " built like brick toilet blocks and enduring with severe acne , bad teeth and on their way to serious health problems . <p> The sight of two world champions flanked by the team watcher and Zhou Ming haunts me yet : they were young teenagers and they were victims of abuse . I have no doubt in my mind to this day . Yards away FINA blazers smiled and pressed the flesh with the Chinese delegation and all was well in the world when clearly it was not . <h> Time to stake a stand if the IOC can not do it for you <p> The Olympic Movement belongs to you . The guardians of the IOC must be judged on what they do and what they do n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to federations without clear , unequivocal instruction as to what is tolerated and what is not , the IOC will simply grant FINA the keys to the room marked " more woe for clean swimmers , more second chances for cheats " because that is what FINA has always ended up doing . <p> Even now , at a time of " zero-tolerance " ( as if ) , the Olympic swimming events will be stacked with those who have tested positive , found an excuse and made their return . The count includes several leading medal contenders . So much for a clean Games . <p> Sun Yang Photo by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> If this is not the time for USA Swimming , Swimming Australia and other leading federations around the world to stand together and press for clean sport and send the clearest message possible to Russia and anyone else who feels that cheating , doping , cover-up and corruption is reasonable and ought to be tolerated then there will never be a time to do that . The fight for clean sport will surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the IOC and FINA it rests with all those who are members of those organisations . Time to remind the leadership who they serve : you . <p> What domestic federations can and must do is promote an atmosphere in which the forces for change from within their organisation and FINA through the representatives they send can not only be heard but are buoyed and protected from a model that offers a stark choice : assimilation or removal . <p> Take Matthew Dunn . You 'll struggle to find a single challenging word from the former medley ace from Australia when it comes to the catalogue of FINA folly . That is , in part , because if he spoke out , he would n't be the athlete representative on the FINA Bureau for much longer . <p> Heartening , then , to find him at loggerheads with the position of the FINA leadership on the matter of Olympic athletes spreading the word on WADA reports and Mclaren and more , sometimes even before publication . <p> Last month , Dunn sent out a mail under the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee joint statement . <p> He informs his readership : <p> As a member of the WADA Athlete Committee it is reflective of the position and comments we have made in the lead-up to today , and please feel free to distribute and share . <p> This is a monumental day for sport and we have , very proudly , been a part of it in ensuring the voice of the clean athlete was always present , and always heard . <p> Many thanks , as always , for your support . <p> Great : terrific note . <p> Yuliya Efimova by PBK <p> What a pity that we find nothing of that nature from FINA . Not a word on the day Efimova is returned to the pool but plenty of energy and fast-response when it came to " serious " concerns that bits of the McLaren report might have been leaked and been put out there " prematurely " . <p> It will take courage and the support of Dunn 's federation and those of others sitting alongside the Australian on those largely emasculated commissions that FINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're listening even when they 're not . <p> I sat on the Media Commission for a few seasons until it became quite clear that FINA 's leaders heard only what they wanted to hear and simply ignored the rest , including a call for reconciliation of victims on both sides of State Plan 14:25 . Unanimous vote : all on the commission wanted FINA 's top table to consider the issue . To this day : no response . It is , for them , a place where letting sleeping dogs lie is the best way to an easy life . <p> Unless they 're challenged : and then they spend $150,000 on attempting to discredit what can not be discredited and trying to get Michael Phelps to be a poster boy for Julio Maglione 's presidential ambitions even when there 's not a cat in hell 's chance of that happening . <p> When I left the media commission in protest at the lack of transperancy in FINA , the pointlessness of raising issues but getting no response ( many of them simple matters of improving the lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and coaches and swimmers at meets ) ; the inappropriate presence of the director Cornel Marculescu at the start of all commission business , agenda setting and steer as obvious as unwelcome ; and the Putin award that should never have been granted ( not to him nor any other world leader ) , Abrahamson sent me a note to say that he respected my decision but thought it best to stay and change things from within . <p> That was the first time I 'd seen his capacity for deep insult even where none was intended . The fact was that by then I 'd spent more than a quarter of a century trying to persuade FINA folk that there was a better path . <p> Vladimir Salnikov <p> There is -- but FINA has yet to find it . Now , it may be charged with the task of deciding which Russians can swim in Rio ( including those who have tested positive on at least two separate occasions and would arrive at the Games as repeat offenders ) . <p> Now , FINA is charged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth being told by the end of the year . That truth includes two EPO positive tests that were never reported to WADA . Will FINA find them ? <p> Perhaps Vladimir Salnikov , the Russian member of the FINA Bureau , will be able to point them in the right direction . <p> Before any decision of the CAS or the IOC , FINA today issued the list of those athletes qualified for Rio 2016 , including all Russians , including Yuliya : <p> Business as usual . And all of that unfolding almost 18 months after John Leonard , the director of WSCA wrote to his equivalent at FINA , Marculescu , to raise concerns over anti-doping efforts in Russia tied to the Kazan World Championships in the wake of the ARD revelations of systematic doping at the heart of the Russian systems , stretching to anti-doping laboratories . FINA 's response was to say all is well because we have put in place the same system , independent observation in the mix , as that operated at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refuses even to submit to independent review in the interests of progress , not just for the blazers and their lot but for the sport and its prime asset : the swimmers . <p> And that 's the point : the swimmers . Those now arguing for justice for ' clean Russian athletes ' have been far too silent when it comes to representing the views of clean athletes from elsewhere when they were being beaten to a pulp by cheats , Russian or otherwise . <p> When it comes to all between Shirley Babashoff to Ruta Meilutyte , one may well ask : where are Fair Play , justice , morality , ethics and all those fine things easier to write than find in the result sheet of Olympic swimming ? <p> Ah , yes , sorry : so rare are such things that you ca n't just hand them out to anyone . No , they need to be kept as the sole preserve of those who need weapons with them for their day in Court , that of Arbitration . <p> Shirley Babashoff , Kornelia Ender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this : " What we have are ( very serious ) allegations . But : No cross-examination . No due process . " <p> Tell that to Wendy Boglioli , Jill Sterkel , teammate and whisper it to the late Kim Peyton . Tell that to Enith , who might have been the first black woman to win an Olympic swimming title ( 1976 , still waiting ) and inspire generations , tell that to Sharron Davies , to Anne Osgerby , to Margie Kelly , to June Croft , to Nancy Garapick , to Lisa Curry , to Jodie , to Mary Wayte who waited four years to defend a crown she won in the absence of the GDR because of boycott only to be reminded how good that felt when she finished fourth behind three East Germans in 1988 ; tell that to every single one of those athletes thumped into a different status , to the families and coaches and others who supported them and had to read their achievements written up as ' brave bronze ' , ' plucky fifth ' if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the girls of the GDR robbed of their health ; tell it to the women who gave birth to disabled children and believe ( no , no hard and fast evidence nor due process for them ) the source of woe to have been the sauce of woe ; tell that to the women who were never known to us in elite sport because they were guinea pigs being fed the sauce so that the bad doctor could know it was safe for the ambassadors in tracksuits . <p> Which is where we turn to the SwimVortex Archive and remind those catching up why the Russian doping crisis can not be compared to the bad stuff in Turkey , Kenya or anywhere else . We are looking at a different comparison : State Plan 14:25 . <p> Nothing was done about it . IOC leaders must surely know that can not happen again if the Olympic Movement is to survive . <p> Alan Abrahamson , I beg to differ . I do so with clean athletes , their coaches , their parents and the survival of the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must compromise as they are compromised ; it is Russia and the stinking mire of systematic doping that must be told , unequivocally : see you in 2020 once the world has trust and faith once more in your compliance as a member of the international sports community . <p> And during that period , let the voices of Evgeny Korotyshkin and like minds win the day ; let the youth of Russia understand that a price has been paid for rotten , corrupt practices among those running the show ; grant the youth of Russia the power to turn round and say to the coach , the doctor , the local official waving a funding cheque in one hand and a syringe in the other : <p> " Stick it where the Sun do n't shine . I 'm competing clean and so is my country . " <h> From the Archive <h> October 2014 , The Month FINA Honoured Putin ... <p> Give everything , take nothing : Nada 's welcome presence was unavoidable as Berlin hosted the European Championships in the former East 25 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone forgot the box marked EPO when it came to anti-doping tests for the meet <p> Tomorrow , Germany will rest from work and will play instead -- and my family and I will do likewise , the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the end of the German Democratic Republic marking a moment that made it possible for me to meet my wife and for us to know our sons . <p> The Peaceful Revolution came to a head this week 25 years ago with emotional scenes as Hans-Dietrich Genscher , speaking to a crowd from a balcony at the West German Embassy in Prague ( to where thousands of East Germans had fled that September ) announced the terms of the deal he had negotiated for them to travel to the West and freedom . The trains had to pass first through the GDR and as they chugged through Dresden , police were forced to stop the cross from jumping on the rolling wagons . <p> Not much more than a month later , it was , in essence , all over : 40 years of the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismantled as Stasi ( secret police ) made for the files archive and the shredding room . <p> Thankfully , there was just too much to shred , too much to hide , too many notes to wipe from the slate of history , from the mundane that informed the authorities what colour people liked to paint their front doors to who might be having an affair with whom and on through reams of scribblings that noted down the precise dosages of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs some of them clinically trialled on human guinea pigs that had fuelled the GDR sports medals and records factory . <p> It was 1990 before reunification became official so another 25-year anniversary will be declared next year and east and west parts of the new Germany will pour over the past once more , much of that done with a sense of happiness and hope , some looking back in sadness and some searching for and finding reason to look back in anger and bitterness ( east and west ) . <p> In the realm of swimming , the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FINA World Championships in Perth , January 1991 . I recall Michael Gross taking to a platform with Kristin Otto and appealing to the media not to dwell on the doping issues . Of course , it was impossible not to do so ( Otto out and about with a bag on her back bearing the logo " Just Say No " ) - especially when , later that year , the first details of the GDR Crime of the Sporting Century emerged in the book Doping : From Research to Deceit . <p> I make no apologies for repeating words old and do so both to mark the date and for the benefit of any who may need reminding . As Germany prepares for a day of reflection on a national holiday , we take the opportunity to recall why we should never forget what came to pass . The day is all the more poignant because it marks the passing two years ago of Nick Thierry , a staunch advocate for clean sport , a coach , publisher and supporter of recording the truth no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed , I give thanks for the fall of the Wall , for what was unearthed , for all those who sought to get to the truth and to those who went to great lengths to report it , none less so than my colleague Karin , who sat in on the doping trials of the late 1990s and reported from them in English . <h> Doping : From Research to Deceit <p> The book confirmed -- in part through Stasi and other documents saved from the shredders by people , since deceased , who worked with the authors Prof. Werner Franke and his wife Brigitte Berendonk the existence and nauseating detail of State Plan 14:25 , complete with the dosages of Oral Turinabol administered to specific athletes , generations of swimmers included . <p> On 26 August 1993 , after the former GDR had disbanded itself to accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990 , records were opened and State Plan 14:25 confirmed : the Stasi , the GDR state secret police , supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was officially unique in so far as having a state plan designed to win in international sport as a way of saying ' look how great our democratic republic and socialist/communist state is ' . <p> The body and bulk of what was discovered is now held in places public and private in several countries , safe from the long arm of any single authority that may ver wish to suppress the truth . Some of that evidence was used in legal cases against coaches , doctors and others in the German doping trials of the late 1990s and subsequent compensation claims by athletes who suffered a spectrum of woes , from personal health , physical and psychological problems to the horrors of inheritance in the form of children born with club feet and a variety of other disabilities . <p> Oral Turinabol was just part of the poisonous cocktail of substances administered not only to medal-winning ' ambassadors in tracksuits ' but to many who were never destined to make it beyond the Berlin Wall . Like the bulk of good but not world-class swimmers in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they served as human guinea pigs to test the effectiveness of substances that had never been clinically trailed in labs before bing administered to the athletes . <p> The Times in London carried the first post-reunification interview with Kornelia Ender in December 1991 , penned by me and revealing her recollection of regular injections and pills that she now knew , along with the rest of us , to be performance-enhancing substances . News agencies , broadcasters and news publications galore from around the world revealed similar cases , after cases , many confirming the shocking depth , width , malice aforethought and criminality of State Plan 14:25 . <p> In the late 1990s , as the doping trials unfolded , a special page on the internet was created by doping victims trying to gain justice and compensation , listing people involved in State Plan 14:25 . Those people included Dr Lothar Kipke , who remains on the list of those who received " FINA Pins " , the awards given to those who have graced swimming with good service and upheld all the best of values . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others with cause to speak up for their athletes to have Kipke and other convicted criminals removed from the FINA honours list and for that to be officially recorded and publicised . This year , after a campaign to recognise victims of the GDR crime on both sides of the divide , I lodged a request with FINA to have that situation reviewed . I am yet to hear news of any progress . <p> It is well past the time when leading members of FINA , the USA at the helm of them , pressed for the kind of recognition of the past that would result in Kipke 's official removal from the list of FINA honourees with an accompanying statement acknowledging the crimes committed , as recorded by the German court . <h> State Plan 14:25 <p> State Plan 14:25 held that children ( for many of those doped , particularly in sports such as swimming , were under age ) would be doped with substances such as anabolic steroids , some never clinically tested on animals before human guinea pigs were plied with them , and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blueprint refers to the drugs as " " , or " supporting means " . The blueprint would not be signed as official policy until 1974 but experimentation on athletes started much earlier certainly from 1971 with research for the plan dating back to the mid 1960s . It was the biggest pharmacological experiment in sports history . <p> The drugs , administered by doctors and coaches , included Oral-Turinabol , a synthetic anabolic agent developed for cancer patients ; testosterone derivatives ; and " STS 646 " , a drug considered too dangerous to licence inside the GDR but given to teenagers before being tested on lab rats . " The pills came in a box of chocolates , " Catherine would say in court in 1999 . You are unlikely to know her name . By the time she spoke she had suffered seven miscarriages in the years after quitting the sport in which she was fed a diet of drugs but not for international glory . " I was a guinea-pig . I was used to test drugs for better athletes so they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The masterminds behind the plan were Manfred Ewald and Dr Manfred Hoeppner . Hoeppner made his base at 21 Strasse , Berlin , doping HQ , the hub of State Plan 14:25 if you like . The room is just 3 metres square . In it he penned his reports for his Stasi ( secret police ) overlords on a fold-down table he had installed because there was no room for a proper table . The room was all taken up by boxes of steroids ready for shipping to sports programmes around the country . Hoeppner filed some 1,000 reports to his Stasi contact . Ewald was always in the loop as chief political player at the scene of the crime . In 2000 , Ewald , then 74 , was found guilty on 20 counts of contributing to bodily harm , the tip of an iceberg of his involvement in a terrible crime . <p> Ewald , who started off his court case a confident and robust man but ended it with a ruling that his health would only allow him to appear for two hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-month suspended sentence , the fact that they had criminal convictions against their names more pertinent than the lenient nature of their penalties . Together they had faced 142 counts of assisting grievous bodily harm . On grounds of time , the judge heard just 22 cases before coming to his conclusion that the men before him were as guilty as sin . <p> Ewald was not handed a financial penalty , as so many others were , for his part in State Plan 14:25 , on the grounds that much time had past since he had been up to his eyeballs in guilt . It took German authorities the best part of 10 years to get cases to court , even though the same evidence as produced in 1998-2000 had been available in 1992-93 . <p> At Hoeppner 's right-hand was Dr Lothar Kipke , member of the medical commission of FINA . In that capacity he bangs the anti-doping drum but back home he is one of the worst offenders in the sporting crime of the century . A former member of the Nazi party , Kipke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Joseph Mengele of GDR sport " . He will also be damned by Hoeppner 's hand . <p> " In preparation for team travel to the US , Dr Kipke forced ... athletes to be given testosterone injections . Dr Kipke is brutal in giving the injections . He does n't consider any pain it causes to the athlete and almost rams the into the body . " -- Hoeppner 's notes to his Stasi liaison officer . <p> Hoeppner and Kipke sat at the helm of a covert network that coerced and corrupted doctors , coaches , scientists , chemists and swimmers , among others athletes . He keeps a tight ship : beyond issuing " supporting means guidelines " with specific instructions on dosages , he orders abortions : <p> " Should a pregnancy occur while anabolic steroids are being taken then it is recommended in all cases that an abortion is carried out . " Children born to athletes who had taken steroids are to be delivered in a Stasi clinic so that " a decision could be taken as to what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoeppner later got cold feet as the monster he created got out of control and coaches started to choose their own doses for their girls ( and boys ) . Most victims were teenage girls . Carola Nitschke and Antje Stille were 13 when they were put on a steroid regime , court cases would reveal in 1999 and 2000 . In his trial , Kipke adopted the role of Nazi concentration camp guard : " I was only following orders ... " . There to hear him was former swimmer Martina , who urged her abuser to " look my 15-year-old son in the eyes and tell him you were just following orders " . Her son , Daniel , sat beside her , his clubfoot swinging under the bench . <p> NADA 's 2014 educational material seeks to have young people understand how their bodies are magnificent without the need to cheat <p> The network headed by Hoeppner and Kipke extended to beyond Berlin HQ . In Leipzig , Prof Dr Helga Pfeifer is among those rolling out State Plan 14:25 . As she confessed me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days after it was revealed that she had been selling flume equipment for Chinese swim programmes in Shanghai : <p> " Yes , I was involved . I knew about the doping ... The doctors decided . I was informed . I knew . I did n't want to risk 35 years of sports science work and I do n't feel I have to apologise for that . I know which system I had to live and grow up in . No-one at the time knew how long that system would be in place . " <p> Pfeifer handles the sports science data at the heart some of the biggest Olympic sports , swimming included . It is unfair , she told me , to taint " brilliant " work with the doping that was a part of something bigger . Many beg to differ , if only because neither she nor we can say how good GDR swimmers might have been had fair play been the watchword of a rotten regime . Two months after the Berlin Wall fell , Pfeifer , with official government permission Down Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her scientific papers were still to be found in the library of the AIS in recent years . <p> Pfeifer , along with many others steeped in the task of rolling out State Plan 14:25 were never called to account in a court of law . Among coaches , national team coaches Juergen Tanneberger and Wolfgang Richter and the East German swimming federation general secretary Egon Muller were among those who received one-year suspended jail sentences after being found guilty grievous bodily harm for having distributed steroids to under-age athletes without their knowledge . Several other national team coaches who had continued to coach Olympic , world and European champions throughout the 1990s , also had their careers brought to a halt after being convicted in trials in 1999 and 2000 . <p> If their guilt was weighty it paled by comparison to that of Kipke , of whom one lawyer for victims said : <p> " He gave injections , he initiated experiments , and did n't care about the individuals . He knew exactly what he was doing . " <p> Kipke , 76 and retired in Leipzig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin in 2000 with this explanation : " At 14 the girls were biologically adult . That 's why we could give them the stuff . They were n't considered minors anymore . " Or even human , some might say . <p> was found guilty on 58 counts of grievous bodily harm to underage female athletes , was served a 15-month suspended sentence and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine . That was January 2000 . By October 3 that year , time would run out on the GDR doping court cases under a statute of limitations and all those not already called would walk free . was among seven GDR officials to receive honours from FINA . He received his in 1985 , the year in which Stasi documents show that those who were spying on a spy reported back to Stasi bosses that Kipke appeared to relish administering doping in a " brutal " way . The rotten regime itself saw in Kipke a man who ought to be reined in . Dark irony indeed . <p> Among doctors called to court to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would set up a surgery in Strasse in post GDR days with the very purpose of helping victims of the GDR doping system . In court , Rosler broke down in tears when she faced some of those victims and said : <p> " I should have shown more courage . In Nazi Germany we did what we were told to do . The GDR doping machine was no different ; we were just carrying out medical orders ... have we not learned anything ? " <p> No such level of remorse from Dr Dieter , Dr Ulrich Sunder ( sounds like S ? nde , ' sin ' in German ) and Dr Horst Tausch . They all broke the Hippocratic oath and indeed the law when they administered drugs to swimmers . They were convicted of bodily harm . They continued to practice as doctors years after the doping factory their talents were put to use in had ceased to produce dark results . Among others working in the system was Dr Eberhard Koehler , who sought an injunction to try to prevent publication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named . <p> He was not alone among those wishing to keep the past a secret and denying that events took place in the way that Stasi documents clearly suggested that they did . Before travel to racing outside the GDR , all swimmers were tested and their urine samples sent to the IOC-accredited laboratory at Kreischa , a place charged by the Olympic movement with the task of catch cheats . In fact , what Kreischa did was to make sure the world would never catch the GDR cheating . Sportsmen and women found positive for drugs simply stayed at home , many after serious attempts had been made to wash their bodies of damning evidence . Little wonder that not a single GDR swimmer was ever caught , even though Stasi documents would later reveal the names , with specific doses of drugs administered , of generations of Olympic and world and European swimming champions . <p> In my archive is a copy of a Stasi document that shows tests taken on four women three already Olympic champions by then -- at Kreischa , a place not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words . The tests were conducted two weeks before racing at the 1989 European championships in Bonn . All four were massively over the allowable **28;114;TOOLONG limit . Between them they claimed six solo medals , four gold , a silver and a bronze , while all four women contributed to a clean sweep of all three relay events for the GDR . Between 1970 and 1989 , no other nation claimed a gold medal in women 's relays at the European championships . <p> Many a success was built on a little blue pill made in Jena at the eponymous drugs company Jenapharm . Its representative sat at the table when State Plan 14:25 was discussed and honed , according to Stasi papers . None was ever called to account for their role in the mass abuse of large numbers of young athletes . <p> " If the treatment with anabolics is long-term , or at high dosages , real possibility for androgenic side effects exists . Skin conditions such as acne will develop , virilisation effects such as deeping of the voice , growth of facial hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypertrophy will all occur . " -- Jenapharm ( drug company ) paper , 1965 . <p> In 2003 , , beyond its GDR days , won Germany 's Golden Pill Award for services to womanhood . Two years on the company was named in a law suit by 162 athletes , many of them swimmers . 's parent companies denied any wrongdoing . In a statement , Jenapharm acknowledged that the company was obliged to " collaborate in the GDR ' 14.25 ' , but that it was not a driving force behind the national GDR doping programme " . The blame rested with politicians , sports doctors and coaches . The athletes ' claims were unfounded , the company said . <p> Ultimately , an out-of-court settlement was reached and victims compensated by the pharmaceutical industry in Germany and by the German Olympic Committee , which assumed the responsibilities of the GDR Olympic body after reunification . <p> Among the victims were swimmers who in their 30s and 40s suffered defects to heart , liver , gallbladder , chronic back pain , damaged spines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given birth to disabled children . <p> Some of those stories may only be told alongside revelations found in Stasi documents confirming the sporting crime of the century because of Prof Werner Franke , a cell biologist and cancer expert in Heidelberg , his wife Brigitte Berendonk and their lawyer Dr Michael Lehner . <p> One of the few victims to have spoken eloquently in public about her plight is Rica Reinisch , who at the age of 15 won three gold medals at the Olympic Games of Moscow in 1980 , each win producing a world record . " The worst thing was that I did n't know I was being doped , " she told The Guardian years later . <p> " I was lied to and deceived . Whenever I asked my coach what the tablets were I was told they were vitamins and preparations . " <p> Stasi ( secret police ) documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped <p> Years on and Prof Franke would say : " There was no medical reason to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democratic Republic . It was against medical ethics . Everybody knew these drugs were not allowed . The people who participated in this clandestine operation knew that they would lose privileges if they refused to take part . <p> " But they also knew they would n't be executed . Some of the arguments now resemble those brought forward in the Third Reich . Those involved disapproved of what they were doing . They knew it was wrong . But they also knew it was a matter of national prestige , and was good for their careers . The Jesuits have a saying : ' For the greater glory of God . ' This is what happened here . " <p> God and goodness , of course , had nothing to do with the abomination of the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 . <p> It was from 1990 that the many who spoke out against the massive deception on which GDR sport was built felt truly free to do so . Two decades on from reunification , there are those who prefer to stay silent rather than tell the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their rightful claim to history . And there are former athletes who can not lead normal lives , who live in pain , who take daily medication to help them to cope with the fallout of the poison pumped into their bodies . <p> In 2009 , on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , Deutsche Welle reported the case of Berlin resident Birgit Boese , for whom just getting to and from work is a triumph . Noted the report : The 48-year-old former athlete depends on crutches to get around , and she and her husband have to forego visits together to the theater , movies or local swimming pool . " Because of the pain , we ca n't really take part in public life , " she told DW . <p> Once groomed to show the world that the GDR was best at shot put , Boese now suffers from an irregular heartbeat , high-blood pressure , diabetes , nerve damage , kidney problems , " and a list of other ailments that have made her all but an invalid " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 11 , when she started at sports school and was told to take the little blue pills that fed the East German medals machine . <p> Boese and 183 other victims of State Plan 14:25 were awarded compensation in 2006 from the German Olympic Sports Organisation ( DOSB ) and the drug company Jenapharm . Each received 9,250 euros from the pharmaceutical company in an out-of-court settlement and 170 of the plaintiffs were paid another 9,250 euros from the DOSB . Said Boese : <p> " It helped , sure . But for those with chronic illnesses and who have to pay out of pocket for medications , the money did n't go that far . " <p> Officialdom in swimming has taken a ' ' approach to all of the above . This year , there were plenty of signs that Germany has long moved on : at the European Championships in Berlin in August , the corridors down which athletes , coaches media , public and others flowed to get to the stands were lined with an exhibition that related the story of the GDR 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all . <p> Alongside the billboard presentations were stands belonging to NADA , the German anti-doping agency . There were brochures for parents and other brochures for their athletic offspring , agents were on call to answer questions and information was abundantly available . Bravo ! <p> Germany has had a tough time keeping up in world waters of late but it has reached a deeper understanding with its past , settled on a better course and can be proud of having done so . <h> A Different Perspective <p> Long gone is the time to stop portraying 14 to 16-year-old victims of abuse as thieves , cheats and deceivers ( that thought as pertinent today as it was back in the days of the GDR and the 1990s ) . Those whose names flood the books of swimming records and results from the 1970s and 1980s grew up in a time and a place and in circumstances that put a torch to suggestions that they had a choice , could have objected , could have told someone , could have gone home told their parents and expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , at the political level and beyond sport , in which , some objectors who later developed cancer believe that they were deliberately exposed to radiation while waiting to be called for interrogation ; a country in which many were shot dead while trying to escape to a place of choice through barbed-wire barricades . <p> Down the years , I have met many of the GDR 's swim champions and medallists . In two cases , I detected a troubling tone of self-justification and defence of an indefensible system . In the vast bulk of cases , the swimmers , polite , pleasant , well-educated and getting on with what might be described as " ordinary lives " beyond the pills and potions and sports-related problems that they endure manage to speak with dignity and patience about painful episodes in their lives . <p> Some of them may well have gold medals but they are all victims to one degree of another . Victims of the likes of Kipke , who , like them , has kept his international honour in official terms . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA . Do current IOC members want history to repeat itself on their watch . One would hope not . <p> Our purpose was clear : let the record stand alongside every footnote necessary to make sport an honest place for future generations while treating victims on all sides with the dignity and recognition that they deserve . <p> Official silence has followed . On the day that Germany celebrates the first 25 years of a new beginning , may that silence deafen those who have had the power but not the courage to act . <p> The SwimVortex Guide To The Rio 2016 Olympic Games , out soon , will place an asterisk by every Olympic podium placer or world-record setter , as well as current ranked swimmers , who us to do so . <h> More Topics <h> 
 on any sort of symbolic gesture . Probably not going to see goggles placed atop the starting block . Not going to see a cap laid in the pool to float away . Probably just going to see a wave to the jam-packed stands , and the meeting of eyes with family . Then , he 'll be gone , twenty-something Olympic medals unlikely to be matched ever . <p> When Michael Phelps walks away from the sport after the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , he 'll follow a path that many athletes make at the end of an Olympiad : He 'll retire . Phelps traveled this road once before , of course , claiming he was finished after the London Games four years ago . This time , he means it , and since he 's going out the way he wants on this occasion , there 's no reason to think he 'll backpedal as the 2020 Games in Tokyo come into focus . <p> But what about the guy who has pushed Phelps the most ? What are his plans ? <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop having fun , " said Ryan Lochte , Phelps ' longtime rival . " Right now , I 'm finding more and more ways of enjoying the sport , and getting the love and passion for it that I had as a little kid . I 'm finding it again . So , hint-hint , I do n't think this will be my last go-around . I 'm not hanging up the Speedo just yet . " <p> In Rio , Lochte will embrace his lightest Olympic schedule since he made his Games debut in 2004 . As was the case in Athens , Lochte will contest the 200 individual medley and race for the United States on the 800 freestyle relay , which is chasing a fourth consecutive Olympic crown . This time around , there will be no 400 individual medley . No 200 freestyle . No 200 backstroke . Since Lochte will celebrate his 32nd birthday just before the Opening Ceremony , the easier load could prove advantageous . <p> The Olympic schedule has never played into Lochte 's hands , and the Team USA veteran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult double -- finals of the 200 backstroke and 200 medley in a tight timeframe . In both 2008 and 2012 , Lochte went into the medley in depleted fashion . In pursuit of a fourth medal in the event , Lochte will be fresh . <p> The 200 medley has enough cache in the fact that a three-way tussle is expected between Phelps , the three-time defending champion , Lochte and Japan 's Kosuke Hagino . But with Phelps ' impending retirement , the event surges in status with the knowledge that it will mark the final duel of the longstanding rivalry between the American men . <p> How the last chapter unfolds will be determined on the evening of August 11 . While Phelps owns the past three Olympic titles , Lochte has won the past four world championships . Meanwhile , Hagino is the rising star , and hungry to supplant his U.S. foes as the event 's top dog . For his part , Lochte views himself as the underdog . His last meeting with Phelps is also not going overlooked . <p> " Just racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a swim meet , it 's a great feeling , " Lochte said . " He 's the hardest competitor I 've ever had to go against . He 's not likely to back down , and I 'm not either . Just the friendship we 've made since 2004 has been great for the sport . No matter what , win or lose , we 'll still be friends , and the rivalry we 've created has been great . " <p> Between them , Phelps and Lochte own seven world championships and the times in history , with the world record sitting to Lochte at 1:54.00 from the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai . Additionally , the Americans are the only men to crack the 1:55 barrier , Hagino the next-closest at 1:55.07 from earlier this year . <p> Laszlo Cseh by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> If there is a bummer element to the final 200 individual medley showdown between Phelps and Lochte , it 's the fact that the main supporting character from the past will not be involved . Hungarian Laszlo Cseh will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in order to emphasize those pursuits , he 's ditched the medley events . Cseh was fourth in the 200 I.M. in 2004 , earned silver in 2008 and was the bronze medalist in 2012 . <p> Lochte enters Rio with 11 career Olympic medals , a total he shares with Hall of Fame countrymen Mark Spitz and Matt Biondi . One medal next month would tie Lochte with Dara Torres , Jenny Thompson and Natalie Coughlin for the second-most medals by a swimmer . If he medals in each of his events , his total of 13 would leave him trailing only Phelps in his sport , and would place him in a tie for fourth in Summer Games history . <p> While Phelps will move on after Rio , Lochte 's revelation that he 'll continue competing brings into play some intriguing storylines . First , can he continue to excel on the global stage as he moves closer to his mid-30s ? More , can he become the first individual to capture five straight world titles in an event , an opportunity that will confront Lochte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan Lochte by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Outside of Lochte , only Australian legend Grant Hackett ( 1500 freestyle ; 1998-2005 ) has won four consecutive world titles in an event . From 2001 through 2011 , Phelps won five of six crowns in the 200 butterfly , the only year without the title the 2005 campaign , in which Phelps chose to bypass his prime event . <p> Whatever shakes out for the future , Lochte is enjoying each day at the pool . He 's also treating his latest Team USA nod with as much zeal as his first . <p> " I 'm a lot older . That 's the biggest change , " Lochte said . " I know what to expect ... how it works . I 'm excited . I feel like it 's my first Olympics . I 'm ready to race and represent my country . That 's the greatest feeling , to represent the United States on the highest stage in sports . " <h> Comments <p> I hope Lochte qualify for 200 IM in the next year world championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 2016 <p> As long as he 's still up to international team snuff and enjoys getting up and going to work every day , no need to retire just yet . <p> July 22 , 2016 <p> I agree . Why retire when you have a job which you are very very good at , that you have passion with and love doing it , keep your body in preeetty good shape , travel the world and get paid for all of that . <p> That 's a dream job ! <p> If I have a job like that , I 'll hold onto it forever until they kick me out , or in the case of Lochte until he ca us to do so . <h> US citizen from 
 Ning , China 's top two title hopes in the pool at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games next month , had better have been honing their writing and anti-doping skills of late given the test that they and all others on the national team , all sports , face before being allowed to board the plane . <p> According to Reuters , the news agency , China is asking all athletes and coaches not only to sign a pledge not to use banned substances but pass a written test before having their Rio selection rubber stamped . <p> The purpose : to enforce a zero tolerance stance on doping in the wake of the McLaren Report and ahead of the IOC decision on Russia come Sunday . That 's according to China . Critics of a nation with a serious doping record look on doubtfully and , inevitably , talk of ' talking the talk , not talking the walk ' and of ' saving face ' . <p> Gao Zhidan , vice director of China 's General Administration of Sport who will lead China 's delegation , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- while those who scored less than 80 out of 100 points on the written test would be barred from travelling to Rio de Janeiro . <p> What is not made clear in the report is what the written test asks . <p> For Sun , the following would be pertinent : <p> have you read the 2016 WADA Code ? <p> have you found a replacement for the banned heart booster than caused your downfall ? <p> do you know that it is forbidden to work with a doctor or coach or any other official serving a suspension for falling four of the WADA Code ? <p> and for Ning , perhaps : <p> did you know that clenbuterol is a banned substance ? <p> had you heard the myriad warnings issued from 2005 to 2011 about the dangers of eating meat in China without knowing its provenance ? <p> have you been far more careful with your diet of late as a member of the China national swim team ? <p> As they sit their test , they will doubtless have the words of Gao Zhidan ringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doping and have a zero-tolerance approach to this particular problem . We have made it very clear that we want to ensure fair play and the well-being of athletes . " <p> It must be assumed that Gao Zhidan will marry the tough stance to news of an IOC clampdown on abuse that stretches to inappropriate behaviour , such as having a meal member of staff disappear into a toile near the call room with a 16-year-old schoolgirl for several minutes before each of her Olympic finals . <p> Meanwhile , the bold new stance of China is to be welcomed . May deed follow word . It is neither word nor saving face that will count , of course , but follow through and preserving the health of China 's youth and the reputation of a country with an appalling record of doping . <h> Comments <p> July 21 , 2016 <p> China is all about putting up facade and saving face . <p> If they were really serious about anti-doping stance , they could have given out serious punishments to their dopers and be transparent about doping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Russia with state support doping systems , but the problem with China is that they do n't want the world to know when their athletes failed any doping tests . That , and also their sports system is competitive with each other and this is where doping is mostly done . <p> The world would not have known Yang 's positive test if a local media had n't leaked the news months after the fact . They are not taking Wang to Rio even if he 's their no 1 breaststroker just because they do n't want to be embarrassed if FINA later wanted harsher punishment for him . <p> Ger July 21 , 2016 <p> I 've heard it all now : a written test . <p> I do n't know what to make of it all . AS asf says , these are the same people who have been way too lenient and quite prepared to sweep the dirt under the carpet in the past . <p> Dan smith July 21 , 2016 <p> I do n't think China , s leaving wang behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via harsher punishment for . Ning tested positive for the same substance and is going to Rio . China have banned some of their best swimmers in the past . Eg they banned their best prio to the beijing olympics , ouyang for life . He was the national record holder in the 50,100 and 200 backstrokes. it must have been tough for them to ban him for life . He was their best and china had never even produced a decent backstroker before then . FINA and even WADA thought the ban was nuts but as you know China listens to nobody . They banned the dude <p> Today , Wang is their best breaststroker and we all know china struggles greatly in the breaststrokes. he , s actually the national record holder in the 100 breast and yet China is leaving him home . <p> July 22 , 2016 <p> Dan Smith , As Craig has reported in the recent past article , Wang is one of the 6 swimmers tested positive for clenbuterol . Out of 6 , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known names were given warning as punishment . In April , FINA said they were going to review the clenbuterol cases where 3 swimmers were only given warnings to decide whether they are going to appeal to CAS for harsher penalty . FINA has not hear made any decision . But now with all the talk about doping and IOC forced to take tough action against doping , FINA will be put under the spotlight if China take to Rio and may likely ask for 's suspension . China can not risk getting embarrassed like that so they leave home . Yes is their best breaststroker but they still have another breaststroker with 59.7 , so not really a loss . As for Ning and Yang , their doping suspension was a few years ago , and even if they still take something they will be more careful . They are not as stupid as Efimova . <p> July 22 , 2016 <p> As for , it proves my point about China 's putting up facade and saving face . As I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regime like Russia , but they have dirty coaches in the Provincial centers . China does n't want to be embarrassed by their athletes doping scandal when hosting the Olympics . Giving lifetime ban served multiple purposes : warning to other Chinese athletes not to dope or at least not to be sloppy when doping , and show the world that they are serious in fighting PED . In 2009 , 's lifetime ban was converted into 2 years ban and he us to do so . <h> RNC 2016 : 
 and you get an idea of the scale of threat to the Olympic Movement the Russian doping crisis actually is : <p> " Vladimir Putin is the most famous ( former ) KGB agent in the world and the ( former ) head of the KGB 's successor , FSB ( 1998-1999 ) . Mr Putin was rightly described as the most powerful man in the Olympic world over the last decade . This has probably changed but he is still a major factor in the Olympic business . On Friday , Mr Putin announced a " proposal to the Russian Olympic Committee " ... on establishing an independent this is very important -- public commission that would include both Russian and foreign experts in medicine and law , as well as respected public and sports activists and experts . The commission 's key task would be to quickly develop a national anti-doping plan that involves strict oversight of its implementation . " <p> " Mr Putin -- Honorary President of International Judo Federation ( IJF ) ; Honorary President of the European Judo Union ( EJU ) ; Honorary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sport developed in the Red Army and the KGB in the Soviet Union ; holder of the black belt in karate ; holder of the 8th dan of judo ; Master of Sports in judo ; honorary doctorate in judo from Yong In university ; and Master of Sports in Sambo ( among other titles ) made a second , for want of a better word , recommendation : <p> " The question is , of course , who would head the commission ? Clearly , the answer is a person with an absolutely impeccable reputation , somebody who has credibility and the respect of the Olympic family . We have a person like this in our country . It is Vitaly Smirnov , Russia 's representative in the International Olympic Committee , a member since 1971 . I think we should ask him to head up the commission . I hope that he will accept as a person who has devoted so many years to the Olympic movement and the development of sports in our country . " <p> " Well now ... <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibility and the respect of the Olympic family . <p> " The 81 years old Vitaly Smirnov , IOC member from 1971-2015 , now an honorary member , was First Vice-Minister of Sport of the USSR ( 1970-1975 ) ; Minister of Sport of the Russian Federation ( 1981-1990 ) among other senior positions , he served as Executive President of the Organising Committee of the Games of the XXII Olympiad Moscow 1980 ( 1975- 1981 ) ; was USSR National Olympic Committee President ( 1990-1992 ) ; President ( 1992-2001 ) then Honorary President ( 2001- ) of the Russian Olympic Committee . Cynics would argue that Mr Smirnov may have inside knowledge about both the Soviet state doping system and Russia 's doping system . <p> " Cynics would also mention that dear Mr Smirnov was involved in strange Olympic bids in the 1990s ( St. Petersburg and Sochi in early stages ) which were connected to allegations of money laundering and other olympic deals ( ask Andr ? Guelfi ) . Mr Smirnov was involved in a costly and dubious failed Olympic Lottery scheme that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and members of his family have been involved in several olympic schemes of alleged bribery ( Atlanta 1996 , Salt Lake City 2002 ) and dubious businesses in Switzerland connected to the Lausanne-based White Flag Foundation . And that 's just a brief summary . " <p> " A person with an absolutely impeccable reputation , somebody who has credibility and the respect of the Olympic family . <p> " Let 's have a look at the secret Olympic world . According to a Russian historian , Mr Smirnov was also a KGB agent . The historian , Yuri Felshtinsky , wrote in his book " The KGB plays Chess " , published in 2009 : <p> " Vitaly Smirnov , the Vice President of the International Olympic Committee and head of the NOC of the USSR , was recruited in 1978 by the deputy head of the Fifth Directorate of the KGB , Major General Ivan . " <p> " So , what 's going to happen now in Russia , in July 2016 in the heat of the Olympic crisis ? Well , one could conclude : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that another former KGB agent acts as chair of an " independent commission " with the task to develop a national anti-doping plan . " <h> Thomas Bach and how he came to be where he is <p> Weinreich notes : " The infamous sport-political department of Adidas ' boss Horst Dassler ( 1936-1987 ) was the focus of KGB and Stasi attention . Under the leadership of Dassler , a group of several well-known gentlemen played a major role in Olympic business . Dassler 's crew influenced Olympic bids , elections in Olympic IF 's , the allocation of lucrative marketing contracts and almost everything Horst Dassler was interested in . From 1985 to 1987 a young German lawyer , eager to learn and talented in sports politics , worked as Dassler 's loyal assistant : Thomas Bach . <p> " Mr Bach , who became an IOC member in 1991 and was elected as the 9th IOC President in 2013 , has always declared that , during his time with Adidas and Horst Dassler , he was never involved in dirty dealings nor did he ever experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of events as presented by Weinreich , including the tale of how Samaranch became IOC president is truly disturbing . <p> As you read the piece , keep in mind that it was Samaranch who pushed medals back across a trable at two GDR swimmers who wished to return their prizes in recognition that they were doped under State Plan 14:25 and told the women swimmers : " Keep them , you were not the only ones who were doped " . <p> Meanwhile , Bach also has business connections in Russia . After becoming president of the IOC , he kept his other role as chairman of the supervisory board of Weinig , a Germany company that makes woodworking machinery . Wining has its headquarters near Moscow . <p> Bach has met Putin on many occasions and is steeped in connections through the wider Olympic family . IN 2014 , he received FINA 's highest honour from Julio Maglione , who has yet to comment on the McLaren Report . If the IOC pass responsibility on to the likes of FINA when it comes to whether Russia will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely as an abdication of responsibility . <p> Time for Bach to show that he means it when he says ' zero-tolerance ' , when he speaks the words contained in his Agenda 2020 program . <p> Russia , meantime , continues to be a power broker in Olympic sports . Patrick Hickey , an Irish member of the IOC 's executive board , has been trying to persuade the Russian government to host the 2019 European Games . That may now be on the rocks , the IOC having ruled Russia out of hosting any major Olympic sports events until further notice . <p> The European Games , itself , is a project that may not survive , individual sports such as swimming keen to continue to run their own senior continental showcase events and favouring a model of cooperation not the building of another empire . <p> If Hickey is pro-Russia on the IOC board , he rubs up against Craig Reedie there -- and the WADA president is among those calling for Russia to be excluded from Rio . Sunday brings the first debate at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wider world will know how serious the Olympic Movement is about its own future if the wait turns out to be so long . <p> Some Russian sports writers are speculating today that the decision will be delivered on Sunday and that Vitaly Mutko , the Russian sports minister , has drafted his resignation letter . <p> Perhaps something can be rebuilt from the ashes but it would have to be a much slimmer , much humbler &amp; transparent organisation .... and I hope they have first rate financial investigators ! ! Whether they may still be a " market " is another matter . <p> IOC will ban the whole Russia from participating in Rio but will ask sporting Federations to examine the merits of individual Russian athletes to compete under IOC flag . I know that Daily Mail is not the most trustworthy of news sources , but if us to do so . <p> This website and 
 our month-long countdown to racing in Rio with a look at some of the most significant swims of Olympic season so far on the clock , we turn our attention to consistency ; the rate at which contenders stack up quality efforts in the top 10 , top 20 and top 25 performances . <p> Last year in Kazan , Emily Seebohm claimed both the 100 and 200m world titles to match the same result among men for Mitch Larkin and grant Australia a golden sweep of Olympic backstroke distances . <p> Seebohm had the edge on the rest not only in speed but skills , stamina and finishing might . Madison Wilson joined her for an Aussie 1-2 in the 100m , while Missy Franklin ( USA ) added silver in the 200m to the Olympic crown of 2012 and the world title of 2013 . All three arrive in Rio as strong contenders , while Belinda Hocking ( AUS ) grants Australia a third podium contender on backstroke in Rio . <p> The form guide also places Mie Nielsen ( DEN ) , Katinka Hosszu ( HUN ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Olivia Smoliga ( USA ) and Kylie Masse ( CAN ) are among those on the cusp of progress in the nick of time . <p> In keeping with the theme of the series , we do n't have to look too far to find the queen of consistency in the 100m : Emily Seebohm has built one of the most powerful event ownerships in the clock all events , all-time as the owner of 28 of the best 50 100m backstroke efforts ever seen ( that count in textile ) . All but three of those efforts are sub-59 . <p> As noted below , Franklin , the queen of all-time ranks in the 200m , will not defend the two-lap crown but will be a force heading into the four-lapper . If Franklin owns 4/4 , 6/10 and 20/20 of the best performances ever but has not come close to best since 2013 , then Seebohm , at her best in 2015 , and Hocking , almost back to best this year , are top of the class among the next in line on the scale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seebohm shares the top time of the season going into Rio with Nielsen , at 58.73 , that speed attained at the most signicant moment for both , respectively for the win at the Australian Olympic trials and for the European title . Nielsen has momentum with her and is due a drop to the zone . Second at London 2016 in 58.94 was Hosszu , the Hungarian with a reputation for swimming fast often but whose consistency of speed on backstroke pales by comparison to her rivals . <p> While Hosszu 's effort is her sole entry among the top 20 performances this year , Seebohm has four of the best 7 and Nielsen has three of the best 10 and five of the best 20 . <p> Knocking at the door of the sub-59 club this year are Smoliga ( USA ) and Masse ( CAN ) , while Wilson , who gave Australia the 2 in the 1-2 at world titles last year , has skirted the low 59s three times this year . The only two others in the best 20 are US No 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to junior waters yet but promising a tall wave for the Dolphins to ride in the years ahead , Minna Atherton , at 19th best effort among eight swimmers . <p> Denmark 's Mie Nielsen has sharpening her nails for Olympic season and could become the first Danish 100m back winner since Harup in 1948 -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Her 59.34 lifetime best was delivered at the Brisbane Grand Prix of late and indicates the progress in the ranks building behind double world champion Seebohm : four years ago heading into London 2012 , Atherton 's best would have ranked her 9th on the pre-Olympic performances list ; go back to 2004 and the Aussie teen would have led the world by half a second heading into Athens 2004 . <p> The 58.12 world record set in a Speedo LZR in 2009 by Britain 's Gemma Spofforth remains the pace-setter on the clock but tick the textile only box and we find only two names in the best 20 ever , Seebohm , with 11/16 , trhe other five belonging to the champion of London 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just one other name appears in the top 20 , with a 58.70 , Japan 's Aya Terakawa , no longer in the race , while Nielsen and her 58.73 and Hosszu and her 58.78 from last year at world titles make the top 25 . <p> Hosszu is 27 but in terns of newcomers to that kind of speed on backstroke she is the bolter in their midst and a swimmer with an astonishing profile : never having sum below 1:03 before 2013 , she has broken 59 twice , the minute 20 times and 1:01 53 times since she first cracked the minute in 2013 in her first born-again season . <p> Seebohm enters the Rio race as the swimmer with one of the most consistent career record of quality swims in any given event ; she is world champion , world textile best holder and the speedster to beat with four years of confidence built since being pipped by Franklin in London the day after she 'd stunned herself with a 58.23 in heats . <p> With Franklin 's journey in mind , worth taking a detour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters and why the USA harnesses such things and why you will find Franklin providing the loudest of cheers when her teammates take to the water for the 100m backstroke in Rio . <p> Missy Franklin -- main image by Peter Bick ; inset , the prospective cover of " Relentless " -- new autobiography from Random House <p> Here 's a short tale from the Olympic trials in Omaha from director of the American Swimming Coaches Association , John Leonard : <p> Back around 1984 , my friend John Collins from Badger in Larchmont , NY , came up to me on deck at trials and said " The Drama is About to Unfold . " Hmm . <p> He went on to describe that at each trials there are " story lines " that emerge from the events .... will so and so make the team ? Will this athlete get to compete again in their best event ? Is this " the end " for the athletic career of a particular person . We 'd both been going to Trials events since 1972 , and agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still true today . <p> In Omaha in 2016 , there was the story of Missy Franklin , our golden girl star from London , on top of the world . The ever smiling , ever professional , sparkling personality that inspires children all over the world . A truly delightful human being ... regardless of how she is swimming . <p> And her last couple of years had been beset with injury and difficulty . She came to Omaha in June with a great , rebuilt , ready to swim body . Marvelous job of getting ready by her , and by her coach Todd Schmitz and her support team . And then , in her first couple of events , she struggled . And we began to wonder , " is it possible that poor Missy MIGHT NOT be on the team to Rio ? " Pretty depressing that .... <p> Missy created my most memorable moment of Trials . In the semi-finals of the 100 back , she had what can charitably be called a less than stellar swim . You would expect some unhappiness on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet away from her , Missy got out of the pool , walked behind the blocks ... and cheered for the top two seeds in the other semi-final ! She yelled loudly and repeatedly , " Let 's GO X and Y and Let 's Go X No 2 ( since they both had the same first name ) . <p> Instant tears from me . Right in front of my eyes , the meaning of sport , the meaning of life , what we all coach for all the years ... an ATHLETE ( yes , in her case , all caps ) who understands that sport is about competing with your friends at their best ! And being happy for them when they do well , and hoping they will do well , so it will take your best performance to come out on top . <p> Missy , I am so grateful . THANK YOU . My faith in what our sport teaches and you demonstrate , fully on display . May all our young athletes learn from your example . I have already told my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many coaches as I can at clinics about this marvellous moment that you created . <p> And on that note ... <p> 200m <p> Franklin will defend the 200m crown and after a gutsy effort for silver behind Seebohm at world titles last year and given that as a member of the USA team gathered to hone for action at an Olympic Games is more likely to swim up and than down come the big moment , remains a danger for the title and a podium contender . <p> Belinda Hocking Photo : Aniko Kovacs <p> There are six 2:06 swimmers this season , led by a 2:06.49 from season Australian international Belinda Hocking , Seebohm on 2:06.59 , Hosszu on 2:06.88 in a minor moment in winter , Dirado at US trials and at Russian nationals a swimmer who may or may not be in Rio at at all , Daria K. , on 2:06.92 at nationals four years on from testing positive for a banned substance at the tender age of 14 . <p> Hosszu , with three top 10 entries on the performances list , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European crown won in 2:07.01 at a pace just slower than that best of quiet moments on Golden Tour in France , another such moment on the same circuit having produced a 2:07.36 . No fewer than nine 2:09 efforts belong to Hosszu this year , the 200m backstroke clearly one of her golden targets in Rio but whether a 24-year-old on a 2:13 best four years ago can really lift the Olympic crown at 27 four years on remains to be seen . <p> If she wins , she would be seven years older than the average winner at any time in history , Kirsty Coventry , the 2004 and 2008 champion the oldest winner for her second crown at 24 , Seebohm 's age going into Rio . What was clear in Kazan last year is that Seebohm had a specialist strength in the back end of the race that Hosszu , under pressure , simply could not cope with as Franklin found the specialist reserve to taken silver . <p> Franklin has the edge on all when it comes to all-time performances : she claimed the Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2:04.06 that no-one has got close to since , her own 2:04.76 world title a year later the only other 2:04 in history in textile , the swiftest seen in a shiny suit the 2:04.81 world crown at the Rome 2009 circus belonging to Coventry . <p> Photo : Missy Franklin by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Emily Seebohm by Craig Lord <p> Franklin has the best 4 ever , 6/10 and 10/20 of the swiftest textile efforts ever . Alot to bank on . the sub-2:06 club is complete by Seebohm , on 2:05.81 for the world title last year , and at 2:05.92 , Anastasia Fesikova ( nee Zueva ) , of Russia , from 2012 but more focussed on sprints as a comeback mum in 2016 waiting to hear if she will race in Rio because of the woe those who run sport in Russia have heaped on the heads ofn all in their country . <p> Hocking heads the list of 2:06s , with Hosszu next among those heading to the Rio race at 11th best all-time . Again , we find Hosszu boasting a unique profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime best of 2:13.50 in Olympic year 2012 to a 2:08.93 high . That , it turned out , was a mere warm-up of a warning shot . <p> Katinka Hosszu by PBK <p> Best sit down when contemplating what happened next : that is no longer among her best 80 efforts ; that 2:08.93 just scrapes into her top 30 ; in the past year she has clocked more than 25 efforts between a 2:06.18 in semis in Kazan last year on the way to world title bronze in 2:06.84 and a 2:08.92 in a quiet moment on Mare Nostrum Tour last year . Other quiet moments have included a 2:06.81 , a 2:06.88 nd four 2:07s . <p> The progress it took Seebohm to achieve over eight years from 15 years of age , Hosszu has managed in the three years from 24 to 27 . <p> That general pattern is repeated across the bulk of all world-championship events , all strokes , all distances . There is no profile like it in world swimming nor has there ever been such a profile . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more mind-boggling facts when you compare Hosszu and Seebohm is that Seebohm is at least as talented as Hosszu if not arguably more naturally talented than Hosszu . And yet Hosszu has been able to create such staggering improvements in a very short time . Hard work ? I have not heard Seebohm to have been lazy in training . Techniques ? Australian coaches have better technical knowledge than Shane Tusup . <p> Seebohm was already a world class backstroker at the age of 14 , and she swam the fourth fastest 100 back as a 4 ? 100 medley leadoff at 2007 Melbourne world championships . Seebohm was a short distance Hosszu before there was a Hosszu : she was world 's top 10 in 100/200 back , 100 and 200 IM . Seebohm won 2010 pan pacs golds in 100 and 200 IM beating the likes of Coughlin and Franklin . <p> And yet , not until she stopped swimming all other events and started focusing on 100/200 back only that she achieved speedy consistency in back events . On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more events . <p> There has truly never been a swimmer like Hosszu . <p> Well , not true . I can think of someone particular from 1996 , but even then , Hosszu 's scale and breadth of improvements and consistency dwarve that particular swimmer 's . <p> Further compounding things is that no two swims in those semifinals shared the same name ( although this is a less important detail , I suppose ) . <p> I 'm not sure if this was an intentional fabrication or a simple mistake , but it baffles me that two major publications would endorse a story that is , at the very least , factually challenged . Missy seems like a great girl and I 'm sure there are so many true examples of her good character ; she does n't need some false story out there to make herself enables us to do so 
 Efimova - a troubled season - will FINA now ban from Rio 2016 Efimova and others who ' ever ' tested positive ? - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The International Olympic Committee has failed to impose a blanket ban on Russia and has abdicated its duty by handing the decision on whether the country 's athletes can compete at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games to international federations such as FINA . <p> However , in the midst of the detail is a ban on all Russians who were ever sanctioned for doping : Yuliya , the World 100m breaststroke champion , is gone . <p> Efimova 's 16-month suspension for a positive DHEA test in 2013 was timed to allow her to return to racing for a home World Championships in Kazan last year . <p> Efimova 's only hope this time round is a Court of Arbitration appeal based on the court 's previous ban on the ' Osaka ' rule . The latter was put out of bounds on the basis that banning an athlete from the Olympic Games even after a suspension period had been served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Russian state doping and the need for the IOC to deal with that was not one of the prevailing conditions at the time the CAS ruled Osaka out . <p> In that sense , the IOC today abdicated its responsibility by passing the issue of Russia 's ' clean ' athletes on to international federations ; and may well have passed the issue of Russia 's doped athletes on to the CAS . <p> Coach leader Bill Sweetenham summed up the feelings of many when he reacted to the news with these stark words : <p> " Well it 's official that we have no leadership or standards in world Olympic sport . Cheating is now tolerated . Who awarded Rio the Olympics and will they be fired due to mismanagement ? The village unfit for habitation . A country highly suspected of cheating gets awarded the Olympics . There is nothing good or positive about this . We reap what we sew . " <p> The first words to emerge from the IOC meeting in Lausanne today confirmed that there would be no blanket ban on Russia : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian athlete they meet certain criteria " . Russians will race in Rio . How many and in which sports remains to be seen . Russian sports federations and their respective international bodies will now find any way possible to get their athletes into competition in Rio . <p> " Specific criteria " includes proving that they have not tested positive in international tests as opposed to Russian tests . That compromise places emphasis on the athletes are takes focus away from the role of the Russian state . The IOC also rejected the notion of whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova racing under a neutral flag . <p> " We had to balance the collective responsibility and the individual justice to which every human being and athlete is entitled to . This was one of the hardest decisions in the history of the Olympic Movement . " <p> He also stated that it had been a unanimous decision of the IOC board not to impose a blanket ban . In fact it came down to this : 13 in favour of , 1 not allowed to vote ( Craig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bokel ) . <p> " The ROC is not allowed to enter any athlete for the Olympic games Rio 2016 who has ever been sanctioned for doping , even if he he or she had served the sanction . " <p> It is , as yet , unclear as to what happens to relays that qualified for Rio on the back of swims from those who are now barred from action in Rio , Yuliya Efimova by far the fastest breaststroke swimmer , Russia uncertain to have qualified for the medley relay if Efimova and Daria K. are removed on breaststroke and backstroke respectively from the results of 2015 . Sanction = a threatened penalty for disobeying a law or rule . <p> A warning is precisely that , a sanction , therefore Ustinova ought to be included in the catch . In the catch , without a doubt , is repeat offender Natalia . <h> Jon Rudd Bigger that Who Is In And Who Is Out <p> Jon Rudd , mentor to Ruta Meilutyte , Olympic 100m breaststroke champion from Lithuania , set Efimova aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than who should be there or not " . He explained : <p> " It 's the fact that the system is broken . There was this wondeful historical moment and chance that could have been there today . It is an opportunity lost for IOC leaders to become historically respected leaders who people would speak of in 100 years from now and say ' do you remember when they said enough is enough -- and from 2020 onwards , things improved . " <p> " Pressure and politics and money and a bit of fear have meant that means we 've lost that opportunity and that 's just incredibly sad and frustrating . " <p> Article 3 , he said was a good thing but it was " only half a decision " , with FINA yet to declare what will happen after the " hot potato " had been passed from media to IOC , to WADA , to CAS and back to the IOC , which had now " handed it back to federations that have been capable of dealing with these things in varying degrees ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example of a federation that had a big star test positive but did not shy away from imposing the penalty due , while FINA was " at other end of spectrum and has constantly capitulated when it 's a big name who has tested positive " . <p> Efimova may now not be in Rio but Sun Yang* , of China , and Park , of Korea , will be . That represented more " inconsistency on a grand scale " , said Rudd . He added : <p> " The IOC had the opportunity to go ' we are the umbrella body of Olympic sports , we are the custodians , we will proceed with integrity ; we are responsible for how sport is seen in the world . " <p> Now , many fans and parents may now continue to doubt what they see , continue to wonder whether to send their child to sport , he wondered . Rudd said : <p> " Maybe they 'll say ' no , I 'm not sending my child to sport because they 'd be looked after better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick an intravenous syringe in their arm to get them to be better . " <p> The line that " should have been drawn in the sand " was one where the IOC said to Russia : " You are not coming because we ca n't trust you " . In despair , Rudd added : <p> " I get up in a morning to work for clean , honest sport . All of this leaves you feeling dirty and cheated . It feels like being in a dishonest relationship . " <h> Russia Reacts <p> The IOC 's criteria , however , removes the key medal hopes of Efimova and from that scenario , while including some who have excelled as juniors in Russian youth teams that have dominated at world and European levels in recent years but never returned positive tests . <p> The backdrop in Russia , however , is one in which many , many hundreds of anti-doping samples were destroyed by RUSADA on the eve of WADA investigators arriving in Moscow to demand those samples be handed over for checking . <h> The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to race in Rio : <p> Yuliya Efimova by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> 2016 -- Meldonium cases may not count , pending research into the substance by WADA . <p> Yuliya Efimova ( see 2013 ) and Grigory Tarasevich <h> 2015 <p> Yana Martynova as above banned for four year <h> 2014 <p> National Federation Case : Vladimir Dyatchin -- Ostarine ( Class S.1.2 Other Anabolic Agents ) following a doping control test conducted with the occasion of the Russian Open Water Championships 2 years suspension from July 4 , 2014 <p> The decision " reeks of the fact that the IOC is under the influence of politics and the power of national states " and the so-called autonomy of sport is dead , critics of the IOC decision speaking on the BBC have already suggested . <p> With just 12 days to go to the start of racing in the pool in Brazil , FINA , the swimming federation that has already spoken up against a blanket ban , will now simply look at its international anti-doping testing program , point out the numbers of tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to business as usual . <p> It can not , however , save Russians who have previously been sanctioned . <p> Article 3 cuts out Yuliya and Natalia and even Daria K. , who tested positive at 14 and received a warning . FINA must deliver the final verdict . <p> If and when it does , questions will flow , such as why the same does not apply to others caught using banned substances in the past one or two Olympic cycles , including Sun Yang* ( CHN ) and Park ( KOR ) . <p> An appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport may now follow but time will be tight if decisions on Rio 2016 are to be returned . <p> Davies , right , added later : " I 'm just sad that they 've passed the buck , as they so often do , down to the governing bodies , and I do n't think the governing bodies have the time to be able to do very much about this . I think the only way to send an incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ban . " <p> Asked whether that would be unfair to ' clean ' Russians , she replied : <p> " That 's the point : how do we know they 're clean ; how can we tell when samples are poured down sinks after WADA has asked to see them . " <p> " I feel the IOC has abdicated its duty of dare to young Russians into taking drugs . It just feels like we 're back in the days when I swam and the East Germans doped and got away with it and then many of the girls suffered consequences , too . It 's desperately sad . The IOC has passed up on an amazing chance to do the right thing today . " <p> Davies predicted , with others , that booing could not be heard in Rio when Russian athletes walk out to compete . Some media are reporting possible boycott measures from others nations , though nothing of that nature has been raised officially . <p> The IOC , according to early reports , has also failed to suspend the Russian Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state-run doping and cited by WADA and Prof. Richard McLaren in the McLaren Report as men who should be banned from sport . <p> In short , the IOC , just 12 days out from Rio 2016 , has passed the buck . In so doing , it has failed to treat the the McLaren report with the seriousness it demands ; it has , once more , failed to grasp the nettle when staring state-run doping in the face a quarter of a century after revelations of the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 <p> The decision today raises questions about the IOC 's status as a body that serves clean athletes and sport . The very Olympic Movement now hangs in the balance . Compromise that allows cheats to prosper and makes states that run doping programs welcome at the Olympics . <p> Russia , for all intents and purposes is back in , its national state role in cheating in sport , has been let off the hook by the IOC , an organisation that has now nailed its colours to the mast : money and power over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If " NBC wants night swimming finals no problem " sits on one level of poor governance and practice , then allowing Russia back in for Rio 2016 sends a clear message to cheats : if we catch you we 'll be tough on you the individual athlete regardless of whether your state is at fault : your state will survive and be welcomed . <p> As Mihir Bose , the BBC 's senior sports correspondent , put it : <p> " What is the IOC ? What is it for if it can not make this kind of decision and hands it on to others ? How can it claim that the Olympics are a great movement ? " <p> The background to today 's decision was the McLaren Report and all that led to it . <p> The McLaren Report key findings : <p> The Moscow Laboratory operated , with the intention of protecting doped Russian athletes from detection , within a " failsafe system " <p> The Sochi Laboratory for the Winter Olympic Games of 2014 operated a unique sample swapping methodology to enable doped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sport , the report states , directed , controlled and oversaw the manipulation of athlete 's analytical results or sample swapping , with the active participation and assistance of the secret services , the FSB ( the Russian federal security service ) , the CSP ( Centre of Sports Preparation in Russia ) , and both Moscow and Sochi IOC-accredited Laboratories <p> Yuri -- Russian Olympic Committee executive and deputy sports minister ordered the collection of clean urine samples that were then used as swaps for samples of urine that contained banned substances <p> Swimming is listed on a chart with nearly 20 ' disappearing positive tests ' ( see chart below and for explanation ) : 9th worst of all 30 sports listed with such cases , track and field and weightlifting by far the worst , with more than 100 cases each . <p> The Moscow IOC-accredited laboratory was asked to keep all 10,000 athlete samples in a letter of December 2014 , but by the time WADA investigators got there , 8,000 had been destroyed . <p> The " Duchess " cocktail of drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug at the helm of the German Democratic Republic 's State Pan 14:25 <p> The build-up to a damp squib this Sunday : <p> The IOC 's president , Thomas Bach , led a conference call of the IOC executive board , which met all morning to debate what to do bout Russia in the wake of the McLaren Report , two WADA Independent Commission Reports and the media reports , at the helm of them the ARD documentaries in Germany that highlighted the systematic nature of the allegations being made by whistleblowers and leading Russians in sport . <p> The IOC said it would " explore the legal options with regard to a collective ban of all Russian athletes for the Olympic Games 2016 versus the right to individual justice " . <p> Since then a series of international sports federations , anti-doping agencies and athletes have spoken out to demand a blanket ban of all sports at Rio , though some have said they are against punishing innocent athletes . <p> Russian state and sports officials ahave said that the potential ban is part of a Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split the Olympic Movement . Leaving Russia in could do the same , of course . <p> Several Russian TV networks were joined by news crews for broadcasters from around the world awaiting the IOC decision at the front door of temporary premises in Lausanne along the road from the Olympic Museum . <h> The IOC DECISION IN FULL <p> The IOC Executive Board ( EB ) has today further studied the question of the participation of Russian athletes in the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . In its deliberations , the IOC EB was guided by a fundamental rule of the Olympic Charter to protect clean athletes and the integrity of sport . <p> The study included the discussion of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) ' s Independent Person ( IP ) Report by Prof. Richard McLaren ; the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) on 21 July 2016 concerning the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) ; as well as the Olympic Charter and the World Anti-Doping Code . <p> Given the urgency of the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the athletes ' entry process already underway , the IOC EB had to take a preliminary decision with regard to the participation of Russian athletes in Rio de Janeiro . Prof. McLaren states in his report that it " fulfils partially the mandate of the Independent Person " . This is why the IOC supports his request to continue and finalise his work . On the other hand , this situation leads to an urgency for the IOC which does not allow it sufficient time for hearings for affected athletes , officials and organisations . <p> The IOC EB has given the Russian Olympic Committee ( ROC ) the opportunity to present the case of the Russian athletes and the ROC . This was done by Mr Alexander Zhukov , ROC President , at the beginning of the EB telephone conference , which he left immediately following his presentation . <p> During his presentation , Mr. Zhukov explained that the Russian Federation and the ROC guarantee full cooperation with all international organisations to she 'd light on the issue in every respect . He also guaranteed that the ROC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-doping system . In this context , he stressed that the ROC is committed to clean sport and would work towards guaranteeing clean sport in Russia . <p> He further stated that all Russian athletes selected for the Olympic Games Rio 2016 have been tested over the last six months by foreign anti-doping agencies . Samples were taken by foreign doping control officers and the samples analysed in foreign laboratories . Russian athletes who participated in different competitions in all sports have submitted more than 3,000 doping samples . The vast majority of the results were negative . <p> The IOC EB discussed the status of the ROC . In this respect , it took note of the fact that the IP Report made no findings against the ROC as an institution . <p> The IOC EB took note of a letter dated 23 July 2016 from the International Shooting Sport Federation ( ISSF ) . In this letter the ISSF confirms having received from WADA information about the three " disappearing samples " concerning shooting . The ISSF states that these three samples had been entered , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management System as positives , and all the result management procedures have already been followed . <p> On the basis of the Findings of the IP Report , all Russian athletes seeking entry to the Olympic Games Rio 2016 are considered to be affected by a system subverting and manipulating the anti-doping system . The IP Report indicates that , due to " the highly compressed timeline " , the IP has " only skimmed the surface of the extensive data available " . The IOC EB therefore came to the conclusion that this view can not be restricted only to athletes from the 20 Olympic summer sports mentioned in the IP Report . <p> Under these exceptional circumstances , Russian athletes in any of the 28 Olympic summer sports have to assume the consequences of what amounts to a collective responsibility in order to protect the credibility of the Olympic competitions , and the " presumption of innocence " can not be applied to them . On the other hand , according to the rules of natural justice , individual justice , to which every human being is entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected athlete must be given the opportunity to rebut the applicability of collective responsibility in his or her individual case . <p> After deliberating , the IOC EB decided : <p> 1 . The IOC will not accept any entry of any Russian athlete in the Olympic Games Rio 2016 unless such athlete can meet the conditions set out below . <p> 2 . Entry will be accepted by the IOC only if an athlete is able to provide evidence to the full satisfaction of his or her International Federation ( IF ) in relation to the following criteria : <p> * The IFs* , when establishing their pool of eligible Russian athletes , to apply the World Anti-Doping Code and other principles agreed by the Olympic Summit ( 21 June 2016 ) . <p> * The absence of a positive national anti-doping test can not be considered sufficient by the IFs . <p> * The IFs should carry out an individual analysis of each athlete 's anti-doping record , taking into account only reliable adequate international tests , and the specificities of the athlete 's sport and its rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> * The IFs to examine the information contained in the IP Report , and for such purpose seek from WADA the names of athletes and National Federations ( NFs ) implicated . Nobody implicated , be it an athlete , an official , or an NF , may be accepted for entry or accreditation for the Olympic Games . <p> * The IFs will also have to apply their respective rules in relation to the sanctioning of entire NFs . <p> 3 . The ROC is not allowed to enter any athlete for the Olympic Games Rio 2016 who has ever been sanctioned for doping , even if he or she has served the sanction . <p> 4 . The IOC will accept an entry by the ROC only if the athlete 's IF is satisfied that the evidence provided meets conditions 2 and 3 above and if it is upheld by an expert from the CAS list of arbitrators appointed by an ICAS Member , independent from any sports organisation involved in the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . <p> 5 . The entry of any Russian athlete ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional out-of-competition testing programme in coordination with the relevant IF and WADA . Any non-availability for this programme will lead to the immediate withdrawal of the accreditation by the IOC . <p> Beyond these decisions , the IOC EB reaffirmed the provisional measures already taken on 19 July 2016 . They remain in place until 31 December 2016 , and will be reviewed by the EB in December 2016 . <p> Additional sanctions and measures may be imposed by the IOC following the final report of the IP and due legal procedure by the IOC Disciplinary Commission established on 19 July 2016 under the chairmanship of Mr Guy Canivet ( Vice-Chair of the IOC Ethics Commission , former member of the French Constitutional Court and President of the French Cour de Cassation ) and the IOC EB . <p> The IOC EB reaffirms its serious concerns about the obvious deficiencies in the fight against doping . The IOC thus emphasises again its call to WADA to fully review their anti-doping system . The IOC will make its contribution to this review by proposing measures for clearer responsibilities , more transparency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The IAAF has already established its eligibility pool with regard to Russian athletes . <p> II . <p> The IOC EB further studied the request by the Russian track and field athlete , Mrs Iuliia Stepanova , to compete in the Olympic Games Rio 2016 as a " neutral athlete " . Since Mrs Stepanova declined to compete as a member of the ROC Team , the IOC EB had to consider the question of whether an exception to the rules of the Olympic Charter is possible and appropriate . Since this request has important ethical aspects , the IOC EB had asked the IOC Ethics Commission for its advice . The Ethics Commission has heard Mrs Stepanova and IAAF and ROC representatives . <p> Mrs Stepanova is basing her request on her role as " whistle-blower " with regard to the manipulation of the anti-doping system and corruption involving the WADA-accredited Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory , the All-Russia Athletic Federation ( ARAF ) and the IAAF . The Ethics Commission applauds the contribution of Mrs Stepanova to the fight against doping . It put this contribution into the perspective of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , in this doping system and the timing of her whistle-blowing , which came after the system did not protect her any longer following a positive test for which she was sanctioned for doping for the first time . <p> After a careful evaluation of the arguments , the Ethics Commission gave the following advice to the IOC EB : <p> " While it is true that Mrs Stepanova 's testimony and public statements have made a contribution to the protection and promotion of clean athletes , fair play and the integrity and authenticity of sport , the Rules of the Olympic Charter related to the organisation of the Olympic Games run counter to the recognition of the status of neutral athlete . Furthermore , the sanction to which she was subject and the circumstances in which she denounced the doping practices which she had used herself , do not satisfy the ethical requirements for an athlete to enter the Olympic Games . " <p> The IOC EB accepted the advice of the IOC Ethics Commission , also taking into consideration its above-mentioned decision not to allow any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . Therefore , the IOC will not enter Mrs Stepanova as a competitor in the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . <p> However , the IOC EB would like to express its appreciation for Mrs Stepanova 's contribution to the fight against doping and to the integrity of sport . Therefore the IOC invites Mrs Stepanova and her husband to the Olympic Games Rio 2016 . Furthermore , the IOC is ready to support Mrs Stepanova so that she can continue her sports career and potentially join a National Olympic Committee . <h> Comments <p> The IOC are spineless cowards and failing clean athletes will now forever be Bach 's legacy . At least Efimova should be out . <p> July 24 , 2016 <p> Craig , How about Daria Ustinova I know that there are two and am not sure if the going to Rio is the one who got busted . <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> Daria K. is the backstroker and she tested positive at 14 -- so yes , under the wording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 24 , 2016 <p> Thanks ! <p> How about team events that had athletes served doping suspension when they played for olympics qualifications Does this mean the whole team ca n't go or only individual athletes ? <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> good point down to FINA , I would imagine ... Russia women 's 4 ? 100 medley for e.g .... qualified on basis of Efimova ( Zueva can replace if it comes to that ) but Efimova a big gain on clock over next Russian <p> July 24 , 2016 <p> For example , Russia qualified for w4x100 free with and 4 ? 100 medley with Ustinova <p> anna July 24 , 2016 <p> Are you happy about Efimova ? What about USA athletes who have doping cases and will come to Rio ? I am not even saying about Olympic Charter , which is broken by this criteria .... <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> Anna I would be very happy to see Efimova , Gatlin and all others from any sports who tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . <p> July 24 , 2016 <p> Anna , I am with Craig . I 'd rather not see all athletes with past doping offenses to play at the Olympics . But this is about Russia punishment , and Bach has chosen the easiest way out . What would you suggest as punishment for Russia 's state sponsored doping system ? <p> Eugene Chc July 24 , 2016 <p> Craig , Efimova was punished for doping , but I 'm sure she did it not specially . Most part of the year she lives in USA and tested for doping USADA . Dopers did n't  use DHEA , this drug is easily caught and can even reduce the results . <p> For the systematic use of doping should be the most severe punishment , but for unintended drug use , should be given a second chance <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> Eugene , she was given a second chance and look what happened . I 'm not getting into semantics about the strengths of one banned substance over another -- athletes should not go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ... the WADA Code is clear , on the substance and the responsibility those are rules that apply to all and most manage to observe them . If sport wants clean sport , no excuses . And that should apply to the rest of them , too , Sun , Park and all . The lesser known and unknown athletes -- full wada penalty . the ' star ' -- softness and excuses . That has to end . <p> Lanfranco badia July 24 , 2016 <p> what beautiful Olympiads , the politics always commands , the relationship mclaren that founds him on inventions and the word of a man escaped in the usa and under pay of the cia I think , after vancouver the Russians have decided for the doping of state , then that donkeys are , they do n't even know , gives incontestable , Olympiads of sidney 2000 28 silver 2004 38 bronzes 2008 21 silver 28 bronzes london 23 silver 32 bronze , from the second place of sidney to in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also won thanks to the naturalization of VIKTOR AN The strongest in the short track usual ex chorea of the south 1 Bronze And Him ex Your Fellow citizen VIC WILD 2 Gold In the SNOWBOARD From Naturalization To speak of swimming the russia is behind doping or not doping , the efimova only athlete of value lives and he trains and him doping in USA Not In Russia To the World ones Of KAZAN In House A True Disaster , Male will Be Him 1 Silver 1 Bronze with this I do n't want to defend the russia , I do n't like that for the struggle to the doping the more weak is looked for to hide the of the strongest or USA UK AUS Khan The wada false structure antidoping you/he/she is commanded by American Canadians English and Australians , and you tell me that it is independent , in italia Mafia As CORRECT is said , WADA = Mafia OLYMPIADS OF RIO WILL BE NOT ONLY A FAILURE FOR SO MANY MOTIVES FOR THE DOPING I WO N'T SEE ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND OTHERS FOR THE FUN OF THE , HER YOUR ARROGANCE BRINGS MORE AND MORE ' PEOPLE TO HATE USA SORRY The DOPING Non Sarah ' Ever Defeated The Greatest Part Of the Athletes Of the TRACK AND FIELD , SWIMMING , CYCLING E Sport Of Strength Him DOPING , The Sport is Corrupt , they are 35 Years That I Follow him/it From Near MA MI Enough For That That I have Seen , MI is Sorry For Florence That I Knew To the World ones Of Rome Di 1987 And That L ' year Later Definite to Win To SEUL Di to Take A Strong Dose Of Hormone Of the Growth , you/he/she has Enjoyed Few Of Those Victoria Con it Defrauds , Ten Years Later it is ' Disappeared To Despite Everything I Cry her/it , Unfortunately <p> anna July 24 , 2016 <p> About Efimova Craig , and what happened next ?

It is not just her words , it was proved by scientists from different countries and by scientific department of WADA . Or you think that they are also corrupt ? <p> John Lohn July 24 , 2016 <p> Anna , even if you " ignore " the meldonium with Efimova , she still has her other doping violation . She does not belong in Rio . <p> John Lohn July 24 , 2016 <p> And just to be clear , any athlete with a doping violation should not be there -- regardless of country . <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> Lanfranco no intention to insult you but this is incomprehensible . please try to write your note in your own language and then put through google translate ; it may be easier to understand . Also , try to find balance and I would also recommend avoiding to excuse those who have done wrong simply because others might have done so too . <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> Anna you raise meldonium , not me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2013 and was suspended . That is on her record . I make no mention of her meldonium cases in recent articles if not to note what happened happened , and no denying it . The meldonium cases are a red herring . Yuliya now falls foul of the criteria laid down by the IOC and the Games would be much the better if not a single swimmer who ever tested positive was in the water . I could n't care less where they come from . That is my honestly held view . <p> Craig Lord July 24 , 2016 <p> Quite so -- John states the official view of this website . We want clean sport . We want to celebrate genuine talent , hard and smart work and all the amazing things that can flow from sport . <p> anna July 24 , 2016 <p> Craig , it was you who raised Meldonium ... " She was given a second chance and look what happened " in your comments .... This criteria brakes Olympic Charter and was many times challenged in CAS ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thing ..... <p> kevin roose July 25 , 2016 <p> So my understanding of all of this now is if a Russian has a doping violation they can not not go to the games ? If a Russian athlete does not have a doping violation they must proove they are clean thru WADA before they can compete ? It is not up to the Russian Federation ? <p> July 25 , 2016 <p> What a tragedy for all clean athletes who are now guaranteed to be competing against Russian athletes who have , over the past 4 years , been preparing with full access to performance enhancing drugs . <p> At least the previous guilty offenders and Athletics wo n't be there , but from a swimming perspective FINA , I am sure will , as usual , do the dishonorable thing and let the swimmers compete notwithstanding the 19 disappearing positives . <p> I wonder what their reallocation medal tally will be for Rio 2016 if all Russian sporting federations ( based on a OK from each International Federation ) are allowed to compete . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio participants would have the have Rio medals later withdrawn based on the final report . <p> To Lanfranco badia , and those trying to defend Russia , I would say look at 2 facts . One is the 11 Russian London medals reallocated and two is the the fact that Russia has suspended officials : <p> Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko told the R-Sport news agency he had suspended his anti-doping advisor Natalia as well as Irina Rodionova , deputy head of Russia 's state-funded Sports Preparation Center , and two other officials . <p> I am sure these are the token sacrificial lambs but the bottom line is that Putin and Vitaly Mutko are not denying the accuracy of the WADA McLaren report . <p> July 25 , 2016 <p> Even if the operations side of this Olympics was running like a Swiss watch , there 's still a chance of much chaos ahead . WADA is currently doing a third and fourth round of retesting of samples from 2008 and 2012 with the chance that results from those round known actually during the Games . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the first two rounds of retests indicate that there 's about a 95% chance there will be more ) you could have them pulled from this Olympics not only after they 've already competed in Rio , but also actually mid-event . Swimming is n't so bad in term of reallocation in that regard- just pull up the first alternate after heats or semifinals , but in sports where a DQ order comes down after an elimination bracket is underway , it 's a mess and a half to try to figure out how fairly clean up the mess afterwards . <p> July 25 , 2016 <p> Kevin , all Russian who has had doping violation regardless if they 've fully served their suspension will not be able to go to Rio . No mention about clean athletes . But ultimately it will depend on IF ( international sporting federation ) policy , like IAAF has banned the whole Russia track us to do so . <h> Share this Page 
 Daniel Gyurta at the eye of the storm , Marco Koch furthest from the camera photo : Patrick B. Kraemer <p> For most , the excitement of competition at the Olympic Games is enough to satisfy entertainment needs . Who does n't like a down-to-the-wire finish , where a hundredth of a second can be the difference between gold and silver ? Who does n't love a comeback ? Those are the kinds of performances that will be talked about for years , complete with ' what would have happened without shiny suits ' ? <p> For some individuals , though , there is a need for another kind of action the type in which money is wagered . With a financial consequence hovering , fans of the sport ( or savvy bettors ) receive that little bit of extra exhilaration . So , without further ado , here 's a look at some of the betting odds that have been established ahead of action in the pool at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . <p> Just to be clear : This piece is meant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storylines that have sadly dominated the sport in recent days . We 're not advocating massive gambling expenditures . Rather , the intent is to look at some of the interesting odds that have been set by the sports books . Enjoy . <h> Value Bets <h> Chase Kalisz : 400 Individual Medley ( 9-1 ) <p> Coming off a victory at the United States Olympic Trials , Chase Kalisz is the No. 3 choice on the board in his prime event , sitting at 9-1 . Those odds are actually well behind the betting favorites , Japan 's Kosuke Hagino ( 4-7 ) and his countryman Daiya Seto ( 5-2 ) , the two-time defending world champion . Hungarian David Verraszto is the fourth choice at 12-1 . <p> Chase Kalisz Photo : Mike Visuals , for USA Swimming <p> Getting Kalisz at nearly double figures is a solid option . Not only has he medaled at the past two World Championships , winning silver in 2013 and bronze in 2015 , his coach Bob Bowman indicated in Omaha that his charge has time to drop in Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earning a Team USA nod , but now can let loose in what will be his only event of the Games . <p> After sifting through the various numbers established by the oddsmakers , the most startling line was the 17-2 figure placed on Hungarian Daniel Gyurta , the reigning champion in the 200 breaststroke . In his primary event , Gyurta was made only the fourth betting selection , behind Josh Prenot ( 6-4 ) , Marco Koch ( 9-4 ) and Yasuhiro Koseki ( 6-1 ) . <p> Sure , Gyurta has n't put together any scintillating performances this season , which likely prompted a drop off the oddsmakers ' radar . Still , we 're talking about a guy who has routinely excelled in big moments , evident in his Olympic crown in London and three consecutive world titles from 2009-2013 . The value on Gyurta is too good to overlook . <p> Kevin Cordes , by Peter Bick <p> Staying in the 200 breaststroke , American Kevin Cordes was the silver medalist at last year 's World Championships and can be tapped at 11-1 , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sub-2:08 this year and while he was beaten by Prenot at the American Trials , he 's more than capable of contending for gold . <p> If you can find an oddsmaker to take an of Gyurta and Cordes , book it . <h> Mireia Belmonte : 400 Individual Medley ( 18-1 ) <p> The big favorite in the 400 medley is Katinka Hosszu ( 1-6 ) , but Spaniard Mireia Belmonte is certainly worth a run at 18-1 . Prepared to take on a hefty schedule in Rio , Belmonte will be her in her first event and enters the Games ranked third in the world . Belmonte is another athlete who excels in pressure situations , and if Hosszu falters , she 'll be among the leading challengers . At longer odds , Belmonte is good for a flyer . <h> Not Worth It <p> Barring a stunning development , no one other than Katie Ledecky is going to stand on the top step of the podium in the 400 freestyle and 800 freestyle . Still , the need to bet $50 to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness and injury are always possibilities in the unpredictable world of sports . It 's just not a wise wager , even if it seems to be a lock . <h> Sarah Sjostrom : 100 Butterfly ( 1-12 ) <p> Since the 2013 World Championships , Sarah Sjostrom has owned this event , and is expected to secure the first Olympic gold medal of her career on the second day of competition in Rio . Even with the United States bringing the formidable tandem of Dana Vollmer ( 14-1 ) and Kelsi Worrell ( 14-1 ) to the deck , Sjostrom has an unbeatable look , and getting back $1 on $12 is a waste . <h> The Longshot Gamble <p> Note : To qualify for longshot status , an athlete 's odds had to be 20-1 or greater . <h> Katinka Hosszu : 200 Butterfly ( 20-1 ) <p> Katinka Hosszu by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The favorite for gold in both medley events and a medal contender in both backstroke disciplines , Katinka Hosszu 's fifth individual event of the Games is the 200 butterfly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a few bucks . Longshot bets are never expected to come through , but if an individual can get a good price , take the shot . <h> Ryan Cochrane : 1500 Freestyle ( 20-1 ) <p> It is n't often a bettor can get a two-time Olympic medalist at lofty odds in his best event , but that 's the opportunity found in Canadian Ryan Cochrane at 20-1 for the 1500 freestyle . Cochrane has never won gold at the Olympic Games or World Championships , so he 's due , right ? Cochrane is n't the only strong choice at 20-1 in the 1500 free , as that is the figure found next to the name of American Connor Jaeger . <h> Kosuke Hagino : 200 Freestyle ( 25-1 ) <p> Kosuke Hagino Photo : Swimming Australia <p> These odds were much higher than anticipated . The value here is terrific , as Japan 's Kosuke Hagino should not be considered a longshot in the event , and that 's what 25-1 next to his name suggests . Yes , the event is stacked and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not out of the question . <h> Andrey Govorov : 50 Freestyle ( 33-1 ) <p> Ranked fifth in the world at 21.61 , Ukrainian Andrey Govorov has a lot of climbing to do to pull off an upset , but he 's been a consistent performer this season and catching lightning in a bottle is easier over a shorter distance . With odds of 33-1 , Govorov would pay off nicely , even for a bet on the smaller us to do so . <h> Dota 2 The 
 mountains together - Mel Marshall and her charge Adam Peaty on high at a different camp earlier in the year <p> Not so much third time lucky but third time prepared is how Mel Marshall sees her third Olympic Games as Rio looms large on the Belo Horizonte ( Beautiful horizon in Portuguese ) . <p> She 's been here before but not in the same place : Athens 2004 , Beijing 2008 as a swimmer racing in Great Britain colours in the midst of a career that delivered a silver at world l/c champs , silver and bronze at world s/c champs , two gold , two silver and a at European level and five silver , two bronze at the Commonwealth Games , all but one of those medals collected at Melbourne 2006 . <p> Basically , she knows what it feels like ; knows what its like to go into the Olympics ranked wold No 1 ( 200 free ) , make the final and come away with that as the prize . Life moves on , new challenge , new horizons . <p> For the bulk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a coach and much of that time she 's had a boy-to-man called Adam Peaty working under her guidance . More on that as the day gets closer but suffice it to say , the partnership has worked . And how . <p> Now starts the craft of the coach at an Olympic Games but Marshall is among those who brings to her job on deck the experience of an athlete who was still a teen when Sydney 2000 unfolded and Anthony Ervin was sharing dash gold with teammate Gary Hall Jr . <p> Now 34 , the Boston-born , City of Derby pioneering coach of the year ( first woman and first , then , to keep the crown ) for Britain in 2014 and 2015 , is , as nature would have it , still a year younger than Ervin as he races in Olympic waters once more -- and only a couple of seasons older than Michael Phelps , Laszlo Cseh and the thirtysomethings who will fly the flag of longevity in Rio for eight days from August 6 . <p> ; different jobs , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been coach , guide , friend , support , funder , firm hand , maturity , smart swim mind and more to Peaty since before the moment he stood in a field while contemplating what Craig Benson had swum at London 2012 and pondered the place he found himself in . As he put it after making the Olympic team this past spring : <p> " I was literally ready to go out and get drunk in a field or something stupid like that . It was like a ' what am I doing with my life ? kind of moment . From then , I watched all the Olympics and said to myself that I would make the next one . That was my defining moment , to stop messing about and get my head down . " <p> Feet on ground , heart in the heavens , Peaty , world 50 and 100m breaststroke champion and a pioneer over two laps with his 57.92 two-lap stunner of a global standard from last year , has been described by coach Marshall ( images , courtesy of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gladiator , a warrior " and in these stirring terms : <p> " He is like a soldier going over the top of the trench . You can shoot at him and shoot at him and you will not stop him moving forward . We talked in our group about if we were soldiers , what role would everybody take . We said he would be the guy who had forgotten his gun and just knocked everybody out along the way . He is fearless . " <p> When you mention that he 's shown courage , what do you mean , I ask Marshall . <p> " If I said to Adam Peaty ' you need breaststroke every single day from now until Rio and it would guarantee you would swim fast ' , he would n't question it . He says ' yes ' to everything ; he comes in with a positive attitude every day ; if I say ' be there 10 minutes early ' , he 's there 20 minutes early ; if I say ' we 're going again ' , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If he is hanging on the side exhausted he would just courageously go again . " <p> They 're beyond that now as far as training is concerned . Nine days out from the gun going off and the work was done a long while back ; tractor tyres chucked and rolled , race-pace sets that sent pain coursing through nerve to muscle , mind and more . Now starts the craft of the coach at a Games . Says Marshall , through British Swimming in Belo Horizonte : " It 's a very different approach coming into an Olympic Games as a coach . I think the biggest change is an athlete goes to the Olympics looking to get as much as they possibly can out the Games they train relentlessly to achieve their outcome and deserve everything that comes their way . In contrast , the role of the coach is about containing everything . <p> " As an athlete you want to be at your physical and mental best and to channel all of your energy and excitement towards that performance whereas for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains calm and contained while absorbing any anxieties if they exist . " <p> Marshall is wedded to the romance of sport but applies logic and process to her mission : <p> " The way I view sport is a part of me that I do not want to lose but it 's all about balance and I try to ensure this in everything I do . When you 're part of the team you have to be someone different at certain times to certain people and that 's an important role . As an athlete I was always fully focused but never saw it as an individual sport . I was very team aware and that 's something that has helped me a lot with my role as a coach . " <p> Team concepts were a big part of Bill Sweetenham 's philosophy as Marshall grew up in the sport and remain that under the current leadership of Bill Furniss and a team of coaches , away and home , that had steered the British shoal to a place of confidence without cockiness this past Olympic cycle since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it might have been but was not the end-of-world disaster that made some rounds . <p> Marshall believes Great Britain to be a nation ready to step up in the prevailing conditions of fierce world competition wholly remote from a time when her nation quite ' easily ' made top three on the overall medals table as women made their Olympic debut at Stockholm 1912 and just 17 countries took part , the USA finishing behind Germany , Austria and Britain on the medals . <p> A pioneer in her own right 104 years on , Marshall sees Britain 's place as solid heading into the 31st Games in Brazil next week : <p> " The camp here in Belo has been very relaxed . It 's been fun but focused and you can tell the athletes are at a good point . You look around the pool deck in training and you get a real sense that everyone is ready . The facility at UFMG is one of the best we 've ever used and the BOA , UK Sport and the University have done an excellent job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and location to have the camp and fine tune over the final days us to do so . <p> The mother , 
 been using Meldonium without telling his coach in the United States for seven years before he tested positive in June for what became a banned substance on January 1 this year . <p> The news came as CAS said in a statement on Saturday : " The ad hoc division of the Court of Arbitration for Sport at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games has registered its first procedures . The Russian swimmers Vladimir Morozov and Nikita Lobintsev have each filed a request for arbitration against the International Olympic Committee and the International Swimming Federation ( FINA ) . " <p> It said the pair had asked CAS to rule as " invalid and unenforceable " the key section of the IOC executive board 's ruling that specified nobody implicated in the McLaren report should be accepted for entry into the Olympics . <p> The statement added : " The swimmers also request that the decision of the FINA bureau of 25 July 2016 , declaring both of them ineligible for the Olympic Games in Rio , be set aside . <p> " Furthermore , they request that the IOC validates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio . " <p> Meanwhile , there is no doping penalty for Lobintsev , the status of meldonium on ice owing , in part , to the vast number of Russian athletes who made the substance a regular part of their diet for so long . The tennis player Maria Sharapova is currently serving a two-year suspension , her case to be heard at the Court of Arbitration for Sport in September a few weeks after the hearing the world is also watching : Blatter Vs FIFA , August 25 . <p> The details of why Lobintsev , Vladimir Morozov and Daria K. are barred by the IOC and FINA from Rio , CAS case pending for Morozov that may decide the fate of the others , has not yet been revealed . <p> Yuliya , Natalia , Anastasia and Mikhail are all barred because they have previously tested positive for banned substances . The IOC stipulated that , in view of the serious nature of the evidence of Russian systematic doping with state involvement noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> That temporary rule is to be put to the test by Efimova at the offshore Court of Arbitration for Sport established for the Games in Rio . The breaststroke specialist has already been spotted in Rio , one coach believing that she had an accreditation round her neck . That is unconfirmed and would seem unlikely given that her current status is ' barred from the Olympic Games ' . <p> Russia 's sports minister , Vitaly Mutko , a man under a cloud of suspicion in the WADA McLaren Report , said that " 29 disciplines out of 34 , with 266 people , " will represent Russia in Rio as things stand . Mysteriously , he indicated that 9 swimmers had not been cleared by : <p> " In swimming , we announced a team of 35 people , now 26 have passed the selection process . " The final decision on rest , including the seven barred , will be made Saturday , he added . <p> Mutko continues to fight tooth and nail for the problems of Russian doping to be a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IWF ) imposed a blanket ban on Russians , Mutko all bit said ' CAS here we come ; we will support our athletes even though the evidence is as dark as a storm warning ' <p> The US Anti-Doping Agency , the testing authority responsive for the meldonium catches of Efimova , Lobintsev and Grigory Tarasevich , all US-based and part of a large group of Russians that appear to have been taking meldonium like others take vitamin C , announced today that : <p> the 27-year-old Lobintsev had been using meldonium for the past seven years <p> the drug , unapproved for sale in the U.S. , was prescribed by Russia team doctors , who told him it would help strengthen his heart . <p> During those seven years ( back to 2008 ) in which he took a substance unavailable and unapproved in large parts of the world , Lobintsev has won : <p> Olympic silver and bronze medals <p> 3 world-title silvers and a bronze , long-course <p> 1 , gold , 2 silvers , 2 bronzes , world s/c titles <p> 2 gold , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , 2 silvers , 1 bronze , Euro s/c titles <p> 2 gold , 2 silvers , Universiade <p> It is to that latter competition , a home Universiade , that focus has turned in relation to ' disappeared ' tests. , though WADA has not published the details of cases such as those of Morozov and Lobintsev that are believed to have been sent by those at FINA who decided to impose a Rio ban . <p> " The disturbing pattern of use associated with this performance-enhancing drug appears to be one more example of growing practice in sport in which coaches ask for , physicians prescribe , and athletes use pharmaceuticals not for their primary purpose of health and wellness but to enhance athletic performance . " <p> Russian swimming issued a round-robin to all its swimmers last autumn to advice them to stop taking meldonium in view of the impending January 1 , 2016 ban . <p> Lobintsev has been coached by Dave Salo at Trojan , the University of Southern California Club that has now barred foreign swimmers from its program until further clarity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing positive for DHEA , which was listed on the label of the product she bought and consumed without reference to Salo . The coach let her back in and now has discovered that his Russian swimmers , Efimova and Lobintsev having tested positive for , were taking substance prescribed by a Russian team doctor without having informed the Trojan coach and the team they were working with . <p> For all the investigative forces out there in the world , there have been no concrete answers to some very simple questions , such as : <p> when the Russian doctors prescribed the meldonium , did he say ' do n't tell Salo and the Americans ' ; did he say ' do tell your coach ' ; or did he say nothing and the swimmer said nothing , too ? <p> did Salo and the Trojan team specifically ask its overseas members to register any supplements they were taking or were such things left to the individual whims of the swimmers and the say of those prescribing substances from outside the University of Souther California set up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had suspended Russians Lobintsev and Vladimir Morozov from team membership . Lobintsev , who told USADA he stopped using the drug 10 months ago : he tested positive for meldonium on June 16 in an out-of-competition test . <p> " Based on the latest guidance offered by WADA on June 30 , 2016 , for cases involving meldonium , Lobintsev will not face a period of ineligibility or loss of results , " the USADA statement said . <p> WADA researchers are conducting tests to determine how long the substance remains in the human body after consumption . The status os the banned substance is , in effect , on hold , until that research has been concluded and a decision taken by WADA . <p> USADA said that meldonium was easily accessible to Russia athletes because it was available over the counter in Russian pharmacies . Lobintsev told the agency that he used it after the world championships in August last year and again the following month . <p> * -- swimmer tested positive for banned substance us to do so . <h> Snapshot : Theo 
 our month-long countdown to racing in Rio with a look at some of the most significant swims of Olympic season so far on the clock , we turn our attention to consistency ; the rate at which contenders stack up quality efforts in the top 10 , top 20 and top 25 performances . <p> Today we continue our look at the women 's events with breaststroke and the leading contenders among those who have shown they have what it takes to step on to the ultimate podium . <p> Racing gets underway in Rio on August 6 . <h> Women 's Breaststroke <p> In May at European titles , racing in the same London lane 4 in which she claimed Olympic gold in 2012 , Ruta Meilutyte took 1min 06.17 to claim the one crown that was missing from her impressive treasury over 100m breaststroke . <p> The European title was delivered by the Plymouth Lithuanian off a 30.17 split a little over six months after she fractured an elbow on the way to two lots of surgery , rehabilitation and recovery of form back on the trail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power are all looking good . The tight timeline to regain fitness showed at the end of battle in as season in which Meilutyte has had no time to rest , peak performance left to the one moment that she 's worked for beyond all others . <p> Whatever pans out in Rio , Meilutyte will defend her crown as a teenager yet , as contender and as the owner of something that can not be taken away : gold as the youngest ever winner in the 100m at an Olympic Games . <p> Asked after the London race whether she had had a tough 12 months , Meilutyte , coached by Jon Rudd , said : <p> " I 've had a lot of challenges and lots of ups and downs . But you have to try and stay positive , take what you can from the experiences , overcome those challenges and learn something new . I have learned a lot in the last couple of years and I definitely could not have done it without my coach 's support , having my whole support system there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a debut Games , Meilutyte has won at least one of every title open to her on breaststroke ( including 50 and/or 100m ) , Olympic , Olympic Youth , World , Senior and Junior , European , Senior and Junior , national long- and short-course . <p> Ruta Meilutyte by PBK <p> The European long-course crown had been missing until May because of the timing of events : after claiming the World 50 and 100m titles and four golds at 2013 World Junior Championships in 2013 , Meilutyte opted for a last season as a junior in 2014 so that she could represent her country at the Olympic Youth Games in Nanjing , China . Victory in the bag over 50 and 100m , she dashed back to Europe in time for the 50m at the continental showcase in Berlin but was too late to race in the 100m . <p> Well known the story of Kazan 2015 , the return of Yuliya from a steroid suspension and the impact that had on those around her , Meilutyte among those most knocked . The breaststroke world of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the International Olympic Committee and its three-string panel to know whether Efimova will be let back in once again . <p> Meanwhile , Meilutyte 's own journey continues . Olympic season 2012 , Olympic season 2016 : chalk and cheese . Then 15 and on an adventure , now in her 19th year and a defending champion with a fractured elbow , two operations , rehabilitation , a new start beyond the anger of having to race a rival back from a lenient doping ban and a wholly different challenge in tow . <p> " If anyone can rise to it , Ruta can , " says coach Jon Rudd . fell off her bike back in September , went under the knife shortly afterwards and was back in the water a couple of weeks later . A top Lithuanian surgeon removed the metal plate in the healed fracture a few days before Christmas and Rudd 's pupil , was back in the water at Plymouth Leander within weeks . <p> got beyond anger over Efimova a while back , says Rudd , the list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this year : <p> it wo n't be home in Plymouth for the staging camp and into London this time ; it 'll be a warm-weather camp far from home and " that 's not going to be easy for anyone ... some nations are still planning where they 'll be for staging -- and there are a lot of issues to consider " <p> she goes into 2012 a little girl looking to swim at the Olympics , no more ; now there are huge expectations on her shoulders at home in Lithuania , where many think its a given that she 'll win every time she races . Well , they know from Kazan that is n't the case <p> the media was reactionary last time ; this time the story is already there and its a case of let 's get the story before the olympics <p> the midday heats , night- 1am finals is another factor ( courtesy of NBC 's Olympic colonialism ) . " I do n't know how that 's going to be ... on staging camp we 'll be training at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having breakfast late morning . I do n't know if it will be a fast Olympics because of that ; we 'll see . Whatever it is , we 'll be making the best of it . " <p> social media : in 2012 , it was not an issue , this time the swimmer is a 19-year-old steeped , like her peers , in social media . Rudd lists the numerous platforms and says : " She 's not a kid now , so she will have all of that on . She 's in that westernised world . We have to talk about how that is managed . " <p> Disneyland is never the same the second time and Disneyland Paris and Disneyland Florida are not the same either <p> Meilutyte will not be the only candidate for gold in the 100m breaststroke in Rio but she will be the only candidate who can keep the crown . If she does it she will be the first in history to have done so . <p> Anticipating an victory at CAS , Associated Press has tipped Efimova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Meilutyte and Lilly King , USA , on the 100m podium ; Rie Kaneto , JPN and Rikke Pedersen , DEN , on the 200m podium ) . For that to happen would be astonishing given the disruption to Efimova 's preparation , Trojan having asked her to leave the deck after FINA imposed a temporary ban in light of what turned out to be five positive tests for meldonium this year . If AP turns out to be right , we would be looking at two of the most unpopular wins in swimming history , along with any victories for those who tested positive in the past . <p> Efimova 's departure from Trojan and the related University of South California 's swim program was followed by a blanket bar on all foreign swimmers until further notice and clarity on the doping issue . Rule sin the United States have changed so that coaches may no longer coach swimmers during suspension periods . <p> Down Under , Swimming Australia was the first to change its rules in direct response tio the downfall of a FINA star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any funded centre after he tested positive in 2014 . Like so many of the Meldonium cases , Sun had been taking a heart boosted long-term , for several years until the substance in question made the banned substances list and no-one in CHina noticed until it was too late . Not good enough -- and neither has the response been of those in charge of anti-doping says a wider swimming world that would rather see those who have foul forced to sacrifice the one thing that matters most to them : the Olympic Games . <p> The ' guardians of sport , IOC , WADA and all downwards have failed the ' zero-tolerance ' test , the cost a tainted Games before they 're begun , the autonomy of sport on life support and never to be the same again . <h> 100m breaststroke <p> Only three women have raced inside 1:06 so far this year , Lilly King ( USA ) , Olympic champion and world record holder Ruta Meilutyte ( LTU ) in the Rio race Yuliya ( RUS ) barred , at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINA , CAS case pending to decide whether a positive doping test will count her in or out . <p> Efimova has lodged her appeal to CAS after being barred from Rio by the IOC and FINA on the basis that she has previously served a doping suspension . that , we say no more : the story is known and her events would be a happier place without her presence . <p> Lily King , courtesy of Hoosiers , Indiana University <p> King is the same age as Meilutyte . In the past year she has stepped up from a best of 1:06.43 to the 1:05.20 she clocked for gold at the USA Olympic trials . Statement made , gauntlet thrown , King enters the Rio fray as favourite for the crown alongside Meilutyte . Why alongside a teenager who holds the world record at 1:04.35 ? <p> Mainly because we can not yet know what Meilutyte 's best form is this year . She has a 1:05.82 on the books from a quiet moment in February that marked her comeback from rehabilitation from a fractured elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , she has not for peak form , her season too short for coach Jon Rudd to step away from the work to get Meilutyte back to the speedster with the back-end stamina we know her to be . <p> Along the road to recovery , Meilutyte claimed the European crown in 1:06.17 , her fourth best of the year . All-time , she has the best three ever , of 1:05.5 or better , from 2013 , and seven entries in the 11th to 20th ranked best performances in history , for 10/20 . King matched Meilutyte 's career fourth-best at trials . To get nigh-on a second more out of progress would be astonishing but whoever can crack 1:05 will represnet a strong tlt at the title . <p> The crown went to in 1:05.47 in 2012 , the silver medallist Rebecca Soni ( USA ) having raced three sub 1:05s in shiny and one in textile on the way to London 2012 . As ever , down to the race . <p> Consistency of speed this season is with Meilutyte : , with four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's trials efforts grant her twi efforts in the top 5 , while US teammate Katie Meili , with a on the books from last year , is the first of the 1:06s , followed by Australia 's Georgia Bohl , on 1:06.12 and , among those in Rio , China 's Shi Jinglin . And that may well be where contention stops , a 1:05 required for the podium . <p> The 1:06.34 British record of Siobhan-Marie O'Connor is a speed geared at the medley not breaststroke , the mid 1:06s the best of Martina Carraro ( ITA ) and Hilde Luthersdottir ( ISL ) , with Jamaica 's Alia Atkinson the who has known . <p> The 2013 season , when Meilutyte added the world title to her Olympic crown and set the world record at 1:04.35 in semis before a 1:04.42 in the final ( 1:04.52 in heats ) , stands out as a breakthrough years for speed among women , the 200m world record belonging to Rikke Pedersen ( DEN ) also dating back to then . <p> Efimova claimed the 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100m with a lifetime best of 1:05.02 , 10th fastest performance in history . And then DHEA showed up in her system and the game was up , her image altered for all-time , the asterisk forever in tow . <h> 200m breaststroke <p> Rikke Pedersen by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Rebecca Soni ( USA ) retired after London 2012 -- and so the crown will pass . At 2:19.65 , the only sub-2:20 of the year , Rie Kaneto , 28 , topes the speed scale this year , her breaksthrough from a 2:21.90 last seaosn backed by the next twop best efforts on the book this Olympic year , and . The question is whether she can now get back down to 2:19 when the pressure is at its greatest . Efimova has a 2:21.41 on the chart , while the 2:21 club this year also included Australia 's Taylor McKeown and world-record holder at 2:19.11 , Rikke Pedersen , at 2:21.69 in the final . <p> Chloe Tutton ( GBR ) , Jessica Vall ( ESP ) , Hilde Luthersdottir complete the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion Kanako Watanabe , at 2:23.02 after last year is there to remind all that it will come down to the race not the speed scale come the hour in Rio . <p> On 2:23s , Molly Renshaw ( GBR ) and Kierra Smith ( CAN ) are in the hunt for places in the final , while a 2:23.94 from Viktoriya Gunes ( TUR ) in semis at European titles masked the potential in the fastest time in the world last year , 2:19.64 for the World Junior champion . The door to the club is closed by Georgia Bohl . <p> All-time in textile , Pedersen is queen of consistency , with 5/10 and 7/15 of the best performances ever . Since that breaststroke bonanza of 2013 , rare have the been . Whoever can press the pace down that way in Rio is in with a serious shot at the crown . <h> Comments <p> David Brooks August 1 , 2016 <p> Craig , <p> Looking at the official start lists I see that Marie O'Connor is not entered for the 100 breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , you 'd have to think she has 1:05 in her , and that would be right in the medal mix , especially without Efimova . Plus , it would give her a run out before her main event . The Brits seem to be giving up a few medal chances , if you ask me . Not switching Benson for Murdoch in the 200 breast sacrifices a potential medal , even possible gold . Not taking a dedicated female flier for the relay puts any medal chance in jeopardy given that SOC is close to a second quicker than the next best over breaststroke but barely faster , if at all than Thomas or Kelly over Fly . Then there 's the lack of Fly cover for the men 's medley relay where they will rely on the already busy Guy . Finally , and this is a stretch , but could they not have pushed for a place for the women 's 4 ? 100 freestyle ? They would n't trouble the US , Aus or the Dutch , but if one of those slips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly wide open . The emergence of Freya Anderson as low 54 relay option puts them in realistic reach of a 3:35 ( SOC 53.7 , Anderson 54.2 , Jess Jackson 54.7 , Halsall 52.7 ) that would push Sweden for 4th . But why would GB need to us to do so . <h> A Tale of 
 our month-long countdown to racing in Rio with a look at some of the most significant swims of Olympic season so far on the clock , we turn our attention to consistency ; the rate at which contenders stack up quality efforts in the top 10 , top 20 and top 25 performances . <p> Today we conclude our look at the men 's and women 's events with women 's medley and the leading contenders among those who have shown they have what it takes to step on to the ultimate podium . <p> Racing gets underway in Rio on August 6 . <h> Women 's Medley <p> Jaws dropped when China 's Ye Shiwen ( right ) , then a 16-year-old schoolgirl , raced nto uncharted waters in textile for Olympic gold in 2:07.57 . A year earlier Ye had the textile standard at 2:08.90 the 2:06.15 at which Ariana Kukors ( USA ) claimed the world record and title in full shiny suit in 2009 was considered a of a standard that would not be surpassed for many a long season after the return to textile-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the start of 2015 , Katinka Hosszu ( HUN ) looked an unlikely candidate when it came down to the chance of racing inside the pace of Kukors and , her all-time best having been axed down to 2:08.11 in 2014 , shy of her own shiny suit best of 2:07.46 from 2009 and a season that placed the best women in the world on a fast-forward of at least 2sec and more often than not 3sec and more taking into consideration improvements among the 20 in the world in 2008 and 2009 . <p> Then , in 2015 at world titles , Hosszu , at 26 , was born again , her solid Olympic-gold contender status hit home with a pile-driver of a 2:06.12 world record after the other two all-time top three swims , her 's and everyone else 's , of 2:06.84 in semis and 2:07.30 in heats . <p> The 2:06.12 belongs to the realm of " off-the-chart " . That is to say , in uncharted waters that you would not expect any to be swimming in for at least a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no coaching explanations that would add up to a response of " ah , yes , we see , how silly of us not to see that before " from a community of rivals and their mentors looking on and scratching their heads . <p> Hosszu 's trajectory is like no other in the sport beyond a tale that bares no comparison : Michelle Smith de . As the Hungarian federation pointed out in Hosszu 's defence at a time when she sued Swimming World for an article posing questions about what some suggest might explain her progress , she has not returned a positive among the many anti-doping tests she has been called on to submit to . <p> Even so , there can be no question that the deck at major events is full of folk asking ' how ' ? So far , any answers -- singular dedication and commitment , hard work , eternal racing , have failed to change the shape of that question mark . The physical change in Hosszu is explained by the swimmer and her husband in the supplements endorsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeps the questions from coming . <p> Go back four years and stretch back to 2007 and you will find the name Hosszu in the mix with a couple of efforts each season . What a difference an Olympic cycle has made for this . <p> Katinka Hosszu celebrates one of her world titles last August by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Trawl as you might through the history of rankings and it is impossible to find a turned around profile of a swimmer 24 years or older remotely close to that picture . Indeed , among swimmers much younger , you are looking at the likes of Michael Phelps , Katie Ledecky , Ian Thorpe , Grant Hackett , Krisztina Egerszegi and folk of that ilk if you want to find similar curves and patterns of dominance . <p> In short , for whatever reason , Hosszu arrives in Rio not only transformed beyond recognition from the swimmer we saw four years ago but as one of the biggest favourites for gold in the pool , the 200m as sure-fire as any predicted win could be , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as solid as any swimmer could ever hope for . <p> Win the first one and Hosszu will be on a roll . Miss it and the story could be very different . <h> 200m medley <p> Siobhan-Marie O'Connor by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Three 2:07s this year , two of those in quiet moments , leave Hosszu in waters uncharted by all others barring London 2012 controversy Ye Shiwen , the Chinese schoolgirl who did the double and then all but disappeared as challenger , her 200m well over 2:10 this season , her 400m so far off the chart of her past self as to make her seasonal chart of speed look like Michelle Smith in reverse . <p> Hosszu also has four 2:08s on her season scorecard , the 2:09.03 in which an unrested Siobhan-Marie O'Connor ( GBR ) took silver behind the Hungarian at Europeans in May the closest to the holder whose 2:06.12 world-title win entered the book of swims last summer in Kazan . <p> If Hosszu has been under 2:10 thrice more this season , O'Connor twice more , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Miho Teramura ( JPN ) and Alicia Coutts ( AUS ) , the London 2012 silver medallist , are next in line in the 2:09 zone . Andreeva , 24 , is the big improver on scale , the Russian having moved up from 2:12.31 in 2015 to 2:09.56 this year . Coutts , O'Connor , Dirado have all been 2:08s , as has Kanako Watanabe but the worlds medallist of 2015 finished third at Japanese . <p> The all-time form beyond Hosszu new dominace gives O'Connor and Coutts an edge on the rest . Here 's a glance at how dominant Hosszu has become in world as well as European waters the European Championships podium , May 2012 : <p> 27.75 ; 59.56 ( 31.81 ) 1:36.87 ( 37.31 ) 2:07.30 ( 30.43 ) CR Hosszu <p> 27.86 ; 1:00.89 ( 33.03 ) 1:38.03 ( 37.14 ) 2:09.03 ( 31.00 ) O'Connor <p> 29.17 ; 1:02.98 ( 33.81 ) 1:40.72 ( 37.74 ) 2:11.84 ( 31.12 ) Miley <p> You have to go back to 2010 when Hosszu was 21 to find the 2:10.09 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born-again career began in 2013 beyond a 2:10.68 in the Olympic rounds and the 2:14.19 for last place in the final for a swimmer who could not cope with the pace and knowing that to be the case , all but gave up . <p> Hosszu does not give up these days . Since 2013 and the advent of Shane Tusup as her coach and husband-to-be , Hosszu has taken a flame-thrower to the all-time medley rankings . <p> Take the 200m : at the start of 2013 , Hosszu 's highest entry on the all-time performances list was 57th best with that 2:10.68 from London 2012 semis . <p> In the past three years , between the ages of 24 and 27 , Hosszu has built the following edifice : <p> : 7 out of 10 and 19/50 best ever . <p> : 9/10 and 16/20 best ever . <h> 400m medley <p> Mireia Belmonte by PBK <p> Beyond the dominance of Hosszu comes Hanah Miley ( GBR ) , right , Mireia Belmonte ( ESP ) , Elizabeth Beisel ( USA ) , the 2011 world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past her at the speed of Ryan Lochte , the American winner of the men 's race who apparently slowed down on on his way to the best textile time ever swum by a man for Olympic gold in , according to defenders of a undeniable controversy . Also in 4:33 is Maya Dirado ( USA ) , while 4:34 finds Aimee Willmott ( GBR ) and the Shimizu ( JPN ) , Blair Evans ( AUS ) and Miho Takahashi ( JPN ) , all their best efforts not up to Hosszu in heats on a slow day . <p> The 4:33 crew are all , on their day , capable of rattling the favourite and the 4:30 zone . The pace of the race from go will be significant , to the podium and to the winning time . <p> The 200m butterfly remains the only event on the World Championship programme , all strokes , all distances , in which Hosszu 's career high belongs to a time before 2013 . <p> The latest best , on a quiet moment on Golden Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 400m medley for the first time : 4:29.89 , a European record inside the time in which she claimed the 2009 world title in shiny suit and inside the efforts that granted her the 2013 and 2015 world crowns and the 2014 European title . In textile , she is the second woman ever to crack 4:30 . <p> The splits showed where progress has been made compared to her historic best splits a touch on ' fly , a chunk of more than a second on freestyle , with more left in the tank at the end on the back of better pacing than was the case in some of the break-neck swims she has carved out in the past three seasons . <p> The exhaustion at the end of titles won in Berlin in 2014 and Kazan in 2015 are reflected in freestyle finishes of 1:04 , 2.5sec slower than she swam the last 100m today . The difference on backstroke : a little over 2sec . <p> Fourth ever inside 4:30 and second ever in textile , the time lags the world record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London 2012 and completed with the aberration of a 58.6 closing 100m , and the poly suited 4:29.45 effort of Stephanie Rice , of Australia , and matches Kirsty Coventry , of Zimbabwe , the latter pair the gold and silver medallists at Beijing 2008 . <p> Hosszu 's latest progress on the clock makes her swim the only standout in that speed zone in a 400IM away from major championship waters . Not only that : it hammers another nail into the sign on the wall that reads " a career of two halves " what went before late 2012 us to do so . <h> Rower Thomas forced 
 States Trials Behind , Missy Franklin Anxious To Let It Rip In Rio <p> The original game plan drawn up by Missy Franklin and her longtime coach , Todd Schmitz , envisioned a program for this summer 's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro identical to what Franklin handled four years ago in London . The plan called for a quartet of individual events , along with duty on each of the United States ' three relays . <p> Blueprints do n't always produce expected outcomes , however , and when Franklin left the United States Olympic Trials in Omaha , she faced a lighter schedule for her second Olympiad . Not in peak form as the American squad for Rio was assembled , Franklin used guts and grit to earn spots on the Team USA roster in the 200 freestyle and 200 backstroke , and as a member of the 800 freestyle relay . <p> Because Franklin did not replicate her Olympic- and world-title form at Trials , she 's found herself less in the spotlight than previous competitions . A look at some tout sheets going into the Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either of her individual events , including the 200 backstroke , where she is the reigning Olympic champion . <p> At her press conference on Wednesday , Franklin took time to address what unfolded at Trials . <p> " I 've felt for the past several months that I am in the best shape I have ever been in , " Franklin said . " I think Trials was just a very different experience for me , and I think I was n't really prepared for the emotional aspect of it ... Coming in this year , I think I felt the pressure a lot more than I ever have before . I 've normally been able to handle that really well , and that was something that I really struggled with at Trials . " <p> Franklin 's blunt assessment of her situation in Omaha was refreshing in a way , an example of an athlete who did n't make an excuse when something did n't go her way . Instead , Franklin openly discussed what went wrong , logged the experience for future reference and moved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully embracing , the knowledge that second chances do n't always come along not lost on the American star . <p> Especially at a competition as deep and cutthroat as the United States Trials , subpar performances are typically damning . For Franklin , she still found a way to finish second in the 200 freestyle and 200 backstroke to cement her place in Rio . What she does in those races is uncertain , although she should climb the blocks void of pressure . <p> Unlike the Games of London , in which Franklin was the favorite for gold in both backstrokes and tabbed as the face of the American women , Rio brings a different scenario . A medal in either of her individual events would be seen in some circles as a surprise , while Katie Ledecky and her distance mastery have taken center stage . <p> With the 200 free among the deepest events on the women 's slate , a medal for Franklin seems like a reach . After all , Ledecky is the favorite , with the likes of Sweden 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McKeon in the battle . Yet , the 200 backstroke is the event in which Franklin can not be counted out . <p> Cast a view at the SwimVortex World Rankings and Franklin does n't show up until ninth in the event in which she owns the world record . Getting past the Aussie duo of Emily Seebohm and Belinda Hocking figures to be a difficult task , along with beating Hungarian Katinka Hosszu to the wall . More , Franklin was beaten at Trials by Maya DiRado , who won three events in Omaha and is waving goodbye to the sport after Rio . <p> So , why should Franklin be giving the benefit of the doubt ? For one , when she 's on her game in the event , she 's created a chasm between herself and the rest of the world . Obviously , it 's a big " if " when it comes to Franklin being as good as she 's been in the past , but she does possess the Olympic crown , two world championships and was the silver medalist at the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shown the ability to gut out a performance , and that characteristic would serve her well in Rio . <p> Look , the Olympics are always full of surprises . <p> " Being at the Olympic Games is so different from Trials , " Franklin said . " We 've made it on the team and that 's the hardest thing to do . Now that we 're a part of this legacy , we need to do all we can to continue the legacy for USA Swimming . I think the last few weeks have been a relief for everyone on the team , a chance to focus on the training on the pool and on becoming a team ... I think I 've hammered down on some of the stuff I needed to work on , and I feel extremely confident that I can be better than I us to do so . <p> Dame Lowell Goddard 
 Alexander Popov , hero to so many in swimming , just messed up his turn . It is not that Popov spoke out for doping nor anything like that but the words of the quadruple Olympic swimming champion of 1992 and 1996 and a smart man at that , showed how blinding patriotism and the bind of politics can be when it comes to facing up to the sorrowful history of his sport . <p> Here 's what he told reporters in Rio today as the International Olympic Committee faced tough media questions over the doping crisis topped by what an official World Anti-Doping Agency Report described " beyond reasonable doubt " as state involvement in cheating and corruption : <p> " We admitted not everything is in order maybe in Russian sport , but this is our internal problem . And we really do n't like when somebody else sticks their nose into our business . " <p> We admitted ... maybe ? Sorry , Alex , not good enough . The evidence for some of it is just that and allegations are searingly serious and overwhelming ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still there is a ' maybe ' attached to your words ; but it is the last part of that sentence that causes most concern : <p> " ... when somebody else sticks their nose into our business . " <p> Alex , systematic doping , any doping , cheating , corruption and the things uncovered by media , investigators and laid out in three WADA reports , demand scrutiny and independent scrutiny at that . <p> This is not about how Russia sets its taxes , what laws it attaches to sexuality and education , how its communities and societies function , what speed limits are set for traffic in Moscow and so forth . <p> What we 're talking about , Alex , is a deputy sports minister agreeing that clean urine should be collected and stored and that top-ranked anti-doping officials in your country colluded to swap that clean urine for filthy samples through a hole in the wall at the Winter Olympics . <p> We 're talking about the involvement of people like Dr Sergei Portugalov in track and field but also in swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years , Alex . Look around the world how many others do you see with that count on their books ? <p> We 're also talking about two missing EPO tests among swimmers never reported to WADA . Have you asked about those ? I only ask because I have asked and good people tell me that the Russian swimming federation leaders know the name of the athletes , the name of the doctor who supplied the EPO and know a few more details , too ... and yet none of that reached WADA , none of it was reported to FINA , none of it got beyond the zone marked " do n't stick your noses in our business " . <p> The rules , meanwhile say that Russia and all others are members of the international sports community signed up to something called the WADA Code , signed up to something called FINA rules . <p> That Code , those rules lay out quite carefully the details of when positive tests must be reported , by whom and to whom . To fall foul of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you agree that that means such issues are definitively the business of others outside Russia : they are the business of the whole world of anti-doping and those charged with keeping sport clean so that we might all celebrate achievement such as that you enjoyed without having to shrug and say ' well , what do you think , do we trust it , or not ? ' <p> Alex , when your old country of residence , Australia , banned Sun Yang* from training at funded centres , it stuck its nose into his and China 's business because he was tainting not only his own country but Australia and the whole of swimming . <p> Shirley Babashoff , Kornelia Ender and Enith , 1976 <p> When the likes of Shirley Babashoff and other clean athletes down the years have called for reconciliation over the German Democratic Republic and State Plan 14:25 , they are indeed " sticking their noses " into the affairs of another nation , one no longer with us , though the taint of it all lives on and how , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympic medals tables and more but in the shape of disabled children , lives destroyed by ill-health and much more , courtesy of the abuse of minors that hurt athletes in the GDR and outside of the GDR . <p> And that 's the point , Alex : doping hurts others . It is not Russia 's issue nor problem alone . It is a global problem , victims are global but the issues that speak specifically to Russia and state involvement speak to a dark and deeply troubling and criminal past . <p> It would be good to hear you speak to that , Alex , on behalf of the clean athletes of the world as Russian Olympic Committee chief Alexander Zhukov contemplates the 271 athletes from Russian out of 387 possible on the bill in Rio . <p> Asking Sebastian Coe whether he sleeps well at night is not the best of approaches . <p> Coe may well lose sleep but not over Russia , I would suggest . Rather , he might sit up at night wondering about all those moments in the past when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean sport and committed to calling for FINA , IAAF , IOC and others to take the bull by the horns and do a much better job on anti-doping . <p> " I hope that he will not regret his decision about Russian athletes because as you can say , what goes around comes around . I hope that he will sleep well at night , " you say to Coe , Alex . <p> Two of the first casualties of the WADA IC report : Lamine Diack , left , and Grigory Rodchenkov <p> That 's called upping the ante , I would suggest . War , be it of words or worse , is what tends to follow . That is not what is required here . Sound commitment to clearing up the filth that is a part of sport right now is what is called for , starting with an acceptance by all that there are problems back home . <p> That means you too , Alex : tell us not that " the Russian side did n't really have a chance to speak up " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean those who blocked WADA investigators from gaining access to information and people ? Do you mean the folk who poured thousands of samples down the sink when WADA asked to see them ? They had their chance , Alex and we know what they did . <p> One can well understand the irritation of Russia and Russians but it might be good to tip the balance towards efforts to cut out the rot instead of turning on others and asking if they sleep well at night ; tip the balance towards asking questions such as ' what are we supposed to do when a nation and/or system is so steeped in bad practice and culture how to deal with it -- how to fight back against the collective punishment of clean athletes ? <p> Ask not if Coe sleeps well ; ask if Portugalov , if your deputy sports minister , if the doctor who gave the EPO to two young swimmers , if the official who threatened ' this goes no further ' , sleep well at night , Alex . <p> That you speak up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean athletes , speak up for rules that rule out , and every other athlete who ever tested positive for the highest category of banned substance ; speak up for making the Olympic Games a place we can trust in and say that seeing is believing . <p> You 're a smart man , Alex Popov . You can do better than this us to do so .@@13688715 <p> Dotting the ground 
 of commitment and care towards clean athletes was completed today , Russian reports letting it be known that all remaining five Russian swimmers among seven previous barred by the International Olympic Committee and the international swimming federation have been let back into Rio 2016 at the 11th hour . <p> According to Russian media , citing Vladimir Salnikov , the president of the Russian Swimming Federation , Yulia , Natalia , Daria , Michael and Anastasia , may be about to join Sun Yang* , Park and every other previously suspended swimmer on the doping case file in the race here in Rio . <p> The official start lists online did not include Efimova at the time the Opening Ceremony in Rio began nor as insult was added to injury and the swimmer herself announced her comeback from the brink on social media . The fate of Lovtsova , Ustinova , and was unclear this evening , in the absence of any statement from the IOC and FINA , whose delegates and decision makers were all in the stadium at the Opening by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games at chess . <p> The game played by Russia is complete : the Russian Olympic Committee agreed to abide by the IOC 's rule that it would keep all previous doping cases out of action in Rio ; the IOC then passed that agreement and the new rule on to international federations such as FINA knowing that the Court of Arbitration for Sport had not only thrown the Osaka rule out on the basis that it represented ' double jeopardy ' but had done so with advice attached : change your rule to make it one condition and all will be well . <p> The IOC did no such thing and as such the ROC , the IOC and FINA must surely have known at the time of barring Efimova and Co that the condition would not stand and all would be back in to race in Rio . <p> The rider that the IOC 's three-man panel set up to make final decisions can still refuse to extend an invitation to the five Russian swimmers was always a possibility but now looks unlikely . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces questions about two missing EPO tests among Russian swimmers in 2009 that have yet to be reported to the World Anti-Doping Agency or FINA in the midst of events that break the WADA Code , who told " R-Sport " that FINA had now " sent to Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) documents for admission of five Russian swimmers for the Olympic Games " . <p> Quite what that means remains to be seen : FINA has already been granted permission , in a sense , by CAS to make its mind up and proceed . If FINA is now letting the Russians back in , it must take the responsibility for that and send the entries . <p> And all because the IOC and everyone downwards did not support the WADA recommendation to bar Russian from Rio and make the point that state-sponsored doping is not acceptable in the wake of the evidence presented in the IP McLaren Report . <p> It now remains to be seen whether clean athletes make their protest and their legal claims . Certainly they need fear no consequence form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who fall foul of doping rules out of the Olympic Games . <p> As Russian lawyers and officials beat FINA to its own news , the swimming events will now be more muddied in Rio this coming week than they already were . <p> Comment <p> Now do you get it , IOC , Herr Thomas Bach ( as if you had n't already ) : you should have imposed a blanket ban and said no to all of that . You have failed cleaned athletes and so have those associated with your model of governance , such as FINA . You are unworthy of leading the Olympic Movement . You have failed clean athletes , failed sport , failed swimming . You have played politics with the youth of the world and ripped the heart out of your own Charter . It will come back to haunt you . <p> Here 's the view of those you claim to represent but would be forgiven if they decided you were no longer fit for that purpose : <p> " I would have to say from a personal standpoint that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dropped the ball on this and the system is broken and has to be fixed . " -- Bob Bowman <p> Asked what he would do if he were FINA President , Michael Phelps said : <p> " Do n't ask me that one . Do n't get me going : I do n't want to political about it ... I agree with Bob that its something that has to be changed in all sports . <p> His voice creaking with irritation and emotion , Phelps suggested he had never raced in clean waters , adding : <p> " We all want clean sports . That 's all we want . We want everybody to be on the same playing field . I can honestly say in my career I do n't know if I 've ever competed in a clean sport . It 's upsetting . But there 's not really a lot that I can control , but me . That 's the main priority for me . We 've had this problem for how many Olympics and its sad that we ca n't control it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't say I 've ever been in a clean competition . " <p> Russia and Yuliya Efimova a troubled season by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The CAS told the IOC when it threw out Osaka ( no athlete who has been suspended and served their time out can be give a second penalty of being barred form the Olympic Games ) , it advised Olympic bosses to consider framing one rule that achieved the Olympic bar . <p> This is the kind of thing that the IOC singularly failed to back on top-category offences : <p> " An athlete falling foul of rules X , Y and Z ( depending on category , shall serve up to a maximum suspension of four years , the penalty to be set at the period of time required to include suspension from the Olympic Games following the offence " . <p> FINA , meanwhile , has left clean athletes , those who will now face the Russians one of them a repeat offender , the other stepped in the controversy of five meldonium positives this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice for the individual is cited . What of the rights of the individuals who are now forced to race those who fell foul of rules designed to ensure clean sport and integrity ? <p> The remnants of those two things left Rio tonight just as the Russians make their way to the Olympic pool to join Sun and Park and the others who for many represent the kind of sport they do not wish to take part in . <p> FINA also put out the below statement today . Two points to make : Carrard is hardly independent , considering its Olympic links and , when was this considered by the wider world of swimming and membership of FINA so that sensible debate and feedback can take place long , long , before any vote takes place in Budapest next year ; and after the voting system has been changed to a secret ballot of electronic votes monitored independently . That 's transparency and democracy for you . <p> That change is being considered : fine . But it can not be internal for there would be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by chums of chums , for there would be no point in that ; it must be carried out by a wholly independent outfit beyond the realm of IOC and FINA . <p> As to the doping reference : did anyone say it had breached rules ? That 's hardly the point . What about the missing EPO tests in Russia ? Have the questions begun ? Has the Russian federation been asked ? If so , what reply was given ? And so on , IOC and FINA a busy time ahead ... <h> Resign Bach , Say His Critics <p> The head of the IOC , Thomas Bach is already feeling the pinch when it comes to his home country . German officials blasted the IOC today over its inability to send a strong message on Russia . <p> Top-ranking German sports officials decried the decision as a " poor signal " , while others demanded the resignation of Bach . <p> That came from the most poignant of all places : the one that reminds us just how precarious the IOC 's position now is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doping and declare " you shall not pass ! " <p> " We want to tell Bach : game over , you may leave . The consistently cowardly manner in which the IOC deals with Russia is no more than pure cynicism . " <p> And she said that " lies and cover ups are becoming the norm while the Olympic charter and good sense is being turned into laughing stocks . " <p> A board member of Germany 's National Anti-Doping Agency , Lars , also had strong words for the IOC , saying its decision " sends a poor signal for clean and fair sports " . <p> German athletics federation chief Clemens Prokop said the IOC has " done serious damage to its credibility " . Given that the abuse was state orchestrated , " there should have been a decision against the system , and not against individuals , " said Prokop . <p> Anti-doping specialist Fritz Serge meanwhile , called it " a victory for Bach but not for honest sports . " <h> The FINA statement : <p> On August 5 , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 Olympic Games , the FINA Bureau met in Rio de Janeiro ( BRA ) . <p> During the meeting , FINA considered the independent report from the Lausanne-based Consulting SA on good governance , in which a series of recommendations were proposed . <p> Based on these recommendations , the Bureau designated a Commission formed by its five Vice Presidents to further analyse these proposals for improving governance , and if necessary , to draft rule changes to be voted by FINA delegates at the 2017 FINA General Congress , to be held in Budapest ( HUN ) . <p> The Consulting SA review is aimed at guaranteeing and ensuring that good governance principles are properly implemented by FINA in an ever-changing modern sport environment . <p> Moreover , at the initiative of the FINA President , an Independent Person report conducted by Prof. Ulrich Haas , has analysed the work carried out by the FINA office related to the doping control results management procedure of Russian and Chinese cases during the period 2015-2016 . In concluding his report , Prof Haas states that he " has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its results management or supervising the results management of its member federation , has breached the applicable FINA or WADA anti-doping rules . " <p> Finally , the FINA Bureau was briefed on the latest stages of the preparation for the Games , including the final set-up of the Aquatics venues . FINA noted with satisfaction that despite a very challenging qualification procedure in Swimming , a new record of national participation will be established in Rio 2016 , with 172 present in the competition . <h> Comments <p> These IOC and FINA goons just ca n't go soon enough !

 SwimVortex coverage of the 31st Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . The team of Craig Lord and John Lohn will report live from the Rio Aquatics Centre , with the keen eye of Patrick B. Kraemer providing photographs . Action gets under way this afternoon with the first preliminary heats -- men 's 400 individual medley , women 's 100 butterfly , men 's 400 freestyle , women 's 400 individual medley , men 's 100 breaststroke and women 's 400 freestyle relay . Continue to visit this file ( and hit the refresh button ) for running updates from the pool . <p> The end of the first sessions brings the 4x100m freestyle , in which Australia are one of the strongest favourites for any crown in the pool . Cate and Bronte Campbell will fire up in heats with Brittany Elmslie and Madison Wilson racing to see who will get the last slot with the Campbells and Emma McKeon in the final . And for the USA : Katie Ledecky steps up for the 4x100m at the start of a mega week that includes the 200 , 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive company in the 100 breaststroke with his world-record showing , joining the likes of Chester Jastremski , Nobutaka Taguchi , John Hencken and Norbert Rozsa as athletes who set a world record in a prelim . <p> From the start , it was clear that Peaty had something special to deliver to the 14,000 fans in attendance , and that delivery was confirmed when he turned for home in 26.69 , more than three tenths under world-record pace . Peaty remained strong down his final lap and generated a huge applause from the crowd upon touching the wall . <p> The dominance of Peaty is so vast that he made the rest of a superb field look mediocre , including reigning Olympic champion der Burgh ( 59.35 ) of South Africa . Japan 's Yasuhiro Koseki was the only other athlete to eclipse the 59-second barrier , going 58.91 , but trailing the effort of Peaty by well over a second . <p> Simply , the semifinal and final will not be a race of Peaty vs. the field . Rather , it is Peaty vs. the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , will have the venue buzzing this evening . While medals will be doled out in four events , Peaty has made a semifinal one of the can't-miss spectacles of the evening . <h> Australian Ladies Targeting Gold and World Record In 400 Free Relay <p> One of the safest bets for gold ahead of competition , Australia 's 400 freestyle relay left no doubt it is the team to beat , setting an Olympic record of 3:32.39 behind the foursome of Madison Wilson , Brittany Elmslie , Bronte Campbell and Cate Campbell . It was the elder Campbell who headlined the outing , anchoring the Aussies in 51.80 . <p> Australia 's world record of 3:30.98 , set at the 2014 Commonwealth Games , is likely in its final hours , the Dolphins with more to bring at night . While Cate Campbell may be near her max , Bronte Campbell was not near her peak in prelims and Emma McKeon will join the relay at night , with Elmslie earning the other spot . Barring a disqualification , the only uncertainty at night is the winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lia Neal , Allison Schmitt and Katie Ledecky qualified second , with Ledecky anchoring in 52.64 and solidifying her spot on the evening squad . Abbey Weitzeil and Simone Manuel will be added to the relay for the final , the last spot to Weir , unless the coaching staff opts to go with Dana Vollmer or a surprise . <p> Canada , behind the 52.90 second leg of Chantal Van Landeghem , qualified third in 3:33.84 , with the final field completed by Italy ( 3:35.90 ) , the Netherlands ( 3:35.94 ) , Sweden ( 3:36.42 ) , Japan ( 3:36.74 ) and France ( ) . <h> Katinka Hosszu Blasts European Record In 400 Medley <p> One of the questions facing Katinka Hosszu on her way to the Rio Games centered on her ability to handle the pressure of the quadrennial event . Four years ago , the Hungarian went home without a medal from London , a surprising development and one connected in part to the overwhelming nature of the Olympics . <p> As Hosszu opened her latest Olympiad , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history , a mark of that was good for the European record . Hosszu was under world-record pace through 350 meters , chasing the 4:28.43 that China 's Ye Shiwen managed for the gold in London . Like other instances , however , Hosszu could n't keep pace with Ye 's homecoming split of 58.6 , as she covered the freestyle leg in 1:02.08 . <p> Of course , Hosszu will get another crack at the world record in the evening , though a first Olympic gold medal ( any medal , actually ) is the priority . Barring an implosion by Hosszu or a performance from elsewhere in the field that does n't seem likely , the 27-year-old will stand on the top step of the podium and jumpstart what could be a multi-medal week . <p> Spain 's Mireia Belmonte and the United States ' Maya DiRado figure to have the best chance at upending Hosszu , as they took the second and third positions for the final in respective times of 4:32.75 and . The British pair of Hannah Miley ( 4:33.74 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the final completed by 2012 silver medalist Elizabeth Beisel ( 4:34.38 ) , Japan 's Sakiko Shimizu ( ) and Canadian Emily Overholt ( 4:36.54 ) . <p> Ye , the reigning champ , finished well down the results , going for 27th . The helm of world ranks , 2016 : <p> How far has the 400 freestyle developed ? Consider : An effort of 3:45.49 was n't good enough to advance to the championship final . Surging over the final two laps , Conor Dwyer prevailed in the last of seven heats and claimed Lane Four for the evening with a career-best mark of 3:43.42 , ahead of the of Australian Mack Horton , who had some choice words for China 's Sun Yang* in the mixed zone . <p> It paid off to race in the last heat , where five athletes secured tickets to the medal hunt and had the chance to gauge what was necessary to move on . Also going under 3:44 was Italian Gabriele Detti , who touched in . The fourth seed was notched by reigning Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 3:44.23 . Sun is never far from controversy , a doping ban on his ledger and earlier in the week involved in an incident in which he splashed and taunted Horton in the training pool . <p> Australian David McKeon ( 3:44.68 ) and Great Britain 's James Guy ( 3:45.31 ) were fifth and sixth , and were followed into the final by American Connor Jaeger ( 3:45.37 ) and France 's Jordan Pothain ( 3:45.43 ) . The speedy nature of the prelims left some big names out of the final . Following ninth-place finisher Florian Vogel ( 3:45.49 ) of Germany were 2008 Olympic champion and 2012 silver medalist Park ( 3:45.63 ) of Korea and Canada 's Ryan Cochrane ( 3:45.83 ) . <p> On cruise control , and needing nothing more , Sweden 's Sarah Sjostrom easily secured the fastest time of the prelim session in the 100 butterfly , going 56.26 . The world-record holder at 55.64 , Sjostrom now owns eight of the 10-fastest textile times in history and is poised to back up her back-to-back world crowns with the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , Sjostrom has been untouchable in the 100 fly , putting up times at all points on the calendar that have been out of reach for others . Although two rounds remain , it is difficult to forecast anyone giving the Swede a push for the gold , especially with more time to drop . If anyone is to challenge Sjostrom , the place to look is the reigning Olympic champ . <p> One of the better stories on the Team USA roster , Dana Vollmer continued her return from maternity leave with a mark of 56.56 out of the first seeded heat . Vollmer was 55.98 for the gold medal in London four years ago , and to be within a half-second of that performance is a good start for the veteran of three Olympiads . <p> Also cracking the 57-second barrier were Canadian Penny Oleksiak ( 56.73 ) and American Kelsi Worrell ( 56.97 ) . The 16-year-old Oleksiak lowered her World Junior Record from 56.99 while Worrell remained consistent after winning the American Trials . The top eight also included China 's Lu Ying ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , China 's Chen Xinyi ( 57.17 ) and Japan 's ( 57.27 ) . <h> Chase Kalisz Keeps Alive Hope For U.S. Gold Streak In 400 Medley <p> Chase Kalisz by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Splitting 1:08.96 on the breaststroke leg to pull nearly even with Japan 's Daiya Seto heading into freestyle , American Chase Kalisz took the lead in the final strokes of his first Olympic swim and nailed down the top seed for the final in 4:08.12 . That time moved Kalisz to the No. 6 all-time performer , and No. 4 in textile . Kalisz is trying to extend the United States ' gold-medal streak in the event to six , dating to 1996 . <p> Seto , who earned the second seed with a career-best clocking of 4:08.47 , built a commanding lead on the opening fly leg and maintained that large gap through the backstroke . But Kalisz turned to his weapon the breaststroke and put together a scorching leg to give Seto a race . Over the final two laps , Kalisz pulled even and , eventually , ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scintillating first final . <p> Also part of the picture will be Seto 's countryman , Kosuke Hagino , who seemingly frolicked in the third heat , going 4:10.00 for the No. 3 seed . Hagino bolted away from the competition and shut down on the freestyle leg , conserving energy for the night . Based on time Hagino has been the premier 400 medley swimmer in the world since 2013 , but he continues to search for his first global title . <p> Rounding out the field for the final were American Jay Litherland ( 4:11.10 ) , Great Britain 's Max Litchfield ( 4:11.95 ) , Aussies Thomas Fraser-Holmes ( ) and Travis Mahoney ( 4:13.37 ) and Spain 's Joan Pons Ramon ( ) . <h> Place It All In Context <h> Rio 2016 The SwimVortex Guide <p> Rio 2016 The SwimVortex Guide ( all images by Patrick B.

 to the first athlete of the Games in competition to speak up for clean sport and against those who fall foul of anti-doping rules goes to Australia 's Mack Horton . <p> The backdrop to these 31st Olympic Games of Blame is one that can not be ignored . For whatever reason , the IOC , FINA and the combined forces of CAS and all others did nit find a way of keeping the poison out of the pool , with all Russians at first barred now back in . <p> And so , no surprised to find some extra needle in the 400m freestyle this night in Rio : asked about getting water splashed at him in the warm-up by Sun Yang* , the defending champion from China who is locked out of all funded training centres in Australia , Horton emerged from a smooth 3:43 heat to say of the incident : <p> " It kind of got played up in the media a little bit . He just splashed me to say ' hi ' and I ignored him because I do n't have time or respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so he kept splashing me and I just got in and did my thing . " <p> Sun Yang tested positive for a heart booster in 2014 after the substance had been added to the banned list at the start of that year . He was handed a retrospective three-month suspension but that was never served , Sun having raced to three golds at the Asian Games between his May positive and the November revelation of his fall from grace . <p> Mack Horton by Steve Christo for Swimming Australia Ltd <p> After the warm-up incident earlier this week , China 's Olympic swim team manager Xu Qi rubbished claims that Sun had splashed Horton in training in an effort to distract him . <p> " It is fake news , " said Xu on the crienglish.com website . <p> " Sun Yang and the Australian swimmers are very good friends .

 Japan on the way to his first Olympic gold - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Call Kosuke Hagino a streak buster , and a man who has drowned the large monkey who would n't get off his back . <p> The Japanese star built a commanding advantage through the opening two legs of the 400 individual medley , and then turned back a gutsy challenge from the United States ' Chase Kalisz over the final two laps to win his prime event in 4:06.05 . Kalisz summoned every measure of his strength to give Hagino a run at the finish and took the silver medal in 4:06.75 , both athletes registering career-best performances . Hagino 's countryman , Daiya Seto , picked up the bronze medal in 4:09.71 , comfortably clear of Great Britain 's Max Litchfield ( 4:11.62 ) . <p> Hagino jumpstarted Japan 's competition in most fashionable manner and ended a streak of five consecutive gold medals by the United States in the event . After Tom Dolan went back-to-back in 1996 and 2000 , Michael Phelps doubled in 2004 and 2008 , with Ryan Lochte maintaining keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ended his long search for a worldwide championship , something that had eluded him before the late hours of Saturday night . Hagino has found himself in a unique position since the 2013 campaign , one of conflicting angles . From a stopwatch and consistency standpoint , no one has been better than the 21-year-old . He 's produced more high-quality times than anyone else in the world , including the only two efforts of the quadrennial heading into Rio . Yet , clockwork accounts for only part of the equation . <p> Prior to his career-defining effort , on the scale that weighs finishes , Hagino lacked the global title that is defining and necessary for superstar status . At the 2013 World Championships , a miscalculation of his energy reserve left Hagino dead by the final day of action , the podium missed with a fifth-place showing . Then last summer , a fractured elbow forced Hagino out of the World Champs in Kazan , which were supposed to serve as his launching point on the Road to Rio . <p> There were no potholes this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best , " Hagino said . " My family inspired me . I had a hard time . I talked to them about my anxious feelings , and without them , I would n't be here . " <p> After coasting through the prelims and shutting down on the freestyle leg , Hagino attacked the final from the start , going through the butterfly leg just behind Seto in 55.57 , but in the lead after the backstroke by more than a second in 1:57.73 . At that point , Hagino had nearly a three-second cushion on Kalisz and went into survival mode as the field shifted to the breaststroke , Kalisz 's big weapon . <p> By the end of the first lap of breaststroke , Kalisz had decreased his deficit to 1.57 seconds and he had the margin down to .74 with only the freestyle to go . Kalisz covered the breaststroke in 1:08.17 , the fastest split for that leg in the history of the event . More , he put together a valiant chase of Hagino over the last two laps . <p> Despite Hagino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freestylers , Kalisz kept grinding and forced his Japanese foe to work all the way to the wall . To Hagino 's credit , he never buckled under the increasing pressure of the American and managed to produce the fourth-fastest time in history , and the second-fastest in a textile suit . Kalisz , meanwhile , clocked the ninth-fastest time , and the third-quickest in textile . <p> The gold medal could be the start of a huge week for Hagino , who pared down his schedule to a more-manageable slate , the 200 freestyle and 200 individual medley still to come . With the 200 free relatively wide open , a medal is not out of the question . After that event comes the 200 medley , one of the most-anticipated events of the meet , with Hagino set to battle Phelps , the three-time defending champion , and Lochte , a three-time medalist . <p> Although the Americans had their stranglehold on the event snapped , Kalisz added a chapter to the North Baltimore Aquatic Club legacy in the event , his medal complementing the pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalisz , his path to the silver medal was carefully crafted , a steady build . <p> In the three years leading up to his first Olympiad , Kalisz continually proved he was among the best in the sport 's decathlon , winning silver at the 2013 World Championships and bronze at the 2015 global showcase . In between was a bronze medal at the Pan . As Rio beckoned , Kalisz opted for a meticulous game plan , redshirting his senior season at the University of Georgia in order to wholly focus on his training with coach Bob Bowman . <p> " This is our event , " Kalisz said . " This is probably one of our most decorated events , so many gold medals . I 'm a little upset I did n't get to continue that tradition , but I was at peace with myself before the race . That was the biggest thing . I was talking with Bob , whatever happens , happens . It 's not about a time . It was n't about a medal . It was about me giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <p> Nerves were evident as Kalisz won the event at the United States Olympic Trials , Bowman saying his charge was wrapped tightly on the evening he punched his Olympic ticket . Bowman , too , felt Kalisz would benefit from five weeks of preparation for Rio , and would feel less pressure with a freeroll basically on the table . Obviously , he was right . <p> A training partner of Phelps , Kalisz received some advice from the 22-time Olympic medalist , tips he took to heart . Kalisz has always looked up to Phelps , even when tough love has been applied . <p> " ( Phelps told me to ) stay relaxed , " Kalisz said . " He knows how I can get when I 'm tight and I 'm nervous . Honestly , I was at peace with myself here . I did n't think about a medal and I did n't think about a time . I thought about giving my 100% honest effort and at the end of the day I will look back at that and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for and I 'm happy with my results right now . " <p> In the case of Seto , he has spent the majority of quadrennial in the shadow of his teammate , an odd distinction given his status as the two-time defending world champ . Although he repelled challenges from the globe 's best on two occasions and etched himself as a worldwide force in the 200 butterfly , the multi-event program of Hagino has been the more enticing storyline , leaving Seto to wave from the background . <p> Nonetheless , he has been a consistent presence in the event , now on the past three global podiums , something Kalisz can also claim . <p> " I enjoyed the race with ( Hagino ) , but I could n't get it this time , " Seto said . " Now I will look to Tokyo 2020 . It will be the biggest stage , with all the fans at home . I am just happy for ( Hagino ) . ( Kalisz ) is also my old friend . I am happy for him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was better us to do so . <p> Chelsea will have 
 of Australia , had already celebrated a golden moment after lunchtime heats , having taken a stand for clean sport . In the final , he drove the knife deeper with a victory over Sun Yang* , the tainted Chinese defending champion , whose 3:41.68 left him shy but the first man on the podium at these Games towing an asterisk . <p> James Guy set the pace at 53.70 , 1:50.23 and , leading still with 100m to go , . It was then going to be tough for the 200m world champion as three 1500m aces chased him down . <p> Sun looked dangerous throughout , in lane 6 and hanging on to the coat-tails of Horton in 5 from start but unable to produce the hallmark killer finishes of the past and t the finish forced to stay in the role of understudy to the Australian coached by Craig Jackson in Melbourne . <p> In a race and at a pace that favoured the men of 30-lap stamina over the last 100m , Gabrielle Detti swept through from 6th at the last turn , past Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze for Italy in 3:43.49 . led the 3:44s at 0.01sec past the post , Jaeger in and the courageous Guy on 3:44.68 . <p> The ebb and flow : <p> 54.06 ( 4 ) 1:51.19 ( 3 ) ( 2 ) Horton <p> 54.52 ( 7 ) 1:51.67 ( 7 ) ( 3 ) 3:41.68 Sun <p> 54.67 ( 8 ) 1:51.84 ( 8 ) ( 6 ) 3:43.49 <p> Horton beamed on the podium as Australian fans cheered for their sixth champion since it all began more than a century ago . He shook hands but had barely a smile for Sun , who , he said , earlier in the day , he had neither time nor respect for after the Chinese swimmer had tested positive for doping in 2014 . <h> Comments <p> Kazan left doubts in many people 's minds re Horton , and I was one of them . He answered them in the best way possible . Congratulations and fair play to him ! <p> As to the Sun comments ; I do n't see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy and he made the decision to make them .... time will tell whether they were wise or not <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> I was also one of them , CW . It looked as if Sun was going to overhaul him on the last 25m and I could not be happier Horton has denied him Gold ! <p> Re Guy -- Gutsy swim indeed , Craig , though it has to be said a big disappointment overall today . Both sets of GB commentary team 's have said his focus is the 200m and understandable looking at Kazan . However , I am sure I have heard an interview recently in which Guy highlighted the 400m still as his target . Time will tell . <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> I watched through the Canadian broadcasting . They showed slow-mo HD clear footage how the Joao Gomes merrily dolphin kicked his way to the finish . Even the commentators were astounded he was not DQed . Jake Packard was robbed of us to do so . <p> Forecasters were still 
 discussed , expected and predicted for months finally came to fruition on Saturday night at the Rio Aquatics Centre , as Australia celebrated a second consecutive Olympic crown in the women 's 400 freestyle relay , and third title in the past four Games . Simply , the home of female sprinting was solidified as the nation from Down Under . <p> Handling the last two legs , the Sisters of Speed Bronte Campbell and Cate Campbell lifted their nation to the gold medal and a world record of 3:30.65 , joining forces with Emma McKeon and Brittany Elmslie . The triumph bettered the Aussie 's world record of 3:30.98 from the 2014 Commonwealth Games and handed them a victory of more than a second over the United States , which set an American record of 3:31.89 for the silver medal . Canada secured the bronze in , anchored by 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak . <p> Boasting three ladies the Campbell sisters and McKeon with sub-53 credentials in the 100 freestyle , Australia went to work with more firepower than any of its rivals , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more-than-capable fourth , her spot on the evening squad confirmed when she covered her leg in prelim duty in 53.22 . <p> The difference , though , was found in the name Campbell . When Bronte entered the water for the third leg , the Dolphins faced a deficit of .61 . Yet , it was n't time to worry as the younger Campbell covered her work in 52.15 , putting Australia ahead by .42 . That cushion was plenty for the elder Campbell , who brought her team home with a split of 51.97 , her second sub-52 outing of the day . Together , the Campbell 's provided a 1.85-second surge over the Americans , and it was n't like Team USA was stuck in quicksand . Rather , the Campbell Girls are two of a kind , and became the first siblings to share a podium in Olympic swimming lore . <p> " It was definitely my favorite race ever , in an Olympic final with my sister and two girls I have known since I was 12 or 13 years old and a gold and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ask for more . Every kid dreams of it . It 's what we always hoped for . " <p> The Australians were so heavily favored that the prevailing line at European sportsbooks had them at 1-20 , the shortest odds of any relay on the Rio program . The United States , just to emphasize the lofty expectations placed on the Aussies , went off at 10-1 , with Canada and the Netherlands each slotted at 25-1 . <p> For the Campbells and McKeon , their work is far from done for the week . The siblings have a strong chance of finishing on the podium together in the events , Cate Campbell the favorite for gold in both disciplines . She entered Rio riding a wave of confidence , provided by a world record of 52.06 in the 100 freestyle in tuneup action . As for McKeon , she 'll be chasing a medal in the 100 butterfly on Sunday night after going 56.81 in the semifinals for the No. 2 seed in the title race . <p> " Everyone is just pulling together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team , " Cate Campbell said . " We 've got a great vibe going and hopefully this will kick the momentum off and we 'll get the ball rolling with this . " <p> The United States ' silver-medal finish marked the fourth consecutive Games in which the Americans finished off the top step of the podium , but it was n't for the lack of a sterling performance . Sometimes , a squad just runs into a buzzsaw , and that is what unfolded with the U.S. running into Australia . That did n't mean there was n't something to celebrate . <p> In bettering the American record of 3:32.31 , the foursome of Simone Manuel , Abbey Weitzeil , Dana Vollmer and Katie Ledecky put together as good a showing as could be expected by the Red , White and Blue . The tactic of the U.S. coaching staff was clear . By placing Manuel and on the front of the relay , the Americans were trying to exert some pressure on Australia . Manuel ( 53.36 ) and Weitzeil ( 52.56 ) did their job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) wrapping up in solid form . For Ledecky , it was her second sub-53 split of the day , and bodes well for what the distance ace might unveil in the coming days . If Ledecky can sprint at that type of rate , her distance marks figure to be other-worldly . <p> " I have never wanted to be on a relay team so badly , " Ledecky said . " After the coaches ' meeting , they sent me a text ( confirming her relay spot ) and when I saw it , I started crying I was so excited . These are the best memories I have , of relays . I just did n't want to let the three other girls down . I wanted to make them proud . " <p> Along the way to Rio , the Netherlands was mentioned as the other medal favorite , its one-two punch of Ranomi Kromowidjojo and Femke Heemskerk a daunting tandem . The Canadians , however , had another idea and put together a national record of to grab the bronze medal , the Dutch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked the first for Canadian women in the event in 40 years , and marked their first in any relay since the 1988 Games in Seoul . <p> Given the task of holding off Kromowidjojo on the anchor leg , Oleksiak did her part in 52.72 , following the contributions of ( 53.86 ) , Chantal Van Landeghem ( 53.19 ) and Taylor Ruck ( 53.12 ) . Oleksiak also advanced to the final of the 100 butterfly , where she 'll be in the mix for a minor medal behind heavy favorite Sarah Sjostrom of Sweden . <h> Comments <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> Not a bad time to be a Canadian I predict a strong meet for their team spearheaded by 16 year old Oleksiak. 56.7 and ( ? ) in the same session at her first Olympic Games . <p> The race itself going to the form book .

 Brittany Elmslie and Emma McKeon in a world-record 3:30.65 victory in the 4x100m freestyle for the third global standard of the day and Australia 's third out of four Olympic titles since 2004 . <p> The victories by Horton and the women 's relay team capped an impressive first night for an Australian team that captured only one swimming gold medal in London four years ago . Now they already have two . Their wins also marked the most successful opening night at an Olympics for the Australians in the pool since Athens 2004 . <p> There was bad blood between Horton and Sun going into the race . After heats , the Australian was asked about an incident in warm-up earlier in the week in which Sun was said to have splashed Horton with water in an attempt to distract him . Horton replied : <p> " It kind of got played up in the media a little bit . He just splashed me to say ' hi ' and I ignored him because I do n't have time or respect for drug cheats . He was n't too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got in and did my thing . " <p> Sun was handed a retroactive three-month suspension for using a banned heart stimulant in 2014 . He never actually served the ban . <p> When Sun held out his hand on the podium , Horton accepted it , shook it but could barely manage a grimace , let alone a smile . That was good enough for Cate Campbell , the perpetrator of two : <p> " I think that Mack is the real hero of tonight . He is such a young guy and to hold his nerve and to conquer in the 400 in his first Olympic Games , I think everyone had a tear in their eye when they saw him win that medal . " <p> Cate Campbell by PBK <p> On the success of the 4 ? 100 relay , Campbell noted : <p> " It was a quiet confidence , one that does n't need to be spoken . We 're very much letting our actions speak and that 's entirely what we did . There was no mention of gold medals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe changeovers and swim your own race and focus on yourself more than anything else . " <p> Meanwhile , the powerful Americans managed three silvers but could n't reach the top of the podium . The game is long , however : seven days to go and the United States got a glimpse of a maelstrom to come today when Katie Ledecky clocked 52.6 and 52.7 in her two 100m freestyle relay efforts . That kind of speed is equivalent to a low 53 in a straight 100m freestyle . For any of those heading to the 200m freestyle , they will know what that means : go out too fast and she will kill them ; go out to slow and she will murder them . <h> Comments <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> Now that Horton is swimming on form and riding on a high confidence , I wonder if the Aussie coaches will put him in 4 ? 200 final . Remember that in 2013 junior worlds he already split 1:45 . may not be fast enough to upset USA , but at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 7 , 2016 <p> It was a good night for the Aussies , but it came after a very strong performance by USA in heats . I was very impressed by the heat swims and know that some gold will follow . <p> In London much was made of Aussie failure despite a healthy count of Silver it is a shame we do n't get as excited by the other podium rewards , some of them achieved in close finishes . I can recall a time when a silver medal was relishes with much pride and not diminished by the question What went wrong ? Toxic culture ? blah blah . <p> The silver behind Aussie women 's relay was an amazing feat . The US team did the best they could given the target was freakishly good . Ledecky continues to amaze me . <p> And the bronze ! ! ! Canada is back . If they can nurture this new crop of then Australia will struggle with an extra serious rival besides USA and Dutch . Bring it on ! <p> SV August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in world titles thru injury , Now he is undisputed world and Olympic champion . <p> ASF , I agree , this is a very fast relay team , maybe not quick enough to match the Americans , but certainly comfortable silver medalist &amp; maybe even scare the Americans . <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> The Canadian women 's side , as a whole , is looking very promising . <p> Oleksiak is already prominent in the crew scrapping for minor medals in the 100fly &amp; looks like she may crash the sharp end of the in years to come . <p> Thomas disappointed in the 100fly but she may progress . Masse 's times put her in the frame for the 100back title . Smith is a 1.06 100 breaststroker . McLean is potentially round the business end of the distance freestyles . <p> Some of these may go on to be major international figures , some may inevitably flame out but this relay medal may not be Canada 's last , either in Rio or at World level over the next few years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horton came into this meet number one fastest this year and deserved favoritism ... The monkey is off his back ( Kazan ) and will only get better and will continue the rich history Australia have in 400/1500 mens freestyle .... <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> Canada girls are looking dangerous in 4 ? 100 medley . Not enough for gold or silver , but are looking us to @ @ @ <h> Recruitment events to 
 a woman who once raced her peers to one who dominates them is complete . Reminding us of the kind of dominance over 400m medley that we last saw in the age of Petra Schneider in 1980 , Katinka Hosszu , of Hungary , added another line to a truly unique profile : 4:26.39 . A world record of enormity and that from a winner who is six years older than the average age of champions in the event down the years . <p> The world mark had stood at a controversial 4:28.43 to China 's Ye Shiwen , who at 16 in London raced to gold at the same pace as the men in the equivalent final over the last 100m on freestyle . Hosszu 's tale is not void of controversy , either . <p> The sighs and sinking spirits all about you up on the media bench are a sign of the times . These are a Games at which seeing is not necessarily believing , skepticism heavy in the air . <p> Hosszu is suing Swimming World and its website after it ran an article suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swimming World publisher Brent Rutemiller tweeted this night : " Speechless and Powerless " . <p> Hosszu not only dominated her event but raced it in a way that her rivals could not cope with and may never be able to fathom . This is not a newcomer in their midst ; it is an athlete they have known for many a long year . Now they barely recognise her . <p> Take the breaststroke split of a woman who in textile has left her former self behind in all events and strokes and distances on the world-championships program since 2013 : 1:16.11 . As the splits below show , 1:18 was about where she 's been before Rio . <p> Among the world-class rest , the silver went to American Maya Dirado ( USA ) in 4:31.15 , the bronze snatched at the last stroke by Spain 's Mireia Belmonte in over Brit Hannah Miley 's 4:32.54 . Said Hosszu : <p> " Its just crazy that I 've been able to swim 2sec faster than anyone else ever -- it 's just crazy " <p> Hosszu added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite some time now . It 's been over seven years I 've been thinking about it . This morning swimming so close to the record ... I knew I could go faster . Honestly , I did n't think I could go this much faster but it was just unbelievable that I have been able to break it by this much . " <p> " It 's been a long journey for me . In 2012 , after graduating college and basically turning pro , I felt like London was my time to do it . I felt a lot of pressure and was super-nervous before the final . I remember not enjoying it , I just wanted it to be over . I was just afraid about what happens if I do n't win . " <p> DiRado 's take : " I was n't even worried about ( Hosszu ) being ahead . I was just looking around making sure that I would be on the podium . That 's an amazing time . I looked at the board and I was shocked for her , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a lot of pieces and a lot of hard work coming together after a lot of years of training , and to be able to do that at the Olympics and get a silver medal is just unbelievable . " <h> Margins Of Victory <p> Schneider won by 10sec , Tracy Caulkins by 9 at boycotted Games . Set those apart and Hosszu 's win stands out in the history of the 400IM . <p> The world record can not be compared to Ye 's pathway to a bizarre result . For the most part Hosszu was racing 5sec inside the pace of Ye in London , falling shy only on freestyle but by then the world record was well within her grasp . The rest of the line up looked as though they had stumbled into a timewarp and found themselves in the wrong race . <p> There are four seconds between Miley and Hosszu on the clock of best times over 200m breaststroke in favour of the Commonwealth champion . That had often shown up in medley races . Not today . <p> Miley and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fingertip decided that Belmonte would add a bronze to her two silvers from London 2012 and Miley , who knew a time when she was quite capable of beating Hosszu and did , would not quite manage to get a medal . Said Miley : <p> " I 'm not letting this Olympics define my whole career . The journey still continues . My first Olympics I was 6th , London I was 5th and now I 'm 4th . I 'm happy but disappointed , It 's tough but that 's sport , it 's brutal . I could see her coming back and I was willing myself to grow an extra two inches . Your body is screaming for oxygen . I had to push through that pain . When I did n't see the lights I thought , ' Oh pants ' . <h> Heading in Different Directions <p> How different are the journeys of champions 2012 and 2016 . The contrast was stark in lunchtime heats as Hosszu and Ye headed in opposite directions from London to Rio return . <p> The Hungarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of age , took down the European record with a . The world record proved a touch too far , still , Ye Shiwen 's controversial 4:28.43 at the age of 16 for gold in London standing the test of time . <p> Hosszu raced well inside Ye 's pace , turning 3sec ahead of target at the 200m and over 2sec inside at the 300m mark but Ye came home in 58.6 , as fast as the blocked in London , an Olympic first , while Hosszu managed a 1:02 flat this morning . <p> The dominance of Hosszu is part of a truly unique profile in sport . Nowhere is it possible to find anything remotely close to the transformation of a 24 to 27 year-old who has wiped out her best form in every single world championships events , stroke and distance since 2013 . <p> She had known success in her pre-2013 days , of course but even there the picture is like no other you will find in swimming history . Take the 400m medley : <p> 2009 -- in shiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had four swims from 2012 between 4:32.8 and 4:33.77 , her for fourth in the London 2012 final just shy of her all-time textile best of 4:32.83 from a grand prix event in the US that same year . <p> To describe that list as extraordinary falls shy of expressing the magnitude of it all compared to what the best of the rest of medley swimmers in history and now have managed , let alone managed from 24 to 27 years of age . <p> The upturn coincides with America Shane Tusup becoming Hosszu 's coach later husband . He recently explained to Karen Crouse of the New York Times that he knew it could work but " also knew that someday they might come to regret it " . <p> The antics of the coach and the public displays of affection and what borders on the opposite are often the talk and even concern of peers on the deck . <p> Jessica Hardy ( the American breaststroke specialist who tested positive for a banned substance at 2008 USA trials and served a suspension but was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list the banned substance in the contents even though they were there ) trained with Hosszu whe the Hungarian was based at Trojan in Los Angeles . Hardy told Crouse : <p> " I 've seen a lot of inappropriate and behavior in Shane . I 've seen coaches exhibit that kind of behavior in training , but this is another level . It 's scary . " <p> Hosszu and tell Crouse that they have been able to separate their relationship as athlete and coach from that of wife and husband . <p> Hosszu reflects on her London 2012 Games three years after lifting the World crown over 400m medley and two years after being well beaten by Britain 's Hannah Mily for the European titles , when she tells Crouse : " In London , I was so scared of what 's going to happen if I lose . It was awful , really . I just felt like : ' This is my time ; I need to show it . It 's now or never . ' I put this pressure on myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Iron Lady ) : she would show nerves of steel and race in every event she could get to , exhaustively and often all arounbd the world and often at a pace that very few , if any , of her rivals could contemplate when in heavy training phases . <p> It all started on World Cup tour and Hosszu became FINA 's favourite star , an athlete who to them proved that swimming could be a spectacle all year round and that swimmers could change the way they went about things : no more need for long periods of intense training away from competition . <p> Katinka Hosszu in Rio by PBK <p> The model , of course , simply does not work for the bulk of swimmers , who are still at school and could not possibly travel as Hosszu does . Not in the sense that her efforts were slow or soft but Hosszu 's multiple wins on World Cup Tour which made her a millionaire were won in the absence of the bulk of her world-class rivals . The bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crouse highlights the obvious , as we often have , when it comes to spouse and coach relationship that turns into altered profile and success late in a career : Michelle Smith de Bruin and her minder on deck back in 1996 , Erik de Bruin . Both have been banned from sport for falling foul of anti-doping rules , he before the triple-gold result of the swimmer in 1996 , she two years after those events . <p> Crouse notes as saying that when he took over Hosszu became " a 24-hour athlete " . Crouse writes : <p> " and Hosszu are like pool water and chlorine : You are not likely to find one without the other . Over a 15-hour period in late November in Budapest , the only time they were apart was to change clothes or use the bathroom . They never exchanged a cross word , and they never appeared to wilt , perhaps because of the four espresso shots over ice that serve as their daily pick-me-up . " <p> Hosszu described the act as " definitely difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a coach , " she said , " but at home he 's supersweet and loving and really funny . So we can laugh a lot . " <p> Asked what attracted them to each other , Hosszu tells Crouse with a laugh : " We 're weird ; we 're different ; we 're not normal . We 're ourselves . " <p> Crouse describes Tusup , 28 , as a man with a " weekend bodybuilder 's physique and several tattoos , including one of his wife 's world-record time . His manner can be brusque . His emotions are on a tripwire , causing some people to keep their distance " . <p> He is , says Hosszu , impatient and a perfectionist and that is what has helped to improve her times . No doubting that those have improved , some of them off the chart , her 2:06.12 world 200IM record for the world title last year one of the very pointy cases in point ( never under 2:10 before 2013 in textile suit ) . <p> Hosszu described him as impatient and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her backstroke , " he expects me to get it perfect right away . " <p> She added , " That 's why I 've improved so much . " She does not mention the endorsement of supplements that Hungarian team sources say are taken in " very large amounts and is why they never seem to get tired he takes them too " . <p> There is no suggestion from the sources of illegality but what is clear is the physical transformation in Hosszu , who talks about changes to technique when video footage of her then and now also point to gains in power as being at least as significant . <p> Self-belief lagged talent , the couple suggest . " Since I started working with Shane , I have a lot more confidence , " Hosszu says . " It 's crazy to think I still need Shane telling me : ' Yes , you are great . Yes , you can do that . ' " <p> In another parallel with the tale of Smith , who was described by coach Deryk Snelling as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the days when she was 20seconds slower on a 400IM , coach Dave Salo , at Trojan tells Crouse that Hosszu was one of the hardest workers he had ever seen . The exception was in the weight room , where Hosszu was " soft " . <p> That power element of the picture has changed radically . <p> Salo said he was happy to see " a leaner and meaner " Hosszu swimming " the way people always thought she was capable " but he suggested to the New York Times that there is reason for concern . <p> " I think the biggest issue with her is her husband . I think you have to look at her motivation . Is it fear or confidence that is driving her ? " <p> There are reports of Tusup screaming in Hosszu 's face , using bad and even what some may interpret as threatening language . Last year at the world championships , Tusup fell into an argument over that when an Australian coach intervened and told him to calm down . A top FINA official also approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not you " , a source present at the time told SwimVortex . <p> Katinka Hosszu by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Crouse reports an incident in which Tusup was said to have told Hosszu , after she swam below the standards he had set her at a grand prix event in the United States , that she should stay in the water and drown . The night was said to have ended with Tusup and Hosszu making their peace . <p> Hardy , meanwhile , reports that she and Hosszu have not spoken a word since a 2013 meet at which Tusup told Hardy not to speak to his charge . Of late , a long time friend and photographer who has supplied Hosszu with many free photos down the years has been treated to a similarly cold shoulder . <p> Hardy said : " He said I was distracting her . She seems happy with the dynamic . I have empathy , but I do n't think she needs or wants anybody 's assistance . " <p> Hosszu described her relationship with Tusup to Crouse as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's laid-back . Because he 's so emotional and he really wants us to get the goals we set for ourselves , that 's probably why he 's able to be that way . " <p> defended his behaviour when he told Crouse he was not a bully , explaining : <p> " That 's what it appears a lot of times . I get a bad rep in the U.S. because these parents in the stands , they 're going , ' He 's such a jerk ; he yells at her when she does n't swim fast . ' No , the hard part of swimming is that there 's a lot of times you just settle for O.K. , and we agreed that the goal was never to settle for O.K. , that we 're going to keep pushing , even if we do n't get it , to be great , to be amazing , to be legendary . " <p> Such descriptions will , of course , be left to others , including fellow athletes and peer coaches , to decide on . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petra Schneider never did test positive in international tests and she kept the prices she won at the Olympic Games and World Championships . As that and much more recent history has demonstrated , a declaration of " I never tested positive " is no iron guarantee . <p> Hosszu , like all others , is in the hands of those who will decide how to tackle anti-doping in future in a way that protects clean athletes . Samples from Rio and the run-up will be stored for 10 years and rested when new technologies emerge . <p> I think in this form Hosszu has to be the favourite in all her events ... I think she 'll make a statement swim in the 100 back prelims later today , Gemma Spofforth 's is under serious threat .... Unless Seebohm can match Peaty 's time and , she 'll be vulnerable to the Hosszu juggernaut <p> Gergely Kun August 7 , 2016 <p> Hi Craig , I have a question for you that I wanted to ask some time ago now which might be a silly one but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described Hosszus 200IM wr time of 2:06.12 as " off the chart " several times right , so I was just comparing male and female wr differences to see how off the chart that time is based on that : <p> 200 free 1:42.00 vs 1:53.61 difference : 11.61 <p> 1:52.09 vs 2:04.06 difference : 11.97 <p> 200bk 1:52.96 vs 2:04.06 difference : 11.10 <p> 2:07.01 vs 2:19.11 difference : 12.11 <p> 200IM 1:54.00 vs 2:06.12 difference : 12.12 <p> so if you look at that time is actually the farthest away from the male counterparts wrs still that is that one that 's " off the chart " for you whilst the others , I assume , are all ok . So I 'm wondering is there something that makes IM so much different to the rest of the strokes ? ? ? I 'm really not sure what the answer to that is or if the whole thing makes much sense so I 'm curious what you think . <p> so here if the difference was 18.16 in the IM the wr would be . Everyone is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say to a 4:22 flat ? <p> Just wan na stress as well this is not about Hosszu its about why the 2:06.12 and the 4:26.36 is so unbelievable and " off the chart " for a female athlete while the others are all ok . <p> Btw the question is open to everyone if you got any interesting ideas . <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> Gergely , I spotted several fallacies in your argument : <p> 1 . It 's not possible to compare absolute numbers . Change the difference in absolute numbers to percentage . 2 . You used textile world records for some events but rubber suit world records for some others . For comparison , it should be consistent . 3 . Even if you do the two things above , it is still not possible to directly compare differences of men and women events between events and distances as physiologically , men and women bodies perform differently at different events and distances . For example , if percentage gap between men and women WRs in 50 free is larger than in 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The percentage difference between men 50 free WR ( 20.91 ) and women WR ( 23.73 ) is more than 13% , while the difference between men 800 free WR ( 7:32.12 ) and women WR ( 8:06.68 ) is around 6% . <p> Generally , the greater the distance , the smaller the percentage gap between men and women 's times . <p> Basically , you can not directly compare men and women 's times across different distances and different events , let alone multi stroke events like IM . <p> Craig Lord August 7 , 2016 <p> I 'm comparing the athlete to the athlete , Gergely . It was off the chart . I 'm not comparing her to men ... I 'm comparing her to herself , her former self and to other women in the context of a long career and in the context of history <p> Dan smith August 7 , 2016 <p> I agree . I know it sounds weird but I think the men , s 800 free WR is slightly weak . The men do n't train for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim the 1500 free . Call me crazy but I think someone like gregorio can swim something like a 7:28 if he puts his mind to it . But I think he , s more interested in the 1500 WR . In mens swimming the 1500 free is more prestigious than the 800 free . In women , s swimming , the 800 free is more prestigious than the 1500 free . <p> There are some fans who want to replace the women , s 800 free with the 1500 at the Olympics but some old time swimmers eg Rebecca Addington are against it . Not sure we 're stands on it though . <p> And yeah , katinka , s 2:06:12 was off the charts . <p> One more thing , it still baffles me that a man of kosuke , s size can swim the times that he does . Incredible . I think he has a 4:05 in him . <p> Ger August 7 , 2016 <p> I am very deflated at this result ; 4:26 is not possible but there it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her other four events ? Craig has documented her improvements since London and they are beyond belief . " The sighs and sinking spirits all about you up on the media bench are a sign of the times . " I would like to hear more of the media reaction but there are of course legal constraints there , so we wo n't see it in print . <p> Blah Blah August 7 , 2016 <p> Dan Smith , distance in general is not nearly as competitive as other events imho ... <p> interestingly , in track and field , the gender gap is relatively constant across distances , and take out Ledecky and the gap is n't as pronounced in swimming either ... <p> Gergely Kun August 7 , 2016 <p> , <p> I find your answer quite interesting especially what you say about men and women bodies performing differently on different events and distances . That might just be the answer although I am not exactly sure how or why it is so . <p> I did indeed compare the wrong wr in the mens 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 10.57 between male and female wr in that event and also 400IM male should also have been 4:05.18 I believe so difference is 21.18 , mind you I think your comparing in your percentage explanation mens 800 free shiny suit to Ledeckys textile time . <p> And as for you saying that we can not compare womens and mens times across different events and distances well as I said the whole thing might not make too much sense but I was just doing it for the fun of it but I was trying to compare same distances and in the same strokes though . <p> Craig , I understand completely your opinions about Hosszu and who you are comparing her to and why but as I stressed earlier I would rather be interested in why a 2:06.12 is so off the chart for a female athlete it being off 12.12 sec away from the male wr while in all other strokes in the same distance the ladies are closer to what men can do especially on free where difference is only 10.57 , but still we would consider Hosszus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd still be interested in what you think on that and just forget for a minute who the actual time was swum by . <p> Blah Blah August 7 , 2016 <p> I agree in terms of the magnitude of the swims .. 2:06.12 is not as big an outlier as it is made out to be . However , I agree w/Craig ( I think ? ) about Hosszu , and it 's so obvious what is going on it 's laughable . <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> Gergely , I compared the fastest of the WRs . If I used the 800 textile WR for men , the percentage difference with Ledecky 's WR will be even smaller . <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> 2:06.12 is still an outlier WR . <p> Remember in 2010 when we were all listing which of the rubber-suit WRs that would last longest ? The women 200 IM WR of 2:06.15 was definitely in the top 4 among women WR ( after 200 fly and 200 free , and possibly on equal quality with 100 free ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by comparing with another WR of closest characteristics ( similar time , by women , of same distance ) , which is 200 back . <p> So here it is : current 200 back WR is 2:04.06 , set in 2012 In 1991 , another Hungarian great , Egerszegi , broke the WR in 2:06.62 So , in 20 years , the 200 back WR has improved by 2.56 seconds , or 2.02% <p> Now let 's compare to 200 IM , the current WR is 2:06.12 set in 2015 . In 1992 , the WR was set by Lin Li in 2:11.65 . The next WR holder was 2:09.72 . Both WRs were considered very strong already , and set by the Chinese swimmers ( you know what this means ) . So , in 20 year , the 200 IM WR has improved by 5.53 seconds , or 4.2% <p> You now see how an outlier is the current 200 IM WR , its rate of improvement is more than twice the rate of improvement of 200 back WR ( and we know both Franklin and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> August 7 , 2016 <p> 4:26.39 will last for decades , unless .. ahem .. another Hosszu appears . <p> Blah Blah August 7 , 2016 <p> Rate of improvement is not a good measure necessarily .. it depends heavily on the makeup of the competitors . There really was n't a super dominant women 's IMer during the height of the shiny suit era with Rice on the decline into 2009 , same with Coventry . Kukors was basically a nobody .. " nobodys " rarely break world records when the field is strong , except that freak men 's 200m breast record . Either way , do n't interpret any of this as suggesting that Hosszu 's performances are not ridiculously suspiscious . <p> Gergely Kun August 8 , 2016 <p> As for her time of 4:26 , well for someone who swims quite a few 4:30 and 4:31s in season is not that big a time drop to do at the most important meet of the year which also happens to be , obviously , the most important meet of the whole olympic cycle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very olympic focused and I do n't  think you can be suspicous just looking at the time but what can arouse suspicion is much rather what she does and how she performs in season . <p> Craig Lord August 8 , 2016 <p> Yes , Gergely , it is not just a singular moment ( it is a whole series of things put together that make for an deniably unique profile ) that raises questions and by that I do n't necessarily mean the D word ( which is simply a part of the language of modern sport these days , in general , as we can see from the number of positive tests at the tip of what may well be an iceberg of problems ) ; I mean how precisely it has been done because a lot of peers , swimmers and coaches , do want to know and really can not fathom it ... that 's what they 're saying and some those questions an reasonable and legitimate . In the current climate , it has to be possible and is certainly desirable for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' how does swimmer A beaten or matched fairly consistently on major moments for several year on end get turned over by vast margins by swimmer B age peer even when swimmer A is one of the toughest nuts and hardest workers you could care to point to and backed up by sports science and much else ' ? If there is a legitimate reason , we should be hearing it . So far , many ( swimmers and coaches ) do n't us to do so . <p> This website and 
 the last in-depth interviews of Yannick Agnel 's career , he spoke to reporter Sabrina Knoll about a time of turbulence , why he left Nice and mentor Fabrice Pellerin and how the death of former teammate Camille Muffat blew new perspective into his life . That interview forms the basis of the article that follows . <p> " You have to make it great , we have to make every day a day where you can smile and enjoy and be yourself . That is the biggest lesson I learned from all this . She is never lost , she is in my heart , in my head . She is always there with us. " -- on Muffat . <p> " I know what I want to do after this and it is not swimming . I think I 'm done . " That is how the career of Yannick Agnel may now come to a close after the Frenchman finished 19th in 200m freestyle heats here in Rio . <p> The contast is stark : <p> London 2012 -- 1:43.14 , faster that the next swiftest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rio 2016 : 1:47.35 , 0.2sec away from a place in the top 16 . The crown will pass -- but that much we all but knew before he dived in , the Frenchman 's form having serted him since he won the world title in 2013 . <p> What happened have you lost your mojo , asked Knoll weeks out from the Olympic Games . That day he still had hope , he still believed he could get back into contention : <p> " I came a long way to find again the way I used to compete . I am glad that things are back again , that I am back in the game . " <p> A false new dawn as it turns out as strong winds blew inclement weather over Rio today , the balmy clim about to give way to cooler times . <p> Had it been a turbulent Olympic cycle from Agnel since he celebrated gold in the 200m freestyle and the 4x100m freestyle with teammates at London 2012 ? <p> " Absolutely . But you know , every year I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am never bored , " he says through laughter . <p> Looking back at his switch from coach Pellerin to a new adventure with Bob Bowman in Baltimore , Agnel skirts the things that helped to make him an Olympic champion and says : <p> " Things were a little complicated , it would take hours to explain how things did not work in Nice . At first I did not want to leave Nice because it is my city : I love it , I love the people , I love the training . But things had n't gone well for a few years : even before London . The results were alright but that was n't the case in our heads , not in the way we were living . Our relationship with Fabrice was very , very complicated . I am talking for me and for Camille . " <p> The outdoor pool at North Baltimore Aquatic Club <p> It is , he adds , why he left and why she quit swimming . did not want an unhappy ending to his career and so he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is closet to my philosophy of what sport is ... I wanted a new adventure " . <p> That he has had but the results did not travel with him . In Baltimore he was " just pleased with what Bowman told me , the way they approached training , the group approach , the athmosphere in general -- and I loved it . I think if I had n't tried it , I would have regretted it alot . " <p> Agnel is now fairly certain that he will be moving on . A couple of months back , when asked if he had ever contemplated quitting since London 2012 , he replied : " When I quit Nice , I really wanted to go on , I just wanted a break , actually , because I was exhausted : you know , physically , mentally , it was pretty hard . The idea of keeping things going in the States was actually such a great motivator that I decided to keep swimming . <p> Even a few weeks after the break , I was like : OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe in the relay to help my fellow Frenchmen ; and then It was ' ah , I feel pretty good , I might swim the individual ' ; and that came out pretty good ( world 200m crown ) . I can not thank Michael and Bob and all the people in Baltimore enough for what they did for me that year . <p> But by Berlin 2014 the writing was on the wall : Agnel 's form was abandoming him and he noted at the European Championships that year that he needed " to talk to Bob Bowman " about what had gone " wrong " . Now , looking back , Agnel explains : <p> " We talked a few times . I had to be pragmatic at the time , I could not go on being this exhausted all the time . I felt like it American daily life was awesome , the training group was insane but in sporting terms it just would n't work . I decided to move on , and come back to France , find something that that would suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been spent in Mulhouse under the guidance of coach Lionel Horter . By late June this year truly felt that he had found his mojo . He said : <p> " We finally found the little switches to swim good , to get back in shape again , and I could swim like I did before ... I swim mainly because it is my passion but my passion is also to be in competition , the eye of the tiger , all that stuff , I love it , I love it ( you can really here how much ) . I love trianing , but I love competing even more and I love winning even more than competing . " <p> That may have all been true before today but as he left the stage in Rio after the 200m there was no sense of him having found those switches to take him back to the swimmer he had been under Pellerin . <p> Whatever the issues were , it was not all slog , the record shows . Back in the days when Agnel was blazing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peers were in shiny suits , the French coach kitted out his squad with waterproof mp3 players loaded with the sounds of Hans Zimmer 's Dark Knight ( Batman ) , Vivaldi 's Four Seasons , Love the Way You Lie with Eminem and Rihanna , the Beatles and Mozart . <p> " There is no theme that better echoes sport than music , " Pellerin told L'Equipe . " If I did not see any link between the two , I would not do it . <p> " The quick or slow movements of a symphony can correspond to a race construction with management , accelerations . I want to introduce them the swimmers to the musical states of mind that will allow them to maintain a rhythm or to change it if the race demands . " <p> In that context , it was ironic that Bowman would become part of Agnel 's life . On a tour of the US , a nation that gave us Bob Bowman 's Phelpsian Symphony from a boyhood visit to a pool where watching Tracy Caulkins translated to the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pellerin talks reporter Pascal Glo through a quarter of an hour of Agnel 's training . <p> The European 400m free champion works to the pace of the Dark Knight . " The piece climbs progressively in volume and a rhythm sets in , repetitive . The two arms ahead working in tune to the uniform beating kicking of his legs . Three chords of cello violoncello the cello appear then disappear by the time he has taken three arm strokes . " <p> On Muffat , Pellerin told the paper : " Camille now swims better than before when I simply said ' do one 25m faster ' . She is more streamlined because she is following the music and knew that one note follows another . Beyond that , she is more relaxed . " <p> , his mp3 loaded with his own wide-ranging choices -- Beatles , Black Desire , Mozart , Polnareff , , Nine Inch Nales and sounded not unlike Mumble ( Happy Feet ) when he said : " I 'm not very good at finding the rhythm of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Pellerin said that he had seen children with a musical education take to swimming more quickly than others . Music now features in three out of 12 sessions for his group . He intended to try some Heavy Metal at some stage : Vivaldi played by the likes of French guitarist Patrick Rondat or Ulrich Roth of the Scorpions . All part of the plan for London 2012 . Much water and sorrow under the bridge . <p> Paul Biedermann of Germany <p> Agnel is not the first swimmer and will not be the last to race and strive on beyond soaring moments . Knoll reminds of the roller-coaster of Paul Biedermann 's career : Hero to Zero and back . What helped him to stick with it was spending time " outside the swimming bubble " . <p> Coul Agnel relate to that ? " Definitely . There is a saying in French : " Life is not like a calm river " . That 's how I 've felt these past two years , and it is pretty much the way I feel how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is never how you expect it to be , and I am very proud about the way how Paul handled things . Because when I see the way he swam and the way he is still here , the only thing I can keep thinking is : wow . That is really the way I want to handle things ... " <p> It remains to be seen whether Agnel will now drift away from swimming , make a clean break or decide , in the fullness and calm of the weeks and months beyond Rio , whether he would indeed rather go than stay . After the 4x100m freestyle , we could expect news of what he had in mind for " next " . <p> Comebacks must never be discounted these days , the lure of success and unfinished business ever present in the champion . Was it addictive ? " It is not that it is adictive , it 's that its ... " , he pauses , thinks and continues : <p> " It feels as though the flame never goes out ; its always there ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retire . That 's the way life is , who we are ... " . Beyond swimming , he would need to " find something that will keep my flame burning . " <p> Like the fame that burns when you 're Olympic champion ? " The thing is , " he reflects , life does not change for you , but your life changes in the eyes of other people . You change for them . <p> " Actually , nothing really changes straight after the Olympics , but it changes after a few months , a few years when you ... walk through the streets , you pass some kids , and they have stars in their eyes and they look at you like you are an inspiration to them and that is the greatest gift you can have as a sportsmen . " <p> The perspective of a gold medal was delivering with the force of a sledgehammer on head in March 2015 when reigning Olympic 400m freestyle champion Camille Muffat lost her life in a helicopter crash while shooting a reality TV show in Rioja , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass , Katie Ledecky ( USA ) the favourite to claim the title after having become the first woman in Olympic history to crack 4 minutes . <p> A few weeks out from Rio , Agnel , his voice starting to tremble , said : <p> " It was terrible ... I could think of nothing else for a month . We really had an awful time , and I had to talk about it with a lot of people , to let it out , it was actually part of the reason why I did not swim at world championships last year in Kazan . It was hard ; that 's life . It could have happened to any of us . <p> " You have to make life great ; we have to make every day a day where you can smile and enjoy and be yourself . That is the biggest lesson I learned from all this . She is never lost , she is in my heart , in my head . She is always there with us . " <p> Many thanks to Sabrina Knoll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ger August 7 , 2016 <p> Moving words about Muffat . Whatever he does , my best wishes to him . <p> Thomas August 8 , 2016 <p> Camille Muffat still had lot of respect to Fabrice Pellerin even after stopping her carrier . Fabrice Pellerin was not evil and even if he 's a great champion is not as a person 100% us to do so @ <h> Trump to propose 
 easy to compare athletes across sports . The apples vs. oranges argument immediately jumps to the forefront of the conversation , those against the approach claiming there is no way to compare what someone does on the basketball court with what someone does on the tennis court . There 's no way to measure what someone does on the golf course with what someone does in the pool . <p> Katie Ledecky takes a sledgehammer to the fruit . <p> The most dominant female athlete in the world today , and perhaps the most dominant athlete of any gender , Ledecky put on a show at the Rio Aquatics Centre , obliterating her world record in the 400 freestyle in front of a crowd of 14,000 . Once Ledecky hit the water and bolted to her customary advantage , it was clear she had a unique performance ready to unveil . <p> In any sport , good luck finding someone as dominant and far ahead of the pack as Ledecky . <p> As the rest of the field battled for the minor medals , Ledecky fought the clock . Actually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabs , crosses and uppercuts that left her previous standard for dead . When Ledecky got done her eight rounds ( laps ) , her world record was redefined at 3:56.46 , almost two seconds quicker than the 3:58.37 she posted at the 2014 Pan on the Gold Coast of Australia . <p> Ledecky had the crowd entranced for the duration of her race , all eyes fixed on the scoreboard at each turn to gauge how far she was under world-record pace . On nearly each length , Ledecky added to the margin , making her last lap a coronation of sorts , and a guessing game at her final time . Ledecky was followed for silver by Great Britain 's Jazz Carlin ( 4:01.23 ) while American Leah Smith claimed the bronze in 4:01.92 . <p> Five weeks ago , there was little doubt that Ledecky was holding back at the United States Olympic Trials . By any standard other than her own , the 19-year-old was fast , well ahead of her domestic competition and still able to stay in the neighborhood of her best performances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to come , and what type of digits Ledecky would put on the clock . Some of the predictions ( fantasies ? ) were absurd , suggestions she 'd challenge the eight-minute barrier in the 800 freestyle out of touch with reality . <p> Nonetheless , it was common knowledge Ledecky would do something special in Rio , and would put chins on the ground . What she managed over eight laps of freestyle went down as her first fireworks display . More will come as the week progresses , but for now , relish what Ledecky pulled off in the 400 free , an event in which she narrowly missed a bid to the 2012 Olympic Games . <p> Ledecky is 4.99 seconds beyond the victorious time ( 4:01.45 ) of the late Camille Muffat at the 2012 Games , the Frenchwoman 's time an Olympic record until Ledecky got to work in the prelims with a . <p> The charge of Bruce Gemmell is 2.69 seconds clear of the next-fastest performer in event history , Italian Federica Pellegrini . At the height of the circus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.19 seconds clear of the No. 2 performer , Smith , who went 4:00.65 at the U.S. Trials . <p> Aside from boasting 10 of the times in event history , including the quickest six , Ledecky has the performances in textile . <p> Her most recent world record was the 12th global standard of her career , and her third in the 400 free . More , on the way to this latest record , Ledecky went through the 200-meter mark in 1:57.11 , which would be good for 19th in this year 's world rankings . <p> On the historical chart , Ledecky is traveling at the rate of speed of that Tim Shaw went in 1974 for the men 's world record in the 400 free . <p> " ( Going ) 3:56 was the goal I set after ( the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona ) , " Ledecky said . " So it feels really good . I 'm pumped . I was so close to breaking it ( in prelims ) . I felt good throughout . The swim was almost identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pop on the last lap . It 's pure happiness . " <p> On the global spectrum , what Serena Williams does on the tennis court and what Lydia Ko does on the golf course place them in the discussion of finest female athlete on the planet . Still , Williams and Ko are not invincible , an argument that can be made for Ledecky . Really , the most apt comparison might be with gymnast Simone Biles , the three-time world champion and overwhelming favorite for the all-around title at these Games . Like Ledecky , Biles can suffer through a subpar day or performance and still emerge on top . <p> Epic is the best way to describe the legacy Ledecky is molding . After all , consider her lead at each of the checkpoints . Only once did Ledecky watch her lead dip , Carlin making a slight move on the fifth lap before Ledecky reasserted herself . <p> Upon finishing and congratulating Smith on reaching the podium , Ledecky wore a satisfied look on her face , but there was also the sense that recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the chase for gold in the 200 free and 800 free , along with duty on the 800 freestyle relay . Smith also has work ahead in the 800 free and on the relay . She also knows she 's benefited from training with Ledecky . <p> " Normally when I swim , I like to be out front , but when I 'm next to Katie I still have really good races , " Smith said . " Even though she was so far ahead of me , I like swimming next to Katie . I mean , if I am anywhere near her , I am probably having a good race . I 've trained with her for the past month and the times she was putting up make me look like I was going to go five minutes . She is amazing and I knew she was going to get that time tonight . " <p> For Carlin , her spot on the podium continued a sterling night for British swimming , as her silver medal followed the world record of Adam Peaty in the 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history and set the Brit up for another medal chase in the 800 freestyle later in the week . <p> " I am a bit speechless . It 's not really sunk in , " Carlin said . " Four years ago , I was cheering from the stands and now I am racing , part of Team GB and I have us to do so . <h> National Sport <p> 
 businesslike and focussed as she walked out to race the two most likely to cause her bother come the final tomorrow . The American 19-year-old then turned 4th at the 50m in 27.20 , Federica Pellegrini ( SWE ) and Sarah Sjostrom ( SWE ) at the helm . <p> At 56.21 , Ledecky had the lead at half-way . The third lap was grill and grind , ahead , then Pellegrini and Ledecky on . This was a dress rehearsal for the final . <p> Those in the second semi knew what they had to do . In the first line-up , Shen Duo ( CHN ) set the pace at 1:56.03 a touch ahead of Emma McKeon ( AUS ) 1:56.29 , Charlotte Bonnet ( FRA ) , 1:56.38 and Bronte Barratt ( AUS ) 1:56.63 . <p> King wins it for clean sport ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Meili in second ; and yes Craig Lord , Ruta will get her bronze when clean sport prevails over doping ..... <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Hosszu can very possibly eclipse Gould @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On another note , Hungarian 's anthem is beautiful . <p> Lynchy August 9 , 2016 <p> Wheels have fallen off for Australia . Unless C1 &amp; C2 can win a few medals . We will be lucky to beat our 2012 tally of ten . <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Suddenly , Australia goes from slight favorite status in women 's 4 ? 100 medley to uncertain status in minor medal , a combination of : 1 . The collapse of its breaststrokers and 2 . The rise of Canadian swimmers. 3 . The steadiness of Chinese swimmers . <p> There 's a real possibility they could miss out on 4 ? 100 medley medal , which was unthinkable just a few days ago . <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Let me repeat , Hosszu can win FIVE INDIVIDUAL gold medals . <p> She must be both the most talented female swimmer ever + hardest worker ever . <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Let me repeat , Hosszu can win FIVE INDIVIDUAL gold medals . <p> She must be both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally toughest ever . <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Not out of the question , ASF . I was scoffed at when I suggested that relay would go to whatever country had the momentum of the meet but that 's the way the meet is playing out . <p> It 's certainly looking like the entire contingent is decidedly off going on performances so far . <p> As regards the showings so far ; why is that the overwhelming majority of the world 's top liners have been able to bring their A game ..... and 90% of the Australians have n't ? Some searching questions ahead for some prominent " names " AND their coaches .... or maybe more accurately " enablers " . <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Maybe Australia should just move their trials closer to the Olympics . <p> It always seem in every Olympics that several Aussie top swimmers just rested on their no.1 ranking laurels after fast trials . Moving the trials closer to the Olympics will keep them on the edge . <p> Robbos August 9 , 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband/coach to show them how hard work really does work . I am not sure what has happened . CW has been right all along ! ! ! ! <p> Relying on Campbell sisters , McEvoy , Horton to rescue us , forget about any relays ! ! ! ! <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> There is most certainly a compelling case for doing so but the mechanics are quite as simple as you may think . <p> Such a move would also necessitate a necessary adjustment to the AUS domestic competition season which currently runs through summer into early autumn ( Qld in Dec to Nationals end Mar/early Apr ) . <p> This is probably going to throw things a bit out of whack for the first year but a little short term pain for longer term gains . How this may impact commercial relationships is unknown but may there may be problems re scheduling conflicts re TV coverage as Trials will now be right in the middle of football season . <p> Then again , TV may end up being " jack " of swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbos August 9 , 2016 <p> Seebohm was swimming sub 59s in her sleep last year , she really bombed out . Larkin 's case it was Murphy who just swam better , maybe Lakin bombed out on a medal . Hoping Larkin can recover in 200 . Seebohm no chance in 200 . <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Rob , Larkin was technical " immaculate " in Kazan &amp; this clearly carried through to his World Cup outings . <p> At Trials , he was messy and its carried through here . The entire Bohl stable has been , shall we say , " less than exemplary " so far at this meet . <p> I 'm not going to gloat ; it 's not pleasant viewing for me either . The thing is that I 've witnessed the really tough years , and seen all too many " built up too high " by a " cheerleading " media and all too few actually deliver in full . <p> Even in the years of plenty ( ) ; the strike rates were well below 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doom but rather the us to do so . <h> Which Two Suicide 
 Committee has issued a plea to athletes to respect their fellow competitors in the wake of vast waves of support for Australian Mack Horton for speaking up for clean sport and as another sessions looms at the Rio Aquatics Centre at which swimmers and others are expected to show their disdain for those who fall foul of anti-doping rules by booing . <p> A plea from Mark Adams , spokesman for the International Olympic Committee , for " people should be free to compete in tranquility and not be addressed by others . We would encourage people to respect their fellow competitors " is likely to fall on the deaf ears of those who have been thumped into silence and submission on doping for far too long . <p> How about , the reply may come : " people should be free to compete in clean sport and not visited by the scourge of dopers . We would dopers to stay away . " <p> The splash made by Mack Horton 's brush with Sun Yang* has led to one Chinese state newspaper to call Australia " a British penal colony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to touch the sides given that the jest has been of the world for many a long decade . <p> Horton thumped Sun to silver in the 400m freestyle and received massive media support for saying that he had ignored the Chinese swimming in the warm-up when Sun had him to distract him because " I do n't have time or respect for drug cheats " . <p> Sun tested positive in 2014 , the same year that another Olympic champion in the 2016 final , Park , of Korea , also fell foul of anti-doping rules . <p> At a press conference for the podium placers of yesterday here in Rio this afternoon , USA bronze medallist in the 100m breaststroke , Cody Miller , backed Horton , saying : <p> " Mack Horton is a boss . Clearly there 's more that needs to be done ( about doping ) and clearly the circumstances that we 're dealing with is frustrating to a lot of athletes and unjust to a lot of athletes , especially because during this Games there will probably be people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the podium and that is wrong , and I do n't have a solution for that , but it 's wrong . ' ' <p> Meanwhile , Horton , who was congratulated on his stand by Bill Sweetenham and other coach leaders , played down the notion that he overstepped the mark on Sun when he called him " cheat " , telling The Australian : " I do n't think it is a big statement because it 's true that he 's tested positive . <p> " There 's a lot that goes on behind the scenes with drugs in sport but no athlete has really come forward and said it , so I guess I would n't really feel right if I raced at this stage against someone who has tested positive and did n't bring it up .

The noise has become louder with each passing session . Tonight , the California-based Russian banned for a steroid in 2013 but back in time tto claim the world 100m title last year at a home championships in Kazan , will race in lane 5 for the Olympic crown . <p> In Lane 4 is Lilly King , of the United States , who watched Efimova wag a " no1 " finger at cameras after her semi-final and then told her rival through a television interview : " You got caught for drug cheating , I 'm just not a fan . " <p> Efimova tested positive for meldonium five times this year and has been suspended and resinstated twice in the flip-flop of sports politics and legal muddle . <p> Sun Yang of China by Patrick B.

She Efimova has tested positive five times and she 's gotten away with it again . " <p> Yvette Kong , of Hong Kong , added : " It 's pretty hard because in my event there is someone who is absolutely a drug cheat . It makes you sick because you work so hard to get here and cheats are getting away with it .

 Hungary celebrates a New World Record after competing in the women 's 400m Individual Medley ( IM ) Final <p> Scan the entry lists from the last Olympiad in London and Katinka Hosszu 's name will appear several times , the Hungarian having embraced a full program . Yet , it is nowhere to be found in the 100 backstroke , that event not part of her competitive equation at the time . <p> It is now , and in a big way . <p> Mowing down the field over the last lap , and particularly the final 15 meters , Hosszu secured a surprising gold medal at the Rio Aquatics Center , prevailing in the 100 back in a career-best performance of 58.45 . Sixth at the turn and looking like she was out of the medal picture , Hosszu dialed up the pace in the final 50 meters to leave her foes battling for the minor medals . <p> Hosszu was .61 off the scorching first-lap pace of Australian pre-meet favorite Emily Seebohm at the turn and was a half-second shy of where the medals picture stood at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap , Hosszu gained ground , and by the time the athletes neared the wall , she was in command and further pulling away . <p> The victory followed her gold medal in the 400 individual medley from the opening night of competition by becoming the fifth-fastest performer in history . Continuing a career week , American Kathleen Baker clocked 58.75 for the silver medal , placing a hundredth of a second ahead of dual bronze medalists Fu of China and Kylie Masse of Canada . Seebohm , the reigning world , Commonwealth and Pan Pacific champion , faded from her quick start and finished seventh in 59.19 . <p> When Hosszu won the 400 individual medley in world-record time on the opening night of action , the dominance she showed suggested a huge week ahead . The 27-year-old is all but a lock in the 200 individual medley , so if she can win either the 200 backstroke or 200 butterfly , Hosszu could equal or surpass the solo efforts of East Germany 's Kristin Otto at the 1988 Games in Seoul . <p> Twenty-eight years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 100 freestyle , 100 backstroke and 100 butterfly . She also collected a pair of relay titles and remains the only female to win four individual gold medals and six overall golds in a single Olympiad . Of course , there is a taint to the Otto tale . <p> After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 , documents from the Stasi , the East German Secret Police , revealed that Otto was part of the nation 's scheme . Although she has never admitted to doping , paperwork shows Otto as being part of State Plan 14:25 , and being given the steroid Oral Turinabol . <p> Hosszu 's progression in the 100 backstroke is interesting , as she has evolved from a non-factor in the event to a supreme force . With a best of 1:04.25 through the 2008 season , Hosszu did n't bother with the event for an entire quadrennial , opting to not race it in competition . In 2013 , it became part of her program , and her best of 59.40 caught the eye . She 's been a factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top times by season over the past nine years . <p> In addition to her top times , Hosszu has also demonstrated depth and consistency . Here is a list of the number of times Hosszu has been sub-minute over the past four years . <p> 2013 : One2014 : : : Eight <p> Coming into the week , Hosszu was considered a medal contender in the 200 back , a status that grows in strength in light of her ability to win at half the distance . Add in the knowledge that her endurance is at peak level , thanks to the 400 medley win , and Hosszu does n't just look like a medal contender , but is the clear favorite for gold . <p> The runnerup at the United States Trials , Baker has put together the best meet of her career , opening with identical personal bests of 58.84 in the prelims and semifinals , followed by her silver-medal-winning time . The 19-year-old from SwimMac Carolina and California-Berkeley has certainly positioned herself for a lengthy and successful career . <p> In tying Fu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sensational week for fast-rising Canada . Masse followed a silver medal by the 400 freestyle relay and a silver medal in the 100 butterfly by 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak . With Masse checking in at 20 years ago , Canada can surely be called an upstart nation . <p> Amid the elation of the medalists , there was heartache for Seebohm . Four years ago , on the way to a silver medal behind American Missy Franklin , Seebohm went progressively slower in each round , the pressure of the moment playing a role . This time around , Seebohm did n't have her customary presence throughout the rounds . While the early speed was there , the finishing punch was not . <p> On Seebohm ; her successful Kazan showing was her biggest undoing ... And after Missy failed to qualify she probably thought gold was in the bag ... 6 swimmers under 59 in the 100back , 6 swimmers under 53 for men ... A very fast meet !

There is a very real possibility ( maybe 40-50% atm ) that NZL will kick AUS ' hindquarters when it comes to gold at these Games .... and this is a team maybe 45% the size of AUS . <p> The razor gang is likely to be out when it comes to federal funding post Rio ... state bodies are already shutting programs .

 the bravest man in the race on pace , Chad Le Clos ( RSA ) , the first clean man home ; second place to Conor Dwyer ( USA ) ; and third to World champion James Guy ( GBR ) . And then there was Sun Yang* , out front in 1:44.65 . <p> He celebrated , he shook his hands and wobbled his hands in the air . The response was muted , the boo and jeer in the air , the man who would take gold no more a winner than the sport he has tainted . <p> Meanwhile , the race was in the lanes beside him . Le Clos blasted the first 50m in 23.39 . Coming off the turn he was a bodylength ahead . Insanity ? In 50.36 at the 100m , he still held sway . But for how long ? <p> At the last turn : 1:17.71 could the tactic work ? Among clean athletes , it did . Only Sun and the tow of a positive test hidden by China until even FINA had to say " confess ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Le Clos led the first three Olympians home in 1:45.20 , American Conor Dwyer on 1:45.23 , with World champion James Guy on 1:45.49 . They might give him a bronze some fine day . <p> A muted response met Sun as he rose to claim his medal and deny others . Chinese fans cheers , a few jeers could be heard , most stayed seated and refused to even clap . <p> Le Clos and Dwyer were a lap ahead of him in the walk round and off the deck , Sun left to celebrate alone with his flag and fans . <h> Sun Goes Down On A Pyrrhic Victory <p> The contrast between the athletes , coaches and the bureaucrats was stark : as those who have fallen foul of anti-doping rules were being booed , Cornel Marculescu , the executive director of FINA , the international swimming federation , leapt out of poolside chair and hugged Sun as if he were his long-lost son . <p> " Marculescu is a very good friend of ( the ) Chinese swim team and he actually watched me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 'd watched me win the gold . I hope this friendship will last . " <p> Sun had locked horns with the Australian who took the 400m freestyle crown away from him on the first day of action . Mack Horton was splashed by Sun in a warm-up last week but had ignored the incident because he " had no time nor respect for drug cheats " . <p> That prompted one state-run newspaper to refer to Australia as " a British penal colony on the edge of civilisation " . <p> Asked if he thought Sun deserved his medal , Guy said : " I can see where Mack is coming from and I 'm great friends with Mack . Yes and no , he 's done his time but it 's over and in the past now . But he 's here you 've got to deal with it , move on , race him and that 's what I 've tried to do and unluckily I 've come fourth . " <p> Earlier in the day , an IOC spokesman had appealed for calm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free to compete in tranquility and not be addressed by others . We would encourage people to respect their fellow competitors " . <p> One leading coach told The Times last night : " How about respect for clean athletes does that count for tranquility , too ? " <p> Comment:This evening 's session and the press conferences that followed , the women 's 100m breaststroke in particular , are unprecedented . Lilly King , 19 , says ' Gatlin Go Home ' and tells the IOC that the decision is their 's and that she has no power but if she did , Gatlin , Sun , Efimova and every other athlete who had fallen foul of doping rules would not be welcome . <p> On a day when the IOC indicated that it will indeed look again at a new version of the Osaka Rule thrown out by the Court of Arbitration for Sport , the issues are coming to a head .

First swimmer home with no asterisk in tow ... <p> August 9 , 2016 <p> Happy for Chad and bitter that Yang won . <p> I 've always said that Chad is extremely talented , although his race strategies are questionable at best .

But maybe those questionable strategies are what actually made the difference and won @ to do so . <h> search of 
 the top ticket for the USA in the Rio 2016 100m backstroke battle by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Flash back a moment to the early to late 2000s . During that stretch of time , no one excelled in the backstroke events like Aaron Peirsol . The American was equally dominant in the 100 distance as he was in the 200 distance , a seven-year winning streak at one point dotting his portfolio in the longer discipline . <p> Along the way , Peirsol picked up a fistful of medals , becoming a double Olympic champion in the backstroke in 2004 , and repeating his crown in the 100 back in 2008 . There were also a pair silver medals in the 200 back , in addition to repeat golds in medley relay action . Throw in seven individual world titles and a handful of world records , and it 's not difficult to see why Peirsol has an argument for being the best his prime stroke has ever seen . <p> So , why have the first two paragraphs of this piece been spent on a guy who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who garnered the gold medal in the 100 backstroke on Monday night has long been compared to Peirsol , frequently tabbed as the individual capable of carrying the United States ' backstroke legacy for many years to come . Basically , he 's been The Chosen One . <p> Ticking the box that has seemed to be nothing more than an eventual formality , Ryan Murphy roared to Olympic gold in the 100 back , going 51.97 to just miss Peirsol 's world record of 51.94 , notched at the peak of the era . By prevailing , Murphy extended the United States ' winning streak in the event to six Olympiads , the stretch beginning with Jeff Rouse at the 1996 Games in Atlanta , and continuing with Lenny Krayzelburg in Sydney , in Athens and Beijing and Matt Grevers in London . <p> Fourth at the turn , Murphy unleashed a huge turn at the midway point , vaulting into the lead in the early stages of the return lap . From there , he retained his edge to hold off China 's Xu Jiayu ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aussie Mitch Larkin , a gold-medal contender like countrywoman Emily Seebohm in the women 's version of the event earlier in the night , was fourth in 52.43 . <p> With Plummer on the podium alongside Murphy , it marked the third straight Games in which Team USA had two men wearing medals in the 100 back . Peirsol and Grevers went gold-silver in 2008 while Grevers and Nick Thoman won gold and silver in 2012 . <p> " The adrenaline is going so hard for me right now , " Murphy said . " I do n't even feel tired just because I 'm so excited . This means everything to me . I 've been swimming for 16 years and to have it come to this is just a dream come true . " <p> As an age-group standout in Florida , Murphy was setting National Age Group standards by the time he was a 10-year-old , totaling more than 20 standards before he was ineligible to add any more . Some of the records he broke belonged to Peirsol , and when someone takes down marks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparisons and hype that come along . <p> To Murphy 's credit , he handled the buzz surrounding his name with aplomb , always following the guidance provided by his coach at the prestigious Bolles School , Sergio Lopez . Then again , why would n't Murphy have listened , given Lopez 's pedigree as a world-class performer and 1988 Olympic bronze medalist in the 200 breaststroke . <p> After Bolles , Murphy shifted his training base to the University of California-Berkeley , where he 's won NCAA championships in each of his three years in the 100 back and 200 back . Obviously , the work he 's done with Cal coach Dave Durden has clicked . It 's also helped that Murphy has been part of a highly talented training group , his backstroke partner Jacob Pebley a medal threat in the 200 distance later this week . <p> Rarely are American swimmers left ill-prepared for what they face at an Olympic Games , such is the gauntlet that must be run at the United States Trials . Still , the minefield of the 100 backstroke was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beat Grevers just to earn the right to compete in Rio de Janeiro . That test paid off . <p> If Murphy was capable of extending one American streak in a backstroke event , maybe he can pull the feat in the 200 backstroke , too . The United States has been in command of that event for the same length as the 100 back , wins provided since 1996 by , Lenny Krayzelburg , , Ryan Lochte and Tyler Clary . <p> While Murphy completed a quest that seemingly started in boyhood , Murphy took advantage of his first Olympic opportunity . A member of the past three American squads at the World Championships , Plummer was denied the chance to compete in London . The four years that followed saw the 30-year-old husband and father plug away , convinced he would get the job done in 2016 . <p> " I would have liked to swim a little bit faster . It was a little bit off my best , but just being on the podium is awesome , " Plummer said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To watch my teammate win , it 's about as good us to do so . <h> RELATED ARTICLES <h> 
 the United States of America ( USA ) prepares himself before competing in the men 's 200m Butterfly Heats <p> It all started way back in Sydney in 2000 when a baby-faced 15-year-old finished fifth in the 200 butterfly to signify big things ahead . Sixteen years later , Michael Phelps put himself in another Olympic final in the event , becoming the first individual to qualify for five finals in the same discipline . <p> Although Phelps was clipped at the finish by Hungarian Tamas Kenderesi , a 19-year-old on the rise , the American did what he needed to chase another gold . Kenderesi qualified for the final as the top seed , going 1:53.96 , with Phelps cruising into the wall in 1:54.12 . If Phelps can win the final , it will be his third gold medal and fourth medal in the event , a silver earned four years ago in London . <p> Phelps got his fifth Olympiad off to a superb start on Night Two when he delivered a sensational leg on the United States ' victorious 400 freestyle relay . That gold medal gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 200 fly would bring his total to 20 , all under the watchful eye of coach Bob Bowman . Considering Phelps went at last summer 's U.S. Nationals , there figures to be plenty more in the GOAT 's tank . <p> " Bob and I were saying ( ) would be good , " Phelps said . " I need to probably work some on going in and out of turns . But I did n't chop any walls tonight . I thought my underwaters were better than this morning . I feel a lot better than I did this morning . Getting a two-hour nap at home felt amazing . It should be a fun race tomorrow . " <p> In the final , Phelps will not only duel with , but also with longtime rival Laszlo Cseh of Hungary and South African Chad LeClos , the man who took Phelps ' title in the event in London . Cseh won the first semifinal , going 1:55.18 in what was a slower heat . Le Clos was third in Phelps ' semifinal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session in the 200 freestyle . <p> Filling out the field for the final were Japan 's Daiya Seto ( 1:55.28 ) and Masato Sakai ( 1:55.32 ) , Denmark 's Viktor Bromer ( 1:55.59 ) and Belgium 's Louis ( 1:56.03 ) . Seto won the bronze medal in the 400 individual medley on the first night of competition . <p> Video of the ready room , where the athletes convene before their races , showed Le Clos shadowboxing in close proximity to Phelps . He then further crowded the space of the 23-time Olympic medalist by shaking out his legs just inches from where Phelps was seated . During Le Clos ' boxing routine , Phelps wore a scowl , which only intensified when the South African moved closer . <p> If Phelps was indeed irritated , as the video seemed to indicate , it would n't be the first time in which Le Clos poked the tiger . While Phelps was at Nationals and Le Clos in Kazan for the World Championships last summer , Le Clos suggested that Phelps was producing swift times because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Clos called him out , Phelps bettered the South African 's world-leading time in the 100 fly . <p> It was vintage Phelps , as was his handling of another topic that has been ever-present at the Rio Games . <p> On a night when doping continued to be a major storyline of the meet , with China 's Sun Yang* winning gold in the 200 freestyle and Russia 's Yuliya taking silver in the 100 breaststroke , Phelps spoke out on drug cheats . Sun and Efimova have both been hit with doping violations , the announcement of their names eliciting jeers and boos from the athletes ' section of the stands . <p> " You 're probably going to see a lot of people speaking up more , " Phelps said .

It breaks what sport is meant to be and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be clean and sport should be on an even playing field , and I think that it 's sad that in sports today we have people who are testing positive not only once , but twice , and still having the opportunity to swim at these Games .

 his way to his third gold in five Olympic 200m butterfly finals - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Rio 2016 Olympic Games <p> Men 's 200m Butterfly Final <p> This was the rematch , the revenge indeed , we thought we would never see . Four years ago , it was Chad Le Clos ( RSA ) 1:52.94 , Michael Phelps ( USA ) , the 2004 and 2008 champion , 1:53.01 . Four Games , a record in itself : a fifth place , two golds and a silver . But no cigar at the fading of the lights . And that in the signature event that meant so much : the one that delivered his first Olympic final at 15 in Sydney ; the one that delivered his first world record a year later ; his baby . <p> The GOAT was gone . Off to his vault to count the 22 and the 18 golden ones . But it does n't take long to count to 22 and polishing stuff in between rounds of golf is n't much fun so back he came . And by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Boomer , up in the arms of mum Nicole Johnson in a seat next to the woman who 'd seen ' em all , mum Debbie Phelps . Boomer Bob . All change . Boomer Bob must have heard the roar . Maybe on a quiet day sometime when he 's older he might listen to dad describe it and think he might have heard it too . <p> In victory Phelps became the oldest Olympic swimming champion in history in a solo event . It was 1920 in Antwerp when the father of surfing Duke Kahanamoku , of Hawaii , set a world record for Olympic gold in the 100m freestyle to celebrate his 30th birthday . Phelps turned 31 on June 30 . <p> On the podium , joy , laughter , relief and tears . The job was done . Business was no longer unfinished . The new business was all about hugs and kisses and tiny fingers and toes . Nicole handed Boomer over the barrier for a hug with dad , the rub of cherubic cheek the very best feeling in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his control and grasp largely all the way . His last turn was a shocker , his finish was a desperate lunge of fury but here was a man drawing from the depths of experience , passion and the power of pain . <p> Michael Phelps by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> As he drove off the last wall , Phelps looked strong , flowing , in his element , flatlining and seemingly fatigue free . For all but the last 7m , the most decorated Olympian of all-time looked certain to claim gold No 20 , Medal No 24 . You could almost hear the heavenly removal men shouting from above : watch out , piano on the way as Phelps took what are likely to be the last few strokes of his career in his signature event . <p> But he hung on , even a jab and stab of a finish unable to uncouple him from his destiny : the prize was back with Phelps . reclaimed , returned to the home of the Baltimore Bullet . <p> Le Clos was first to have his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 , and his 30-year-old teammate , World champion Laszlo Cseh . They got set . All settled . " Stand down please " said the starter . The crowd Oooed and Ahhed . The air crackled with tension . <p> Second time , they were off and it was Le Clos who got the best start . Momentum was something else . By the first turn Phelps held sway among those heading for the top end of the result . At half-way , he had the edge on Le Clos . Would the South African shadow him once again and pounce at the last stroke ? <p> A lap later , it seemed not : Phelps powered to the last turn , mistimed it , found himself too crunched but able to use the moment for recoil , restructure on his way to a redefining moment among many defining ones . He headed for home with a second lead on and Sakai Masato , Le Clos the closest at a gap of . <p> Could the GOAT , at 31 , really hang on ? Could the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Clos have left ? Yes , Yes but not enough and not enough completed the puzzle . <p> The ebb and flow : <p> 24.85 ; 53.35 ; 1:22.68 ; 1:53.36 Phelps <p> 25.37 ; 54.35 ; ; 1:53.40 <p> 25.42 ; 54.18 ; ; 1:53.62 <p> 25.06 ; 53.87 ; 1:23.35 ; 1:54.06 Le Clos <p> Phelps looked as though he had never devoured and savoured a victory with quite as much relish . Maturity showed its face . There was no wild pumping of fists , no screaming . Just a cool , calm , collected hop on the lane rope , a stare down the pool , a smile up at the family , two arms raised steadily aloft -- and then the gesture that said it all . <p> Phelps curled his fingers and cupped them in that small motion that says : come on , bring it to me . He 'd brought it to us , all of us : the greatest of the greatest show on earth when free of the taint Phelps has asked the IOC to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal the show by ruining it . <p> More on and from Phelps after the 4x200m free <h> Poking The Tiger Do n't Try This At Home Folks <p> Michael Phelps by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> It has to be assumed that Chad Le Clos has seen at least one version of Jungle Book ; he might even have read it . There 's a tiger in it -- Shere Khan , a big predator to be treated with respect ; not a creature you want to poke a stick at . <p> Switch the ending from Tiger gets tail burnt to Tiger eats Boy and we can stretch to Michael Phelps as the personification of Kipling 's creation . <p> You would not imagine that Chad Le Clos would have wanted to poke a stick at Phelps , what with that history of Milorad Cavic in 2008-09 and way back beyond that Don Talbot in 2003 having played down suggestions that we might be looking at a particularly big beast in Phelps . <p> As Phelps poked his head through a curtain stage left and folk started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grab Ian Thorpe 's headline-grabbing power away , Talbot told Nicole Jeffery of The Australian : " Well , he has n't achieved anything yet . " <p> Phelps slapped a poster of Thorpe on his wall and stared it down every day until the job was done . It was n't personal but it was part of <p> We had n't ever really caught a glimpse of Phelp ' face at the specific moment when such murmurings made it to his ear . We have now : you could almost hear the rest of the jungle saying " No , Chad , do n't do it , " as the video of a call-room incident hit the net . <p> Phelps in the blue corner , focussed , Le Clos shadow boxing nearby after silver in the 200m free . Then the champion walked over to stare Phelps down , shake a leg in his face . That face stayed out , the eyes avoiding contact but the jaw clenched and the grimace telling . <p> The tiger was about to feast on the fuel he has long fuelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% shiny suit on and tell your sponsor Speedo to catch up like you 're gon na have to catch up with me ' . Not quite those words but that was the gist of it . What followed was a gladiatorial response in a 50&amp; LZR Racer : rippling below 50sec , he put Cavic 's taunt back in its box , the Serbian taking silver and achieving his goal of bringing to the pool something of that rumble in the jungle . <p> Talbot , the former Aussie head coach , once said that the key to greatness is longevity . There are arguments to the contrary : hard to argue that Shane Gould is not one of the greatest women swimmers we have ever seen , if not the greatest , as an example . And that leads us to the obvious conclusion about Phelps he is unique , in that he joined the elite club for folk of the calibre of Gould , Spitz , Matthes , Gross , Biondi , Egerszegi and so on , and then shot into outer orbit beyond them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sports . He had the shorter-term and the longer-term wow factor , as it turned out . <p> A year after adding 8 gold medals for an Olympic tally of 14 , retirement may have beckoned . Not for Phelps . He came back for more and made it count , every stroke of the way . Bowman played a pivotal and masterful role . And then it all grew to 18 in 22 at London 2012 . <p> Bob Bowman 's Golden Rules , out in May , were forged in the water but transcend swimming and sport this is a book for all seasons -- main image by Patrick B. Kraemer <h> The Golden Rules <p> In May this year , Bowman brought out the book that outlines the Golden Rules that made it possible . Here are some words on all of that <h> Recalling some of the finest tracks in the finest collection <p> Three favourites contemporary notes <h> 1 . 2007 : Schubert This Was The Greatest Performance Ever <p> Michael is in full flow at the mike , hunched forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , US head coach Mark Schubert to the other . Suddenly Phelps interrupts himself and the media . His attention is gone , lost in the world he revels in . <p> On the monitor at the back of a press conference room in which just 14 journalists sat to listen to the greatest performer in the pool of all time -- contrast that with the gathering of 250-plus peering in on the troubled world of Ian Thorpe -- former Baltimore training partner and US teammate Katie Hoff is on her way to making history , as he had just done himself , over 400m medley . <p> Phelps 's eyes widen , he turns to raise an eyebrow in the direction of Bowman , who smiles back like a father watching the unfolding of a smile on the face of a child thrilled by the wonder of his world . " There she goes , it 's gon na be a world record , " says Phelps . Hoff stops the clock at . Deal done . Yana Klochkova and 4:33.59 a part of the past . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a smile : " He knew exactly with a 100 to go that she was inside world record ... " . Mind on the matter , hearts beating as one . <p> Was this key to the phenomenal performance of Team USA ? Schubert gave a slightly American reply : " Coming in here we knew that the last time the United States had really lost a major international competition was here in Melbourne in 1956 . " No mention of Fukuoka 2001 , Talbot and the gold count that counts the most , one that placed Australia ahead . <p> Still , the point was made : it was n't going to happen again here in Melbourne . " All the athletes really feel a strong part of that tradition , " said Schubert . " What I 'm always impressed with is how they help each other from the time they came together on the training camp at Geelong . We saw things like Brendan Hansen giving Tara Kirk breaststroke lessons , sharing his knowledge , and we 've seen that kind of support across the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of moving in numbers : " We have tremendous chemisty from kids all over the country who just want to see each other succeed . It 's very gratifying . Its one of the best team performances we 've ever seen . " <p> How important was the spirit of helping ? " The spirit of helping is all the difference , " said Schubert . " They really feel part of each others ' success . They are so supportive if someone is disappointed ... they pick each other up . " <p> The critical moment , the watershed , the turning point was Phelps ' drubbing of Thorpe 's 200m free world record , he believed : " Once we got the ball rolling , particularly with Michael 's swim over 200m free : that 's what really lit the fire . " <p> Why , Schubert asked , was the rest of the world simply unable to keep up ? " You know , I have so much to think about making sure we 're good , I do n't think about that , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming : " We have a tremendous advantage because of the number of people who swim and are involved in swimming . " <p> Then the words that can only serve to demoralise those on a distant shore still further : " We 've felt for a number of years that we 've underachieved compared to the population we have in swimming . Right now we 're trying to focus on utilising our talent . Developing talent like Phelps and Coughlin really helps that , and helps us to continue our tradition . <p> " I truly feel we can get better from here . " <p> The low point in US swimming , he thought , had been 1988 after the boycott years had left a gap in the flow of inspiration . The 1976 Olympic men 's team that won every title barring the 200m breaststroke that went to Britain 's David Wilkie , unfolded because " we had the inspiration of Spitz four years before " . <p> Learning from mistakes has become part of the genetic make-up of Team USA . Take the Crocker mistake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Schubert . " They 're still young adults and they are all trying their best and we made a mistake and we are sure not going to blame our guys , and we going to learn from it and were going to move forward and do alot better a year from now . " <p> Yes , it deprived Phelps of a sure eighth gold medal ( sure , because the US heats time was faster than the winning Australian effort in the final ) but the moment would be lost in time , Schubert predicted . He recalled Bruce Furniss at the 1975 worlds , when in the 800m freestyle relay " he jumped by a mile " . A year later Furniss won the Olympic 200m free crown in Montreal and the US team took gold in the 800m free relay , breaking the world record twice in the process . Then " everybody forgot about it ( 1975 ) ... that 's what its ' going to be like with this , " said Schubert . <p> Did Phelps now rate alongside Mark Spitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspired the US for many years , and that is kind of been the benchmark but if you look at Michael 's performance from the standpoint of all four strokes , his relay split leading off the 400 free relay , where that would have ranked him in the 100 free , and continue through the 400 IM and the 200 ' fly , and know if he had swim the 400 free that would have been an interesting phenomenon ... " <p> " There has been nobody that 's been not just as dominant but as versatile . His performance this week was the greatest performance of all-time , " said Schubert . <p> And it included five individual golds . " I do n't really look at it by medals but by the dominance and by the records and the way he handled it from ever to event to event , " said Schubert . " I just did n't notice any weak points ... and then ( in the 100 ' fly ) when he goes to touch the wall and his head is clearly behind but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall . <p> " He can do it from behind , he can do it from the front , he can do it when its close , he can do it when its not close . " <p> Which was the best of all his efforts ? " It 's very difficult to say but when you shatter the world record in the 200 ' fly like he did and beat the field by 3sec in a world championship , that 's mind-boggling . " <p> Phelps not only inspires his team in competition , Schubert revealed . " I communicate alot with Bob , just to kind of help me with benchmarks to inspire other coaches and swimmers and he just tells me about some of the things Michael does in training which are phenomenal . Also the way he competes in-season and out of season . " <p> He cites efforts in California and the world 200m ' fly record set at Missouri a month out from Melbourne . " There 's no doubt that when you break a world record a month out when still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be see something special . <p> " We did n't know it would be this special . " <p> Had America been graced with the birth of another Phelps ? " He 's got to be out there . We are going to find him , " said Schubert . There may be some wait but only a fool would doubt the course of history . <h> 2 . EIGHT IN EIGHT AT THE <p> Patterns in the pool Beijing 2008 -- Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Michael Phelps ( USA ) ticked every box in his secret book of Olympic dreams , he told two packed press conferences after lifting his eighth gold medal in eight mornings of finals at the Water Cube . <p> " Everything was accomplished , " Phelps said . " Doing all best times , winning every race . " Seven of Phelps 's gold medals were accompanied by a world record , including three global standards . The one world record that stood was teammate Ian Crocker 's 100m butterfly standard , of 50.40 , and even then Phelps clocked an Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Milorad Cavic ( SRB ) . <p> Many did not believe that Phelps could do it . Among them was Ian Thorpe , the Australian who was no sooner linked to the debate about who and what constitutes greatness in swimming and sport generally than he found he was racing in a pool with a man ready to rewrite history as the greatest Olympian of all-time . Thorpe said that he felt the feat impossible in a particular context : it was not to undermine the American but rather to provide a clue as just how difficult what Phelps has now done actually is . The message from Thorpe was intended for the ears of those who say that Phelps is not the greatest Olympian of all-time because swimming offers " too many chances " . One twit wrote that medley was like asking runners to take a side step or a jump every so many paces in their race . There are levels of understanding and then there is stupidity . <p> Phelps was happy to prove doubters wrong , he said . " The greatest thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could n't be done , but all it takes is an imagination . That is something I have learned . " <p> Along the way to surpassing Mark Spitz 's 1972 record of seven gold at one Games , Phelps scaled the summit of Olympic achievement , matching and then surging past the record nine career gold medals of Games icons Spitz , Paavo Nurmi , Carl Lewis and Larysa Latynina . <p> Beyond eight gold medals in eight best times , Phelps had a deeper dream , he said : changing the profile of swimming in the United States , a country that has long boasted the best swim team on the planet but pays attention to the pool once every four years when the Games comes round . <p> " It 's fun , " Phelps said . " From here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as I can in the US ... 70,000 fans will be watching the relay at the ( NFL ) Ravens game tonight ( the team based in his home town of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events across the country . I have heard people say it 's crazy , they are out to dinner and swimming is on the television . For me , it 's still work in progress . " <p> Phelps started his campaign with a victory in the first final of the meet last Sunday , the 400m individual medley , and via the 200m medley , 100m and 200m butterfly , 200m freestyle and both the 4x100m and 4x200m freestyle relays concluded his campaign in time to give thanks and have Sunday lunch today . <p> Phelps dodged the bullet three times along the way : in the 4x100m freestyle relay , Phelps led off the US challenge with a personal best time of 47.51 but by the time anchor Jason Lezak dived in , French sprinter Alain Bernard was a bodylength ahead . Lezak clocked the fastest split in history 46.06 , to defeat France by 0.07sec . <p> " That kept it alive , " said coach Bob Bowman . " After the 200 IM , I started to think we could get there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , it was pretty exciting . " <p> Then came the 200m butterfly , in which water flooded into Phelps 's goggles . A " wardrobe malfunction " is how Phelps described the moment when he did n't strap up properly . A schoolboy mistake . Phelps was grateful for the 2sec comfort zone he had on the world going into the race . That meant that when the Baltimore Bullet fired off a 1:52.03 world record , falling shy of a potential to challenge the 1:51 barrier still left him celebrating gold . Then came the 0.01sec " " swim against Cavic . Phelps was asked about the " conspiracy " between him and Omega over that one . Phelps just shrugged and said : " I just looked up at the scoreboard and saw the number 1 next to my name . That 's all I know . " Next question please ! <p> If there was one swim that stood out as the most stunning , the most dominant , it would have to be the 200m freestyle , in which Phelps clocked a world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 4:03.84 . Some might say that rates even higher than the 200m free . In truth , hard to compare . More certain is the name of the unluckiest man in town : Laszlo Cseh ( HUN ) , three silvers , three fabulous European records , three reasons to wish he had not lived in a time of Phelps . <p> In all , Phelps swam 17 times over nine days , carefully measuring his effort and always coming through when it mattered . He took ice baths , two massages a day , he ate well , slept when he could and stayed focussed . The unfolding of the eight swims was like watching a classical composition . I likened it to epic compositions such as Rodrigo 's Concierto de Aranjuez . Bowman has been listening to that haunting sound " all year " , he said . <p> For Phelps , master of the race pool after Bowman played puppet-master in the training pool , said : " It has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one-hundredth to doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but an upward rollercoaster , and it has also been nothing but fun . " <p> In Athens four years ago , Phelps won six gold medals ( 100m and 200m butterfly , 200 and 400m individual medley , 4x200m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley relay ) , and two bronze ( 200m free and 4x100m free relay ) . At the age of 23 , Superfish has set a record for the total number of medals won by a male Olympian with 16 . Russian gymnast Nikolai Andrianov won 15 , including seven gold . London 2012 holds another target : Latynina won 18 career medals . <p> " Michael Phelps you ca n't put it in words what he has done here , his level of achievement is phenomenal and I do n't think it will ever be seen again , " said Australian distance great Grant Hackett , who fell a length shy of becoming the first man in history to win the same crown , the 1,500m freestyle , at three successive Games , the title going to Oussama Mellouli , the US-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven medals , but he would need a bit of luck to get the eight ... it all lined up for him , " said Hackett . <p> Leisel Jones ( AUS ) , 100m breaststroke champion , described watching Phelps all week as " the highlight of my Games " , ranking more highly than her own journey to the top of the Olympic podium at least in an out-of-body sort of sense . <p> Phelps and Bowman are now off for a well-deserved rest . But then he will be " back to making deposits " in the bank of supreme fitness and charting a course to London 2012 on mission to raise the profile of swimming in the States . <p> " There are some things I still want to do to raise the bar a bit more in the world of swimming , " Phelps said . " For me , it 's still work in progress . " That work may see him turn to events beyond his Athens and Beijing programme . He has already cut a deal with Bowman on the 400m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed an interest in sprinting . " I would say I would like to go down and start sprinting , but Bob is n't so keen on that , " said Phelps , smiling . Bowman said : " I think he thinks that 'll be less work somehow . We 'll see how keen he is on going to the sprints . There is more and different training . He 's more naturally suited to longer events . " <p> In Beijing , 47.51 and 50.58 in the 10m events , freestyle and butterfly respectively , suggest that Phelps could be lethal at sprinting . But backstroke offers great prospects and he hinted that he would loike to have another go at cracking the 200m butterfly standard this time without water in his goggles . <p> Phelps said he and Bowman would experiment , as they did at Montreal 2005 , although those world championships were his least successful world meet . " I think over the next four years , I would like to try new events and see what happens . Bob has said he wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , new training methods and stuff like that . It 's gon na be a lot of fun . " <p> Phelps will pick-up his things at Ann Arbor and head back home to Baltimore in the autumn , following Bowman back to their roots after a spree at the University of Michigan . <p> " We are going to look at some different events , mix up the training programme a little bit and do some experimenting , " Bowman said . " We have plenty of time and we will look at reinventing ourselves . We have accomplished this set of goals and I would dare to venture to say we are not going to do it again , at least not like this . We will start coming up with some goals that excite him and start working towards them . " <p> First Phelps will sit still : " It 's something I have n't done for a long time , " he said . " I am looking forward to seeing friends , hanging out and sitting down . Not moving . Bob has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week was about making withdrawals . I guess I 've gotten through every penny . Now it 's time to start making deposits again . " <p> When he does so , he will have a particular drive in mind : " I do n't want this sport to be an every four year sport , " he said . " We get lots of attention every four years , but for the rest of that time there is really not a lot of attention . We swim every single day , there is never really an off-season . I just want more people to get involved in the sport and I think it will happen in the next four years . " <p> First stop : Rome 2009 . The pressure is on . " My mom has told me I have to make the ( US ) team so she can go to Rome , " said Phelps . You can be certain that he 'll deliver the ticket . <h> 3 . Beyond Beijing London Rising .... <p> And for my next trick ? Time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bowman greets Michael Phelps home to Baltimore after a break that could stretch until February 1 next year . Unlikely Phelps ca n't sit still that long , the coach believes . <p> Besides , both mentor and mother of the winner of eight gold medals want a trip to Rome next summer . Michael is their ticket , so the pressure 's on . Sort of . " It 'll be like his welcome back meet , a little like Montreal ( 2005 ) , " said Bowman in his last interview before leaving Beijing . <p> Speaking at the Casa Italia to SwimNews The Times and The Australian , Bowman revealed a little of what we can expect from Phelps : " He will definitely be swimming backstroke and he 's going to branch out into the sprint events as well . You 'll see him do breaststroke but not at this Olympic sort of level . In national events . " One thing he wo n't be doing : chasing Thorpey 's 400m free record . But the 200m butterfly is in for a bashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water in the 200m butterfly and left him struggling to find best form . The result was still a world record of 1:52.03 . But Bowman says that might have been " in the 1:50s and if he takes a shot at it on its own beyond the multi-event programme it could be 1:49 . " Imagine that . <p> Not long after Bowman spoke at the Casa Italia , Phelps was being mobbed by Chinese fans and tracked by the constant craving of cameras over at the China Club , the very beautiful , most Chinese temporary home of one of his sponsors , Omega . As stylish as their watches . Clockwork luxury . The perfect image for a swimming who times things to perfection . The offers are flooding in and the folk at Octagon , the agent for Phelps and Bowman , will need more than eight arms to cope . They are talking Tiger Woods . No surprise . <p> None either when Bowman talks of keeping the 100m butterfly on the list of targets 50.58 in Beijing but Bowman believes a sub-50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400m medley : coach will honour the deal he struck with his charge , although there would be room for improvement even on a 4:03.84 , he said : " When he did his breaststroke to freestyle turn , he did no dolphin kicks , so there was a flaw there , it could have been better . If he did the dolphin kicks he would have been another body-length ahead . " <p> It is what you might expect of a psychology graduate and deep thinker , who helped to build the perfect competitive beast of the pool since Michael was 11 . A Machiavellian grin breaking out on his face , Bowman , revealed the terrible truth : " At the Melbourne World Cup in 2003 I stepped on his goggles deliberately . He said ' hey , someone stepped on my goggles ' . I said ' Oh ... well , you 're just gon na have to go without them ' . " <p> When the scrawny , gangly boy raced at his first national junior meet in the United State , Bowman noticed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the blocks . " I saw them sitting in our team area , I could have taken the goggles to him but I decided to keep them and see what he could do , " Bowman said . " So he swam and won the race without the goggles just like he did here in Beijing in the ( 200 ) butterfly when his goggles filled with water . " <p> Bowman added : " I 've always tried to find ways to give him adversity in either meets or practice and have him overcome it , " said the coach . He took Phelps , 14 , to an evening competition and asked the driver to turn up late on purpose . " That way there was no dinner he had to deal with it , " said Bowman with a chuckle . <p> " He 's used to handling pressure situations in training , where that pressure comes from me , " Bowman said . " We have often put him in a situation where practice is not over until he achieves a certain time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do them over . " <p> Bowman learned some of his tricks and tactics from former Britain performance director Bill Sweetenham . " I was at the AIS when Bill was there training a squad of juniors . After one session , they all complained that the water in the water fountain was too hot . So the next day , there was no water fountain . " It had been removed . <p> In Phelps , Bowman found the raw materials that he had been looking for at the North Baltimore Swim Club . " He was so fast , he had to swim with older swimmers ... but by the end of the practice , and at the most difficult part of the session , I saw a little cap moving up forward to the front of the line with each repeat swim . It was so remarkable , I 'd never seen anything like it and when I went home that night I could n't sleep I was so excited , but of course I did n't tell him that . " <p> Instead , Bowman piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , Phelps leapt out of the water and started throwing water at some of the girls watching nearby . " I said ' you should be very tired , that 's the hardest practice you 've ever done ' , " Bowman recalled . " I 'll never forget , he looked me straight in the eye and said ' I do n't get tired ' , so I made that my life goal to see if I could accomplish that . " <p> He took Phelps to junior meets where " he would race three times in the morning , three in the afternoon and then I 'd say to him , ' that 's not quite right , you could go again ' . Every time he got out and said ' I 'm tired ' , I said ' no , no , look , let 's just try that again , go on now ' , and every time he 'd get back in and go again . " <p> He also had a built-in clock . Bowman asked him to write down the times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was just 11 but six months later he swam those exact times , to the one-hundredth of a second , " Bowman recalled . " I do n't know how that 's possible but it 's true . He always had a very good sense of finding where he wants to go and how to go there . " As we discovered at the Water Cube . <p> Bowman 's role has been pivotal , critical even : 12 years of emotional , mental and physical preparation of a kind that few could have withstood . Time swims of 10km and hour-long sessions chucking a medicine ball back and forth have combined with Phelps 's ability to disappear to a place where he needs to be to get the return he seeks . <p> Bowman noted that Phelps " can focus like no other athlete " . The example he gave also explained an incident that was reported as " Phelps stares down Cavic " . He did no such thing , it turns out . " If you were watching the 100m butterfly final , the Serbian swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it looked like they were trying to stare each other down . After the race I asked Michael if that was what he was doing , and he said ' I did n't even know he was there ' . That 's how focused Michael is on what he wants to do . " <p> There are moments when things do not go according to plan , of course . The 200m butterfly and the goggles was one . And there are moments that need Bowman to step in and coach hand son in the middle of a big meet . The only time that happened in Beijing was on the day that Phelps faced the 200m medley job done but the swimmer returned " totally drained " for the first time that week and the 100m butterfly semi-final . " I had to talk him through that . He was really tired at that point . I was n't sure how it was going to go , " said Bowman . <p> Phelps put in a fantastic second 50m and a day later stood up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven . " The biggest moment of relief for me was after the 100m butterfly final . I 'd myself convinced that seven was the number . It was n't until the last 15m butterfly that I thought maybe it eight would happen . One thing Michael does better than anyone else is to use the right amount of emotional energy for every race he stands up for . " <p> When Phelps returns from London 2012 promos , golf in the Algarve , the Superbowl and a 101 other commitments and catch-ups of varied kinds , Octagon will be ready with a plan that will have to leave swimming at the top of the heap . Bowman explained : " They know that without the swimming there 's no more money , that 's the key to Michael 's success . " And success is what he would seek if he stays in the game . " It would be nice to have Michael retire on top . It 's important to me that he does n't peter out . " <p> And with that , Bowman was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting up shop and waiting for the return of a man who this time round starts the season , whenever that may be , as the greatest Olympian in history , a man who transcends his sport . The same might well be said of Bowman . <p> Phelps is simply the greatest of all time . we are incredibly privileged to witness these epic moments in our time ... <p> August 10 , 2016 <p> I heard McEvoy is sick . Is that true ? <p> But yeah , if healthy mcevoy swum in that 4 ? 200 instead of Daniel Smith , Australia would have gotten silver . <p> August 10 , 2016 <p> Reports are that McEvoy has a cold . Was a little sniffly in his post race interview after 100 semis . If this is the case , then I understand the risk management decision behind the ' call ' . <p> When you 're under the weather , your recovery is going to be compromised . He already has a 100 semi in that session which he may/may not have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tank in the relay .... what 's the price tag going to be with regards to his 100 final tomorrow night ? <p> Put him into that relay and yes , they may have snagged a medal ; maybe silver but more likely bronze . Remember his track record in this relay ... he has NEVER split sub 1.46 and tends to " die hard " . You potentially pick up a minor medal here but is the price of a significant hit to his chances of gold in the 100 worth paying ? <p> Whether it was the right choice , we may need to wait until tomorrow night but I do understand the reasoning behind it <p> August 10 , 2016 <p> The omission of Jack Conger from the American team in the was unprincipled in my opinion . He was third at trials ; he swam the fastest split in the preliminaries . He deserved it . But he was sacrificed to accommodate Phelps and Lochte . Obviously Bob Bowman thinks protecting their legacy overrides merit and fairness . Many would say that doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Phelps legend and vindicates the decision . I certainly give Phelps credit for a remarkable performance . But I still think Conger was wrongfully denied his opportunity . The 1.46 split by Lochte underlines it . <p> Is Cameron McEvoy not quite at his best here ? Even a mediocre low 1.46 split would have given Australia the silver if he had us to do so .@@13775851 <h> Chinese tourist mistakenly 
 up on a half-century since she fought through the thin air of Mexico City to register the first and only -- freestyle Triple Crown in Olympic history . Only 16 years old , Debbie Meyer was a standard setter at the 1968 Olympic Games , beating back asthma in conditions hardly conducive to someone with her disorder . <p> But as Meyer left what ended up being her only Games , there had to be a belief her feat would be matched somewhere along the way . With the Olympic program growing , more opportunities would be available for an athlete with the right combination of speed and endurance . <p> It took 48 years . <p> Completing the most-challenging leg of her journey into the record book , Katie Ledecky secured the second jewel of the Triple Crown on Tuesday night , winning the 200 freestyle in 1:53.73 . It was supposed to be a difficult ask of the 19-year-old , and that scenario indeed unfolded as Sweden 's Sarah Sjostrom claimed the silver medal in 1:54.08 , with Australian Emma McKeon taking the bronze in 1:54.92 . Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains for Ledecky to complete the Triple Crown is defense of her gold medal in the 800 freestyle , the event which as the clich ? goes launched her into stardom . Only disaster will keep Ledecky from the top of the podium , the gap over her closest challengers upwards of 10 seconds . <p> The margin of victory in the 200 free may not be an overwhelming figure , but for the fact Ledecky is a former long-distance ace transformed into an all-distance machine , it adds another chapter to her legacy . On top of the sport in four freestyle events at last summer 's World Championships in Kazan , and likely three in Rio , her foes must be posing questions to themselves : Is she beatable ? How long can she keep this up ? <p> Fifth at the first turn , Ledecky started to impose herself on the second lap , moving up to second behind McKeon , with Sjostrom in third , but .43 behind Ledecky . To her credit , and an example of her resolve , the Swede actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .05 on the finishing lap . The early deficit , though , was too much to overcome . Accustomed to routing the competition , Ledecky proved she has a knack for squeezing out a tight decision , too . <p> " That hurt pretty badly , " Ledecky said . " It 's the closest I 've come to throwing up at the end of a race . I was just glad to get my hand on the wall first . It was a stressful race and I feel good now it 's over . I took it out pretty fast and forced everyone ( to press ) , and once I was ahead , I was not going to let it out of my hands . " <p> The manners in which Ledecky 's career and skill set can be analyzed are numerous . As her world records and global crowns in the distance events attest , no one in history has possessed her endurance and ability to maintain such a high rate of speed in a multi-lap discipline . At the same time , she has added an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed an impossible complement for someone of a distance background . No , she 'll never carry the swiftness of an Aussie Campbell sister , but she 'll be much closer to the sprinters ' bests than they 'll be to her distance exploits . <p> The comparison of freestyle range with the legendary Shane Gould has circulated for a couple of years now , the Australian once the simultaneous world-record holder in every freestyle distance from the 100 through the 1500 . That Ledecky for the second year in a row is the global champion in the 200 free , 400 free and 800 free is the closest thing we 'll see to Gould in this age of specialty and enhanced depth . Really , it 's a breathtaking achievement . <p> More , Ledecky went even shorter in revealing her versatility , handling a leg on the 400 freestyle relay that captured the silver medal on the opening night of the meet . Twice , in prelims and finals , Ledecky posted a sub-53 split in a 100 freestyle , the efforts proving her range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements through articles , videos and television , Ledecky 's exploits would be deemed incomprehensible . <p> When Ledecky emerged as a worldwide force as a 15-year-old in 2012 , her makeup was one of a distance phenom . Of course , she captured the Olympic title in the 800 free in London , and just missed making the Team USA roster in the 400 free . Down an event in length , Ledecky owned a best of 1:58.66 in the 200 free , a mark that sat just 55th in the world rankings . <p> In 2013 , the speed started to show . She was a best of 1:56.32 during that season , produced on the leadoff leg of the United States ' victorious 800 freestyle relay at the World Championships in Barcelona . By the next year , she was at 1:55.16 , and maintained that identical mark in 2015 , the year which produced a world title and was part of her sweep in Kazan . <p> The Olympic campaign has witnessed another jump in levels , both in singular speed and consistency . Ledecky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cracked the 1:55 barrier on six occasions , a seventh time ( 1:55.01 ) just shy of visiting . She makes a difficult chore seem simple . Given Ledecky 's margin of error in the 800 free , catching Meyer is her next task . <p> " I am really excited by it , " she said of the Triple Crown . " I have the ( 800 free ) relay ( on Wednesday ) and that 's my main focus . Taking it one event at a time . I 'll have the morning off . I am excited , and swimming really good . Hopefully , I can do something really great in the 800 as well . " <p> In the case of Sjostrom , who took gold in the 100 butterfly earlier in the week , her effort was extraordinary , and she emerged as -- perhaps -- the only woman currently in the sport capable of giving Ledecky any sort of trouble . The fourth-fastest performer in history , Sjostrom proved she 's going to be a danger in the upcoming events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 freestyle and it was my best time , so I could n't be happier , " Sjostrom said . " Of course , Ledecky is one of a kind , so it feels like a gold to me that I 'm after her . " <p> Asked by the media if she was the future of American swimming , Ledecky had the perfect response . <h> Comments <p> I 'm a huge fan of Shane Gould and everyone here knows that . But I have to say that Ledecky is now the Greatest Female Freestyler of All Time . <p> Her major medals , her records and her longevity seal this title for me . <p> August 10 , 2016 <p> : Sjostrom gave herself too much to do on the way home and Ledecky realistically was n't going to weaken . <p> Hats off to McKeon who , unlike in the 100fly , went out and gave herself a chance . Her talent is unquestioned . Hopefully , now this will give her the self belief that she can not only compete with the elite but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice that he 's certainly still around and will take some beating . Chalmers mental outlook certainly stands out as a contrast to so many of his team mates with their " the weight of the world is upon me " air . <p> McEvoy was better than his heat but certainly not stamping his ownership on the event . &amp; Dressell will clearly be thereabouts . Damned if I know who 's going to win ! <p> In this race , Emma showed a bit of confidence attacking the race from the start . She completely did n't do that in 100 fly , which is especially weird considering she has the sprint chop and the endurance to make it home . <p> I hope her renewed confidence can make her go bang in the w4x100 medley . Australia needs her to do that just to secure a minor medal . <p> August 10 , 2016 <p> Chalmers ' physique looks a lot more defined than he was during trials . That 47.8 is the second Junior world record he broke today . I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly is n for a medal , but not sure if he can swim much faster tomorrow . <p> ASF , 100% concur re McKeon 's 200 . She just did n't give herself a chance in that final . I really do hope that , should she continue post Rio , this DOES give her some lasting self belief . Maybe she can carry this through to the medley relay . <p> Barratt has always been a perpetual enigma .... and source of frustration due to her inconsistency . Major cudos for that PB . Du n no how they 're going to structure that 4 ? 200 but if both she &amp; McKeon can carry through this form , it will at least give the others some chance of holding onto a podium .... who knows , it may even lift them ! <p> SMOC was excellent but she was never really threatening Hosszu . Care to bet against a 4th gold in the 200 back ? <p> The Americans had the marked down as " one of theirs " coming into the meet . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duo but the Japanese will certainly make them work hard as will Willis . Koch has been less impressive . <p> Finally , Maddie Groves ! ! There has been zero doubt over the past 2 years that she can swim the times needed to be " thereabouts " internationally ; but rather her capacity to put it together under pressure . <p> What she may or may not do tomorrow night , we can not know but at least she has been going out there and giving herself a chance . As someone who 's been a Groves sceptic ; I can only salute her for doing so and hope this gives her the self belief to go on from this <p> : Phelps had to dig deep for that one ! Both Cseh &amp; LeClos will be disappointed ; maybe the latter was paying for his 200free exploits . In Kenderesi , one suspects we have the future of this event <p> : Another episode in the Phelps farewell series . The US were n't earthshatteringly stupendous ... but they did n't need to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business . <p> McEvoy 's omission ? Perhaps it cost a medal ; maybe silver but more likely silver given his propensity to " die hard " in this relay . However , given he was " under the weather " , his recovery will be compromised and his " emptying the tank " with an additional major effort tonight would clearly compromise his chances in tomorrow night ; s 100 . <p> August 10 , 2016 <p> A list of world champions who have been totally shut out from the podium in their individual events : <p> Emily Seebohm Mitch Larkin Zetao James Guy Laszlo Cseh <p> Did forget any other name ? <p> This is very very unlikely . But that 's what Olympics usually are : past achievements mean nothing , and very cruel awakening at that . <p> Robbos August 10 , 2016 <p> CW , about McEvoy , 100% correct , being under the weather &amp; not emptying the tank .

 to predict beyond the notion that anyong could have won . There was not a single man in the final less capable of winning the crown than the next . There were those more capable in terms of the titles and medals win , the things proven , the statements made about the prospects of a sub-2:07 . <p> Outcome often takes the runes , rips them to shreds , throws them into the air , history written only when the pieces land in their new form . So it proved in the 100m freestyle final in Rio tonight as Australia got its first champion since 1968 , the name ... Kyle Chalmers . <p> And so , too , it was that Kazakstan found a hero in Dimitry Balandin , his country 's first Olympic swimming champion and the first from all countries for twenty years to pan gold from lane 8 . <p> Kazakstan has known swimming podium placers before back in the days of the Soviet Union but in the colours of his modern country he writes new history , adds to that book of outside Olympic smokers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in the 1500m freestyle at Atlanta 1996 , and adds a line in swimming history as the winner who won by the highest of margins . <p> They would drink long into the night back home , Balandin reckoned , while his face lit up like a Christmas tree at the race press conference when a reporter passed on a message from the Sports Ministry to offer him the official role of " Goodwill Ambassador " to Kazakhstan . <p> The job comes with pride , money and not a little power to decide things . turned to right and left and said immediately that there was a great home meet that he 'd like to invite both Josh Prenot ( USA ) , the silver medallist , and Anton Chupkov ( RUS ) , the bronze medallist , to . <h> The Tightest Squeeze <p> If London 2012 produced the tightest win in history when Hungarian Daniel Gyurta pipped Britain 's Michael Jamieson by 0.15sec , then Rio 2016 established a new standard in squeeze . And that in a race without either of the top two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rounds , Jamieson out in domestic trials . <p> Balandin and his 2:07.46 were followed home by Josh Prenot ( USA ) and 2:07.53 , the battle for bronze going to Anton Chupkov ( RUS ) in 2:07.70 , the next three home within , the entire final all done just 0.54 back from bronze . <p> Dmitriy Balandin by PBK <p> Yasuhiro Koseki ( JPN ) set a sharp pace to the half-way mark , turning in 1:00.86 , Balandin the only other man inside 1:02 , at 1:01.39 . A lap later , the picture was the same but the rest were edging up stroke by stroke . Koseki paid a toll down the last lap as Balandin rolled on and Prenot led the charge among the rest . If his would be a challenge a clap of the hand too late , the last prize in the race went to Chupkov after he came back from last to bronze at the touch . <p> The ebb and flow is worth running in full , so tight the race , so much in a line the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge who was in on the podium party and who got locked out . All will carry thoughts of ' if only ' , the man highest on the scale of frustration Andrew Willis ( GBR ) , 0.08sec shy of the podium after stepping up on the clock and from 8th to 4th between Games home and abroad . <p> As Willis 's teammate Hannah Miley said after her fourth place by a fingernail in the 400m medley on the first day of action : " Sport is brutal . " Willis noted that " it does n't make any difference if you 're fourth or eighth " .

Actually , it 's history , because it 's the first medal in swimming for Kazakhstan and I 'm very happy that I 'm the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by drinking the night away . Balandin then gave a sober answer to the question of winning from lane 8 and explained how two rivals in the race had worked to get the best for each other : <p> " There is a positive and a negative side to swimming in the end lane .

We were working towards this . We did everything we could and finally we achieved it . " <p> Had it sunk in ? He was hero at home in Kazakhstan : <p> " Not right now . I 'm just really tired .

 Australia jubilates after winning in the men 's 100m Freestyle Final <p> His birth certificate says he 's only an 18-year-old , and teenage boys strictly from a physical standpoint are not expected to possess overwhelming strength . Rather , muscle is supposed to come later , and be built over time . Well , someone never had this discussion with , the Australian youngster now a sporting hero in his homeland . <p> Jumping into the future , where vast success has long been predicted , Chalmers became the sprinter of the current moment by upending a slightly more experienced field for the gold medal in the 100 freestyle . It was n't a worst-to-first performance , but it was close , as Chalmers rallied from seventh place at the turn to end his nation 's almost half-century Olympic drought in the event . <p> Powering through the water in the final strokes , and reeling in reigning Olympic champion Nathan Adrian of the United States , Chalmers earned the right to stand on top of the podium with a World Junior Record of 47.58 . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still young enough to qualify for junior-level standards . <p> Chalmers was n't the only surprise in the much-anticipated race as Belgium 's Peter Timmers ( 47.80 ) took the silver medal to become his country 's first Olympic medalist in the sport since Fred captured the gold medal in the 100 breaststroke at the 1996 Games in Atlanta . Adrian picked up the silver in 47.85 , .03 ahead of Canadian Santo Condorelli . The favorite and world leader heading into competition , Aussie Cameron McEvoy was seventh in 48.12 . <p> " At the moment , it 's still sinking in for me that I 've actually won , " Chalmers said . " So it 's very exciting . It 's hard being in this situation because I 've been ( racing ) with a teammate ( McEvoy ) who 's looked after me all week and roomed with me . I do n't want to celebrate too much because I know it would have been really hard for him tonight , but I 'm sure toward the end of the week I 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dynamics at work in what has long been considered the sport 's showcase event , champions through the years including Duke Kahanamoku , Johnny Weissmuller , Mark Spitz , Alex Popov and Pieter van den Hoogenband among others . Some of the storylines : <p> Adrian could have easily been in the stands or at the Olympic Village watching the final on television , fortune winding up on his side . In prelims , Adrian put together a performance which ended up sneaking the reigning champion into the next round as the last of the 16 semifinalists . <p> McEvoy and Chalmers were charged with the task of returning the event to Australian hands after a 48-year hiatus , the last Aussie to rule the event , doing so in 1968 . Wenden 's triumph capped an era in which Australia won the 100 free in three out of four Games , Jon Henricks ( 1956 ) and John Devitt ( 1960 ) titlists in Melbourne and Rome , respectively . <p> Chalmers , on the sport 's worldwide radar for several years after numerous youth achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was unavoidable , and what happens when you break youth records of someone as venerable as Ian Thorpe . <p> Just a handful of years after racing as club teammates with the high-powered Bolles Sharks , American Caeleb Dressel and squared off with Olympic hardware on the line . Their other past teammates , Ryan Murphy and Joseph Schooling , are in Rio , too -- Murphy the champion of the 100 backstroke and Schooling targeting a medal in the upcoming 100 butterfly . <p> Home favorite Marcelo Chierighini , racing in Lane Eight and a longshot for a medal , nonetheless brought an extra element of pop to the race , thanks to the raucous ovation he received from the crowd of 14,000 . <p> Of all the possibilities , the night belonged to Chalmers . <p> Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 200 pounds , it 's not like Chalmers is a small bloke . Generally , he 's a big boy . But his build is not of the chiseled foes he sees on the deck , and his strength is not yet near what it likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? The only thing that counts is his ability to move through water quickly , and come through in a pressurized situation . <p> His start a weakness , Chalmers trailed the field from the start and made the turn for home in seventh place , .47 back of Adrian . As his opposition started to fight fatigue , Chalmers was feeling good , evident in the 24.44 split he delivered over the final lap . The next-quickest return trip was the 24.84 of Timmers , an eon back for a sprint . <p> The victory was the fulfillment earlier than anticipated of lofty prospects for Chalmers , the son of Brett Chalmers , a former player in the Australian Football League . In his early teens , Chalmers was compared frequently to Thorpe , in the pantheon of freestylers . Now , they have something in common : They 're each Olympic champions . And Australia is no longer waiting for the heir to Wenden . <p> " I actually had no idea about that to be honest with you , " Chalmers said of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow swimming too much . I kind of stay away and follow basketball and soccer and football . I know that we 've been beaten a few times . Going in fastest and being beaten . So I wanted to do it for myself and my family and my country and all my friends back home . " <p> Going into Rio with a world-leading time of 47.04 , also the fastest textile mark in history , McEvoy was supposed to be the Aussie who linked to the days of Wenden . But McEvoy never found his usual speed through the rounds , although he showed a great deal of class following the race . As Chalmers waited for McEvoy on the deck ( an impressive gesture of its own ) , McEvoy joined his younger teammate , raised his hand in victory and pointed , as if to say : " Here 's the man . " <p> By not medaling , it brought into further question a decision of the Aussie coaching staff . The night prior to the final of the 100 free , the presumptive thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay . After all , he was the co-champion of the 200 free at the Aussie Trials . But the Dolphins ' staff decided to go without him , figuring less wear on the body would play to his advantage in his individual pursuit . It evolved that Australia just missed the podium in the relay , placing fourth , where McEvoy 's presence would have meant a two-second drop and a silver medal , bronze at worst . <p> Reaching the medals stand for the second consecutive Games made Adrian the first to accomplish the feat since van den Hoogenband won back-to-back titles in 2000 and 2004 . A soft-spoken type , Adrian followed his Olympic triumph by grabbing the bronze medal at the 2013 World Championships . In the two years that followed , cracking the 48-second barrier did n't happen . There were enough clockings in the book , but nothing to overwhelm . In the Olympic year , Adrian put it together . <p> " I feel great about getting another medal , " he said . " No doubt . To be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights there . I do n't know , it 's what you work for . It would be great to have gold , but in this day and age , the 100 freestyle is maybe the most fickle event out there . " <p> Timmers was another guy to fit the pieces into place at the best time . Coached by the Netherlands ' Ronald , he once trained in the same pool in Eindhoven where van den Hoogenband did his work and now carries his name . now mentors Timmers in Antwerp , where an Olympic medal will be brought . Timmers ' time is .04 faster than the best of van den Hoogenband , a goal and his charge chased . <p> " I was very surprised , " Timmers said . " It 's incredible . I knew I had a small chance to go for the medals and this is just incredible to get a silver medal . It 's unbelievable . I was mentally very strong today and I think that made a big difference against the rest . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I always said this would have to be my best race ever and I did it .

All the focus was on McEvoy and Adrian . Great comeback by the Aussies on day 5 . Fingers crossed for Cate tomorrow . <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> Actually this win by Chalmers may be a boon for C1 . No longer will she have the added pressure of having to " rescue the meet " for the team who should be on an upward kick with 2 silvers and one gold on the us to do so .@@13790640 <h> Russia killed Olympic 
 the Olympic program is concerned , the women 's 800 freestyle relay is still in its infancy . It was only added in 1996 , making its debut at the Atlanta Games . And when the event capped the fifth night of Olympic action at the Rio Aquatics Centre , it was n't surprising to see which country was playing the role of babysitter . <p> For the second straight Games and fifth time in the six Olympiads the event has been contested , the United States came away with the gold medal . The quartet of Allison Schmitt , Leah Smith , Maya DiRado and Katie Ledecky combined for a time of 7:43.03 , 1.84 seconds clear of silver medalist Australia ( 7:44.87 ) . The bronze medal went to Canada ( ) , its roll continuing . The only time Team USA has n't won the event was 2008 in Beijing , when it picked up bronze . <p> The United States has now been successful in three of four relay attempts in Rio , the odds strong the meet will end with a 5-for-6 showing . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medals , eight of which are gold . The next-closest pursuer is Australia with seven medals , three of them golden . Obviously , any questions about the firepower of this squad have been emphatically answered . <p> Although the United States sat in second place during each of the first three legs , the outcome was never really in doubt . Schmitt , Smith and DiRado were never far off the pace and with Ledecky on the end , the Americans had the ultimate weapon . <p> Schmitt covered the opening leg in 1:56.21 , giving way to Smith and a split of 1:56.69 . Not initially expected to be part of the relay , DiRado got the call between sessions , the results of prelims indicating she would be the faster choice over Missy Franklin or . DiRado got the job done , covering her four laps in 1:56.39 and putting Ledecky in position to bring home the gold . <p> Ledecky went into the water staring at a .89 deficit and racing against Australia 's Tamsin Cook . Only 75 meters into her leg , Ledecky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's margin of victory of 1.84 was the second-biggest gap in event history . Ledecky 's split was 1:53.74 , easily the fastest in the field . <p> " That was so much fun , " Ledecky said . " To be in a relay with those three girls , they are three of my best friends in the sport and we just had so much fun with it . We were just smiling the whole time before , during and after and we knew we could get the job done . " <p> Australia 's silver medal was aided by Emma McKeon 's second leg of 1:54.64 , the second-fastest split . Meanwhile , Canada 's bronze was punctuated by Penny Oleksiak 's anchor of 1:54.94 , the 16-year-old having gone 52.72 for a World Junior Record in the semifinals of the 100 freestyle earlier in the session . <p> The gold was Ledecky 's third of the meet , to go along with a silver from the 400 free relay . She 'll have the chance to win another in the 800 freestyle , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 10 seconds over her rivals . That victory ( yes , it 's going to happen ) for the 19-year-old will also put her in the Triple Crown Club with Debbie Meyer , the Americans the only winners of three freestyle events at a single Games . <p> A member of the past three U.S. 800 free relays , Schmitt completed a feel-good year . While dealing with depression after collecting five medals from the 2012 Games in London , Schmitt missed the squads bound for the World Championships in both 2013 and 2015 . Along the way , though , she started to get a handle on her disorder and was outspoken about the condition in an attempt to help others . <p> Although she is not in the form that made her a star of the last Olympiad , Schmitt showed tremendous leadership and resolve in the way she performed in her lone event of these Games . Before she contributed in the final , Schmitt earned her place on the evening unit with a leadoff leg of 1:55.95 in prelims . <p> Since going without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has won at least one on each of the past four evenings . The momentum within the team is certainly flowing and unlikely to end as numerous victory opportunities await . As the **28;322;TOOLONG foursome stood on the podium for the playing of the Star Spangled Banner played , cheers rang out . There 's no doubt experience and youth have come together . <p> " I was prepared for being ahead , for being behind , but I knew that Maya put me in the right spot to get out there and I knew I just had to kind of pace myself and not jump on it too fast , too early , " Ledecky said . " I think the most fun part of it is that each day seems like it gets more fun . There is just something unique and special about each day with the team and it 's just crazy being part of it . I could n't have had more fun tonight . " <p> For Oleksiak , she 'll be able to look back at the week as one that changed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the opportunity to secure another in the final of the 100 free and on the 400 medley relay . <h> Comments <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> There was so much talk pre meet about the USA obliterating the WR in this one . Tonight clearly demonstrated the reality that WRs rarely progress exactly according to script and never as an inevitability . One can have all the requisite component parts present but having them all firing or performing at the requisite level is far rarer . <p> What we saw competence and stability from the front three and Ledecky sealing the deal rather than a or Franklin " smoking it " with Ledecky taking it into the stratosphere . <p> This may be controversial to some but do not be surprised if we see CAN on the 2nd step of the podium next year given the potential trajectories of Oleksiak , Ruck &amp; McLean . AUS may not roll over without a fight but they 're needing to locate a replacement for Barratt fairly quickly ! <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> The collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE swimming story in the past month . <p> I really do n't understand how one extra year of full time training has successfully made her significantly slower across all events . <p> It does n't seem she has had any existential personal crisis a la Allison Schmitt circa 2013 . She has also been injury free . She has been living and training at altitude . She has had fabulous commercial activities guaranteeing good income . <p> Maybe the type of her current training ( technique , conditioning ) does n't suit her post-puberty body shape ? <p> Anyway , it is sad not to see her on the podium so far , and I am not too optimistic she 'll medal in 200 back either . <p> Eugene Chc August 11 , 2016 <p> , looks like Hosszu and Dirado top favorites in 200 back . <p> one of the best options for Missy would return to Teri , but apparently their parting was not the best . <p> if Schmitz trained so as before then all it would be not bad , but he decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Based on current form and momentum , It 's Hosszu vs . in 200 back , with perhaps Hocking for bronze . <p> Eugene Chc August 11 , 2016 <p> This will be great for Dirado if she wins individual gold in her last race . <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> Imagine if Dirado wins 200 back gold , she would have won a complete set of Olympics individual medals . <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> The only way i can see Maya winning the 200 backstroke is due to Hosszu " fatiguing " as Nicole would so gracefully put it . <p> She has had a heavy program and the signs of being drained are slowly creeping forward . Same goes for Hagino . <p> Phelps is going to smash that 200 IM tomorrow . <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> I really hope Katie swims the anchor on the 4 ? 100 relay . She deserves it . That will take her to 6 Medals . Wow <p> August 11 , 2016 <p> Yeah , I think it 's Hosszu 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hardly obliterating her PBs . I think she can be a medal factor but that would be contingent on the minor medals being decided in the . <p> What may be happening on Planet Seebohm is anyone 's guess . Hocking ..... will depend on how she handles the pressure . Whilst she was silver medallist in this event at both 2011 &amp; 2013 Worlds ; she went into London as clear 2nd money and failed to make the final after finalling in her lesser event ( 100 ) <p> Ger August 11 , 2016 <p> Flyguy , I was just thinking that . If Manuel or Weitzel do n't put themselves forward by producing tonight , and if Ledecky has enough left in the tank , I think it makes sense to put her in . The U.S. will need a cushion against Campbell and Ledecky is the best option to defend that situation . <p> Ger August 11 , 2016 <p> The road has definitely become easier for Hosszu with others under performing . Hard to see past her unless Seebohm can find her form . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd reassess that final sentence to include CAN us to do so . <p> Tuesday 's meeting

And so they do : a token three months is given . It will never be served , for the swimmer swam on and won three gold medals at the Asian Games two months before the details of his case started to emerge . <p> Sun Yang in Rio by PBK <p> Imagine that . The swimmer , the Chinese Swimming Association and Dr Ba Zhen , not to mention and others , all know about the case , dated May 2014 .

And yet , there he is poolside in Incheon with Sun . Dr Ba has been there throughout Sun 's career : he was a China team doctor at a home Games in Beijing and then again in London when Sun raced to two Olympic titles , over 400 and 1500m freestyle . Dr Ba , says Chinese sources , is one of several doctors that have been deciding what substances , legal or otherwise at any given point of time , might hep the swimmer cope with his workload in light of a heart condition . Triamterene is prescribed for " several years " before it was placed on WADA 's banned list but neither nor anyone else sees what ... well , all other teams in the world ( and all the way down to ... me , and other journalists who write about such things ) had seen , namely the WADA statement on its website and accompanying warnings that the substances was about to go ' red alert ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three-month penalty and all is well ... Sun three months ( though retrospective so a token at the very most , one he will feel no consequence for barring the taint to his status ) ; Dr Ba a year ( until it is pointed out by this website that he worked with Sun during his suspension period and a second offence has been committed under the WADA Code and a second penalty joins the first ) . Things are not going well for Sun , a swimmer who spent a week in jail after he drove without a licence , his case coming to light when the Porsche he 'd borrowed collided with a bus . Oops . <p> Imagine that : August 2015 , world titles and Sun races the 400 , wins ; the 200 , gets pipped by James Guy .

The withdrawal comes too late for Pal Joensen , of the Faroes and Denmark , to make it to the blocks and take up his rightful place as reserve . The title passes a while after Sun has kicked a locker in during a row with team officials who sought to clear the changing space of all other folk . <p> Imagine that : in a week at the most troubled Olympics in history in terms of swimming being an arena in which teams , athletes , coaches and others feel as need to boo and jeer to get their point across when those who have fallen foul of anti-doping rules walk out for races , Marculescu is seen on the deck during finals after a medals ceremony walk up to Sun and hug him like a long lost son .

Russians with an asterisk to their names locked out , then let back in to the swimming pool , their greatest saviour and defence Sun Yang* , Park and the all others with that asterisk in tow .

 Club : Ryan Murphy Finishes Sweep With 1:53.62 In 200 Backstroke <p> The names read like a Who 's Who of backstroke . Roland Matthes . John Naber . Rick Carey . Lenny Krayzelburg . Aaron Peirsol . What is their connection ? Each of the aforementioned men pulled off an Olympic double in the stroke , claiming gold medals in the 100 distance and 200 distance during the same Olympiad . <p> Welcome to the club , Ryan Murphy . <p> Touted as the future of his stroke for several years , the 21-year-old ascended to the top of backstroke on Thursday night , roaring to victory in the 200 back at the Rio Aquatics Centre . The triumph complemented Murphy 's gold medal in the 100 back earlier in the week , and placed him in some exclusive company . <p> If Murphy 's win in the shorter distance was convincing , then his decision over four laps was perfectly executed . A six-time NCAA champion for the University of California-Berkeley , Murphy was fourth at the first turn , but in front at each of the other checkpoints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any surges his rivals may have been summoning . <p> Finishing with a time of 1:53.62 , the fastest of his career , Murphy finished .34 ahead of Australian Mitch Larkin , the co-favorite in the event heading into Rio . Russia 's Evgeny Rylov dropped a European record of 1:53.97 for the bronze medal , fourth place going to China 's Xu Jiayu well back in 1:55.16 . <p> Like he did in the 100 back , Murphy extended a reign of American dominance , his title ( as was the case at half the distance ) the sixth consecutive for the Stars &amp; Stripes . Since 1996 , the U.S. has held a grip on the gold , Murphy preceded by Brad Bridgewater , Krayzelburg , , Ryan Lochte and Tyler Clary . The last non-American champion was Spain 's Martin Zubero in Barcelona in 1992 . <p> The way Murphy marched to his first gold medal this week and with the ease in which he moved through the prelims and semifinals of the 200 back , a sweep of the dorsal disciplines was almost expected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed , Murphy coasted through the last lap , almost bathing in the water as he neared the wall . <p> Many would pay handsomely for Murphy 's skill set . <p> As has been written before , Murphy was identified as a future standout early in his career , National Age Group records coming as early as his 10-year-old season . Then there were the standards he took from Peirsol , an icon not only in his events , but in the sport . Once Murphy was stealing from the seven-time Olympic medalist , the comparisons picked up momentum . <p> Aside from possessing pure talent akin to that of Peirsol , Murphy also brings back memories of his measured approach . For years , Peirsol was a master of managing himself through the rounds , exerting only as much energy that was necessary for advancement and a quality lane . But once the goods were for sale , no one was going to outbid him . <p> Murphy might push a little more in prelims and semifinals than Peirsol , but he 's not one to unnecessarily waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of his assets . There always seems to be a bit more , and the moment is never too big . Simply , Murphy enjoys the spotlight and pressurized moments . Given the nature of what 's on the line in Rio , the Olympic Games , obviously , is the perfect fit . <p> Outside of what he can control , that being his ability , Murphy has also benefited from the presence of Jacob Pebley as a training partner . Cal teammates for the past three years , and 40% of the five Golden Bears placed on the Team USA roster by coach , Murphy and Pebley must never look too far for a practice push . They have each other to drag up and down the pool , one another to press through dryland workouts and each other to rely on for motivation . The respect and appreciation they have for one another was on display at the United States Olympic Trials when the realization of their Rio invitations resulted in an embrace over the lane ropes . Pebley was fifth in the Olympic final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a strong bounce-back from a fourth-place finish in the 100 backstroke , and a lockout from the podium . Larkin attacked the early portion of his race and fought hard down the stretch to fend off a charging Rylov by the smallest of margins . <p> The most shocking result ... My picks went up i 'm smoke .... Sjostrom one gold , one silver one bronze ... Not too shabby ... And an American swims a 52 when it matters most ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Even Seebohm was swimming 58s and could n't replicate that when it mattered . Team Australia is crushed , just Larkin 's silver this session .... <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> When was the last time teenagers won the 100 free , and a 31 year old won the 200 i 'm ? ? ? <p> President Obama will be so proud of Simone Manuel ? ? Extraordinary things are indeed possible ..... <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Oleksiak winning = no surprise . Manuel = WTF <p> C2 was no surprise ... she 's been battling all year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise but that would be lying . <p> There are going to be any of number of issues raised in the inevitable post mortems ; some organisational ( like timing of Trials ) but when it all boils down , the swimmer needs to have done the work and have the necessary self belief to withstand whatever is happening to others . <p> Team momentum , I suspect , has been a key factor . It works both ways , feeding off both successes AND disappointments . As a growing number of leading names have continued to fall short ; there is little doubt that the psychological pressure has flowed onto others ... with very few being able to withstand it . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Remember how a while back , I invoked the name of Hanna Maria Seppala and talked about how things can get little weird in the big championship finals of the women 's 100 free and a bunch of people were like C1 and C2 are a lock so only and Sarah S should even bother thinking they 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports books from time to time . <p> Blah Blah August 12 , 2016 <p> C1 was a surprise . The rest was not . Manuel looked great in prelims and semi . As did penny . The rest did n't look strong . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Australian top swimmers have become so fragile in these past two Olympics . They were pretty tough in <p> I 'm still in shock over Cate 's loss , but after some thinking , what hurt me the most is not that beat her , but because she just fell apart . I agree with CW , Cate just got spooked , and fell apart on the last lap . <p> I mean , there 's no other reason for swimming 53.2 in an Olympics final . She could swim that time wearing weight belt and anchor any day ( to borrow us to do so .@@13798090 <p> " She makes

" The international federation will , however , be aware of the pending appeal . <p> The Chinese Swimming Association was told the news two days ago . Sources said that the matter is now in the hands of the Court of Arbitration of Sport , which has been specifically set up in Rio to deal with any doping cases , including appeals for Russian athletes still wanting to compete at these Games in the wake of damning reports linking the state to cheating and cover-up . <p> Chen was 16 when she catapulted up the world rankings to a 56.61 victory for China over 100m butterfly at the Asian Games .

 completing the bookends of age for Japan - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Rio 2016 Olympic Games <p> Women 's 200m breaststroke <p> Japan has had the youngest ever champion in the 200m breaststroke since 1992 , when Kyoko Iwasaki , 14 years and 6 days , claimed the crown . Now , Japan has the oldest champion ever : Rie Kaneto , a month shy of her 28th birthday . <p> The title took a 2mins 20.30 , Kaneto followed home on the podium of those with no doping asterisk attached to their names by China 's Shi Jinglin in 2:22.28 and Chloe Tutton just 0.06sec away on 2:22.34 , just 0.01sec shy of the British record set in semis by teammate Molly Renshaw , today sixth in . <p> Kaneto produced the pace of the race . Out in 32.74 , she paced her first 50m in 32.74 to turn fifth . A lap later , in lane 5 , she had snuggled up to the shoulder of Australian Taylor McKeown , in 4 , 1:07.99 to 1:08.26 , and asterisk on 1:08.71 and biding its time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more boo-ing to do . <p> By the last turn , Kaneto had the edge , in 1:44.23 , the first six all through within a second . The race could go any which way . Kaneto thought otherwise . A last lap of 36.07 in which she maintained her pace while the rest fell off their 's demolished her rivals . Kaneto said : <p> " I 'm delighted . I feel grateful to all who supported me and I really wish would I have a chance in the near future to respond to their support and to thank them . All I want now is to cheer the rest of my teammates . " <p> Rie Kaneto by PBK <p> Asked about the medal around her neck , she said : " Definitely this feels the heaviest medal of the various medals I 've got . This was a lifetime ambition . " <p> The ebb and flow : <p> 32.74 ( 5 ) 1:08.26 ( 2 ) 1:44.23 ( 1 ) 2:20.30 Kaneto <p> 33.10 ( 8 ) 1:08.71 ( =4 ) 1:44.55 ( 2 ) 2:21.97 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:45.63 ( 7 ) 2:22.28 Shi <p> 32.39 ( 3 ) 1:09.14 ( 8 ) 1:45.05 ( 5 ) 2:22.34 Tutton <p> For Tutton , 20 , there will be no bronze to take home to Pontypridd in Wales , Russian Yuliya , towing a positive steroid tested with her from 2013 , taking a pyrrhic silver in 2:21.97 . <p> Boos and jeers were heard once more as Efimova made her way out to the blocks -- headphones blocking out the cat calls three years after she tested positive for DHEA . She served a 16-month suspension and made her return to the pool . The saga , however , continued this year when Efimova tested positive five times for meldonium , the heart booster added to the World Anti-Doping Agency 's list of banned substances from January 1 . <p> Rie Kaneto by PBK <p> The jury is out on meldonium and how long it lasts in the body but the drama included Efimova being barred and reinstated twice on the way to a Games at which she was labelled a cheat by American Lilly King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title ahead of her earlier this week . <p> Tutton expressed frustration at being so close to the podium and at finishing behind the controversial Russian . <p> She said : " Being in fourth place is a bit gutting , no matter who is in front of you . I would 've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games . I could n't help who was here . I 'm not happy with it , but it 's just the way it is . People just have to get on with it . I would 've preferred to have a medal . " <p> The race was , then , " bittersweet " . " I 'm really happy with that time , but being so close to a medal , you ca n't help but be disappointed , " she said . <p> " To see the scoreboard at the end , just to see a fourth . So close . I 've got many more years to improve . Hopefully that 's just experience and hopefully in the future do a bit better . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my third Olympics . In the first one , I was fourth , in the second I was third . Now I am second , so maybe the next one is mine . " <p> If justice is done and Olympic bosses frame the right rules , she will never get the chance . <p> Meanwhile , Efimova returned to the insult of a year ago when she told reporters at the post-race press conference that a doping offence was just like a traffic penalty : you lose your licence and then get it back . <p> How to win friends an influence people . <p> On winning her medal , She said : " Even if this is just third place , I 'm proud of myself . This is my first Olympics so it was a big challenge , " said Shi on the pool deck but she did not make it to the obligatory press conference because she was " too i 'll " . <h> The Trouble With Truth <p> Efimova found support in teammate Anton Chupkov and here is where Russian troubles spills from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on the podium yesterday , Andrew Willis missing out in the same 200m breaststroke by 0.08sec . <p> Chupkov has no asterisk to his name . He belonged to Russian youth teams that have so often dominated continental racing for a long time . His words on Efimova highlighted the view from within the Russian camp when he said : <p> " You could say that Yulia inspired me with her desire , her willpower , her patience . What inspired me is that she endured everything , overcame everything and brought such an important medal for our national team . I was watching her final ( 100m ) . The whole team was probably watching her final and everyone was cheering for her and worrying for her . " <p> The issues spilled over into the men 's 200m medley press conference , too , as Wang Shun was asked about reports that teammate Chen Xinyi had failed a doping test . What were his views on that ? He knew nothing . us to do so . <p> Former Philippine President 
 the United States of America ( USA ) competes in the men 's 100m Butterfly Heats <p> One day , perhaps a production company will pay all the rights fees required for footage and mesh together a DVD . It can be titled , " The Greatest Rivalry . " Care to guess the subject matter ? Hint : It has to do with what unfolded -- for the last time on Night Six of the Olympic Games at the Rio Aquatics Centre . <p> For more than a decade , we 've sat back and watched them entertain , rarely -- if ever -- providing something less than award-caliber stuff . If Part One of their show was a one-sided affair , it set the scene for what was to come . Part Two certainly brought more drama , the action scenes hitting their peak . <p> Now , the curtain is closed . <p> The Michael Phelps Ryan Lochte rivalry is no more , the last clash of the American superstars booked into history on Thursday night with Phelps capturing the 22nd gold medal of his career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second retirement , Phelps left no doubt about the outcome , putting together another virtuoso performance that ended in a time of 1:54.66 , the fourth-fastest of his career and No. 8 all-time for the 31-year-old . It was his 15th individual Olympic medal , breaking the Olympic record off 14 , held by former Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina . <p> The bummer to the narrative was Lochte 's fifth-place finish in 1:57.47 , the 32-year-old unable to maintain his lead at the midway point and his third-place standing going into the final lap . Nonetheless , to discount Lochte 's significance in the event , and to the best rivalry the sport has seen , would be a narrow-view focus . A career is not made on one race , but in totality , and Lochte 's portfolio rates in the top 1% . <p> With Phelps notching a margin of victory , not far off his record triumph from Beijing in 2008 , the silver medal went to Japan 's Kosuke Hagino in 1:56.61 , the bronze to China 's Wang Shun in 1:57.05 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medals ceremony , a smile pretty much the extent of things . This week has been different . Tears appeared in his eyes during his first three ceremonies in Rio , but the medley elicited more , Phelps choking up at the playing of the Star Spangled Banner . <p> It may not have been the fairytale end to the rivalry , but it was n't without history . With his latest gold , Phelps became the first swimmer to win the same event at four consecutive Olympiads , acknowledging that achievement with a four-finger flash to the crowd of 14,000 . Phelps joined fellow Americans Al Oerter ( discus ; 1956-68 ) and Carl Lewis ( long jump ; 1984-96 ) as the only Olympians to pull off The Quad . By the way , he 'll have the chance to do it again in the 100 butterfly , that final set for Friday night . <p> " I say this a lot , but every single day , I 'm living a dream come true , " Phelps said . " As a kid , I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm enjoying it . Being able to finish how I want is just something very special to me , and this is why you are seeing more and more emotion on the medal podium . " <p> Even if the last faceoff was n't epic , Phelps and Lochte engaged in a spectacular two-man act for a 12-year period that began in 2004 . The show came off Broadway for a brief while , when Phelps retired following the London Games in 2012 , but it was rekindled in time for a final run . The finale was watched by millions across the globe , and while there was the occasional guest appearance ( Hagino of late and Hungarian Laszlo Cseh in earlier episodes ) , Phelps and Lochte did just fine manning the spotlight by themselves . <p> In the Playbill for their last showdown , a special section could be found that detailed their extraordinary success . Updated after Phelps ' victory , it reads as such : <p> Between them , Phelps and Lochte boast the performances of all-time , and account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have 26 of the fastest 35 outings , 34 of the quickest 50 and more than half ( not a typo ) of the top 100 . <p> While Phelps has four Olympic titles in the 200 medley , Lochte 's trophy case includes two silver medals and a bronze in the event . Together , they 've accounted for 38 Olympic medals 26 for Phelps and 12 for Lochte , the second-highest total for a swimmer . <p> They combined for every world title dating to the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona . While Phelps walked away with gold medals in 2003 , 2005 and 2007 , Lochte won every world championship from 2009 through 2015 -- four in all . <p> At the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai , Lochte and Phelps engaged in their finest duel . While Lochte lowered the world record to 1:54.00 , Phelps posted the fastest time of his career , a clocking of 1:54.16 . <p> And now it 's over . Kind of sad for the sport , huh ? Then again , that depends on the vantage point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never go into the breaststroke leg of a medley in a dead heat , each man looking for that smallest crack of daylight . Sure , we 'll miss the banter between them , a little bit of joking and a lot of mutual respect . But all things end , and the impact they 've had on the sport ? That 's going nowhere . <p> When this rivalry was born on the road to the Athens Olympics in 2004 , it was lopsided in nature . Lochte was n't at the level of Phelps . Work needed to be done to cut the deficit , and it would take time . So as Phelps rolled along , Lochte trained his way into someone capable of giving the G.O.A.T . a challenge . Eventually , the result was a global standard for Lochte and a defeat of the Big Man at the World Champs in Shanghai . <p> The tale , on the big stage , was an illustration of one of Phelps ' primary goals : Grow the sport . He made Lochte into a better athlete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made swimming better from an internal standpoint . Other swimmers understood that Phelps knew no boundaries on his ambitions , and recognized through Lochte 's determination that previously discounted aspirations were doable . Wait , someone can challenge Michael Phelps ? Lochte basically said , and showed : " Hell , yes ! " <p> Outside of the world of international competition , Phelps and Lochte have put kids in the pool . USA Swimming has experienced a spike in membership during their careers , enhanced boosts coming in Olympic years . It 's been as simple as that little kid sitting in front of the TV turning to mom and dad , and saying : " Sign me up . I want to win medals like those guys . " <p> Then there 's the coverage aspect . Before Phelps , and with the help of Lochte as his profile soared , finding swimming on television in the United States was ... well , it was n't going to happen . These days , coverage can be found of USA Swimming Pro Series stops , U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Olympic years , swimming rates at the top of the list of most-watched sports . Heck , the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) , the United States rights holder to the Games , convinced the International Olympic Committee to have finals start at 10 o'clock in Rio de Janeiro . Why ? By getting that schedule arranged , it could show the swimming action in not only a live format , but in primetime . What does primetime mean ? Bigger advertising dollars . <p> With Phelps going the retirement route , Lochte is uncertain about his end date . He has not ruled out a run toward the 2020 Games in Tokyo , but he also recognizes the need to take a step back , recharge and reassess . <p> " I wish that end was a lot better , " Lochte said . " It is what it is . My swimming career has been good and I 'm so thankful for the gifts and talent that I 've been given . But I had to work at it . Day in and day out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up better . <p> " I ca n't say this is over . If anything , I think especially that race , it helped motivate me . There are a lot of things I need to change in the next four years if I want to come back into the sport . But for right now , I think I need a break mentally . Who knows . It could be for a day . It could be ten days , two years . I just know I need physical and mental tapering . " <p> Whatever happens , it 's a guarantee that Phelps and Lochte will be celebrated at future Olympic Trials , regaled through tales of their duels and given the chance to take a bow . <h> Comments <p> Breizh August 12 , 2016 <p> Boring , really . <p> Craig Lord August 12 , 2016 <p> I think you were right the first time , Breizh more Boeing ( in the bin ) than boring ... the thing is the world is full of the inevitable like the sunrise , a full moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the birth of a child .

 Italy - worth the NBA pose he likes to put on show at the end of races - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Welcome to the SwimVortex coverage of the 31st Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . The team of Craig Lord and John Lohn will report live from the Rio Aquatics Centre , with the keen eye of Patrick B. Kraemer providing photographs . Action gets under way this afternoon with the Day Seven preliminary heats -- women 's 50 freestyle , men 's 1500 freestyle and both 400 medley relays . Continue to visit this file ( and hit the refresh button ) for running updates from the pool . <p> Fresh off her share of the gold medal in the 100 freestyle , the United States ' Simone Manuel will take to the 50 freestyle , in search of another surprise medal .

Peaty was preceded by Chris Walker-Hebborn ( 53.68 ) on the backstroke leg and followed by James Guy on butterfly ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The United States finished more than a second back in and will switch out its lineup for the final . Getting Team USA in the medals race were David Plummer ( 52.70 ) , Kevin Cordes ( 59.51 ) , Tom Shields ( 51.88 ) and Caeleb Dressel ( 47.74 ) . In the last event of competition , the U.S. will go with Ryan Murphy , Cody Miller , Michael Phelps and Nathan Adrian . <p> Japan qualified No. 3 and will be looking for a fourth straight medal in the event after winning bronze in 2004 and 2008 and silver in 2012 . Australia and China tied for fourth at 3:32.57 , but Australia is in much better position for the final , especially with 100 free champ Kyle Chalmers going to the anchor leg . The field was completed by Brazil ( 3:32.96 ) , Germany ( ) and Italy ( 3:34.85 ) . <h> Team USA 'S 400 Medley Relay ( 3:54.67 ) Set Up For More Gold <p> Katie Meili , right , handled the breaststroke leg for the USA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the final By Patrick B. Kraemer <p> At the beginning of the Olympic Games , the United States figured to be in a battle for gold in the women 's 400 medley relay . But as the picture became clearer throughout the week , Team USA will go into the final of the event as the big favorite . The United States rolled through prelims , going 3:54.67 for a cushion of more than two seconds over Canada ( 3:56.80 ) and Denmark ( 3:56.98 ) . <p> The Americans relied on the quartet of Olivia Smoliga ( 59.57 ) , Katie Meili ( 1:04.93 ) , Kelsi Worrell ( 56.47 ) and Abbey Weitzeil ( 53.70 ) , but will go with an entirely different lineup for the final . The U.S. is expected to turn to Kathleen Baker , Lilly King , and Simone Manuel , the world record of 3:52.05 not out of the question . <p> Canada will also get quicker in the final as it adds 16-year-old sensation Penny Oleksiak to the butterfly leg .

Going into the final of the event , Paltrinieri no longer has a shared status . <p> Clocking a performance of , Paltrinieri looked comfortable and in control on the way to the top seed , American Connor Jaeger taking the No. position in . In the final , neither man will have to deal with Sun , the world-record holder who was 16th and out of the final in 15:01.97 . The gold medalist in the 200 free and silver medalist in the 400 free , Sun did n't look like he exerted much effort in the prelims . <p> It 's never easy to judge how much energy is being expended in the prelims of the 30-lap race , but it appears Paltrinieri and Jaeger have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14:48.23 ) was third into the final , with Australian Mack Horton , the gold medalist in the 400 free , coming home strong in for fourth . <p> Bronte Campbell , right , and Sarah Sjostrom advanced to the semifinals of the 50 freestyle By Patrick B. Kraemer <p> With all of the biggest names in sprinting lining up for the 50 freestyle , the top seed for the semifinals went to a longshot . Denmark 's Pernille Blume fired off a personal-best clocking of 24.23 to place herself in the middle of the medal hunt . Blume raced in the last of 12 heats , her time just .03 quicker than the 24.26 thrown down by Great Britain 's Fran Halsall in the prior heat . <p> Belarus ' , with a doping violation to her name , qualified third in 24.42 while Australia 's Bronte Campbell ( 24.45 ) was fourth and older sister Cate Campbell ( 24.52 ) in seventh .

Canada 's Chantal Van Landeghem and reigning Olympic champion Ranomi Kromowidjojo of the Netherlands tied for eighth at 24.57 , with Sweden 's Sarah Sjostrom next at 24.66 . <p> After securing a surprise gold medal in the 100 free , sharing it with Canadian Penny Oleksiak , Simone Manuel moved through the prelims in 11th in 24.71 . Manuel should be quicker at night , the events of the previous day a little more settled in her system and additional rest gathered after an evening that included press obligations and doping-control requirements . <p> Also advancing to the semifinals were 38-year-old Therese Alshammar of Sweden in 24.73 and the trio of the Netherlands ' , the Bahamas ' Ariana Vanderpool-Wallace and Germany 's Dorothea Brandt , all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medeiros ( 24.82 ) . <h> Comments <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Olympics swimming is not over yet , and I am already starting to experience withdrawal lol <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Australian swimming is crazy if they do n't move the next Olympics trials to a date much closer to the Olympics . Main idea would be to prevent the top swimmers from having too much media exposure and believing in their hype created by media/public . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> So great to see 2 swimmers under 15 minutes already . Now the action is about to start . The pace needs to be quick , or we will see a few upsets <p> Ger August 12 , 2016 <p> Is Sun Yang finished ; falling back . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Ger , I think so , but let 's see how he finishes .

Surely he can not come back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , 2016 <p> He 's done Flyguy . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Sun Yang is gone ! I wished he 'd gone in 200 too . <p> Buh bye Yang ! <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Horton looked pretty good , but he should n't wait until the final lap to pick up the pace . Detti also looked good . Wilimovsky seemed to work hardest . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> I still ca n't figure out how can swim that fast with that stroke that look so inefficient . <p> Craig Lord August 12 , 2016 <p> Underwater efficient , asf ... grabs the water fast -- great angle of buoyancy , drag of a two-beat kick , he ' surfs ' more than Jaeger in next line , for e.g .... <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Absolutely Craig , Efficiency of stroke underwater &gt; efficiency of recovery on top of the water ...

Canada have a real chance to medal yet again . Oleksiak could end up with 5 Medals ... Who would have thought <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> Got ta say , GBR looks great to contend for the 4 ? 100 crown for men ... I hope the USA tear it up just for Phelps ..

Quite pathetic . There was alot of hype but there is no chance they were going to make it with a " B " Team , ie no Le Clos , and sub par performances . <p> Rafael August 12 , 2016 <p> GBR might spoil US .. even with a subpar back leg .. if Peaty goes 56 and adding a very good fly + free GBR can upset US . <p> Bronze seem open .. Everybody in underperforming on something .. as Brazilian I Really wished to see Guido swimming 53 low and the breast splitting 58 .. <p> Ger August 12 , 2016 <p> It could be very tight but the U.S. will change all four which is just as well as a split 59.51 from cordes and 51.88 from Shields does n't do it . I assume Shields was just saving himself for later . Peaty 57.49 will be faster tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't call it <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> I cant see USA Losing . Duncan Scott is never going to track down Adrian . Murphy is going to put 1.5 seconds on CWH , Miller will be strong , but Peaty will close the gap . Phelps will do what he does best . <p> August 12 , 2016 <p> About when to have trials : it 's a tricky thing . Do remember the frequent complaints about US swimmers peaking at the trials , only to be slower at the worlds or Olympics . That never applied to the greats , or the ones for whom it happened to be their first real year of racing , the Oleksiaks or Kings , but it did apply to many regular others , for whom qualifying was the main goal . <p> ( Of course , a typical example should have been Simone Manuel , that 's why few on this list , myself included , did not believe she would progress ... ) <p> But what 's the happy medium ? Certainly not what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereby removing any incentives for someone like Steenbergen . Just as I am sure that the Campbells did discourage others , although clearly not Oleksiak or Manuel . <p> David Brooks August 12 , 2016 <p> I make US big favorites over GB . Murphy could take 1.5 secs out of CWH . could take all that back and more but with Phelps at least a second faster than Guy , Scott will start half a second down on Adrian . That 's too much to ask . But if Murphy under performs and Petty goes 56 mid , then it 's game on . <p> David Brooks August 12 , 2016 <p> On the women 's medley , Gb cut it very close today . just crazy that they do n't have Thomas or Kelly here as Fly backup . SOC is clearly not much quicker than either on fly but she 'd take a second out of Tutton . <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> Paltrinieri would need to make a mess of it to lose ...... but have n't we seen so many examples here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Have to suspect that at least one of the Americans will be on the podium . Horton will need to have his wits about him if he is to do so . Detti the spoiler . <p> Eugene Chc August 13 , 2016 <p> i 'm so happy for Maya <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> ! ! Shocker ! ! <p> Americans are really lifting their game and performing much better than their trials suggested . <p> Ger August 13 , 2016 <p> Wow , Dirado <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> Whatever the Americans did between the trials and Olympics really work ... very well ! <p> And most importantly ; momentum ! ! <p> For Australia , the collapse of the women 's breaststrokers , Seebohm ( and to a much lesser extent , Larkin ) was the start of domino collapse . That 's how fragile they are . Only much less-hyped and youthful talent of Chalmers can be oblivious to that . <p> Ger August 13 , 2016 <p> Destroyed on the turns but faster through the water .... another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> As Indonesian , I congratulate our neghbor Singapore .

Phelps 51.14 feeling it .... that make the relay tomorrow more interesting <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> Ledecky 4:01.98 at 400 ... on the feet ... on the way to 800 <p> s p e e c h l e s s <p> It 's faster than what Carlin swam to her silver in 400 . <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> Oh , yes , that 50.39 also finally removed the long-standing Crocker 's 50.40 textile record which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing , 14 years and going . <p> Ger August 13 , 2016 <p> 4:01.3 Carlin in 400 ? <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> That was her time Ger , but Katie had to turn still . Its generally accepted that a turn is. 6 to . 8 of a second . Travelling at the same pace <p> Ger August 13 , 2016 <p> 8:16 is a great time , but 12 seconds behind , lol <p> Ger August 13 , 2016 <p> Ervin ... WOW <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> USA is killing it . <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> Australia should take a sigh of relief they are not a complete disaster like the France , although they are pretty close second to France in the worst performers department . <p> The only thing that can save Australia from total disaster if a Campbell win 50 . <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> I love love love love how Ervin win 50 free . <p> His personal story arc is nothing less than amazing . One day a movie will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired in after 2002 , he 'd probably have won 3 ? 50 free golds , that 's how talented he is in sprinting . <p> Ger August 13 , 2016 <p> U.S. have moved on leaps and bounds from Kazan . The coaching staff have done a great job preparing the team to perform at this level . Australia have been a big let down ; I expected so much more from them . <p> ASF , Sjostrom has indicated she 's swimming on but she DID say that 200 was a " never again " after the 100 . Will be interesting how this next cycle goes for her ... and even whether she goes another " full cycle " . <p> C2 COULD , but I think that Rio is/was C1 's last roll of the dice given her physical fragility . Here 's hoping she can rescue something from the 50 , but its looking another slow race and that 's bringing so many more into the equation . <p> Chalmers may be a case of " too young to know fear/doubt " but all credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credits list for her 400 &amp; 4 ? 200 . <p> I 'll probably elaborate further when the inevitable post mortems arise but my fear re the AUS fall-out is that they will take the easy way out and " shoot the foreigner " ; making Verhaeren the scapegoat when probably very little should be sheeted home to him . The administration of SA , the personal coaches and the swimmers themselves have to take ownership for both the selection policy and the performance ... or lack thereof . <p> August 13 , 2016 <p> Yes , I would n't blame . <p> This Olympics year seems like a nightmare re-run from 2012 . From the numerous world leading times at the trials , months of media hype and build up , tip swimmers started to believe in their own hype , very few high quality racing opportunities , arriving too early in the Olympics village , little problems at the Village that should have been dealt with quietly and easily all the way to the " stage fright " . The only missing features are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I am betting you that if the AUS trials is moved to late June or early July , you would n't get the likes of Seebohm coasting away on her laurels .

 China 's top butterfly swimmer , is out of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games after the Court of Arbitration for Sport , sitting here in Brazil , handed the 18-year-old a temporary suspension , with a final decision due before the end of the Games . <p> The ruling puts Chen out of the medley relay and the 50m freestyle this morning , both events part of the curtain-closing session in the pool here in Rio tomorrow . <p> Xinyi Chen ( swimming , 100m butterfly and 50m freestyle , China ) , positive test with hydrochlorothiazide ( specified substance ) ; order on request for a provisional suspension ; the athlete accepted a provisional suspension on a voluntary basis ; as a consequence , the athlete is provisionally suspended from competing at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 ; the procedure will continue and the CAS ADD will issue a final award before the end of the Games . <p> Hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure and swelling caused by heart failure and liver damage . <p> The Chinese Swimming Association was told the news three days ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a 56.61 victory for China over 100m butterfly at the Asian Games .

 the next man and the last one to stop Michael Phelps - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Every Olympic year , the prediction game makes its way around the sport , fans contemplating the way the podiums will look . The exercise was no different in this Olympic campaign , the forecasts constantly evolving in the leadup to the Games in Rio . <p> As the men 's 100 butterfly went under the microscope , it was obvious a big name in the event and the sport would be left off the medals stand . Of the quartet of Michael Phelps , Joseph Schooling , Laszlo Cseh and Chad Le Clos , someone was n't getting a piece of hardware . Um , not so fast was the reply of the Aquatic Gods . <p> Unloading a performance , Singapore 's Schooling did something that nobody else has managed here ( or often in history ) , and he did it in dominant fashion : Beat Phelps . Going coast-to-coast at the front of the field , Schooling touched the wall in 50.39 , a hundredth of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 World Championships in Montreal . <p> As Schooling powered to the finish , his victory under no doubt , Phelps , Cseh and Le Clos battled the minor medals . They ended up sharing the same one , each them registering a time of 51.14 for a three-way share of the silver medal . There have been a handful of two-way ties through the years , but never a trifecta . Making the outcome all the more entertaining was the way the threesome handled the awards ceremony . As the announcer read their names to the crowd in English and Portuguese , they held hands and stepped onto the podium in synchronicity , raising their arms . <p> Because history and record-breaking achievements always call his name , Phelps was trying to become the first Olympian to win four consecutive gold medals in two different events . He first pulled it off the previous night , a rout of the field doing the trick in the 200 individual medley . The 100 fly figured to be a little tougher , and that 's the scenario that played out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I 'm full of emotions , but I do n't know what to believe , that I actually did it or I 'm still preparing for my race . I 'm between the two of them , " Schooling said . " I need to let this moment sink in , realize what I 've done and then I 'll have a better understanding of what I accomplished . But right now all I can say is I 'm really honored and privileged to have an opportunity to race in an Olympic final alongside huge names like Michael , Chad and Laszlo , guys that have redefined the sport . " <p> Phelps was relegated to Lane Two following a fifth-place showing in the semifinals , the result of a mere 32-minute window between the final of the 200 medley and his semifinal of the fly . With Phelps not entirely recovered , the objective was simply to secure a lane . With a full day of rest ahead , everyone knew he 'd be much quicker . Indeed , he was almost a half-second swifter , but Schooling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the years , Phelps repelled far more challenges in the 100 fly . For the most part , his medley exploits required the toppling of Ryan Lochte , the duo light years ahead of the competition . For so long , he was untouchable in the 200 fly , and when Le Clos took him down in London in 2012 , it only stoked the fire to play repo man in Rio . <p> But the 100 butterfly has been different . Crocker . Milorad Cavic . Le Clos . They 've all thrown uppercuts , Phelps taking the shots . His response ? Picture a prize fighter smirking back at the opponent , as if to say : " Is that all you got ? " Schooling found a way to faze the champ . <p> Michael Phelps ( back ) and Laszlo Cseh show each other three fingers after finishing together with Chad Le Clos in a three-way tie in the 100 butterfly final By Patrick B. Kraemer <p> " I do n't know if I have been in a tie , " Phelps said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster than I went , I think , four years ago to win . ( Schooling ) is tough . He had a great year last year and has had a really great last two years so hats off to him . He swam a great race . <p> " It 's wild . Chad and I have had some races over the last four years and Laszlo and I , I ca n't even remember when our first race was . Probably as long as ( Lochte ) and I. So , kind of special and a decent way to finish my last race . I ca n't complain too much . " <p> As a teenager , Schooling initially made his international mark in the 200 butterfly . Although born in Singapore , Schooling attended the high-powered and prestigious Bolles School in Florida , where he was a high school teammate of American Ryan Murphy , the double backstroke champion in Rio , and Canadian Santo Condorelli , who just missed a medal in the 100 free . He was also a club teammate of American sprinter Caeleb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold-medal-winning 400 freestyle relay . <p> Over time , Schooling became more dominant at the 100 fly , breaking through during the 2014 season . In addition to capturing the title at the Asian Games , he was the silver medalist at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . A year later , Schooling was wearing a bronze medal in the event from the World Champs in Kazan . He had the idea of playing alchemist , and becoming Singapore 's first Olympic medalist in the sport . <p> " It 's been a hard road . I 've done something that no one in our country had done before , " Schooling said . " It 's been a tough road . I 'm not going to lie . The first guy through the wall , it 's always bloody . I had to take that blow and I 'm thankful and blessed that I have the ability to accomplish this . It does n't matter where you 're from ... I hope this opens a new door , opens more doors for sports in our country and hopefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up . " <p> Mentored by Sergio Lopez on the way to a scholarship from the University of Texas , Schooling has spent the past two years under the tutelage of legendary Longhorns coach Eddie Reese . With Lopez remaining closely involved , Schooling 's speed has emerged at a new level , a development that needed to take place in order to contend for global championships . It ca n't be overlooked , either , that Schooling has benefited from a training environment at Texas that features a wealth of talent , notably Jack Conger . Among the elite flyers in the world in his own right , Conger has helped push Schooling in practice , and vice versa . <p> In determining his Olympic schedule , Schooling took the safe and intelligent -- route . He opted to bypass the 200 butterfly and race the 100 freestyle as his only individual event prior to the 100 fly . The lighter workload has paid the biggest dividends Schooling could imagine . <p> While Cseh won the sixth medal of his Olympic career , Le Clos collected his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver raised his medal count to 27 over the past four Olympiads , his first trip to the Games in 2000 in Sydney yielding a fifth-place finish in the 200 fly . All that remains between the greatest Olympian of all-time and a second retirement is the 400 medley relay . If the United States medals , it will be Phelps ' sixth of the meet , and mark the fourth time he has left an Olympics with at least six medals . <p> Schooling would n't mind another matchup with Phelps when the Games go to Tokyo in 2020 . <p> " He said , ' Good job . That was a great race . ' I told him , ' Four more years ? ' and he said , ' No way . ' If he changes his mind , that would be fun . I us to do so . <p> The hacker Guccifer 
 round of the 50 freestyle , something approaching , if not faster , figured to come from someone in the field . Instead , the final of the event will go off with a wide range of contenders for the last individual title of the women 's program . Perhaps Australian Cate Campbell will shake off the disappointment from missing the podium in the 100 free and get the gold medal she came to collect . <p> After leading the field through prelims , Denmark 's Pernille Blume also delivered the fastest time of the semifinals , going 24.28 . But Campbell , the world leader and only woman to crack the 24-second barrier this year , is lurking close behind . Campbell was timed in 24.32 and will certainly be a factor the title , provided she 's gotten her earlier struggles put away . <p> Reigning champion Ranomi Kromowidjojo is n't out of the chase for a repeat , the Dutchwoman going 24.39 for the No. 3 seed , just ahead of the 24.41 of Great Britain 's Fran Halsall . Aussie Bronte Campbell ( 24.43 ) will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States ' Simone Manuel ( 24.44 ) and Brazil 's Etiene Medeiros ( 24.45 ) also in the hunt for the podium . The field was rounded out by Belarus ' Aliaksandra ( 24.53 ) . <p> The semifinals were delayed by about 20 minutes when a bus carrying athletes to the Rio Aquatics Centre went to the wrong venue . Aboard the us to do so . <p> Winner Anthony ERVIN 
 ( R ) of the United States of America ( USA ) celebrates with his 3rd placed teammate Nathan ADRIAN after competing in the men 's 50m Freestyle Final <p> He flexed . He splashed . He bellowed . The momentum of his celebration accidently carried him into the next lane . The reaction of American Anthony Ervin when he realized he had captured a second gold medal in the 50 freestyle was priceless , and provided all the evidence needed to understand just how much the triumph met to the wait for it -- 35-year-old . <p> Getting off to a solid start , something that is a routine struggle , Ervin blazed over the water at the Rio Aquatics Centre and touched the wall in 21.40 to dethrone defending champion Florent Manaudou of France , who clocked in at 21.41 . The victory handed Ervin his second gold medal in the event , the first coming way back in 2000 , when he tied countryman Gary Hall Jr . for the title in Sydney . Ervin 's former training partner , Nathan Adrian , grabbed another sprint bronze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the program only since 1988 , when it debuted in Seoul . Only Russia 's Alexander Popov and Hall have repeated , and while that statistic is partially connected to the relative infancy of the event , it also hinges on fickle nature of the discipline . In a race that is over in barely more than 21 seconds , every mistake is magnified . Poor start ? Damning . Bad finish ? ? Extra breath ? Crushing . <p> Ervin was flawless . <p> There have been plenty of comeback stories in the sport over the years , the return of Dara Torres among the best known . She came back twice , after all , winning five medals at the 2000 Games after an eight-year layoff , and winning three in 2008 at the age of 41 , again after eight years away . But Ervin 's comeback now includes a gold medal in an individual event , a spectacular achievement in itself , and even more so given his age . Ervin is now the oldest gold medalist in the sport 's history . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> The fastest man in textile at 21.19 from last year 's World Championships , Manaudou made himself the man to beat in the previous night 's semifinals , a 21.32 effort handing him the No. 1 seed . But Ervin was confident in his preparation , and hungry for his opportunity . Much of whether he could pull off the upset hinged on his start . Make it a good one , and he was in the mix . <p> Bingo . <p> Ervin did n't bolt to the front of the pack , as Manaudou did with his trademark entry . But he did n't leave himself with a sizable gap to narrow , either . Once he got on top the water , he simply let his vast skill take over . At 6-foot-3 , Ervin is n't a small man . But he 's leaner than most of his muscled rivals , and standing next to Manaudou and Adrian , he 's dwarfed . None of it matters . The speed is there , and that is what counts . <p> " There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meet , " Ervin said . " I felt really good in the prelims , then I changed things for the ( semifinals ) , and felt even better . Then I had a game plan for finals . If anything , I was a little bit slower than I thought I was going to be . But it 's a tough race . It 's the 50 final in the Olympics . " <p> The 2000 Olympic Trials in Indianapolis marked Ervin 's coming-out party , a second-place finish to Hall in the 50 freestyle landing him a spot on the American squad bound for the Sydney Games . Down Under , as a 19-year-old coming off his freshman year at Cal-Berkeley , Ervin elevated his stature even further , the tie with Hall an epic moment for the youngster . <p> The future of sprinting was in Ervin 's hands , his raw talent and speed said to be as good as the sport has seen . He followed his Olympic gold by capturing the sprint double at the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka and was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Pan Pacific Champs . But after failing to advance out of the prelims of his prime event at the 2003 World Championships , he disappeared from the sport for seven years , bouncing around to various places and living an unsettled life . He spent some time teaching swimming lessons , but from a competitive standpoint ? Nothing . <p> In 2011 , though , Ervin was back on the pool deck , a comeback materializing . He gradually watched his times come down , the possibility of high-level success opening eyes . Ultimately , his comeback resulted in a trip to London for a second Olympiad , where Ervin finished fifth in the 50 freestyle . Since that time , he qualified for the World Championships in 2013 and 2015 and established himself -- once again -- as a staple in global sprinting . At 35 , Ervin has followed the path set by Torres , and has turned his back on the notion that age should slow him down . <p> Originally at Cal-Berkeley for his comeback work , Ervin did a stint with the Trojan Swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David Marsh . <p> " It 's surreal , kind of absurd , " Ervin said . " When I touched , turned around and saw the one next to my name , I kind of smiled and laughed . Then I wanted to show a little bit of emotion for the effort I 'd put in for my friends , for my family , for those watching at home and in the stands . <p> " It 's been an incredible journey to think that after 16 years I 'm back on the podium at the Olympic Games . But all the credit is to the love and support of my people , my family , my friends , my teammates , my coaches , my country . " <p> By ascending to the top of the sprint world again , Ervin tied Torres ( 1984-2000 ) for the most years between gold medals , but set a record for most years between individual crowns , Michael Phelps the next best at 12 years . He also equaled Australian ( 1908-1924 ) for the largest gap between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The overall record stands to Torres at 24 years , spanning 1984-2008 . <p> A few years after prevailing in Sydney , Ervin auctioned his gold medal for charity , raising $17,000 to aid the tsunami relief fund in Indonesia . For now , he 's planning to keep this gold medal . <p> Conventional thought wonders : What could Ervin have done if he had n't vanished for the better part of a decade ? Would his name be mentioned in the same breath as Popov ? Could he have given Hall a push in Athens ? Obviously , those questions will never be answered , but solace can be taken in the fact that Ervin came back at all , and treated the sport to his unique talents . As far as he 's concerned , there 's more ahead , including a run at the 2020 Games in Tokyo . <p> " I 'm going to try and make the Tokyo team , of course , " Ervin said . " Obviously , I like being in an environment where I can keep trying to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think my age should limit me to that , and I do n't think fear of defeat should limit that either because I do n't think about winning or losing .

" <p> looked stunned at the finish , his chase for a repeat dashed by a man who -- if he followed the typical road would be retired . While Manaudou finished just behind Ervin , Adrian added to his treasury and helped the United States bolster its lead in the medal count with 29 , the gold total at 14 . For perspective on the American dominance , Australia sits second with eight medals , three of them gold . <p> " I 'm really happy with a bronze and coming away with a medal , " Adrian said .

 Makes The Dash Is A Splash First Gold For Denmark Since 1948 <p> Denmark celebrated its first Olympic gold since 1948 when Pernille Blume stopped the clock at 24.07 , 0.02sec ahead of Simone Manuel ( USA ) , the third swimmer home with a clean record Fran Halsall , of Britain , on 23.13 . <p> Locked out : Cate and Bronte Campbell , the Australian sisters who will return home with no solo sprint freestyle medals . Unthinkable before these Games . <p> Blume left the deck in floods of tears . She seemed stunned , shocked , unable to fathom what she had just achieved . But she was not done -- and Denmark needed her to pull herself together . That she did . <p> Within the hour she was back in bringing Denmark home to bronze in a European record of 3:55.01 behind the United States , Manuel delivering the gold in 3:53.13 , and Australia , Cate Campbell finding the strength and depth of character to get back up again and fight through from 6th to silver 0.01sec ahead of Denmark . More on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Denmark after becoming the first Olympic simming champion for her country since Greta Andersen claimed gold in the 100m freestyle at London 1948 . Andersen is a part of Olympic lore not only because she won in London but because she got into competitive sport because her brother would charge his friends to watch his 13-year-old sister wrestle boys older than her to the ground . After Olympic glory , Andersen went on to swim the English Channel six times and set a world record for the crossing in 1964 aged 36 . Now 88 , she still runs a swim school in Florida . <p> More on that beyond the curtain closer ... gold for the USA in the men 's medley relay would deliver Michael Phelps his 28th medal and 23rd gold and the 1000th gold medal in history for the United States in Olympic history -- Olympian Heights and the very Gods could hardly have scripted a better end . <h> Comments <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> That 's the most shocking result : Both Campbell sisters come home without a single individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home without a single individual medal . <p> The collapse of Australian swimmers in this Olympics is simply breathtaking . This is more than just one or two swimmers . What made Australian swimmers so fragile as porcelain doll ? <p> Australian coaches treat their swimmers with kiddie gloves ... they were complaining about everything ... Americans can even win racing in the ocean , they train to expect the worst <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> Amen , BA ! ! Some of the complaints , to be fair , were from the Olympic team itself rather than the swim team , but Horton 's wail to the media about " Sun Yang being a meanie " illustrates the mentality . <p> This has been the Olympics that AUS , not just the swim team , has needed to have . Too many " tourists " , too many over-hyped teams that have fallen face over apex . The entire AUS Olympic body and too many sporting federations , of which Swimming AUS is just one of the most culpable , are still existing in a mindset of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a warning shot that those days are over and its back to being just a strong 2nd division team with certain powerful " niche " . <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> Australian female swimmers in 4 ? 100 medley were fading badly in the final meters . <p> This is clearly a problem of preparation . <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> CW , I disagreed about too many tourists . I think the selectors have weaned off tourists pretty good ( maybe not enough , there were still hansford and palmer ) . <p> Its the collapse of the top swimmers : with the exception of larkin in 200 back NONE of the Australian world champion even medaled in their events . <p> It 's more than shocking . <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> OK , I think this is a worse result for Australia than in London despite more golds . , there were ranked #1 in only 2 events : men 100 free and 4 ? 100 free This time , there were ranked #1 in 10 events ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything less is very poor . 3 golds is a disaster . <p> My comment re tourists was not purely specifying swimming but also the AUS Olympic team in general . Serial non-performing sports &amp; teams are still getting plane tickets . <p> They were much lesser in numbers and at least one who was tracking that way finally stood up ; but I DO totally concur that there was next to no leadership from the " top bracket " . Actually the only clear demonstration on " leadership " that I saw from a senior swimmer was Barratt , not only in the individual but especially the 4 ? 200 . <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> I forgot , WR to Ryan Murphy ! ! ! <p> Larkin 's 53.13 clearly cost Australia silver . His teammates swam fantastic times , and yet he , as the current 100 back world champion , faltered badly . <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> My " bottom line of expectation " was 4 gold &amp; 12 medals with a " worst case scenario " of 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " bottom line " end result as it has to be acknowledged that a good number of the expected golds were cases of narrow favourites that could easily fall either way . <p> What was the shock and leaves a nasty taste is not the close calls not falling AUS way but that almost all the surer bets not only failed to get up but missed podiums ...... and the manner in which these occured <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> I 'm happy that Jake Packard and David Morgan win Olympics medal . They swam very well , but Larkin swam terrible and if not for Chalmers ' 46.72 and Chinese DQ , they would have missed out on a medal . <p> ... and Seebohm gets her first medal of the meet on the women 's last event of the program leading off in 58.83 ... To say she actually performed better in London is a huge understatement . Rio is an epic disaster for Australia ... Sweeping reforms are a must .... <p> August 14 , 2016 <p> CW , " What was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls not falling AUS way but that almost all the surer bets not only failed to get up but missed podiums ...... and the manner in which these occurred " <p> Totally agree ! <p> The question for Australia is : Why ca n't NONE of their #1 swimmers ( with the exception of Groves ) swim their best times of the year at the Olympics ? To give more contrast : Almost all USA #1 swimmers swim their best times of the year in Rio . <p> Agree with ASF , this is worse than London , words fail me . They either peaked early or the sports psychologists did not do their job . Why would n't we try running trials a month before next years world champs , see what happens . And then for Comm games and the following world champs . <p> Times from American Olympic trials were slowler because it appeared as if some of their swimmers were still in their taper , anyone agree ?

 each other in the pool on a daily basis , grinding through difficult sets . Following the last individual event of the program , training partners Gregorio Paltrinieri and Gabriele Detti stared at each other with the knowledge that their work had been rewarded , both Italians on the podium in the 1500 freestyle . <p> Going wire to wire in what was a tour de force performance , Paltrinieri blew away the field and recorded a triumphant time of 14:34.57 , good for a five-second decision over Connor Jaeger , who set an American record with a mark of . was next to the wall , in comfortably for the bronze medal in 14:40.86 . The United States ' Jordan Wilimovsky went a career best of 14:45.03 for fourth . <p> was under world-record pace for the majority of the race , as much as two seconds clear of Sun pace from the London Games in 2012 , when the Chinese star went 14:31.02 . Maintaining the speed required for a global standard proved too difficult , though , Sun 's finishing strength the difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while to soak it all in with everything that I 've done this year , " Paltrinieri said . " Coming here to win this medal means so much . The gold medal was my absolute goal . I believed it was possible , and I had the spirit to fight once I was in the water . I wanted to do it on my own terms , setting my pace , to be in control , and it was perfect . The Olympics are a special race . It 's the one race that all the world is watching . The last four or five days , my confidence was high and I knew I was ready , but there are always little doubts in your mind . Once I was in the water , I felt I was in my element . " <p> Coached by Stefano Morini , Paltrinieri and Detti made Italy the current capital of distance swimming . It was Detti 's second bronze medal of the meet , complementing the one he earned in the 400 freestyle on the opening night of action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As for Paltrinieri , he came through amid high expectations from his country . <p> Earlier this year at the European Championships , Paltrinieri declared himself the hot choice for gold in Rio , a continental record of 14:34.04 good for the No. 2 time in history and placing the spotlight on the Italian . The time from London put Paltrinieri in unique company , too , ahead of the career-best efforts of Grant Hackett and . His outing in Rio ranks at No. 5 all-time . <p> Gregorio Paltrinieri and Gabriele Detti by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> is like a human metronome , moving up and down the pool with precision-like consistency . If his stroke is not aesthetically pleasing , it is highly efficient . The only weapon missing from his arsenal is the ability to sprint at the finish , but with such a large gap on the competition , he did n't need to close like a freight train . <p> " I tried to go out faster and put a gap between me and the others , " Paltrinieri said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters , I was really dead , but I am very happy about this performance . It 's amazing . " <p> By grabbing his second bronze medal , Detti proved his freestyle range . In addition to ranking fourth in the world in both the 400 free and 1500 free , he sits 25th in the 200 freestyle , a sub-1:47 marker his best . <p> " We work well with each other , " Paltrinieri said of his training partner . " We are not rivals in any sense of the word . We train together and we are teammates . To share the podium with him is a special treat . When I 'm in the water , that 's when I 'm happiest . As soon as I win a medal , I 'm thinking about the next challenge , setting the next goals . That 's what gives me the motivation to keep working so hard .

Sun cited an illness for his poor showing , although there is speculation he did not want to tangle with Paltrinieri , and may have permanently retired the metric mile from his program . <p> It was a controversial Games for Sun , who already carries a doping violation from the 2014 campaign . Prior to the start of the meet , he taunted Mack Horton during a training session , going as far as splashing the Aussie to irritate him . Horton , who was fifth in the 1500 free , stayed calm through the incident , focused on his task . He followed by capturing the gold medal in the 400 freestyle on the opening night of action , leaving Sun in his wake . Horton also addressed the pre-meet shenanigans of Sun by stating he does n't have the time to worry about a " drug cheat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doping in sports , it opened the door for others to speak out , notably American Lilly King . It was King who was the most vocal , as she hammered the presence of Russian Yuliya Efimova in Rio , and made it known she does n't feel anyone with a doping violation should receive a berth to the Olympics , including countryman Justin Gatlin , Team USA 's track and field star and threat to Jamaican Usain Bolt in the 100-meter dash . <p> Sun also stirred the scene inside the Aquatics Centre when he was greeted by FINA Executive Director Cornel Marculescu after taking gold in the 200 free , the men embracing on deck and Sun later calling a grandfather figure in his life . For an organization that does not seem concerned with ensuring a drug-free sport , the sight of hugging Sun was a poor optic . <p> What was n't a bad look was the excellence of Paltrinieri , whose willingness to attack was not lost on his rivals . <p> " At a certain point , he just took off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaeger said . " But I could n't . And then you have to hope , ' man , I hope he 's going fast because otherwise I 'm really going pretty slow . ' I have so much respect for that guy . He 's such a hard worker and really talented . " <p> Jaeger took down his American standard from last summer 's World Championships , slicing nearly two seconds from that 14:41.20 . Jaeger has consistently risen up the global distance ranks over the quadrennial , the focus all along on peaking for his second Olympiad . Consider his mission accomplished . <p> While Paltrinieri bolted to the front of the pack , Jaeger sat in fifth- and sixth-place territory for the opening 350 meters , before moving up to third by the 400 . He stayed in that slot for the next six laps , until he moved into second . It 's where he remained , the result the first Olympic medal of his career . <p> " A pretty exciting way for me to end the meet , " Jaeger said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could race again and basically watched Team USA swim out of their minds . I got a little anxious on the bench , so to be able to come back and add to that medal count really means a lot to me because that 's why I 'm here . Because you want to hold up your end , it 's like being on the bench while your team is playing . It 's like , ' coach put me in .

And cerebral palsy , a condition that has suddenly appeared on the profiles of swimmers and others well into careers , may leave one person being able to lead a life close to ' normal ' , while anotger is severely handicapped . <p> Sport-specific classification was created to overcome such problems . And other problems emerged as a result of ... well , human nature . In extremis , there was the entire Spanish basketball that faked disability to win ( and then lose ) paralympic gold at the onset of it all . <p> Dutch Monique van der Vorst claimed two silvers at Beijing 2008 but within years made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that led Der Spiegel , the leading German magazine , to write : <p> " Former competitors and neighbours have reported often seeing the athlete outside of her wheelchair taking a shower , or even dancing .

" <p> So , back to Rio 2016 -- or rather , those refusing to watch it all unfold and seething that " nothing is being done ... about cheating that has official backing and is a deliberate ploy by federations to boost their medal tallies " , according to one Australian observer . <p> " I now know that you Xavier Gonzalez and Philip Craven received these videos of Lakeisha Patterson taken by Australian Sport Scientist Danielle Formosa in June 2016 .

" <p> For 24-year-old Long , on , it was medal No 18 overall , 12 of them gold at four Paralympics . <p> Long was born in Siberia with fibular hemimelia , a birth defect that left her without her fibulas , ankles , heels and most of the other bones in her feet . Soon after being adopted at 13 months old , Long endured multiple surgery , eventually having each of her legs amputated below the knee . Growing up in Baltimore , the home town of the most decorated Olympian all-time , Michael Phelps , Long started swimming at 10 and by 12 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paralympic Games in Athens . <p> It is hard to prove intentional cheating and indeed swimming federations in Australia , Britain and elsewhere would and have denied involvement in any form of manipulation . <p> In swimming , there can be no question that classification remains a troubling issue and is the main reason why paralympic swimming remains a remote country a million miles away from elite able-bodied swimming . <p> Swimming is a sport in which the clock decides -- easy and brutal get to the wall first , gold , then next two home , silver and bronze . No judges ( beyond those watching for rules being observed or not ) to hand out points and assessments . <p> Swimming is also a sport in which balance and angles of buoyancy are critical to speed and efficiency in water . And yet , we witness races between people whose disabilities dictate vast differences in balance and angle of buoyancy . Races in which one man has one arm , another has none to speak of and others have two arms are races in which the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pre-determined . <p> Beyond races that are not like elite races , what you are then left with for obvious value is the very clear celebration of human achievement at the Paralympics . <p> If that is tainted by alleged cheating , the IPC has a serious problem to overcome . Where some feel awkwardness tackling the issues of ' cheating ' in paralympic sports , the doers in that world do not . <p> Go back a couple of seasons and we find wheelchair users taking to street protests in wheelbarrows to highlight the plight of those who wait for years on end to gain access to the right kind of equipment vital to their being mobile and active . At the fore is Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson . <p> The Wheelchair Leadership Alliance , established this year , presented a 10-point document in the British parliament to politicians , providers and manufacturers , urging them to commit to the development of an effective National Health Service wheelchair service . The alliance says that delays in service cause waste and harm to wheelchair users . <p> To have Baroness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as role model and campaigner on such issues has helped to transform the whole debate and improve the lives of those living with disability . <p> In that sense , the Paralympics is golden . <p> All the more urgent and important , then , to take the Fair Play debate by the horns . <p> When the story of Elliot was raised , Swimming Australia categorically denied any attempt to play the system to any advantage . In response to questions from SwimVortex.com , the federation issued the following statement : <p> " There was definitely no intent to breach any rules . It has been the Paralympic swim team 's practice and the instruction to our coaches for all our swimmers to do their absolute best . <p> " The Australian Dolphins Swim Teams always operate within the spirit of the rules and that includes never taking an unfair advantage and to make informed and honourable decisions at all times . " <p> In reply to questions from SwimVortex.com , a spokesman for the IPC noted that the speed of the swimmer was one of several elements considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it came to making decisions : <p> " During classification , the ability of the swimmer is looked at , not how quickly or slowly they can swim . Although IPC Swimming does monitor performance , it is not the primary driver in determining classification , and it must be stressed that the chief classifier can intervene at any moment if they have concerns . " <p> Moreover , participants were well aware of the rules , the spokesman added : " Swimmers , their coaches and their countries are also fully aware that the IPC deems intentional misrepresentation in any para-sport a serious offence which can result in disqualification of results and a suspension of two years . " <p> The IPC also confirmed : <p> " In the case of Australia 's Maddison Elliott no country has lodged a formal protest with IPC Swimming . " <p> It is understood that the IPC will , however , investigate the circumstances related to Maddison Elliott 's classification in Glasgow . <p> In the midst of discussion a year ago , SwimVortex heard from sources close to the Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go slow in first-appearance swims . One source wrote : " I ... have no doubt ... that she ( Maddison Elliot ) would 've been told to swim slowly in that S9 100 back . I have no doubt because it 's happened by Australian swimmers many times before and I have specific examples of that from team experience . " <p> It was , the source said , fairly normal for swimmers to " deliberately swim slowly in the heats on day 1 to confirm their classification before performing considerably faster at night " . <p> In the response from the IPC , the spokesman noted the relativity opt speed : <p> " One last point is that not everything in para-swimming is classification related . If an able-bodied swimmer puts in a slow time , it is put down to a " bad day " , so not every time difference in performance in para-swimming should be put down to " wrong classification .

 officially thrown its weight behind plans to have anti-doping removed from the auspices of FINA . <p> Some 10 weeks after Bob Bowman and Michael Phelps said at the Rio Olympic Games that responsible authorities had dropped the ball when it came to protecting clean athletes and providing the best environment for clean sport , the American federation that represents them has backed moves to take anti-doping out of the hands of bodies such as FINA and make the realm " independent from all sport organizations and from influence from governments " . <p> The stance was taken a week out from the International Olympic Committee 's Olympic Summit in Lausanne today . The gathering will reinforce the IOC 's wish to have anti-doping removed from the auspices of international federations in a move to a fully independent system . <p> World Anti-Doping Agency bosses will be among those at the think-tank session , the meaning of " independent " among those that will come under close scrutiny in the days and weeks and months ahead of a summit build on the basis of invitations from the IOC and appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversight of process ( see foot of this article for the list of those attending ) . The opening gambit is very much an internal affair . <p> USA Swimming pledged its support for independence in a letter to USADA boss Travis Tygart in which the swim federation lends its support to " USADA 's efforts to bring about change to the global anti-doping efforts and organisation " . <p> American swim bosses voluntary , Jim Sheehan , USA Swimming 's president , and paid , Chuck Wielgus , executive director , and the leadership of USA Swimming have lent their support to proposals for anti-doping reform agreed at a gathering of iNADO in late August . <p> " Anti-doping efforts around the world need to be independent from all sport organizations and from influence from governments . Without true independence and the ability to take on not only those individuals who are cheating but also the systematic programs we have seen causing irreparable harm to the clean athletes of the world . " <p> Tygart , meanwhile , has called pro-Russian hacking team Fancy Bears " con artists " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cover ups " by US sports officials in a series of email exchanges including USADA staff . Tygart 's response : <p> " This is just another desperate attempt to distract from the real issue of state-sponsored doping . " <p> In July , a WADA-commissioned report from Prof. Richard McClaren outlined state-backed doping of athletes and cover-ups that included exchanging samples said to contain banned substances with clean urine collected on previous occasions with the approval of Russian Government officials . <p> Since then the Fancy Bears have released the medical records of some of the world 's biggest sports stars , stolen from the World Anti-Doping Agency database " ADAMS " . The " revelations " are largely based on the legitimate Therapeutic Use Exemptions that allow athletes to take medicines containing banned substances for specific periods of time and under particular circumstances . <p> The issues has raised questions about whether some athletes and programs are abusing the TUE system in order to take banned substances t enhance performance . <p> The latest FB release includes email exchanges between anti-doping officials , one of them requesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elevated level of testosterone . The emails in question appear to show that officials were attempting to build a longer-term profile to ascertain whether they were looking at a problem or not . That is a fairly common practice in anti-doping but FB 's uses that as an example of cover-up . <p> Travis Tygart <p> Tygart nows says that Fancy Bears is simply trying to " smear the reputations of athletes and organisations from around the world who choose to operate with integrity and abide by the rules " . He told the BBC : <p> " They are con artists . We are confident that people will see this for what it is : a malicious and illegal invasion of athlete privacy followed by a baseless smear campaign . " <p> He highlighted errors in the FB releases , noting that where Fancy Bears claim the USADA " granted " 583 TUEs in 2015 the figure is actually for applications those , 402 were approved . <p> Meanwhile , the Olympic Summit today will start the process of thrashing out some of the details likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-doping efforts in the wake of a quarter of a century of failure on the part of the IOC , FINA and other federations to deal with the systematic doping programs operated by the German Democratic Republic and related crisis points across many Olympic sports in the intervening years . <p> The past having been left to lie like a sleeping dog , the IOC , FINA and related bodies were forced to face doping demons in Rio this summer past in the wake of the Russian doping crisis . <p> Three reports pointed to state involvement and even backing for doping in sport . The last of the reports , from Prof. Richard McLaren , came with a recommendation for a blanket ban on Russia for Rio 2016 . The IOC disagreed , handed responsibility for who could race and who could not back to international federations and the net effect in swimming was to have all swimmers with previous doping records but qualified for action in Rio back on their blocks . <p> Mack Horton of Australia by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Lilly King by Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their feelings known with booing and jeering aimed at those who raced with a doping record in tow . Criticism of those in charge of anti-doping was voiced by the most decorated Olympian all-time , Michael Phelps , his coach Bob Bowman , as well as Olympic champions Mack Horton and Lilly King , among others . <p> In terms of booing and jeering in Rio , none felt the heat more than California-based Russian Yuliya Efimova , whose case has caused USA Swimming to impose new rules governing coaches who guide overseas swimmers at US programs . <p> The latter followed new Swimming Australia rules that forbid swimmers with a doping record from training at a funded centre and oblige all overseas visitors training Down Under to submit to and pay for Australian out-of-competition testing upon demand . <p> No greater example was there of FINA wearing two hats , promoter and hunter of ' stars ' , than when Cornel Marculescu , director of the international federation , rushed on to the Olympic deck to hug Sun Yang* after the Chinese swimmer towing a doping ban claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the 2015 world titles that Marculescu told German TV : <p> " You can not condemn the stars for a minor doping offence " . <p> Foxes guarding henhouses do n't go : that is what it comes down to , say Tygart and others . The USADA boss tells the BBC this morning that the argument for independent anti-doping control from top to bottom had been there for many years and that it was sad that it took the Russian doping crisis to force the issue . <p> Tygart noted that there were other realms in the state/company , while it had a role in funding aspects of governance and oversight had no direct influence on that oversight . What is clear is that what have been seen as relationships all too cosy can not be allowed to prevail . <p> Sun called a grandfather figure to him and great friend of Chinese swimming .

The Olympic Summit will discuss some principles for a more robust , more efficient and more independent worldwide anti-doping system . <p> " This will include a reinforcement of the request issued by the Olympic Summit on 17 October 2015 to make the entire anti-doping system independent from sports organisations .

 Burgh , of South Africa , whose medals may help to subsidise his subsidising of the South African swim federation - by Patrick B.

Any success they have in Windsor will help them to subsidise their subsidisation of the South African federation . <p> Alongside a statement naming its team , the South African swim federation lays out the conditions of selection , namely you 'll be paying for yourself . <p> Calling the ' tour ' to the showcase " subsidised " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estimated 30,000 rand ( about $2,000 ) with the authority by November 1 . <p> Those who do n't wo n't be going , international selection not a question of merit nor even capacity to stand up , make finals and win medals ( the likes of Roland Schoeman are not among those named ) . Instead , the ability to pay the bulk of costs in order to take up selection is what counts . <p> In letters sent to swimmers by Shaun Adriaanse , the federation Chief Executive , makes clear that paying their own way does not free the swimmers from the team agreements that stretch all the way to any obligations that come with racing at a FINA event nor does it extend any rights in terms of choosing their own accommodation . They will stay in a hotel chosen for them by a body that can not afford to pay for that hotel . <p> The situation sums the current status of swimmers in world swimming : they have no rights . Understanding of such things does not need to run deep . Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill of $1500 and then finding a yoghurt sponsor to come up with that moment in support of the swimmer 's international selection . <p> What that sponsor would see next is clear : the swimmer will race at world titles with the name of a rival product on their cap because the money flow primarily goes through FINA and the federations , while the rights of swimmers to have their own sponsors and control what happens with their image(s) are all but non-existent . <p> In return for the benefits of that status ( the right to compete , full stop ) , the South African swimmer is asked to pay their own way to a event . <p> The picture includes this : while a South African swimmer is being asked for $1200-1500 to pay his/her way to the world championships , South African delegates to FINA commissions who might be called on to perform the onerous task of sitting in a short meeting while in Windsor to discuss issues that could write easily be handled via email will be subsidised to the tune of full travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Total estimated bill for a South African delegate paid for by FINA this December : at least $3,500 . <p> The South African situation sums up the status of swimming as a ' professional sport ' : by the thread of its teeth and not at all for the majority of elite athletes . The bulk of FINA member federations struggle to survive as proper entities able to pay their own way in the world . <p> In Windsor , modest prize money for those who make the podium is where the swimmer may gain beyond the medals won . Where prize money is being used to subsidise the swimmer 's passage to the event , the money is no longer a prize , one might argue . <p> The issues at the heart of the South African situation also sit at the heart of reasons why FINA needs radical reform or replacement if swimming is to become a sport that holds athlete interest as a priority and finds a way to make its presence felt in us to do so . <p> ' And when

 Olympics long gone , SwimVortex continues its look at the reflections of the champions and others who stepped up on the podium at the Games in August , at the things that flowed from success and plans already made for the follow-up . <p> Mireia Belmonte : two silvers at London 2012 , a bronze in the 400m medley on day one of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . The best was yet to come : 200m butterfly , gold , the first ever Olympic title in the pool for a Spanish woman . <p> The pioneer , coached by Fred , the man who yet again was named Spain 's mentor of the year of late , achieved her " lifelong dream " in Rio but the striving will not stop there . Belmonte will race a " as many events as I can " in search of berths at the Budapest world titles in July next year , she revealed to Spanish media this weekend on return to full-flight training beyond sitting a degree exam . <p> The 26-year-old had suspended studies on the way to Rio but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advertising and public relations . How had it gone ? " In the Olympic year I had less time for studies , but since the Games I was able prepare for this exam and I think it went well . We 'll see , " she told Ideal . <p> Belmonte may yet become something of a pioneer in Europe , along with 60 or so other Spanish Olympians who were able to continue to study at university while continuing to train in their respective sports thanks to a tutoring project that the European Union is seeking to spread to colleges and universities across 27 countries ( discounting Britain , which is on a course to leave the union ) . <p> Mireia Belmonte by Patrick B.

The magician told Spanish media this week that he 's working on a trick to make Donald Trump disappear but Spanish audiences are more interested in what he 's been up to with Belmonte . <p> Asked by domestic media if he 'd made the swimmer 's Olympic medal disappear , he replied : " No but we did play a game with her and it 'll be well worth watching ... swimming fascinates me and Belmonte is a living legend . We experienced the magic of water . <p> Belmonte experienced that back on August 11 in Rio . <p> On a night of fast firsts and results , Belmonte joined the history makers as the first woman ever to reign for Spain in the Olympic pool at the end of a crackling battle with Australian Maddie Groves that ended with gold 0.03sec ahead of silver , the bronze , further adrift , returned to Natsumi Hoshi , of Japan , four years on . <p> It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympic pool .

It is n't hard to see how well it all works , from the facilities , sporting , catering and sleeping to an environment dedicated to singular attention and backed up by oodles of support , knowledge and an understanding that flows from top to bottom . <p> That much is obvious when Alfonso Sanchez , a retired boxer and one of the top men running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask if all is well and if there 's anything he needs . The personal tough is obvious at many levels , biomechanists on tap for filming , measuring , monitoring and analysis , physios and medical staff no more than a short corridor away at any time , the ' how can we help ' approach extending to the chefs in the kitchen and other staff around the venue . <p> After we 've spoken about the impact of altitude camp and how it works , the obvious question seems to be ' why not base yourselves here most of the time , then ' ? smiles . He would like Spanish swimming to spend more of its time on high and use the national centre more like its two siblings in Madrid and Barcelona : as a permanent base . <p> " If I stay in Spain then my plan is to be here more of the time . Look at Font Romeu in France and the centre there : its almost a permanent home for some swimmers , pentathletes , triathletes , wrestlers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that here ? It makes no sense not to do that . " <p> Americans also use altitude and replicate the effects of it ( hypoxic tents ) on an ongoing training basis not just for short camps , he notes . " There 's no full-time squad at altitude here but we go up and down on a regular basis , the distance group for three to four weeks at a time , the juniors for two weeks and the folk for one to two weeks in adaptation phases . <h> Why Altitude ? <p> Many studies , much research under the bridge , altitude training is simple to understand at face value : live and train at altitude for several weeks and the body adapts to the shortage of oxygen . The most important adaptation for the endurance athlete is an increase in the number of red blood cells , which are produced in response to greater release of the hormone erythropoietin ( EPO ) by the kidneys . Red cells carry oxygen to muscles ; the more red cells , the more oxygen , better the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the extra blood cells , in theory and in practice ( say those who have seen it work ) supercharge the athlete by natural gains in red-cell count ( as well as the workloads endured in training , of course ) . As experts point out , it is not always that simple and things can go wrong , as this article discusses . <p> Asked why altitude , Vergnoux says : " The purpose is from a physiological point of view is to get the swimmers fitter . <p> " And the reason we repeat it up to four times a year is that science shows that if you 're going to do it then do it on a regular basis not just one short camp , which achieves not very much . " <p> Take this season : world long-course championships is main objective . As such , says the coach , " we have a main camp finishing three weeks before the start of racing ( at worlds ) and come down to put the finishing touches to the preparation . " <p> A camp late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea level in the first test of the year ; then it was straight back up for the current camp , which will stretch into March . Says Vergnoux : <p> " It is important o bounce from camp to camp and doing that we keep the level of fitness at a consistently high level throughout the season . " <h> Why " Focus " Camp ? <p> There is an element of bubble about the Spanish national training centre at CAR here in the Sierra Nevada . There are moments of escape , such as sorties down to Granada , the Med coast not much further afield , and through skiing and other ways of having fun in the snow ( as I sat in the restaurant having breakfast I noticed the snow-covered football pitch on the roof of one of the buildings and out of sporting bounds at this time of year was dotted with snowmen , a couple of ice sculptures and even a fairly sizeable igloo : the creative side of the athlete will out . <p> The point of being here , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the one time and place for a meaningful period . Says Vergnoux : <p> " For me , camp is a place where you focus on the work : we have everything within 2-minute walking distance here . There are no distractions , we can work properly , we eat properly ; each swimmer has their own room ; the beds are amazing ; the food is just what they need ; we have medical support here ; biomechanists and physios ; saunas , jacuzzi for recovery . " <p> Tutors come in and out to help the swimmers with studies and even invigilate when exams have to be taken . <p> No question that the level of comfort and ease of it all is tremendous ( I confirm the beds and food are good , too ) but the gains to be had for Vergnoux 's team and others visiting squads this week , clubs from German and Denmark are here , while next week sees the arrival of a squad from Japan and the facility is used by several other nations with world-class swimmers to boast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to offer , this is no holiday camp , notes : <p> " We actually do more work than what we do back home and also do more volume but it is more relaxed , 7am to 8pm almost non-stop . Because of the time we have and the time we take , because of the mountains , the nice weather , it is all low-key in one way ; we have no stress and there are no distractions . " <p> " My philosophy is ' why would we do less here than we would do back home . The work is extended over lengthier periods but overall it is more and more intense . We have five years of stats and analyses to rely on now and I 'm looking at what others are doing and finding out , too . " <p> Sweden , for example , has been testing holding taper phase at altitude . There is some evidence that it worked well for Sarah Sjostrom , says . There will be no experiments on the cusp of a major , however . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts , turns , a gentle pace toy all things but you 're at altitude so you 're getting the benefits of rest but still maintaining consistent gains of altitude . " <h> Discipline , Determination , Dedication <p> guides , instructs , sets parameters ; he does n't raise his voice , he explains when asked and sometimes when not asked . he has eight swimmers in the water , most with international experience , a dream focus for any coach . He uses his chance well . And so do the athletes , a group supportive of each other , happy in each other 's company in water , gym , meal times and leisure . So oft have I heard ' swimmers are so ... well , nice " . <p> As you sit with Belmonte , Barbosa ( more on them in the not-too-distant ) and Co , it is very easy to agree . Barbosa is the dad of the team , at 30 a husband and a man with experience high and low on his way to a crack at a home Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quiet support and fine guidance , as eluded to by Hannah Miley at the end of a recent visit to the camp . <p> One gym session this week went ahead with only the athletes in the room . When we arrived at the door and peered through a small porthole , each and every athlete was busy doing a dedicated exercise , not one of them stopped , staring , chatting or unfocussed . A radio plays music and there is time between stations to exchange a few words , a joke here and there , between teammates . <p> " They know what they have to do , " says and they know that in the end it is up to them what level they have put in . The swimmers come to train , they listen to music and stretch and have more time to do things like that without rushing off to meet a girlfriend , boyfriend , make it home in time for a meal or a family occasion . Here , we 're not dependent on the time . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in the early morning and then another session in the afternoon . That schedule is dictated by school and pools and other things but here it is not like that . So why not train 3 hours in the pool . Personally , I 'm happy with two and a half hour sessions . <p> " Back home it is a little more complicated . Here they bounce from the pool to the gym , to recovery and testing and back again . " Last evening ended with a one-hour recovery session in the spa . Notes : <p> " Normally that kind of recovery would last 20 minutes and then they need to get moving . Here , recovery is part of a full job . " <p> Full job is spot on for this Spanish centre . Hard to want for better , swim , setting and all . Temporary home to Vergnoux and Belmonte and her teammates today , potentially a more permanent post for a Spanish squad in the years ahead . <p> That 's for the then ; for the now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate of events , decisions about which events to focus on to be left until the selection job is done . It being the world champs year , her focus at world titles may span the spectrum of her favourite and her least favourite races : respectively 200m butterfly , for which she is world and Olympic silver medallist and European champion , and the 1500m freestyle , for which she is European champion . <p> If last year was transition season for Belmonte , this one has world titles at the helm of intent that rests its cap in Rio next year four years on from silver over 800m freestyle and 200m butterfly in London . <p> In common with all her teammates , Belmonte gave a thumbs up to altitude when asked which she felt was the more efficient contributor to progress each season , up high or down at sea level . She 's learned to understand how it feels and to harness the gains to be had . She says : <p> " When I come down from altitude , I for the first two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You get lots of oxygen , too much . Then about the fifth day you feel better . " <p> Cue big smile on the face of a racer , a feisty competitor , a champion honed at altitude who has proven time and again that she is capable of stepping up on the biggest days of all in the us to do so . <p> Are humans doomed 
 the case , the Texas Hall of Fame Invitational has brought together some of the top collegians in the American system , and that contingent of athletes did not disappoint as individual action got under way on Thursday . As strong as the competition was , however , it 's hard to argue that any event was more impressive than the men 's 500-yard freestyle . <p> Olympian Clark Smith of Texas , a former NCAA champion in the event , was the class of the 500 free , prevailing in a stellar mark of 4:11.20 . Having surprisingly missed the final of the 500 free at last year 's NCAA Champs , Smith 's triumph in the midyear prep meet was a good sign on the road to reclaiming his title . More , Smith had to defeat a quality field . <p> While Smith was the lone athlete to crack 4:12 , Stanford University had three guys in the , with Grant Shoults going 4:12.03 as the runnerup . He was followed by Cardinal teammates True Sweetser ( 4:12.97 ) and Liam Egan ( 4:12.99 ) . Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold medal 800 free relay from last summer 's Olympic Games , was fifth in 4:14.36 . <p> Texas did n't just receive a sterling effort from Smith . The Longhorns opened the session with a victory in the 200 freestyle relay , the foursome of Tate Jackson , Brett Ringgold , John Shebat and Jack Conger edging Stanford , 1:16.73 to 1:16.88 . Texas also won the 400 medley relay as the unit of Shebat , Will Licon , Conger and Ringgold went 3:05.63 . <p> Stanford 's Abraham Devine topped the field in the 200 individual medley , going 1:43.02 , while Texas ' Madisyn Cox was the female winner in 1:52.83 . Wisconsin 's Cierra Runge , another U.S. Olympian , won the 500 free in 4:35.55 and Arizona 's Katrina Konopka went 21.90 to win the 50 free . The men 's 50 free was captured by BYU 's Payton Sorenson in 19.22 . <h> Sprint Triumph From Amanda Weir Headlines Action At U.S. Nationals <p> A third Olympic appearance notched over the summer , Amanda Weir kept her strong campaign going with a triumph in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her home state and was the only performer to crack the 22-second barrier , thanks to a mark of 21.81 . That performance supplied Weir with a half-second cushion . <p> Melanie Margalis by Peter Bick <p> Olympian Melanie Margalis , who just missed the podium over the summer in Rio , established a championship record in the 200 individual medley , her winning time of 1:53.16 more than four seconds clear of the competition . An event later , Vini Lanza took top honors among the men , as he registered a mark of 1:43.57 . <p> A final-lap surge by Lindsey Clary carried the Ohio State standout past Brooke Zieger for victory in the 500 freestyle , Clary touching in 4:39.33 and close behind in 4:39.55 . For the men , the 500 title remained with a Big Ten Conference athlete as Indiana 's Marwan El Kamash , an Egyptian Olympian , covered us to do so . <h> Next In Technology 
 Up American Record 43.84 In 100-Yard Fly At United States Nationals <p> Anyone familiar with the career of Tom Shields is aware of his short-course exploits , fueled largely by his stellar underwater skills . While Shields has developed into a world-class performer in the long-course realm , highlighted by an Olympic berth last summer , the former Cal-Berkeley star made his earliest headlines in the little pool . <p> As the United States National Championships moved into their third day on Friday night , Shields was the dominant athlete , thrilling the crowd in Atlanta with an American and U.S. Open record in the 100-yard butterfly . Shields blazed his way to a time of 43.84 , a mark that bettered the U.S. Open standard of 44.01 , set at last year 's NCAA Championships by Joseph Schooling of Singapore . Meanwhile , Shields bettered the American record of 44.18 , set by Austin Staab at the height of the shiny suits in 2009 . <p> Out in 20.57 at the 50-yard mark , Shields already had nearly a second advantage through two laps , and the only question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trouble brining the race home , either , and finished well ahead of runnerup ( 45.56 ) . During his collegiate days , Shields was an NCAA champion in the event . <p> With Schooling sitting as the reigning Olympic champion in the 100 fly and only in his junior season at the University of Texas , there 's a good chance Shields ' record might endure for just a few months . Still , the effort was a splendid way to open December and generate momentum for next week 's World Short Course Championships in Canada . <p> " I set that goal as one of my first long-term goals ever , " Shields said . " I was able to pop that 44 when I was 18 and I was like , ' Oh man , maybe I can make this happen , and it never did . ' You know , these guys , back in my day NCAAs was a three-day meet . I always had seven swims on that day and we were taught and brought up on our team to care more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team title and fortunately we were able to make that happen . I do n't know how much that took away from my individual 100 ( butterfly ) at NCAAs , but I think that 's pretty equivalent to where I 'm at , short course meters . It was just fun and exciting to come and race this course . I have n't done it in forever . " <p> While Shields was in record-setting mode and also won the 100 backstroke in 45.11 , fellow Olympians Kevin Cordes and looked strong in their events . Cordes covered the 100 breaststroke in 51.88 while Margalis doubled a night after winning the 200 individual medley . Margalis added triumphs in the 200 freestyle ( 1:43.72 ) and 100 breaststroke ( 58.09 ) . <p> Brooke Zeiger ( 4:02.71 ) and Sean Grieshop ( 3:44.69 ) notched victories in the 400 individual medley and Aliena Schmidtke was tops in the women 's 100 fly in 51.87 . Maxime Rooney touched the wall first in the 200 freestyle in and Bridgette Alexander prevailed in the 100 back in 52.53 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Georgia Invitational <p> He might be better known for his accomplishments in the 400 individual medley , but Georgia 's Chase Kalisz can put together a splendid effort at half the distance , too . The Olympic silver medalist in the 400 medley , Kalisz won the 200 I.M. on the first day of the Georgia Invitational in 1:41.26 , defeating Cal 's Andrew Seliskar ( 1:42.41 ) and Ryan Murphy ( 1:42.53 ) in a loaded field . <p> The night was filled with big names supplying top-flight efforts , as Olivia Smoliga of Georgia topped the field in the 50 free in 21.58 . Smoliga 's Georgia teammate , Chantal Van Landeghem of Canada , was next in 21.76 , with U.S. Olympic teammate Abbey Weitzeil of Cal third in 21.81 . Meanwhile , Cal 's Kathleen Baker was victorious in the 200 medley in 1:53.41 , with Michigan 's Gillian Ryan first in the 500 free in . <p> The Cal men and women each doubled in the 200 freestyle relay and 400 medley relay , with Murphy handling legs on both relays as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times of 1:16.94 and 3:03.82 . The women went 1:26.31 in the 200 free relay to scare the NCAA record , Weitzeil on the leadoff leg . <h> Texas Paced By Olympians Jack Conger and Townley Haas At Home Invite <p> On a journey to end his senior season at Texas with his first solo NCAA title , Jack Conger powered to victory in the 100 butterfly at the Texas Hall of Fame Invitational , breaking the 45-second barrier with a swim of 44.94 . In helping the Longhorns to back-to-back NCAA team titles , Conger has flirted with NCAA crowns on several occasions , and could cap his career with one this year . <p> In the 200 freestyle , Texas ' Townley Haas won from an outside lane , his clocking of 1:33.72 a good marker for the reigning NCAA champ . Haas has the ability to be the next American star in the 200 freestyle and was a member of the United States ' gold-medal winning 800 free relay at the Olympic Games in Rio . <p> Among the women 's highlights was a win by Sweden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51.17 ) and Madisyn Cox going 4:03.16 to win us to do so . <p> The call , 
 young guns in the American arsenal put together superb performances on the middle night of the three-day , Chase Kalisz and Ryan Murphy excelling in the midseason collegiate competition . While Kalisz pulled off a double for the University of Georgia , Murphy was untouchable in his prime event for Cal-Berkeley . <p> The silver medalist in the 400 individual medley at last summer 's Olympic Games , Kalisz won the short-course version of that event on Saturday night , going 3:36.98 to beat fellow Olympian and Georgia teammate Jay Litherland ( 3:38.19 ) . Kalisz was back in the water later in the session to win the 100 breaststroke in 52.31 . <p> Kalisz is back on the college scene after taking a redshirt season last year to place his sole focus on Olympic preparation . With his return to the roster , and with the Bulldogs featuring a deep squad , coach Jack Bauerle has Georgia positioned for a strong showing at the NCAA Championships in March , a top-five finish certainly within target . <p> While Kalisz doubled individually , Murphy complemented a solo triumph in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A few months removed from winning three gold medals in Rio , including a world-record effort on the front of the American 400 medley relay , Murphy blasted the field in the 100-yard back , going 44.61 . He also handled legs on the first-place 200 medley relay ( 1:23.76 ) and 800 freestyle relay ( 6:16.22 ) . <p> Justin Lynch added a win for Cal in the 100 butterfly , clocking 45.85 , and freshman Michael Jensen prevailed in the 200 free in 1:33.76 , along with anchoring both winning relays . For the Cal women , Amy Bilquist and Abbey Weitzeil were part of two winning relays , with Bilquist besting the competition in the 100 backstroke in 51.12 , Georgia Olympian Olivia Smoliga just behind in 51.24 . The Golden Bears also received a victory from Canadian Noemie Thomas in the 100 fly ( 50.67 ) . <h> Will Licon Shines In 200 Breaststroke at Texas Invitational <p> For much of the fall season , Will Licon has been quiet for two-time defending NCAA Champion Texas , racing primarily in off events . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show in his best event , the 200 breaststroke . The titlist in the event at the last two NCAA Championships , Licon notched a time of 1:50.76 to win by more than four seconds . <p> It was the latest strong outing by a Longhorn , but not the only one on the last night of action . Clark Smith added a victory in the 1650 freestyle , going 14:32.77 , and Jack Conger won the 200 fly in 1:40.24 . Texas also took top honors in the 400 freestyle relay , Conger helping that squad win in 2:51.24 . The Longhorns will only gain power going forward , too , as Joseph Schooling works his way into a full schedule . <p> Sweden 's Louise Hansson , in her first year at USC , was swiftest in the 100 freestyle , covering her four laps in 47.55 , while Texas ' Madisyn Cox wrapped up an excellent weekend with a third individual crown , this time a victory in the 200 breaststroke ( 2:07.21 ) . Wisconsin 's Cierra Runge won the 1650 free in 15:52.22 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distance <p> The last night of U.S. Nationals in Atlanta was headlined by Kevin Cordes completing a sweep of the breaststroke events , the Olympian posting a mark of 1:53.51 for a comfortable triumph .

 57.12 victory in the 100m breaststroke at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games marked the most momentous swim of the year - coach Mel Marshall , inset with Peaty , now aims to have winning ways ripple out to a wider swim world in Britain from the Loughborough ' hub ' - main image by Patrick B. Kraemer , inset courtesy of Marshall and Peaty <p> talks to coach Mel Marshall in her first interview since being made lead coach at the Loughborough National Centre in Britain <p> What she wants them to see is a coach for all skills and personalities , a coach who wants to know from the get go what the person standing in front of them is all about : what drives them to the water ; what gets them up each morning ; what makes them tick ; and what strengths can help to make them the best they can be ; what weaknesses need to be ironed out . Marshall will have a one-on-one relationship with each of her charges . She will insist on it . <p> Not so much towing as buoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a coach these past two Olympic cycles and the lessons learned at City of Derby with Peaty and mates , Marshall not only intends to work with the individual in the team but is thinking well beyond the box of her own pool . <p> Loughborough is to be a hub , a swap shop of excellence open to swimmers and coaches from around the country not only the talents in residence . To some extent , it has already been that . Peaty , for example , is no stranger to the place , the centre a temporary , long-course home from his Derby home during the years of preparation for Rio 2016 . <p> Marshall intends to take things to the next level , for the individual(s) and the hub . <p> Asked by SwimVortex to outline some first key tasks on the job in Loughborough Marshall says : <p> " I 've always believed that every individual who walks through door is unique . Yes , there are general things that apply but it is that individual formula and code that you need to crack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding the individual and what works for them and finding the best development path that completely suits suits that individual . " <p> How had that worked out in a club program with the demands of a program stretching from the minnow , the swim-along and along the spectrum to Olympic gold prospect ? <p> " At Derby , we created our own sectionalised elite group . I had six swimmers in that group for the past three years . It is just about changing your dynamic within that bored club situation . You kind of have to mould yourself as a coach . How I am for Adam is not how I am with or for others . There is the wider picture and the specific picture and within that the individual performer and performance . " <p> Just how the dynamic will work at Loughborough will remain in-house . British Swimming made its agenda clear on the day it announced Marshall 's appointment but what the coach is prepared to say nails the overall goal : <p> " We are going to harness the things that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that program . " <p> All eyes on Peaty , of course . He 's no longer a prospect and promise . He 's the real deal : an Olympic champion who converted to the next level with a series of stunning world records before and after a brace of world titles . His victory over 100m breaststroke in Rio marked the performance in the Olympic pool ( and any other pool ) of the year . <p> Peaty not to mention his mum , Caroline will no longer struggle with a 45-min one-way pool run . He lives an eight-minute drive from the Loughborough pool . There 's be other changes , too , Marshall acknowledges . <p> " Yes , there 'll be a shift in dynamic . He 's excited about the change . For the past eight years we 've had an incredibly good run . Now it will be " full-time " and we will work out just how that change will look . It will involve having more people to work off and fresh people to work off . Adam 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peaty is already enjoying it . Marshall had a smile on her face when looking across the lanes of late to see Peaty and developing backstroke ace Luke Greenbank " bouncing off each other , having a good time ... he 's got adults around him and working alongside him and he can have a banter with them " . How significant is that ? Says Marshall : <p> " I would n't want anyone to take this the wrong way but the fact is , swimming involves a really boring preparation . It 's five hours a day in water and then gym ; six and a half hours of preparation a day . A lot of that is ' go up and there and come back ' and we have to be innovative in the ay we deliver what we do . You have to think how do we engage the individuals and liven up that process . " <p> Adam Peaty and coach Mel Marshall <p> A process that will not stop at Peaty and Loughborough . " We are going to be a hub for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will deliver the best practice and only the best will do . " <p> Skills , work ethic , fast swimming but also happy rounded folk ? <p> " Absolutely : it is my belief that we want to be better people through sport , not worse . My philosophy is that through what we do and the work at the hubs like Loughborough , as well as out there in the clubs beyond , we can help swimmers be better equipped for life , better able to cope , become better people and role models . I have some ideas about how we can bring that to life . " <p> The work is not only ' there and back ' nor even confined to the water or gym . " If when standing in the arena on the big occasion all you are is a swimmer in a frightening place , it is n't going to go the best . We 're also responsible for placing confidence in the human and that involves working with the human not just the swimmer . " <p> Tomorrow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of Olympic year , Marshall , Peaty and others from Britain , will arrive in Dubai for a two-week pre-Christmas camp , the next long-course journey well underway . <p> The group will be hosted once more by Hamilton Aquatics , where coach Chris Tidy and his team have played a part in the progress of Peaty , Marshall and others from Britain . Says Marshall : " Throughout the journey they 've been really supportive of the fact that we come from a place where we have n't got pools . " those 50m long , where the water is ' owned ' by those on a performance pathway <h> Plaudits For the City of Derby Swimming Club , the Source of Success <p> Adam Peaty 57.13 -- something to smile about by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Adam Peaty by LaPresse for arena <p> They have such a pool now , Loughborough a fine facility to call home , notes Marshall before she grants a careful and heartfelt thanks to the source of success . <p> " For me , I 'm really excited about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance in Britain going forward but I 'd like to say a very big thanks to my club City of Derby SC ; all the experiences at that program bolstered my security and my confidence . They say you never get over our first love and that is the case : I will always cherish and be thankful for everything they did for me and for that moment eight years ago when they took a chance on me by appointing her head coach . " <p> Could she recall what it felt like to walk out as coach on that first day in a new life ? <p> There 's a slight pause , a tiny window of reflection , a small gulp , perhaps . <p> " That first day I remember thinking that the role , the job ahead excited me from the very start and it still does , so I think it must be the right job for me . I ca n't think of anything better than to get the chance to enthuse people ... and show them that they are capable of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Such notions have their roots in the swimmer that was and remains Mel Marshall , coached at Loughborough by Ben Titley , now in Canada and steering the likes of Penny Oleksiak to Olympic gold , at a time when Bill Sweetenham was turning the Britain ship around , not without a wave of challenge in the mix ? <p> " Absolutely . I spoke at the World-class Coaches Conference on Monday ; it was the keynote speech . I chose to speak about the highs and lows of being a swimmer myself . My experience has been really valuable and that journey as an athlete has really helped me to navigate my way in the world-class arena . I know what it is to have heavy legs you ca n't move , when you 're arms just wo n't work and I know what kind of mechanism to put around you to get you through that . The athlete still stays in me and helps me to remember what it was like . <p> " You have to put people before performance . If you put people first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with human beings and we must never forget that . " <p> From The Archive <h> The School Of Learning -- Olympic Memories , 2004 , 2016 <p> Anna Zair , Caroline Peaty , with son Adam and his dad Mark in Rio by Craig Lord <p> Asked in Rio about the pressures of the big occasion and how Peaty and his coach got through the mill so well , Marshall said : <p> " All this stuff in terms of arena training , I felt we did years ago . " <p> Meaning : Marshall had passed on the lessons of her own experience and those had fed into the nature and nurture of Peaty and contributed to producing a swimmer who firmly believes that pressure is there to be harnessed not feared . Indeed , ' pressure ' , he suggests , too often serves as an excuse for not performing . It might , he once said , not even exist at all : all in the mind . <p> Marshall understood better what to tell her charge because she 'd lived through challenging times and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She arrived in Athens as the world No 1 on the clock in 2004 over 200m freestyle . Princess Anne turned up for semis but it was not to be Marshall 's day . That would come 12 years later on a sensational night in Rio , the experience of loss and letdown fuel for another journey . <p> Said Marshall : " It was 12 years ago and if I look back now , I 'd say that was my defining moment as a coach . I would never have been able to guide him to this if I had not had that experience myself . I feel like this , for me , was my Olympic gold . I went through that and that 's just how it is , but now I get to help the guys hopefully realise their dreams year on year . " <p> " Little did I know that that moment there was my defining moment as a coach . I feel like I know now that it 's about balance , in terms of making sure you 're not pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in that last year . That 's why I 'm here , because of that I can help guide people through this process . It is a very challenging process . <p> " The first thing you say if you go to number one in the world and do n't win is so-and-so has failed to win a gold medal , when they may have got silver . The odds of winning the Olympics are 22 million to one . The odds of being an Olympian are 628,000 to one . You pick up one of those medals and it 's an amazing achievement . It 's often criticism from people sitting on couches not doing that much with their lives . " <p> Adam Peaty by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Something that could not be said of Peaty . " There are not many like him , " said Marshall back in Rio . " I did a montage for him before we left in terms of the work that he has done and the journey he has been on . He is always the last man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' go again ' he will say ' yeah ' . If I say ' go again ' , he will say ' yeah ' . If he says ' I ca n't ' , I will say ' go again ' and he will say ' yeah ' . It is testament to his hard work that we are here . I feel like we are the perfect partnership and that 's a special and a rare thing . I will never forget this moment for the rest of my life . " <p> That montage included the hourly slog , the daily bread , the weekly wash and tumble of workouts and challenge and the markers that make wach month one closer to the goal . It might have included that charity bike ride across Africa Marshall took the teenager on for fitness and fun in pursuit of wider horizons , perspective and resilience . It might have also included the breakthrough moments in 2014 and 2015 that led to Marshall being voted by peers at the British Swimming Coaches Association as the first women Coach of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If he was learning all the while , so was she , but as peaty himself noted " you can learn from the experience of others but you still have to live through it yourself to know it " . <p> What had Marshall been feeling as she sent Peaty off to his blocks . <p> " Have you seen that programme One Born Every Minute ? A ground-breaking TV series in Britain that focuses on the drama and emotion of a maternity unit . It was literally like that . It was horrendous . As soon as we had our final conversation , that 's when my emotions came out . I went to the other side of the stands with a couple of the sports science staff because I knew I did not want anyone to see me pacing up and down like I was about to give birth . " <p> Adam Peaty by PBK <p> Peaty was born as a swimmer who might maske it one day when he arrived at Marshall 's pool . What were her first impressions of him ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaststroke was just something different in terms of the way he swam it . I feel there is a massive amount of fate that has gone on with this journey . There were so many situations . I had just come out of elite sport from Beijing ( 2008 ) at the time . He just landed on my doorstep . It went from there . " <p> Marshall met Adam 's mother Caroline Peaty ( more on Adam and his family later ) and agreed to assess her young son for swimming training . The coach was none too impressed . As Peaty puts it : " She saw my freestyle and was going to chuck me out , I think . All the 10-year-old girls could beat me . " <p> But then Marshall saw him swim breaststroke and thought " oh , that 's interesting " and she agreed to take him on , a ticket stamped at the start of a long journey . It was in 2008 not longer after Peaty had been signed up that she had a dream : she dreamt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which he would get off to the sound of a crown cheering his name . Says Marshall : <p> " He was supposed to win this . It was his destiny . That 's the biggest thing . If this message gets out to a wider audience and to kids then it should be that dreams really can come true . Eight years ago , I dreamt of this result tonight . " <p> Asked what sets him apart , Marshall said : " His work ethic . He works harder than anyone else . He has got a bloody good coach . " <p> Cue laughter . Spot on . <h> The Next Chapter <p> Peaty is just 21 and there 's work to be done over those " eight more years " the partnership has in mind . Says Marshall : <p> " I thought we could go 57.2 here and we went 57.1 . So I guess it 's project 56 . After this year we 'll be looking to rebuild and take it steady again and build up again over the next four years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four years gone by since Peaty stood in a field thinking he might get drunk , with a jealous eye on Craig Benson 's splits at London 2012 home Games that he 'd hoped he 'd be at , what did Marshall think had made the difference ? <p> " He 's just grown up . People take time to grow up and get that feeling of ' I do want to do it ' . He 's just grown up . Those stories ... some in news reports of him playing up for teachers he was never a bad lad . We had one argument when he was a 14-year-old about putting his fins on , but apart from that , if you have a quiet conversation with him , help him understand the way forward , he will always listen . <p> " That 's the one biggest thing about him : he 's listened and he 's absorbed . That 's why he is where he is , he 's been a great listener . " <p> A great one for paying plaudits to all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So what were all those folk back in Derby up to when Peaty was pulling his way to Olympic gold ? " I know they had a big screen outside where he trains . I think it 's too early on a Monday to get drunk , but ... I just know he 's been an inspiration to the kids there . We 've had a very difficult year . We lost facilities and stuff . But it 's been a ' we ' . It 's been the club , volunteers , British Swimming , UK Sport . Everybody 's come together and we 've achieved this . That 's a great thing . " <p> Adam Peaty by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Adam Peaty by PBK <p> Not all has been plain-sailing , Derby having been knocked by pool closures that forced Peaty and mates to make alternative arrangements . " We 've had some difficulties in terms of pools closing and stuff . All of them , " says Marshall . " We lost three pools this year , but they 're all back on now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to deal with . You have to put all your eggs in one basket and try to deliver the goods . That 's just sport . <p> The bookies had had Adam at 1/100 but had Marshall suffered doubt ? She replied : <p> " I came into this meet and I did n't dare ... because I know what it 's like on the other side if it does n't go well . There 's an element of me that was cautious . But in my gut I knew what he could do . I fully trusted in him and believed in him . Yes , what a guy . " <p> It was time to fly , to get back to work on the burning deck that Marshall need never again associate with 2004 and feel pain . The shadow of Mount Olympus , courtesy of her work , Peaty 's work and the outcome in Rio last night , now serves simply to remind Marshall of the mountain climbed and conquered , the view from the summit us to do so . <h> The Moral Sickness 
 guided by Bruce Gemmell , and Adam Peaty , guided by Mel Marshall , followed up a stellar world titles in 2015 with pioneering performances that topped all others at Rio 2016 - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Editorial <p> The World Short-Course Championships get underway in Windsor , Canada , tomorrow . Six days to go until the FINA circus packs up at the end of a woeful years for the international federation . <p> Whether be design or default , FINA simply could not prevent the participation of dopers at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . Many would argue that FINA simply did n't want to . In word , FINA would argue with the latter ; in deed , however , there 's no hiding place for an organisation led by a director who hugged Sun Yang* on the Olympic deck a year after declaring " you ca n't condemn the stars for a minor doping offence " and he did so even as the world of swimming around him descended into the biggest protest in Olympic swimming history , the backdrop to racing in Rio the boo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception that has poisoned the pool for many a long year . <p> Thirty years after he took up as top paid man at FINA in the midst of the second decade of the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 , Cornel Marculescu leads a cultural malaise ( those he works with and for have at least as much to answer for ) . <p> The fact is that if you do n't condemn such things , if you tolerate such things , if you apply one rule for Sun and Co and another to the unknown athlete from Thailand and elsewhere , you get a breeding ground for cheats . <p> The issue ripple well beyond doping , of course . Watching FINA from within and from afar is like watching small boys play cars , each with a favourite for whom the rules will be bet to suit the outcome less won than given . <p> Do n't get me wrong : no doubting the score of Katinka Hosszu this year three Olympic gold medals and a silver . <p> Did that merit the FINA woman of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Katie Ledecky ( USA ) by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Katinka Hosszu by PBK <p> Woman swimmer of the year ? Only one choice : Katie Ledecky . The American claimed Olympic gold in the 200 , 400 and 800m freestle and with teammates in the 4x200m freestyle , in which she played a pivotal role . In the 400m and the 800m , stunning world records that represented the biggest points scores among all new standards set by women this year . <p> Ledecky 's was a flawless Olympic campaign , a performance like no other in Rio for an American who since she started an unbroken winning streak with Olympic gold in the 800m freestyle at 15 in London four years ago has failed to win FINA approval over its constant choice and enrichment of Hosszu . <p> The only argument for selecting Hosszu over Ledecky would be to count the world cup and other s/c competitions pertaining to FINA . Here again , however , FINA is hoisted by its own petard : <p> Michael Phelps , FINA male swimmer of the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racing ... and yet , and yet , how deep to go before you get to the swimmer of the year if not Phelps ... onward past Adam Peaty and Joe Schooling and Mack Horton and a bunch of others FINA can not turn to to find world cup promoters and beneficieries , Hosszu the very biggest of those and now not only in possession of FINA 's biggest cash rewards but its big honorary prize , too , the Olympic Games apparently a secondary thought ( and yet not ) . <p> The showcase s/c event this year is yet to take place but wo n't count for FINA honours , the dinner and the clock of blazers worth more than the duel and the clock of clocks to those governing the sport . That is a faux pas for FINA : the counting criteria for the award includes points for the world s/c championships . <p> a world cup ranking does not and should not rate ahead of a world record but FINA says it does ; and the points a swim is worth is also worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the counting system rigged for the swimmer who turns up at a failing world cup avoided by the vast bulk of world-class swimmers , as if the Olympic arena and world records can be compared in that light . They ca n't -- and if they were not , then there would have been no choice : Ledecky gets it . <p> The FINA criteria is designed to get top swimmers to the world cup : it has failed but FINA 's desire to mould the world of swimmers and swimming has blinded it to the opportunity inherent in allowing swimmers and swimming to mould the way the federation serves the sport . And so we find the guardians of the sport setting a criteria that includes the world s/c championships and then turing a blind eye to its own unsatisfactory counting mechanism . <p> Where then is her voice when it comes to FINA , the body granting her so many prizes ? is FINA Vice-President . Just where the loss of the headship of Hungarian swimming will leave him next July when Budapest hosts the FINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-course ) remains to be seen . The new leadership of the Magyar shoal has the right to nominate its own officials . , who runs the FINA Aquatics Magazine in a very lucrative arrangement with the international federation , may yet be able to remain in an honorary capacity . <p> He may also yet make a comeback , as he did after the scandal of 1996 when Hungary made up a whole meet after realising that it needed some decent qualification times to enter the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta . noted that he had had nothing to do with that exercise . Still , captain , ship . Not a train of thought , it must be said , that holds much truck at FINA , a body that we have yet to hear Hosszu criticise . Time will tell how all of that works out . <p> In the meantime , FINA clearly realises that its two short-course events , the World Cup and the world s/c titles , are struggling . The federation has sought the views of swimmers on what might improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear the truth : kill it and start again . <p> That FINA nerves are a touch on edge over the world s/c titles is obvious in the words of Peter Hall , FINA " head of broadcasting and marketing " . <p> There is no arguing , not even from FINA and any other wise monkeys you care to mention , that the list in Windsor is notable for its absenteeism , regardless of the quality that is there and will provide six days of swift swimming worth tuning in to but not what it might be by a dizzying margin . <h> All in the turn of events <p> Adam Peaty by LaPresse for arena <p> Michael Phelps a kiss from the man with the Midas Touch by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> So what 's the explanation ? Here is from Hall to Canadian media : " From the swimmer 's perspective , technique on the turn is so much more important because you have to make twice as many turns as you would in a 50-metre pool for the same distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a lot of swimmers who wo n't come . " <p> So , that 'll be Michael Phelps in his heyday : if the greatest Olympian of all time cared less for short-course swimming , what could never be said of him was that he could n't turn . Ryan Lochte may well have had an edge on him on occasion but anyone who argues that Phelps could not whip in and dolphin kick out of a turn better than almost anyone you cared to mention ought to be led away by the elbow quietly with a view to public safety . <p> Adam Peaty ? Cracking turns . Katie Ledecky ? Terrific . But not in Windsor . Peaty made his views on that clear a while back . FINA just granted Peaty and Ledecky the federation choice of best performances of the year awards , men and women . Well , you ca n't get it wrong all the time . Meantime , Hall 's reasoning ought to have been shot down in flames but he surely felt safe in the face of those who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had had cause to wonder at the wisdom of Hall on previous occasions . I had been asked to represent the FINA media commission at a world cup event in Berlin some years ago . In the course of doing so , I was invited to a dinner in a not 50 yards from " Checkpoint Charlie " in Berlin . Christa Thiel , the then DSV German federation head , had just delivered a fine speech about how good it was to be able to gather so close to what had been a border and know that healing had taken place and that Germany and sport were on a better way in the days beyond the GDR and what had come to be known ( all the abuse that FINA hads long failed to deal with , for example ) . <p> The Mayor of Berlin present and on a table with various dignatories and backers of sport , as well as FINA officials , Hall raise the issue of shiny suits . Did it matter ? Yes , I said . It did and swimming was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall continued beyond wisdom , did it really matter if , when Lance Armstrong and Jan Ulrich were battling to a thriling finish in the Tour de France , both were doped ? He suggested that it did n't change the thing that mattered most : the show . That 's what the crowd wanted . I begged to differ ( the events of the past two years appear to have sided with that view and how ) . <p> Stasi ( secret police ) documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped . Did the record of the sport change ? Of course not . <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> I asked two questions : did he think it right to utter such words of support for doping in this place of all places given the abuse and ill-health and damage that State Plan 14:25 had wrought ? And did he think that someone working for an organisation that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution on doping should be promoting such views . A littl red-faced , he left the table not long after . Busy day ahead . <p> Best part of a decade on , meanwhile , and the sport votes with its feet and FINA continues to ignore the slow death of swimming 's mid-term sales pitch . <p> Consider the first day of racing tomorrow and we find a pattern repeated through the next six days of racing in Windsor : absenteeism is greater than those showing up when it comes to the best in the world , the line of " 6 out of 8 Olympic finalists missing " fairly common across the board . There is cause for concern in the depths of FINA 's interpretation of " world " , too . <p> No argument at all with the quality of those up top on the entry lists but " world " does not mean " world-class " to FINA : it means participation and development and worse still in some case tokenism . Men on 3mins plus over 200m butterfly and well over 5.30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " World Championship " . <p> Day 1 finals point to an undeniable pattern and picture of an event to be taken for the moment and for what it is : a fine in-house showcase that simply does n't translate to mass interest in the realms of world-class pro sport , swimming yet to reach the pro pond of sporting life . <p> Men 's 400m Freestyle <p> The numbers missing : Olympic -- 6/8 are not in Windsor ( 2/3 podium placers are not in Windsor ) <p> Standard : entries slower than the best in the world in 1976 ; 17/81 entries over 4 minutes ; 0/81 faster than world No 1 in 1999 ; entries slower than the women 's world record ; are faster than the all-time No25 at the close of the last century . <p> Standard : slower than the world best time held in 1976 by Canada 's Shannon Smith ; 60/91 entries over 2 minutes ; 6/91 faster than world No 1 in 1999 ; 23/91 slower than 2:10 ; 22/91 faster than what was No25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men 's 200m Butterfly <p> The numbers missing : Olympic -- 4/8 ( 2/3 ) <p> Standard : 17/55 slower than the world best time in 1976 ; 22/55 over 2minutes ; 5/55 faster than world No 1 in 1999 ; 12/55 over 2:05 ( and 1 over 3mins ) ; 21/55 faster than what was No25 all-time at the close of the last century . <p> Women 's 400m Medley <p> The numbers missing : Olympic -- 5/8 ( 1/3 ) <p> Standard : 4/25 slower than the world best time in 1976 ( discounting the GDR in the midst ) ; 8/25 over 4:40 ( 2 over 5mins ) ; 7/25 faster than world No 1 in 1999 ; 14/25 faster than the all-time No25 at the close of the last century . <p> Men 's 200m Medley <p> The numbers missing : Olympic -- 3/8 ( 2/3 ) <p> Standard : 24/75 slower than the world best time in 1976 ; 20/75 over 2:07 ( 6 over 2:20 ) ; 15/75 faster than world No 1 in 1999 ( FINA Bureau athlete member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in world swimming , Matt ? ) ; 26/75 faster than the all-time No25 at the close of the last century . <p> The fact is that the short-course world being touted by some as the thrilling future of swimming is just not cutting the mustard in comparison with the ultimate showcases of the sport : the Olympic Games and the FINA event that matters , the World Championships in a long-course pool . <p> There is a market for global swimming twixt those peaks but potential will be a distant horizon as long as more is more is more and there is no attempt to graps the nettle of a bulging and conflicting competition calendar failing swimmers and year after year . <p> With that in mind , we return to Hall , swimming 's marketeer . He tells the Canadian media : " Swimming is the backbone of the Olympic Games . It 's the No. 1 sport in the Olympic program , so to have a world swimming championship in a city of this size is a remarkable achievement . " <p> Actually , Windsor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmers bound in ambitions well beyond the showcase you are about to host . <p> Let 's be clear : fast , tight swim finals ahead ? Sure . Exciting racing ? Sure , worth tuning into for anyone who loves fast swimming . The best that those there have to give ? In most cases , absolutely . Then again , you can say the same of your local age-group gala , the stands packed every weekend all over the world with mums and dad , grandmas and grandads . So we turn to : the very best in the world ? No , I 'm afraid not . Fewer than a third of the best in the wold across the board of all events . <p> Michael Phelps of the United States of America ( USA ) in the only pool that ever counted for him -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> FINA 's merchandisers and marketeers can sell it , Hosszu and anything else as they wish . None of that will wash in a world outside their window that peers in at the Rio revolt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abuse , a realm that can not stretch to providing a living for anything but a handful of swimmers , and knows that it is a world they 'd rather pass by . <p> That 's a tragedy . Swimming is a great sport , stacked high with the dedicated , high achievers at every turn , water and deck . A world cup , a world championships ought to have the best in the world there . They do n't . Why ? Because FINA believes more is more and more means more travel , more luxury lifestyle and more per diems for themselves , not more opportunities for us to do so . <p> The wife of

Kraemer was on the deck today to train his lens on the limbering up , the Swiss and the Danes in focus in some fine shots of the easy mood at world titles in the little pool at the end of a long and arduous Olympic year . Not all went well in Rio for some of those in Windsor to test themselves again -- and enter 2017 with a happier memory . <p> Among them is Australian Emily Seebohm , a double world long-course champion in 2015 and in the hunt for 25m titles in the wake of an Olympics that simply did not go to plan .

 Germany thanks the heavens that his 2016 will end on a high note - by Patrick B.

No Peaty , Van Der Burgh out in the rounds and the clock slower than it has been on previous occasions but a win is a win , Koch 's stamina over 200m shining through under the circumstances ( including the fact that this was not Koch 's season best nor as fast as three others have been this , as the ranks below show ) . <p> Marco Koch of Germany on his way to victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Koch turned sixth at the turn , his 26.83 adrift the 26.51 lead pace of the man he would overhaul for the crown , Vladimir Morozov .

The bronze went to 2012 champion Fabio Scozzoli , of Italy , in 57.05 , the slimest whisker possible in the pool , 0.01sec , ahead of defending champion Felipe Franca Silva of Brazil , with Russian Oleg Kostin on 57.07 and American Olympic podium placer Cody Miller a further 0.01sec us to do so . <p> Although no amount 
 Lilly King Marks Strong Night For Team USA North of Its Border <p> Lilly King of the United States of America ( USA ) winning in the women 's 50m Breaststroke Final during the 13th FINA Short Course World Swimming Championships at WFCU Centre in Windsor , Ontario , Canada , 07 December 2016 . <p> World S/C Championships <p> Windsor , Day 2 <p> The trip to the World Short Course Championships was a short one for the United States , just a hop over its northern border . In the time it took the Red , White and Blue to reach Windsor , Team USA evidently put together a game plan for success , much like it realized at last summer 's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . <p> Her skills in the water equally matched by her willingness to condemn doping in sport , Lilly King was a headliner in Rio . As a refresher , she not only reeled in the gold medal in the 100 breaststroke , she also spoke out against the inclusion of rival Yuliya Efimova following a doping suspension and the inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violator of doping bylaws . <p> As long as King remains a top athlete in the sport , she 'll be looked to for her voice on performance-enhancing substances . And as long as she remains in the sport , she 'll be expected to flourish in the water , as was the case on the second night of the World Champs . By the time the night was over , King had two gold medals , one in the 50 breaststroke and the other as a member of the American 200 medley relay , which set a world record in an event very much in the development stages . <p> Lilly King by Patrick <p> Covering the 50 breast in 28.92 , King relegated Jamaica 's Alia Atkinson to the silver medal for the third consecutive time at the World Short Course Champs , Atkinson going 29.11 .

Kraemer <p> Nonetheless , the United States was superb in the fledgling discipline , Ali jumpstarting a wire-to-wire win with a 26.12 split , and giving way to King and her 50-meter outing of 28.78 . Next up was Kelsi Worrell on the butterfly leg , her 24.44 split giving the United States the fastest split in each of the opening three legs . Katrina Konopka closed matters in 23.93 . <p> Worrell had a big night of her own , as she earlier took silver in the 200 fly behind Hungarian Katinka Hosszu . Timed in 2:02.89 , Worrell established an American record and set the stage for pursuit of gold later in the week in the 100 fly , her primary event . <h> Home Crowd Given Treat By Kylie Masse In 100 Backstroke <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hosszu on top in 55.54 , the title one of two she won on the evening and the third of her competition . But the crowd in Windsor no doubt appreciated the silver medalist to a greater degree , as Canadian Kylie Masse nailed down the silver medal in 56.24 , bronze to Britain 's Georgia Davies in 56.45 . <p> Kylie Masse of Canada poses with her silver medal after finishing second in the women 's 100m Backstroke Final during the 13th FINA Short Course World Swimming Championships at WFCU Centre in Windsor , Ontario , Canada , 07 December 2016 . <p> As the Canadian women enjoy a resurgence on the international scene , a jolt that first emerged in Rio , Masse followed her bronze at the Olympics by moving up a step on the podium in her homeland . Only .05 behind Hosszu at the 50-meter mark , masse could n't stay with the Hungarian over the final two laps , but she did plenty to warrant appreciation of her fellow Maple Leafs . <p> Masse is one of several Canadian youngsters who have delivered significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the headliner of that crew .

Consequently , eyes during the gold-medal chase will focus on lanes three and five , although Barrett can not be discounted .

 Xinyi has been handed a two-year suspension after testing positive for Hydrochlorothiazide during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . <p> China 's top butterfly swimmer of the moment was removed from the Olympic Games after confirmation of the adverse finding back in Brazil in August . <p> This evening , as racing wrapped up at the world short-course championships in Windsor , Canada , FINA issued the following statement : <p> Doping Panel Decision Xinyi Chen ( CHN ) <p> On 8 August 2016 , the International Olympic Committee conducted a doping control test during the Rio 2016 Olympic Games on the swimmer Xinyi Chen ( CHN ) . The athlete was tested positive to the substance Hydrochlorothiazide ( Class S5 of the WADA Prohibited List 2016 , Diuretics and Masking Agents ) . <p> The FINA Doping Panel decided according to the FINA DC Rule DC 10.2.2 to impose on the athlete a period of two years ' ineligibility , starting on 11 August 2016 and ending on 10 August 2018 for her first anti-doping rule violation . <p> Furthermore , the FINA Doping Panel acknowledged the Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disqualification of the athlete 's results at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . <p> Chen Xinyi was barred from racing in Rio afterthe 100m butterfly final and after the Court of Arbitration for Sport , sitting here in Brazil , handed the 18-year-old a temporary suspension . It has taken until now for FINA to confirm the case and hand out a penalty . <p> Hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure and swelling caused by heart failure and liver damage . The judgement handed to the swimmer is not accompanied by a penalty for coach , doctor or any other official serving as the guardian of an athlete who has been in the care of the national team in China since she became a teenager . <p> The Chinese Swimming Association was told the news three days before it was revealed in Rio . Chen was 16 when she catapulted up the world rankings to a 56.61 victory for China over 100m butterfly at the Asian Games .

Miami was told last year that it could no longer admit Sun Yang* to its facilities after he tested positive for a banned substance in 2014 . <p> Australia changed its rules of engagement with foreigners as a result of Sun 's case : no swimmer who ever tested positive may train at a funded centre in the country and all who do visit to train must agree to submit to national anti-doping agency testing on demand at their own cost . <p> The cases , among six in China that date back many months but have yet to make the published list of FINA cases , involve a masking agent being used by a pod of swimmers in the same season , sparking by fears within China of a " systematic network of doping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resignations from FINA of three doping experts in protest at their advice over Russia being ignored by the international swimming federation , Chen , 18 , took to seven the number of positive tests by national team members ( past and present ) in China . <p> It was six months after an investigation by The Times and that forced Chinese swimming to admit that it had six undeclared positive tests on its account , that we were able to reveal the names of the three swimmers who also tested positive for the hydrochlorothiazide that caught Chen out in Rio . <p> Li Xuanxu by Patrick B.

That all these young swimmers test positive for the same masking agent , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systematic network of doping athletes . We have seen this before in China and we want it to end . We hope that WADA will look more closely at Chinese swimming . There is a deep problem and there are rogues working in the sport . " <p> The Chen Xinyi case came on the back of warnings handed to World junior record holder among men on breaststroke , Wang , and the man who replaced Huang as China No 2 on medley , and An Jiabao , after they tested positive for Clenbuterol last year . Both men qualified for the Olympic Games as winners or second-placed swimmers at trials back in April but were not selected to race in Rio . <p> To date there has been no official explanation as to why one of China 's top freestyle swimmers , Qiu Yuhan , 18 , did not make it to the Rio 2016 Olympic Games despite having us to do so . <p> Wilson says she 
 Japan on his way to gold in the 400m medley - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> World S/C Championships <p> Windsor , Canada , Day 5 Finals <p> Men 's 400 Individual Medley <p> For all he has achieved in the water , Daiya Seto does n't seem to have received enough credit for his exploits . So , maybe the fifth world crown of his career will take the Japanese star a step closer to a proper tip of the cap . <p> In command of the 400 individual medley by the 150-meter mark , Seto stormed to his third consecutive short-course global title in the event , a mark of 3:59.24 getting the job done . Couple his trio of championships with the last two gold medals at the World Champs in the big pool , and that 's five straight crowns for Seto at the World Championships . <p> Although Olympic gold proved elusive over the summer in Rio de Janeiro , where Seto was the bronze medalist , there is no arguing his ability to excel on a big stage .

Indeed , Hagino got the best of Seto at the Olympics in Rio , a gold medal in the 400 medley cementing his place in Olympic lore .

The three tracks were meant to capture everyone from early to late developers who had the potential to represent Canada internationally . <p> Since the spring of 2014 , Swimming Canada has had the opportunity to work closely with a sports analytics group established by Canadian Tire Bank in collaboration with Own The Podium . As a result , Swimming Canada has gained access to a number of valuable resources and tools to further enhance the On Track times tool . The analysts worked with more than two million sets of results from world-class athletes to help provide insight into their career progression . <p> For the quadrennial leading into the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games , Swimming Canada has developed the World Class On Track Times 2017-2020 . <p> " Every sport should have a method of identifying talent within the sport pathway , " said High Performance Director John Atkinson . " These On Track Times will increase the probability of identifying the right athletes to invest in for future Olympic success . We have worked with our partners on fine-tuning this system and feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the provincial swimming sections to identify young athletes who may become the next generation of international swimmers . " <p> As with the original On Track times , this series of times will act as a tool to help identify developing swimmers who are tracking towards producing world-class swimming performances . The same basic principles from the original On Track times remain . <p> The objective is to identify a pool of athletes who are five to eight years away from podium potential performances at international competitions such as the FINA World Championships and Olympic Games . World Class On Track Times will be the key evaluation tool for Swimming Canada 's podium pathway and will be used in all aspects of the development program . <p> The entry point to world-class swimming has been defined as the Olympic Qualifying Time ( OQT ) . Traditionally , the 16th-place time from the most recent Olympics is used as the for the next Olympics . Therefore , the 16th place times from Rio 2016 have been used as the target times for each of the three tracks for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the target time to be reached at an age that equals the average age of a finalist in the event minus four years . For example , the average age of a finalist in the women 's 400-m individual medley is 21 , therefore the target time is set to be reached at age 17 . Whereas the men 's 50-m freestyle has an average age for finalists of 26 , which would set the age to reach the target time at 22 . By achieving a world-class level of performance at these ages , the athletes would then have four more years to develop the skills and tactics necessary to reach the podium before they theoretically reach their peak performance . Using the progression rates developed by the analytics group , five years of times were then calculated for each event working back from the target time and age . <p> As with the original On Track times , Track 2 and Track 3 were then developed with the age to reach the targeted time progressively one year later with each track . The same progression rates were then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Track 1 . The intent of Track 2 and Track 3 is to identify any later developers who are still tracking towards world-class swimming . This combined with the nine-year development window of Track 1 should capture all potential outliers who are five to eight years us to do so . <h> National Sport <p> 
 the Netherlands celebrates gold in the 50 free as Windsor waves goodbye to those gathered - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> World S/C Championships <p> Windsor , Canada , Day 5 Finals <p> Women 's 50 Freestyle <p> Not only has top-end speed long defined the career of Dutchwoman Kromowidjojo , consistency has been a hallmark of the 26-year-old 's career . So , when Kromowidjojo wrapped up her World Short Course Championships with a gold medal in the 50 freestyle , it was hardly a stunning development . <p> For the third time in the past four versions of the World Champs ( little pool ) , Kromowidjojo stood on the top of the podium in the 50 free , her winning time of 23.60 supplying a comfortable margin over Italian Silvia Di Pietro ( 23.90 ) . American Madison Kennedy produced her best performance of the meet to pick up the bronze medal in 23.93 . <p> The silver medalist to Aussie Brittany Elmslie in the 100 freestyle , Kromowidjojo looked impressive throughout the meet and particularly through the rounds of the 50 free . She headed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her foes , and maintained that status in the final individual event of the six-day competition . <p> The pace of 2016 compared to 2014 and 2012 : <p> 2012 : 23.64 ; 23.87 ; : 23.32 ; 23.62 ; 23.77 <p> The world rankings 2016-17 : <h> Women 50M Freestyle <p> 1 <p> 23.58 <p> Jeanette Ottesen DEN , 28 <p> World Cup Round 2 GER , Berlin <p> 2 <p> 23.60 <p> Ranomi Kromowidjojo NED , 26 <p> World Championships CAN , Windsor <p> 3 <p> 23.90 <p> Silvia di Pietro ITA , 23 <p> World Championships CAN , Windsor <p> 4 <p> 23.93 <p> Madison Kennedy USA , 28 <p> World Championships CAN , Windsor <p> 5 <p> 24.00 <p> Zhu CHN , 17 <p> World Cup Round 4 CHN , Beijing <p> The 2012 Olympic champion in the 50 free and 100 free , Kromowidjojo did n't replicate her success in London at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , but she was hardly an afterthought . The Dutch star took fifth in the 100 free and sixth in the 50 free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sprints . The others were American Simone Manuel and the Campbell sisters of Australia , Cate and Bronte . <p> While Di Pietro became the first Italian female to medal in a sprint event at the World Short Course Champs , Kennedy ended her season on a positive after enduring a difficult summer . Among the contenders to make the United States Olympic Team in Omaha , Kennedy found herself on the outside , clipped by the youthful pair of Manuel and Abbey Weitzeil . Despite the setback , Kennedy remained focused and upbeat , the reward a piece of hardware on the global stage . <h> Women 's 100 Butterfly <p> Katinka Hosszu of Hungary on her way to winning in the women 's 100m Butterfly Final during the 13th FINA Short Course World Swimming Championships at WFCU Centre in Windsor , Ontario , Canada , 11 December 2016 . <p> Even if relay duty this week supplied the United States ' Kelsi Worrell with gold , her solo efforts contained a silver lining . For the third time in butterfly action in Windsor , Worrell claimed runnerup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 100 distance . Although Worrell led at the midway point , Hosszu edged ahead to prevail in 55.12 , Worrell just behind in an American record of 55.22 . The bronze medal went to Japan 's Rikako Ikee in 55.64 . <p> The triumph was the seventh of the six-day competition for Hosszu , who earned three gold medals and a silver at last summer 's Olympic Games . She also collected a pair of silver medals as part of her extensive program , which featured double-digit entries . Hosszu ended with a sweep of the individual medley events , won a pair of backstroke crowns and earned a pair of golds in butterfly events . <p> The pace and death of the entry in Windsor places Hosszu 's seven in context but no doubting the leaps and bounds the Hungarian with the most unique profile in world swimming continues to make .

Van der Burgh 's outing allowed him to finish comfortably ahead of silver medalist Peter Stevens of Slovenia ( 25.85 ) and bronze medalist Felipe Lima of Brazil ( 25.98 ) . <p> The world-record holder at 25.25 , van der Burgh was n't in the same neighborhood as he 's been in the past , but his final major race of 2016 was n't about time .

Ultimately , he ratcheted up his best performance of the meet to comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title was his second short-course world crown in the event , complementing the gold medal he claimed in 2010 . Van der Burgh also joined countryman Chad Le Clos atop the podium , as Le Clos earlier earned a sweep of the butterfly events for the second consecutive time at the World Short Course Champs . <p> What awaits for van der Burgh during the next Olympic cycle remains unclear . With Peaty holding the long-course world record at an obscene 57.13 , much work remains if the 2012 Olympic champion has visions of again contending for the top spot in his prime event . If nothing else , though , van der Burgh has shown he 's lurking around , still capable of handling the heat of the moment . <h> Men 's 400 Medley Relay <p> Russia completed a sweep of the men 's relays when the quartet of Andrei Shabasov , Kirill Prigoda , Aleksandr and Vladimir Morozov covered the event in , Morozov anchoring the squad in 45.58 .

 sport perceive itself ; how does it look like from the other side of the lens , screen and bank of seats ? Will swimmers find their own representation and forge a new professional era ? - image by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> continues a countdown of the most significant swimming stories of Olympic Year 2016 . <p> We started with the heights of Katinka Hosszu and then considered the Canadian Comeback . Today , we turn to the opposite of progress in the pool , or in other words , the swimming selfie , poorly proportioned priorities and the art of talking to oneself . This has been a year in which FINA 's refusal to engage with key stakeholders in swimming has highlighted cracks in a system that has failed on some fundamental levels , including : <p> a lack of recognition that the sport is growing up and professional athletes will want their own representatives not those hand-picked by a blazer here , a boss there -- to be at the top table arguing for the things that matter to the key asset of the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage with coaches and athletes and others in favour of a call for the international federation to submit to independent review of structures and finances so that swimming is run for swimmers and can grow in that spirit of service not self-service in office <p> a failure to give experts , commissions and committees a free reign on the agendas they wish to set for the betterment of the sport ( not the betterment of themselves ) , without ' guidance ' from on high where that simply means ' politics ' not wisdom . <p> ( L-R ) Fanny of Finland and Javier Acevedo of Canada race in the mixed relay at world s/c titles in Windsor by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> One fine day , Georges Kiehl , former French international and a man who has poured good will and effort into promoting the best of swimming for many a long year , will get a prize for perseverance . <p> That he missed only one European Championship ( 1970 after returning from racing ) between racing for France at the 1962 continental showcase right through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that he stuck with counting world cup scores long after FINA had somehow managed to lose the rhyme and reason of short-course racing he 'd done so much to promote in that quiet way that unsung heroes often do makes him a candidate for canonisation . <p> Kiehl , who recalled days of youth , triumph and tragedy on the 50th anniversary of the Bremen air disaster back in January this year , has enjoyed several roles since his racing days . Multi-lingual commentator , presenter , he was also media liaison for the European swimming league . In the early world cups in the days when Bonn held sway as short-course pressed for a greater presence in world swimming , Kiehl was among those exploring ways to bring the thrill and splash of the sport to audiences in between the big moments at a time when the four-year cycle Olympics , continental and regional highlight ; World Championships ; another regional highlight ; and back to the presence at meets such as the Canet round of the Mare Nostrum Tour and today the Euro Meet in Luxembourg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , happy , beat to proceedings . He 's in his 70s these days . You 'd never know it . <p> I do n't write any of this to embarrass Georges nor to make him our No18 in this choice of top 20 significant stories . It is just that he is symptomatic of an army of people who have long got things done in swimming , rarely got any credit as they help to keep the show on the road for the athletes while the likes of FINA keep the show going for ... well , themselves , for the most part . <p> Kiehl is also among those who helped lay the foundations for short-course to become official , to become the realm of official world records in 1991 , to become a vehicle for change , with prize money the lot of the swimmer and swimming presented as fast and furious and thrilling . <p> And ... they 're off by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> It all turned into " The World Cup " . It all turned into : let 's water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let 's make it a per-diem event for the family ( the ones in the dry suits ) , bring in the sponsor , slap Yakult on every cap and give the swimmers enough money to keep them quiet in the belief they 'd turn ' pro ' when they 'd done nothing of the kind and were living under the same yolk as those who had gone before them in almost all respects barring the ability to earn what for most was pocket money and still is . <p> Just in case anyone should think I 'm selling long-course short , here 's an excellent piece on headed Long-Course Swimming : Why You Should Embrace the Big Pool . Quite so -- Olivier setting out some of the key reasons why long-course makes the difference and will and should remain the ' real deal ' of the sport . <p> Anyone , average swimmer or elite athlete who has ever gone from short to long and back again in the course of a day in training will know the feeling : water to treacle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little like doing a set with flippers and then taking them off and doing it all over again while wondering what happened to your feet , that friendly angle of buoyancy and the extra catch and carry in your stroke . There 's a difference , no matter how hard you work , how much you develop your skills in both environments . <p> One of the purposes of this piece , however , is to use short-course swimming as an example of where it can all go wrong when the political agenda and jockeying for position on lifestyle support trumps all else . In the book of swimming 's second thoughts : shiny suits , facilities rules , professionalisation of structures and personnel and short-course . <h> Jack Of All Trades Wins Every Day , Master None <p> Katinka Hosszu who by now will have a medal for every day of the year and some to spare by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The World Cup limped to an end in Hong Kong in late northern autumn . The fall , as Americans put it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spring clean . <p> Why does it not work ? Well , there the prize-money structure : for four years it has worked in favour of a handful and to the vast benefit of of one swimmer . Not Katinka Hosszu 's fault nor is she objecting to the model that works a treat and who can blame her . We can blame the custodians who allow it . <p> Back in the days when Khiel was among those thinking about how to structure the prizes and the premium moments , no-one had in mind four or five all-China heats of an event when in China , three heats of Russians when in Russia and a multiple endless racer who would win it all , time and time and time again , the big prizes only truly open to thos who can step up to a top 3 place on at least three strokes as well as a range of distance , sprint to distance . <p> I recall lots of moments in Bonn and Stockholm and Paris where the media bench was full . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did n't come to see folk ranked outside the world top 50 , let alone top 200 ( many in the cup series this year fit that bill ) ; they did n't come to see a development meet . And nor did the athletes . They came to race the best not the remains of the best . <p> Where is the scope to pay professional rates , in the cup competition as it stands , to the likes of Adam Peaty , Joe Schooling , Ryan Murphy , Ruta Meilutyte and many others ? Folk who , of course , can swim beyond their beat ... but not in world-record rattling form in 10 and more events none times a season . <p> Hosszu is anything but average and yet there is a sense , backed by the evidence of points , that FINA wants mediocrity because in opting for that it can have its cake and eat it , tell the world and its broadcasters that swimmers can be like tennis players , constantly on the top and in the headlines . It wo n't wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world record victory delivered the outstanding swim of the 2016 Olympic Games , just bypassed the whole of the post-Rio global short-course season . Why ? <p> Adam Peaty celebrates by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> " At the end of the day , no-one cares about short-course in Britain . There 's no coverage of it and what people want to know about is the Olympic Games and the World long-course Championships . I think swimming is getting there as a sport , climbing up the ranking of sports to another level but only when it comes to the Olympic Games and then the World long-course . " <p> August to November , 8 or 9 events , full world-championship programs . Attractive ? <p> " The world cup is n't working . It is ridiculous and embarrasing . They FINA and the sponsor the federation persuaded to sign up should put that money to good use , anywhere else in the sport . It 's completely the wrong time of the season for me and for most swimmers . Put it in January and February if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events on the way to trials season . " <p> Ah ! Season ! Swimming is a sport for all seasons but none , right now , when you look at the chaos of a calendar that serves to demote , not promote , swimming and swimmers . We are not talking about the seasons that each of you may recognise and feel familiar with . We 're talking about the seasons that exist in other sports that are recognised and followed by the big audience in the wider world . <p> Peaty hits the nail on the head when he raises the word season and raises the timing of events . He then adds : <p> " No-one turns up to it and that 's why they put so much money into thinking that people will have to come to make a living . But they do n't . I do n't blame the people that do go to them the cup rounds because the money is good and they have to make a living but FINA needs to do something about that because it clearly is n't working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Not even close to doing so . The solution is not to simply revamp the world cup . What is required is a fundamental rethink of the swimming calendar at world-class elite level and where that fits into all those events , from regional and continental events to domestic trials and nationals , college swimming and on down through the ranks of juniors and developers , international and domestic . <p> As things stand , there is no structure , no logic and no flow that makes sense to anyone outside the sport . And even within it , the voice of opposition , so long dormant , is starting to be heard . <p> FINA 's obsession with ' more is more ' has taken a toll . The federation 's attempt to steer more attention to and place more value on short-course has failed . Says Peaty : <p> " For me it is all about long-course . That 's it : all people want to see it long-course because that 's what the Olympics is and what the majors are . I 'd rather win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ l/c ) than a silver or something at a world s/c event . " <p> He adds : " The thing is , it is a different sport , short-course . I do n't do world cups because its unrelatable . It 's about people going there for the money and it 's not what it should be about . You 've got to have passion and that 's where the difference is made at long-course : 100% passion and dedication or you wo n't be there winning big medals . " <p> Adam Peaty by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> I do n't raise the direct issue of access to sports governance and the decision-making process with Peaty , a man on whom you need not try any questions that seek to corral the answers to suit whatever they intend to suit . He knows his own mind and he would one day like to put that to good use as a leader in his sport on dryland . <p> His interest rests in a better deal for athletes and the promotion of values he holds dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peaty says : " We live in a culture now where people will do anything to get on YouTube , on Facebook and get noticed through some viral video doing something absolutely stupid . Obviously you should have your fun as a kid but its whether that stays with you as an adult . " <p> So what to do about it and what relevance to swimming ? <p> " I 'd love to have a position where I could have a positive impact on the sport , not just on people . I think the sport needs some people who have been there and done it , so I 'm thinking of going into that area as well . Maybe in the IOC or FINA where you can absolutely make a difference and change that culture and give 100% to that sport and know what 's 100% right and you 'd be willing to do anything to make the sport right and do the best by the athletes and those who work at it every single day . <p> " Recently in swimming governance it just has n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be 100% up for playing a role come the time . That 's eight years away he intends to battle for top honours until the 2024 Olympic Games and alot can change in eight years so you hope that others will press for change , too , along the way . " <p> Alex Baumann , one of the greats of medley swimming Photo compilation : depicted on a Canadian bus ; in a poster ; in action , the Prague astronomical clock ; and with coach <p> Fascinating prospects : imagine a day when the likes of Peaty , Anthony Ervin , Michael Phelps , Mack Horton and Co get a direct say in the rights of athletes , in what matters to them , in what values they hold most dear . Go back in history and you find the likes of Michael Gross and Alex Baumann and Shane Gould and Debbie Meyer and Nancy Hogshead and ... and many others ... putting keen minds to the topic of how best swimming might be run and what the sport 's priorities should be and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that neither Gross ( largely , if not altogether , lost to the sport ) nor Baumann ( lost to swimming in a direct sense but playing leading roles in sport in his career ) nor a great many others got anywhere near to the decision-making process in swimming . <p> Will Phelps ? Will Peaty ? Will Ervin ? Will so many others , coach leaders in the mix , who would have so much to contribute ? <p> Time will tell but unless FINA is either radically reformed or replaced , they will not have access to such things . The entire structure is built to make sure that can not be , while ' athlete representative ' , such as an athlete leader on the FINA Bureau , is little more than a token measure in the midst of a culture that prizes assimilation of any who join ' the family ' over just about all else . New and sound ideas , let alone saying ' actually , I disagree ' , have little chance of flourishing . <p> Since Rio 2016 , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them podium placers , if they felt represented by the athletes sitting on commissions at FINA and relatied continental bodies . <p> Go ! -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> To a man and a woman the reply was ' No ' . Of the 25 , 20 noted that they had never been asked and never been consulted on any issue related to athlete well-being , from the timing of finals in Rio to the kind of blocks that are used , to the scheduling of competitions and on to issues such as the distribution of prize money at major events and the obligation to wear kit with the FINA sponsor on it even when that may place the athlete in direct conflict with the personal sponsor that pays the swimmer 's way through the sport . <p> So how , then does FINA go about seeking information on what athletes want , how more might make it to the cup ? Well , there 's the athlete 's commission but that 's not " current crew " . What FINA has engaged in is a process that lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ear of a couple of world-class athletes : go out into the world of swimmers and return with the messages they have for us , partly so we can use that to do a quick spruce up but largely go and as things stand and partly so we can say ' well , we did ask and that 's what the athletes wanted ' . <p> But what is it that they want for an event in between the twin peaks ? <p> what does swimming want to showcase ? <p> what is it the sport wants to reward ? <p> what does it want to hold up as ' peak performance ' ? <p> what other ways can the sport be measured in to take away the need to always be either in peak form or boring . <p> what is its highlight , where is weight and worth ? <p> is quantity to be valued over quality ? <p> what is the rationale behind prizing excellent training sets across the board over the few focussed moments of higher excellence ? <p> do you want a wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sponsors and backers ? <p> do you , the swimmer , want to become part of a professional network of elite swimmers ? <p> does your sport showcase your excellence in a way that makes swimming accessible and helps spread the word of an activity that transcends racing and health and entertainment , the wider benefits to be had stretching all the way to saving lives ? <p> can swimming do much better by you and the potential of professionalism ? <p> Splash by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Format matters . Swimming is a sport that keeps telling the deaf ear of FINA and other guardians that it needs to train in private and get on with life beyond the lights at certain times of the year ; swimming is a sport crying out for calendar reform ; swimming is a sport left looking for new ways to grow beyond Mount Olympus and World Championships , leagues and complex points systems having proved unappealing and ineffective as a magnet even with money as incentive . <p> Can a completely new concept work ? And where would short-course fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in the northern autumn . Here is what we came up with as a possible way forward , a way out of the malaise . It was published not as a commandment but as an invitation to sit at the round table and imagine what kind of swimming world you would like to see . That conversation has not yet reached the custodians of the sport . If sooner or later , swimmers and coaches want something different , however , they may well have to organise it themselves unless FINA has an epiphany . <p> Many of you read " A great day out at " when it was published on November 15 . You need not read on . Below is the same piece repeated for those who missed it the first time round and are interested in the topic at hand : reform . <h> Great Day Out at ' ' : Dawn Of A Golden Era For The ? <p> Others believe the world cup is still the best way of organising a regular tour-style gathering and spread swimming across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulk of world-class programs do n't go there . is aware that swimmers have been discussing what to do about the unhappy state of their in-season world . Most heartening news , for it is swimmers who must , ultimately , own change , move change and work for a professional future that will not be delivered through any of the vehicles currently available to them . <p> Below is a fictional glimpse of a different pool in a time of professional swimmers and improved governance . As you read , please keep in mind the following : <p> NB : references to formats and distances and strokes in the following should not be read as concrete suggestions : this is simply a caricature-style demonstration of the scope swimming has to do something different in a constructive manner beyond the championship moments and therefore lessen the impact of comparisons that need not be ; the moment is left to itself , the with challenge and fun and education and entertainment and community all considered , as are the traditions , history and the lore of the sport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of opinion and there are and will be those who believe nothing , or little , needs to change .

The status quo and the structures of governance that exist are not set up to favour a professional swimming realm that has the interests , welfare and pockets of athletes at the top of the mission statement . That will almost certainly mean a long list of reasons from some quarters why something like the below can not and should not and ' will not ' be done . No matter . It will , ultimately , come down to what swimmers want and whether that includes their freedom from total federation control , freedom to make their own choices , the desire to own their sport and to benefit from a professional era that is yet to make it to the swimming realm . <p> Precisely what the specific formats and timings of any change should be , would , of course , have to be the subject of much wider discussion with those steeped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only when the sport has a good grasp on seasons and where a new style of annual competitions might fit in the calendar to the benefit of swimmers and their greater goals will the way be clear to consider the kind of arena , entertainment and presentation that would suit both live and remote audiences and take swimming to a new level and a realm more recognisable and accessible to the world that did not grow up in the pool . <p> the below is a fictional account in which the roles of swimmers and what they say in the script are also fictional ; they are there as part of the theatre set and play <p> I 'm told that athletes do n't have the capacity to get through an article of this length . I do n't believe that . Athletes know well that life is not a tweet . They know if they put into their training the 2min Vs the 20min effort , they can kiss goodbye to unlocking their potential . Here 's a good reason to stretch your brain cells beyond " 10 reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth . <h> A Swim down to <p> Sprint Classic ahoy Anthony Ervin and Nathan Adrian will be among those gunning for dosh in the dash by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Roll-up , roll-up . The Classic is born . Some have dubbed it : swimming 's attempt to create a series that starts with domestic and regional qualification rounds leading to a two-week festival of three events every year around late January and February . <p> And where we say swimming , read swimmers , for the athletes themselves own the biggest stake in Classic and have had the biggest say in what is valuable to them in-season and what they feel will sell to the wider world . <p> That goes for current athletes and former greats of the sport , starting with the founder members of the Classic , the " Final 4 Club " . Backing for was sought from all who ever finished in the top four in an an Olympic swimming final . These greats of the sport are the first elders of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is borrowed from tennis , in which Wimbledon has a Final 8 Club for the venerated of their sport . <p> The Grand Slam format at the helm of professional tennis does not translate to a sport whose summit is held every four years , the Olympics , with a long-course World Championships showcase every two years in between , the traditions of those peak moments much treasured . <p> However , the decline of the swimming world cup that in its latter years made a handful of swimmers wealthy , rated quantity over quality and failed to attract support from the vast majority of world-class swimmers , the damage of dilution prompting a rethink in the ranks of athletes , coaches , sponsors , broadcasters and others . <p> Taking the plunge into a professional era by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In the absence of any response from FINA , the World Swimming Association and the Professional Swimmers ' Association secured a multi-million golden handshake from Hancock Prospecting and organisers of the Classic announced a year ago their intention to get the show started this season , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> stretches from September to February each year , domestic and regional qualification rounds leading to the Classic , a fortnight of world-class swimming and much more that brings the world swimming community together in an aquatic forum like none before . Two events three days long are followed by the Final held over four days , the first of which will be held in Perth , Westerm Australia afrer knockout stages in Brisbane and Sydney . <p> Swimmers will have their nation recognised but they will race for a professional team . <p> There are two sides to : in domestic rounds , with prize money stretched from that level right through to the Classic fortnight , swimmers can qualify as individuals in the traditional competition program . The Classic will be a Professional teams event including knockout stages in solo events with a twist , in sprint , mid and distance . The Classic will also feature opening days at each of the three rounds dedicated to relays with a difference . December will serve as the annual transfer window for Classic Teams to finalise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are done . <p> After a bidding process , the first 10 Classic Teams , each with 24 swimmers , 12 men and 12 women , have been declared , selection to any squad requiring a world top 30 ranking as of December 1 , the start of transfer season . <p> The first Class Squads are : Team Discovery ; The Energy Squad ; Volvic Victors ; Team Arena ; Team Speedo ; FINIS Flyers ; Phillips 66 ; House Charity ; Aquasphere Aquatics ; and The Squadron . Swimmers who do not find a place on a team ( their incentive to rise up the rankings and gain access to the team element of the Classic ) will race in solo events and earn prize money in precisely the same way . The only difference is that most of them will not race in relays and their swims will not count for points that go towards the overall Pro-Team prizes . Some of those who are not part of a Pro team can be elected onto teams by fellow swimmers for specific events on Team Trials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( USA ) powering his way back to the Olympic podium in 2016 -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> A new era has required not only additions to the swimming rule book but a rewrite of the existing law of the sport . The Professional Swimmers Association , working with World Swimming Association , Classic organisers and the Swimming Oversight Senate ( SOS ) , a new independent watchdog for the sport , have laid down rules of engagement that control the activities of agents and others . <p> For its part , the international federation agreed to groundbreaking changes in the rule book to cover the demands of a new era and the Classic . Among the most significant changes : <p> a lifting of restrictions on the size and shape of logos <p> permission , for the first time , for alcoholic drink makers access to the sport through advertising <p> Australian vintners have expressed interest in partnerships in two of the Classic 's " Islands " of activity , namely the " Dryland " , a meeting lounge , with catering , where athletes , Hall of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social as well as media can meet ; and " Fame " , an exhibition that will be organised by the International Hall of Fame at every Classic in celebration of the achievements of swimmers , coaches and others in swimming . ISHOF will also host annual induction ceremonies during the Classic , the thread of history linking former greats and contributors to the current wave of talent . <p> Michael Phelps who took the plunge for clean sport and unlocked the door marked " Time for Athletes To Be Heard " by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Adam Peaty ( GBR ) by Patrick B. Kraemer <h> Sustainable Swimming <p> The Classic Board have made a priority of keeping costs under control , consideration granted to the carbon footprint of the sport , a " Sustainable Swimming World In Motion " to be launched during the first Classic Final . <p> With lifestyles , training commitments , carbon footprints and money in mind , organisers also opted not to create new events for qualifications rounds . Meet organisers from around the world were asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , allowing existing events to tap into new resources and avoiding costly and unnecessary additions to the competition calendar . As such , in January , the Austin round of the Arena meet served as a regional qualification round for the Americas , while the Euro Meet in Luxembourg hosted Europe 's regional qualifier . <p> The host of next year 's final will be Long Beach in Califiornia after knockouts at Mission Viejo and Arizona State University , while Paris , Rome and London are among parties interested in hosting the event in its third year . Classic organisers and sponsors have placed emphasis on holding the events in locations with a strong swimming tradition , backed by success in the pool and audience . <p> Discussions continue over whether to have fixed venues for the event in the way the Grand Slams in tennis , Opens in golf and F1 grand prix events follow a regular circuit and in so doing establish traditions that transcend the race , help develop crowd-friendly environments and keep costs at bay . <p> During a press and teleconference today , Classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annual celebration of swimming , a fortnight each year when the best of the sport gathers in one place and has a party in the pool , with racing , exchange of ideas , guidance on safety , the latest trends and products and some great days out for what we intend to be a growing base of swimming fans . Its our church if you like and we have to go out and find those followers . <p> James Guy races Michael Phelps in the last race of the GOAT 's career by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Michael Phelps by Craig Lord <p> He added : " We did n't want this to be a match of other championship moments . There 's no need to replicate those . The Olympics and World long-course Championships are long-established , they 're great , they 're not going away and they will remain the peak moments of our sport , a time when swimmers stand up and get counted for country , team and self . " <p> He then explained the thinking behind the Classic : " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one . Among them is the freedom of great swimmers to have acess to great international competition based on their world ranking not the strength or whim of their home federations . Many of us were lucky on that score but many are not and get locked out of being a part of the highlights of their sport even though they 're are serious athletes right up there with the best in the world . <p> " We also wanted to create an annual one-stop show for anyone who loves swimming , a must on the calendar for swimmers , coaches , parents , fans and the officials , sponsors , merchandisers and marketeers who make all of this possible in a way that truly promotes our great sport up the ranking . We wanted to create an event with an impact that ripples well beyond the race , all the way out to swiming for life , safety and health . There is so much untapped potential in our sport . " <p> He set those out as follows : <p> provide a showcase in which swimmers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles in which they take charge of their futures <p> provide a living wage for professional swimmers ; <p> provide a regular swimming spectacle at which athletes can put their skills on show beyond the summer championship moments ; <p> provide a format that delivers instant results without the need to calculate who won ; <p> provide a forum for ideas and skills and different ways of showing what a great sport swimming is ; <p> provide regular haunts for that spectacle and therefore have the racing as the heart of something bigger , a show and a great day out for the fans , a way of reaching new people and bringing them to the water and them to a sport that 's for life and saves lives ; <p> provide domestic and regional rounds that do n't require swimmers to travel extensively when being home for uninterrupted periods of training is the right thing for them <p> and to do that at times of the year that fit the training cycle and in formats that are challenging , fun and great for fans and the new fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we do . <p> Hancock , the headline sponsor , is now working in partnership with other backers , including swimming 's traditional partners such as kit makers and timing outfits , to help to kick start a new era in swimming after the old World Cup proved a poor vehicle for promoting the sport and supporting professionalism among swimmers . <p> The cup scanned across four continents , nine events and three months , rendering the " tour " out of bounds for the vast majority of world-class swimmers for reasons stretching from school , training for the long-term , lack of financial resources to cover the high cost of travel and all that goes with it and on to the choice of programs that favour long-course over short as they prepare for the ultimate dream and challenge : the Olympic Games . <p> With that in mind , the first moves to rationalise the international swimming calendar have begun , the international federation having agreed to bold and sensible moves . Between Olympic Games in future , there will be one World Championships held in long-course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaks every four years is enough . This hands back value to both the world titles showcase and the continental long-course championships , which will also now be held every four years , in years 2 and 4 of the Olympic cycle . <p> Janet Evans raced at world titles 4 years apart , while Katie Ledecky , left , races in an era in which the global showcase is held every two years , its impact diluted -- Photo by Peter Bick <p> Joe Schooling by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Those previously guiding swimming at FINA , LEN and other bodies had for many years diluted swimming and the value of that most precious stock : champion . They organised the sport not on the basis of what was sustainable for swimmers and coaches and their programs but what suits their desire to be on the road as eternal , career and the most highly paid ' volunteers ' you will find in any realm in this world . <p> The rot set in with a vengeance in 1999 when LEN switched to holding its European titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar every December . It was not long before FINA ( several of those at the helm of both bodies the same people ) followed suit : world titles l/c every two years , world s/c titles every two years . LEN was forced to shuffle its dates and got landed with a showcase that takes place three months before an Olympic Games once every four years . Damaging dilution all round has been the result . <p> Now , the World Championships will shine like a beacon of peak form two years beyond and two years out from each Olympic Games once more . Further , four entries per natio will be allowed at future World Championships , with three allowed to qualify for finals , returning to the sport the potential for national clean sweeps . To take account of that change , trhe World Championships program will run elite heats for all events before development heats kick in . <p> All entered in development heats and subsidised by international and regional federation support funds must report for finals and will be granted a seat in a dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed as part of new education and development opportunities offered in conjunction with organisers of the Classic . Failure to attend finals and the chance to learn from the best in the world will result in loss of funding and a penalty stretching to exclusion from the championships . <h> MAKING ROOM FOR <p> Time for action and a new start .... image by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> A big plus for is that it taps into existing meets and race schedules for domestic and regional rounds . The alternative would have been to create a new presence on a cluttered calendar that has suffered from what can only be described as a bolt-on diet . <p> Swimmers will earn money based on placings through all qualification rounds , domestic rounds relying on home sponsors and funding , with qualifiers in regional rounds and the Classic paid from a pot of US$10m funded in part by broadcast income , sponsors , the purchase of team entry by professional teams , ticket sales and corporate events . The Classic will brings together the 250 ( each team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) best world-ranked swimmers in the world for the Classic fortnight . <p> The earning power of the athlete depends on what they swim and where they finish and where their team finishes . The budget allows for a swimmer at the lower end of the spectrum of commitment and success for example , racing several events in domestic rounds , two events at the regional round and two events in the first round of the knockouts and a relay at the three rounds of the Classic to earn at least $12 to $15,000 . <p> At the high end , a swimmer racing at all three domestic rounds , excelling at the regional round and going all the way as a winner of one Classic solo race and a member of the winning Team in relays and the overall Team prize could earn upwards of $250,000 in one season . <p> In a deal struck with the international body , all podium placers at the Olympic Games and World Championships will be granted automatic entry to the Classic following their season of success , with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualification stages at domestic level and race at their respective regional round and meet a time target in at least one race that confirms their form . <p> At a press and teleconference today , Phelps was asked why new rules on branding had been brought in for swimming . He replied : We understand why at the Olympic Games there are certain restrictions on branding at a time when certain sponsors are paying vast sums of money to be a part of the Games , to help fund it and when representing your country is what it 's all about . What we wanted the Classic to do was work for the swimmers , the programs and the sponsors that back them and swimming . <p> " We talked about it long and hard and in the end could see no reason for restricting the size of logos . In fact , we saw a lot of reasons , including how much fun you can have with the look and presentation of the sport , if you free up the creative process for sponsors . " <p> Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Brisbane and Sydney , the first day of the Classic final will be devoted to the " Team Trials " , a series of relays with a difference . The 10 professional teams paying for access to the Classic Team Trials will have no restrictions placed on them when it comes to the colours and branding on tracksuits and race suits . Each team may have up to 12 swimmers , the selection of which will require a spectrum of sprint to distance and stroke skills in order to mount serious challenge ( see highlights below ) . <p> Those who make the Classic cut for solo racing but do not have a team place may wear the branding of personal sponsors as long as those apply with international rules ( such as no tobacco companies ) . For the first time , brands involved in the production and sale of alcohol , such as beer makers and wine producers , will be allowed to advertise and sponsor events in swimming . <p> Phelps also welcomed a move by the global body for the sport to link the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a category top 3 place a wildcard entry to the global long-course showcase if they do not secure national selection in domestic trials . Their place at the World Championships will not impact on the ability of nations to select a full quote of swimmers for each event . <p> The Board was making its plans known after consultation with a team of business advisors that including representatives from the likes of Paribas and other investors . Broadcast representatives from a number of key networks , including ABC and NBC , the broadcasters that secured the rights for the first two Classics , have also played a key role in getting the show on the road . <p> Caron laid out a vision of what the Perth venue will look like in Classic mode before others spoke to some of the highlights of a four-day event that promises a thrilling start to a new era , one in which swimmers themselves have insisted on contracts that oblige them to repay all earnings in the event of a positive test for banned substances that leads to a penalty at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer out of contention for the Classic . <p> The model of one sponsor or organising committee fits all and controls all is replaced with a system of zones at the Classic that will be managed by experts in specific fields <h> The Arena <p> WATER : The race pool , suprises ahead on lane colours and coats of arms for teams , Classic organisation committee in partnership with sponsors and technical experts <p> HAVEN : Training , warm-up and down pool , massage and rest areas . <p> COAST : The stands -- public sales of tickets for the general public ; plus corporate seats , ticketed ; Parents and Friends of Swimming ( ticketed , no sale , including invitees , prize winners and officials ) ; Clubs ( ticketed , by invitation ) ; Teams ( allocated ) ; Media ( allocated ) . <p> SHOAL a zone where the achievements of swimmers , coaches and others are celebrated in a showcase of achievements in and out of the pool , organised by run by the International Hall of Fame in partnership with sponsors .

And in between race sessions , crowds will not want to leave the venue , the program stacked with day-long entertainment . <p> Here are some of highlights ahead at the Classic Final in Perth <p> The first day will feature Team Trials , relays for men , women and mixed , including innovative events such as the Classic 500 Split a 10x50m relay of five men and five women . All events at the Classic will include a series of knockout rounds ascending to head-to-head finals on the last day of the Classic Final . <p> The Classic Final will feature the following events : <p> Sprint <p> Classic Dash a knockout skins event concluding in a head to head final <p> Mid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strokes , the knockout rounds a series of swims , the medley featuring a 200m medley ending with an extra 50m freestyle <p> Distance <p> Classic 500 -- knockout rounds of 3x300m swims lead to a showdown 1k final <p> The knockout stages of all events will take place simultaneously .

There are lots of other ideas and models and variations on the theme out there as swimming reaches a watershed . Whatever they are , best think big and believe that swimming can , in the real words of Michael Phelps " make it to the next level " . <p> The path of least resistance is certainly there for the sport to sink back into and settle for the same old , let the world cup limp along , tolerate poor decision-making among the leadership group at FINA , moan and shrug and believe you have no power to influence the realm you work in . <p> Who knows what tomorrow 's swimming will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> there is nothing wrong with the Olympic cycle and the Olympic Games as the pinnacle of the sport , beyond the woeful state of governance and where that has left all Olympic sports when it comes to issues such as anti-doping . <p> swimming is a stronger sport for having the long-course environment as a showcase for one of the most aesthetic , one of the toughest and among the purest ( you and a dense element , no tech , no engine , gear and pedal to make it something other than you ) sports out there . Above , I deliberately left out mention of l/c and s/c . The smart thing to do would be to go for long-course , held in the sun , harnessing the very best of the sport and the environment in which it can be held but no harm in a four-day festival of fun in having a short-course element to it . Planning required but nothin insurmountable . <p> the future is yours , you the athletes who face a choice : take control of your affairs and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be headed in or resign yourself to being a small player whose sport comes alive big time once every four years with a couple of highlights in between that are built with and on structures that will never generate the kind of income required to make swimming a home for truly professional swimmers who work to be among hundreds not a handful who can earn a living from it . <p> swimming has swum more than a quarter century past the point when swimmers were able to accept payments for racing and appearances without that breaking FINA rules ; swimming is more than a quarter of a century past the point at which sports politicians decided that swimming needed professional management and a professional office to go alongside what have turned into very well paid ' volunteers ' , many of whom pay no taxes on per diems they pocket for expenses they never incur . <p> swimmers have been content to go with the flow and nod their caps to federations and others who hold the keys to governance domestic and international . <p> swimmers have started to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day of the Thirtysomething , with Michael Phelps , at 31 , setting the record for the oldest Olympic swimming champion in a solo event just before Anthony Ervin raised the bar to 35 . <p> Can swimming stand out in-season ? by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> So , with all that said and done and much more than could be said , the questions are clear : <p> Has the day come for you , athletes past and present -- talented in the pool and brimming with ideas and mindsets that could help swimming reach a new level as a sport to engage in the process of reform ? <p> Do you have access to the decision-making process ? <p> If not , do you want to do something about it ? <p> If so , what ? <p> Is swimming a sport that wants to dream big and set goals that it intends to achieve ? <p> If so , what role will you play ? <p> A of one kind or another is out there waiting to happen in one form or another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches and other to press for change , with or without FINA , ca n't find a way to seize the day . <p> NB : By all means criticise any of the above but better still , offer your vision and help get us to do so . <p> Health officials are

That same season , when Mary-Sophie Harvey 's family were delighting in their one-year-old 's smile , a over 400m free would have taken silver at world titles . <p> Lines like these or not far away among the young folk warming up the water at the Ontario Junior International in Toronto were not uncommon on the second day of the meet . <p> How time flies . Here comes the Millenium generation of 2000-plus borns .

Harvey then swam a minute flat for her third 100 , Anderson pacing 2sec down on that , Padington 3sec . In the lead and motoring going into the last 100m , Harvey slapped down a 59.52 bill for her rivals to pay . <p> Anderson , 15 , clocked a fine 4:05.69 , with Padington on 4:07.07 , her Island teammate Molly Gowans on 4:08.73 to all but match her heats effort . <p> Sarah Darcel Twitter <p> Harvey was n't done and almost caused another upset when she rattled home in 2:24.65 over 200m breaststroke .

That left her a touch shy of Darcel , who had done enough for the win in 2:24.23 . <p> British visitor Layla Black , a year younger than her 17-year-old rivals , took third in 2:26.47 , after in heats , while Padington , 2:26.63 , and Nina , 2:26.78 , completed the close battle . <h> Large Going Big <p> At 15 , Large is coming to the end of a fine breakthrough year .

From the home club of Ryan Cochrane , Davila struck from the front , his 1:50.93 mid-way leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of business was Alex Pratt , a 16-year-old racing for CASC to a 3:48.43 best . Third place went to Josh Zakala , os Island , in . <p> AAC 's Ryan Telford , led the pace in the 200m breaststroke on 2:09.47 , the 18-year-old followed home by Island 's 16-year-old Josh Young , on 2:11.66 ( and registered last year for New Zealand if the same swimmer I see on the record at Canadian age nationals ) . The bronze went to 15-year-old Owen Huang , MAC , in . <p> In dash final , the 50 free went to 's Ruslan Gaziev , 17 , in 22.58 , clear of a 22.77 challenge from Camo 's Mehdi Ayoubi , third place to Ethan Fazekas , WAC , in 23.11 . On ' fly , Alexandre Perreault , , clocked 24.26 in heats and then 24.32 for the win ahead of Adrian Goin , Pointe-Claire , 24.63 , and Tom ? re , Neptune Natation , on 24.79 . <p> The relay curtain-closers produced a win for Island in the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gowans , Padington and Darcel dominating the field , Neptune second in 3:48.96 ( Harvey on 55.31 up front ) , third to OAK in 3:50.33 . <p> The boy 's 4x100m free went to CASC 's quartet of Sho Neilson , Andrew Dungate , Alex Pratt and Matthew Ketchin in , close , on , Pointe-Claire third in . <p> Another 8 meet records downed , Harvey another Canadian standard in the bag and a new Ontario 13-14 record for Graysen Bernard in the 100 back 55.96 . Born when the youngest male champion ever , Ian Thorpe , was gracing the waters with what would be his us to do so . <p> It is the 
 parallel context , we look at the folk responsible for the environment of all the entries in the list above and most to come , too : FINA , the international federation is the focus of a review , reform or replace debate among its membership . The official custodians of the sport , as opposed to that much bigger body of custodians at the water 's edge and in it day in and day out , have let the side down on many fronts for a long period of time . <p> In 2015 , FINA leaders refused ( and continues to do so ) to even acknowledge a request made by hundreds of the world 's top coaches via the international association that represents them ( WSCA ) to submit to an independent review of structures and finances with a view to assessing what might be done to make the federation fit for purpose in the coming century . No response , no polite letter , no acknowledgment whatsoever . Head , Buried , Sand . The Same As It Ever Was since FINA established its professional office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Our No15 entry could have chosen so many issues from those covered in our FINA Future compilation of features on the federation 's handling of matters but none comes close to the damage wrought by its inability to get to grips with a doping crisis that FINA leaders to this day describe in these terms ( words used by four people currently at the top table ) : " Swimming has no special problem with doping . " You could have fooled me . In looking for a way to explain why , I go back to July and reprint the following Olympic essay , for those who are minded to read it and had n't done so first time round , penned on the cusp of Star Wars at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games for those who want to be reminded of where and what the trail of woe leads to , with a 2014 archive article at the tail end for the record : <h> No 15 -- Same As It Ever Was <p> Editorial &amp; Olympic Essay -- July 2016 <p> Today I 'll be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far away from Kreischa in Saxony where once the town clinic was one of the key hubs at the heart of the German Democratic Republic 's State Plan 14:25 doping program . <p> How times have changed . There are no world-class swimming programs pumping out Olympic and World champions and record holders in these parts nowadays . Thank God for that . <p> Hereabouts , you do n't have to look far to find both those who would defend criminality ( and even do so on the basis that ' the rest of the world was n't clean anyway ' ) and those who tell how life as an ambassador in a tracksuit ruined their lives and those of their loved ones , too , in far too many cases ( see the archive file at the foot of this editorial ) . <p> How relevant is the GDR in 2016 ? Vastly so as we stare at the wreckage of the Russian doping crisis and await the decision of the Court of Arbitration for Sport and then the International Olympic Committee . <p> The little blue pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the Russian doping cocktail of the hour ? " The Duchess " contains ... yes , , as well as oxandrolone and methasterone . <p> I ask the same question as that posed by a colleague I find common ground with on many issues but with whom I fundamentally disagree when it comes to the Russian doping crisis and response to doping and bad governance in general . The question posed by WADA Reports and the McLaren Report of this week : what 's to be done ? <p> The answer from Alan Abrahamson , FINA 's first journalist of the year and a man who heartily defended Justin Gatlin 's right to be racing still when so much of the rest of the world points to him as American hypocrisy personified , appears to be clear : a hard line on Russia , including a blanket ban that would catch the innocent with the guilty , would be unfair , even illegal and would be damaging to the Olympic Movement . <p> My reply : a soft line on Russia , allowing most ( for that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if nothing had happened would surely be unfair , too , and might even be deemed illegal some fine day it would also catch the innocent with the guilty , only in this scenario the damage would be done to clean athletes from round the world yet again -- and to the Olympic Movement . <p> From Abrahamson comes this question : <p> " If you 're going to ban Russia , you might want to ban Kenya while you 're at it . Unlikely ? If so , how is it remotely fair to ban Russia ? " <p> In a tweet he also raised the issue of Turkey , as in why Russia if you do n't ban Turkey from Rio 2016 because of its 40 positives in 2013 . <p> Abrahamson does not ask : spot the difference at the heart of the woe in those nations ? <p> Answer : the state . <p> That status raises the temperature and quite rightly so -- beyond anything else that could do so barring the bright thing up above at midday on a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chink glasses with the IOC once more . All images are stills from " Red Herrings " by ARD <p> Abrahamson goes to lengths to cite friend of Olympic bosses and Russian President Vladimir Putin chapter and verse . The President doth protest too much , methinks . <p> Cast your eye over this lot : <p> " Russia is well aware of the Olympic movement 's immense significance and constructive force , and shares in full the Olympic movement 's values of mutual respect , solidarity , fairness and the spirit of friendship and cooperation . <p> " This is the only way to preserve the Olympic family 's unity and ensure international sport 's development in the interest of bringing people and cultures closer together . Russia is open to cooperation on achieving these noble goals . " <p> Well , you could have fooled me . Noble goals . What , like issuing a decree to border control so that all samples be opened and checked before leaving the country ? <p> If Putin is serious , it 'll surely be the Gulag for Yuri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of Russia . Vitaly Mutko , the Sports Minister , too , came in for very steep criticism and stands accused of knowing about the system he has said did not exist . <p> Their fate will , ultimately , rest with Russian attitudes . As Putin puts it , this is all about the " ... values of mutual respect , solidarity , fairness and the spirit of friendship and cooperation " . <p> Shame he did n't ask if that 's how he felt about his jobs before appointing him , given that the minister now stands accused of being a king-maker in a doping process involving cover-up , the Olympic Committee member 's name and thumbs up on the paperwork granting official , state permission for clean urine samples to be collected for later purpose . <h> Two Sides Of A Coin , one less polished <p> Abrahamson sets off on his trawl of McLaren Report day with the words " The most important note from the compelling report released Monday is that ... there is no recommendation about what , as Lenin might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The most important note ? Perhaps he overlooked the following : <p> The Moscow Laboratory operated , with the intention of protecting doped Russian athletes from detection , within a " failsafe system " <p> The Sochi Laboratory for the Winter Olympic Games of 2014 operated a unique sample swapping methodology to enable doped Russian athletes to compete at the Games <p> The Ministry of Sport , the report states , directed , controlled and oversaw the manipulation of athlete 's analytical results or sample swapping , with the active participation and assistance of the secret services , the FSB ( the Russian federal security service ) , the CSP ( Centre of Sports Preparation in Russia ) , and both Moscow and Sochi IOC-accredited Laboratories <p> Yuri -- Russian Olympic Committee executive and deputy sports minister ordered the collection of clean urine samples that were then used as swaps for samples of urine that contained banned substances <p> Swimming is listed on a chart with 18 ' disappearing positive tests ' ( see chart below and for explanation ) : 9th worst of all 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weightlifting by far the worst , with more than 100 cases each . <p> The Moscow laboratory was asked to keep all 10,000 athlete samples in a letter of December 2014 , but by the time WADA investigators got there , 8,000 had been destroyed . <p> Here are a few more things in Abrahamson 's campaigning editorial that demand scrutiny : <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> He asks whether Russians given " The Duchess " were even aware . Great question , for many in the GDR did not know what they were being given . Does that mean that Surley Shirley ( Shirley Babashoff to those who know her as an outstanding athlete ) should forever be considered sour and second best and look up to Kornelia Ender as one of the greatest of all-time ? Would it have meant that the GDR should not have been collectively punished , even if that had extended to sports where doping was not seen as part of the problem ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming as he stares as the chart of ' disappeared positives ' and notes ' no issue ' and therefore how could such innocents be lumped in with the rest if the state-run saga . Well , not with too much of a struggle , in fact , gymnastics and synchronised swimming both sports that belong to the club of those with doping positives on their score in world sport , including Russians . <p> Abrahamson raises this , too : " McLaren ' did not seek to interview persons living within the Russian Federation . This includes government officials , ' page 8 . So the report is deliberately one-sided ? " <p> To raise the question is reasonable though not in those terms : on what basis does he reach for the word ' deliberately ' , one wonders . The more pertinent question to ask of people who know just how dangerous all of this has been for the whistleblowers , according to the people who genuinely fear for their safety would be : were your investigators disappointed with the appalling lack of cooperation they experienced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Is it the case that some who you might have spoken to in Russia did so on the basis that they would not be referred to in the report , let alone named ? And was that because they were terrified ? <p> WADA noted how important it was to protect and support those who find the courage to speak out about very dark things . None of which is good enough for Abrahamson , who simply asks how Rodchenkov " finds himself now in Los Angeles ? From what source or sources might he have money to , you know , pay rent and buy dinner ? " <p> He might have asked all manner of things of Rodchenko , including how is he faring in hiding and is he relieved not to have suffered the sudden-death fate at 52 years of age of Nikita Kamaev , the former boss and his former colleague ? I only ask because that , too , would be a reasonable question for an inquiring mind . <p> Abrahamson then picks up in this : " At page 25-6 : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Report has left much of the possible evidence unreviewed . This Report has skimmed the surface of the data that is available or could be available . As I write this Report our task is incomplete . " And concludes : " By definition , " incomplete " means exactly the opposite of " beyond a reasonable doubt . " <p> Stasi ( secret police ) documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped <p> Er , no , it does n't . It could mean , for example , here 's the tip and it is 10-storeys high ; we believe that may indicate a colossal edifice below the surface . The 10 storeys in view are no less significant for all that , of course . <p> Same point when it comes to the FSB , the Russian security service . A " glimpse " does not make for proof beyond a reasonable doubt , writes Abrahamsson , with some certainty where none appears to exist , that being the nature of secret services ... <p> Abrahamson concludes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then writes : " See you there , Russian delegation . Behind your red , white and blue Russian flag . " <p> That thinly veiled appeal to patriotism and pride at a time when heads should be hung in shame is the worst of it . <h> The Evidence Is Out There : In Abundance <p> State-run and pre-meditated is what it looks like from the great body of evidence put together by the media doing sterling investigative work and from the investigators following through . <p> And what it sounds like is the ghost of the GDR coming back to haunt with a whisper no less chilling for its lack of surprise : " Told you so -- we were not the only ones ... " <p> None of which is good enough for Abrahamson and others who live down the lane from Surley Shirley but seem to have forgotten that she exists . <p> Here is what Abrahamson writes : <p> " But -- and this is the key the report does not tie specific athletes to specific misconduct . At least yet . Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense to bar anyone from Rio . " <p> Fails law ? Where is the law that protects clean athletes , Alan , and if you can find it , do you think its done a good job ? <p> Morality ? What is moral about returning doped athletes like Gatlin , Lovtsova and more to the Olympic arena only to send a message to the youth of the world that screams " it 's ok to cheat and even cheat again " ? <p> Common sense ? Where is the common sense in teaching our children that the Olympics is a place where cheats prosper and even if they get caught , they 're good for at least two more chances ? Where is the common sense in teaching our children that they should never question anything that ca n't be proven ? <p> The questions run and run and there are valid points on both sides of the coin but almost all of those posed by Abrahamsson in his editorial seem to run one way to a cul-de-sac conclusion : Russia should remain because there are other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive test you have to assume innocence and so on and so forth . <p> You can almost hear an Olympic clerk somewhere whispering ' sure , there 's the issue of state involvement but hey , can that really be proven and anyway , there 's the official word to consider ; I mean should n't we take the politicians ' word for it . Thing is , we accepted the word of Lothar Kipke and Co and FINA even gave them awards for services to sport , prizes that they keep to this day years beyond being criminally convicted so how can we jump tracks now ? Far safer to stick to the law , blame it all on CAS and let bygones be bygones ' . <p> Abrahamson tweeted : <p> " What we have are ( very serious ) allegations . But : No cross-examination . No due process . " <p> The Stepanovs <p> Whistleblower Yuliya Stepanova with coach Vladimir Mokhnev who is alleged to have run a doping program <p> Beyond that being wrong it is deeply insulting to the teams at ARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage , the investigators who followed up and the men and women who worked on hundreds and hundreds of hours of evidence and had to cope with folk pouring 8,000 samples down a sink , evading , telling fibs and seeking any obfuscation possible to cover up their old clothes with new ones . <p> More significantly , it takes us back to the start and point of this article : a blind eye is being turned to history . Take the tweeted words and timewarp them back to 1973 , to 1976 , to 1980 , to 1986 , to 1988 , to 1989 , to 1990 through to 1999 . Guess what ? GDR doping , serious allegations , no cross-examination , no due process . <p> Guess what ? It was all true . And when due process happened it happened only because the state of a reunified Germany pressed the matter to a degree and went after some Mr Bigs ( far too many got away by virtue of living outside Germany by that time , coaching folk from other countires and back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Olympics and worlds such as FINA do ? Nothing . They did absolutely nothing of any consequence whatsoever ; no moves made , no words spoken with a mind to reconciliation and healing deep wounds . Not even after the guilty were criminalised . They let the sleeping dog snooze on . They refused to drive a stake though its heart . Hark the snarl of a waking beast . <p> Dear Alan , If only that were the case . You argue yourself for Russia to remain because you ca n't chuck ' em out in a world stacked with cheats from elsewhere . All too easy , then , to drive a truck through such platitude . Core is truth . Fair Play has far too often been left gasping for air at the edge of Olympic truth and we all know it . <p> The fact is that the IOC and FINA and others failed in a monumental and miserable fashion to deal with the ghosts of the GDR past and lawyers and apologists have made their case and been listened too . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state-sponsored doping on both sides of the divide and made it far easier for people to take up cheating and consider it ' normal ' and even ' acceptable ' . <p> When Abrahamson writes that " ... calls for bans or more sparked by the McLaren report amount to howling from the mob . Not justice . The Olympics are better than that . The Olympics , at the core , are about fair play " he could not be more wrong . <p> Shirley Babashoff , Kornelia Ender and Enith , 1976 <p> Tell that , Alan , to Margaret ( Margie ) Kelly ( who , you ask ? look her up she might have been an Olympic champion but for the GDR and , dare I say it , Russian drugs in one of the races she might have medalled in , the podium was URS three times , then came three from the GDR , then Kelly and her teammate Debbie Rudd ) ; tell it to generations of European women who were beaten into submission by the GDR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , to the USA women 's team of 1976 , tell it to Shirley Babashoff : you 'll know her . She hails from your neck of the woods . Would have gone down as one of the greatest swimmers and athletes in history . She went down as Surley Shirley instead by folk who said she and those raising serious questions about the East Germans constituted the mob ( and more on that when in a review of Babashoff 's terrific " Making Waves " ) . <p> You 'll know Shirley , too , because the USA has recently celebrated the launch of The Last Gold . You might have seen it . Did you get to talk to the girls , Alan ? Did you listen to what it all meant to them ? Did you sense the depth of pain ? Could you fathom the frustration of a life that left the rails when doping won the day ? <p> Shirley , Alan , was not surley nor was she the mob . She had no evidence ; there were no positive tests to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male-like muscles thrashing about the other side of the lane line . What she had was a deep feeling for her sport and its possibilities and parameters : she held nothing like ' beyond reasonable doubt " but she was certain that something was deeply wrong and unjust . <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> Nothing was " beyond reasonable doubt " , either , for young Rica Reinisch , winner of three Olympic golds , Alan . The certainty that then did come her way must have been a shocker for a young teenage girl . Imagine being told at 16 that your ovaries are dangerously inflamed and that sterility is a serious threat . Take the thought and place yourself in the suit of the 14-year-old Russian who tested positive for doping in swimming ... and the 15-year-old and the two 16 and 17-year-olds ... and ... I think you get my drift . <p> Russia excels not in senior swimming so much as in junior swimming , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of local economies and the pressure to perform intense . In junior swimming , Russia has thumped well above the weight of what follows in senior waters , in fact . <p> In the midst of that story is what amounts to abuse . That 's what I call it when 14-year-olds test positive for banned substances supplied to them by a team doctor and/or coach . Worse still when the kid goes down and those in the shadows either walk away or , woe upon woe , remain and work on with the same athlete beyond the warning or suspension . <p> It is against that backdrop and the one in the archive at the foot of this editorial that I feel it reasonable to question some of Abrahamson 's choice of words . <h> From the Horse 's Mouth <p> Yuri Gordeev -- ARD found him wanting when it came to clean sport <p> Abrahamson , a member of the IOC Media Commission , accepts without question the words of Olivier Niggli , the new WADA director general , when he says that " ... senior Russian politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices in Russia , and have conceded that a significant culture change is required . The McLaren Report makes it ever more clear that such culture change needs to be cascaded from the very top in order to deliver the necessary reform that clean sport needs . " <p> There 's some of the evidence you 're looking for Alan , right there . Or are all those senior Russian politicians lying from another angle as they " acknowledge the existence of longstanding doping practices in Russia " ? <p> There will of course , be good and bad people in the mix of all this in Russia , precisely as there would be the world over . The truth is , however , you can go the world over and you 'll struggle to find other major world leaders presiding over a sporting catastrophe of the nature and on the scale of the Russian crisis . <p> Can you imagine Obama and his team signing a decree to border patrols to have doping samples intervened and checked ? Can you imagine a top official in the sports ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection of clean urine samples as part of a swap club come the Olympics to ensure the best possible result through ilicit means ? <p> And can you imagine in Britain a local police chief popping along to the pool to inform federation folk that the two EPO tests that showed up and the name of the doctor that supplied the drugs to two teenagers will go ' no further than these four walls ' . All in the know in that scenario comply because failure to do so would endanger their personal safety . Not happening in many parts of the world , really not . Yet in Russia it did happen , just a few short seasons ago . <p> I know that without a shadow of a doubt , Alan Abrahamson . No , there will be no witness standing on a public platform and telling us all what happened . Why ? Work it out Alan . That does not mean to say that McLaren did not find the same evidence as I did , as The Times did , as did . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone understands is that the slightest mistake in identifying a source can lead to that person 's death . Same for the translator , the lady who brings the meals in and anyone else helping the journalist in pursuit of truth . <p> Sport is not war , Alan , but think about it as you drive your truck through McLaren 's report : evidence supplied to him and his team may have been provided on the basis that the source can not in any way be identified . <p> That is reasonable and that is standard practice and yes , it demands a degree of faith in folk like McLaren but given that you granted your faith to and you can surely spare a drop for McLaren and Co . <h> The Court Of Arbitration : Future of The Olympics in The Balance <p> The whole sorry Russian doping saga makes the Olympic world a depressing place on several levels and all the more so at a time where FIFA and football and the IAAF and track and field and mired in inquiry and the prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news so far in the Olympic tale : high rankings officials are being targetted . But will their removal and punishment make any difference to the culture and education and the environment in which young athletes grow up in ? <p> The bigger question is what to do about the athletes . Every answer requires compromise and pain and the legal challenge runs far deeper than some legal eagles would like us to ponder at the choppy surface . <p> The Court of Arbitration for Sport will make its judgment on Russian track and field tomorrow . That decision will , in turn , weigh heavily on the next move the IOC may make . <p> If it removes officials but let 's the athletes in , then Russia would hardly feel punished , while many in the rest of the world , most significantly clean athletes , will feel punished . Fair ? Of course not . <p> If it removes some athletes but not all , on what basis will it do that ? Could the IOC really claim fairness by removing swimmer X whose sample was tampered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swimmer who has a definitive steroid positive to her name and 5 positive tests for a banned substance this year which count for nothing on what may or may not be a technicality , the rights and wrongs of which will not be known until later in the year beyond the Games ? <p> All the more worrying if that first swimmer turned out to be , as real life confirms has been the case , a 14-year-old who had no clue that she had been doped and will now be made a victim all over again , while someone who actively took a product that listed the banned substance on the tin gets to muscle in on the action in Rio to the sound of depressed and damaged rivals all about her ? <p> Fair play ? Of course not . <p> Neither is collective punishment , say lawyers . CAS decides tomorrow . A fair and just solution and one that complies with the basics of law and order can not be a collective punishment in which all get dropped in the same soup regardless , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alas , in the context of sport , clean athletes have been collectively punished for decades . Who stands up for them ? Which law protects them from collective punishment ? <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> If anyone doubts that State Plan 14:25 did not involve collective punishment then I recommend they read right down to the bottom of this file , including the archive repeated here and the consequences for generations of swimmers , most poignantly women , many of them girls not women , who have been rendered victims of laissez-faire attitudes and deliberate blind eyes for many decades by a world sports governance regime and realm that remains to this day very much a man 's world . <p> If sport does n't feel collective punishment for state-sponsored systematic doping is appropriate given all we know about the GDR state plan 14:25 and its consequences then it and its fans should have thought about that a long , long time ago -- and done something about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case , to deliver as much unfairness as fairness as any hard line could when taken in the interests of a complete change in the culture of Olympic sport that is long overdue . <h> Watershed . Tipping point <p> Call it what you will . The Olympic Movement 's survival hangs on a thread . <p> Whatever the decision may now be , a percentage of the audience has already been lost not because of inquiry and hard and soft lines but because there is a fundamental lack of faith in any result as a result of cheats . <p> When the cheat is a state , then clean athletes in that state need to challenge their state , not the rest of the world . And the rest of the world , the IOC included , needs to send back that message and say " see you in four years and we will help you be a better you -- and if you 're serious you 'll accept a generous offer " . <p> The IOC has already partly dispensed with the principle of presuming innocence until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prevailing evidence . The presumption of innocence was eroded by a meteor storm a quarter of a century ago when what many had believed had been happening turned out to be fact not speculation . <p> Fact : no GDR swimmer ever tested positive in international testing <p> Fact : many hundreds if GDR swimmers tested positive for anabolic steroids in internal tests kept from the world as part of State Plan 14:25 <p> Fact : Zhou Ming was banned for life China and FINA have since stuck with a line that he was suspended for eight years in 1998 despite the existence of contemporary record of a press conference at the Perth 1998 World Championships which shows clearly that the coach was sent home and would be banned for life . When that changed was when he reappeared on a poolside with kids less than 7 years into his ban ( they even miscalculated their recalculation ) . <p> Fact : the count of positives among Zhou Ming 's personal charges went double-digit but that was the tip of an iceberg in terms of the numbers passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad was clean , the other half not ? I 'm afraid not -- we assume they were all on doping because among those who never tested positive officially were " Golden Flowers " built like brick toilet blocks and enduring with severe acne , bad teeth and on their way to serious health problems . <p> The sight of two world champions flanked by the team watcher and Zhou Ming haunts me yet : they were young teenagers and they were victims of abuse . I have no doubt in my mind to this day . Yards away FINA blazers smiled and pressed the flesh with the Chinese delegation and all was well in the world when clearly it was not . <h> Time to stake a stand if the IOC can not do it for you <p> The Olympic Movement belongs to you . The guardians of the IOC must be judged on what they do and what they do n't do . By batting back responsibility for ' in or out ' to federations without clear , unequivocal instruction as to what is tolerated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keys to the room marked " more woe for clean swimmers , more second chances for cheats " because that is what FINA has always ended up doing . <p> Even now , at a time of " zero-tolerance " ( as if ) , the Olympic swimming events will be stacked with those who have tested positive , found an excuse and made their return . The count includes several leading medal contenders . So much for a clean Games . <p> Sun Yang Photo by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> If this is not the time for USA Swimming , Swimming Australia and other leading federations around the world to stand together and press for clean sport and send the clearest message possible to Russia and anyone else who feels that cheating , doping , cover-up and corruption is reasonable and ought to be tolerated then there will never be a time to do that . The fight for clean sport will surely have been lost . <p> The responsibility rests not just with the IOC and FINA it rests with all those who are members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they serve : you . <p> What domestic federations can and must do is promote an atmosphere in which the forces for change from within their organisation and FINA through the representatives they send can not only be heard but are buoyed and protected from a model that offers a stark choice : assimilation or removal . <p> Take Matthew Dunn . You 'll struggle to find a single challenging word from the former medley ace from Australia when it comes to the catalogue of FINA folly . That is , in part , because if he spoke out , he would n't be the athlete representative on the FINA Bureau for much longer . <p> Heartening , then , to find him at loggerheads with the position of the FINA leadership on the matter of Olympic athletes spreading the word on WADA reports and Mclaren and more , sometimes even before publication . <p> Last month , Dunn sent out a mail under the subject : IAAF ban on Russia -- IOC and WADA Athlete Committee joint statement . <p> He informs his readership : <p> As a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position and comments we have made in the lead-up to today , and please feel free to distribute and share . <p> This is a monumental day for sport and we have , very proudly , been a part of it in ensuring the voice of the clean athlete was always present , and always heard . <p> Many thanks , as always , for your support . <p> Great : terrific note . <p> Yuliya Efimova by PBK <p> What a pity that we find nothing of that nature from FINA . Not a word on the day Efimova is returned to the pool but plenty of energy and fast-response when it came to " serious " concerns that bits of the McLaren report might have been leaked and been put out there " prematurely " . <p> It will take courage and the support of Dunn 's federation and those of others sitting alongside the Australian on those largely emasculated commissions that FINA leaders use as a prop to show the world they 're listening even when they 're not . <p> I sat on the Media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that FINA 's leaders heard only what they wanted to hear and simply ignored the rest , including a call for reconciliation of victims on both sides of State Plan 14:25 . Unanimous vote : all on the commission wanted FINA 's top table to consider the issue . To this day : no response . It is , for them , a place where letting sleeping dogs lie is the best way to an easy life . <p> Unless they 're challenged : and then they spend $150,000 on attempting to discredit what can not be discredited and trying to get Michael Phelps to be a poster boy for Julio Maglione 's presidential ambitions even when there 's not a cat in hell 's chance of that happening . <p> When I left the media commission in protest at the lack of transperancy in FINA , the pointlessness of raising issues but getting no response ( many of them simple matters of improving the lot of journalists and their working conditions and the interface between them and coaches and swimmers at meets ) ; the inappropriate presence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agenda setting and steer as obvious as unwelcome ; and the Putin award that should never have been granted ( not to him nor any other world leader ) , Abrahamson sent me a note to say that he respected my decision but thought it best to stay and change things from within . <p> That was the first time I 'd seen his capacity for deep insult even where none was intended . The fact was that by then I 'd spent more than a quarter of a century trying to persuade FINA folk that there was a better path . <p> Vladimir Salnikov <p> There is -- but FINA has yet to find it . Now , it may be charged with the task of deciding which Russians can swim in Rio ( including those who have tested positive on at least two separate occasions and would arrive at the Games as repeat offenders ) . <p> Now , FINA is charged with the task of making investigations in Russia that will lead to the truth being told by the end of the year . That truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WADA . Will FINA find them ? <p> Perhaps Vladimir Salnikov , the Russian member of the FINA Bureau , will be able to point them in the right direction . <p> Before any decision of the CAS or the IOC , FINA today issued the list of those athletes qualified for Rio 2016 , including all Russians , including Yuliya : <p> Business as usual . And all of that unfolding almost 18 months after John Leonard , the director of WSCA wrote to his equivalent at FINA , Marculescu , to raise concerns over anti-doping efforts in Russia tied to the Kazan World Championships in the wake of the ARD revelations of systematic doping at the heart of the Russian systems , stretching to anti-doping laboratories . FINA 's response was to say all is well because we have put in place the same system , independent observation in the mix , as that operated at the 2014 Winter Olympic Games . Oh Dear ! <p> Interesting news ahead on an organisation that refuses even to submit to independent review in the interests of progress , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport and its prime asset : the swimmers . <p> And that 's the point : the swimmers . Those now arguing for justice for ' clean Russian athletes ' have been far too silent when it comes to representing the views of clean athletes from elsewhere when they were being beaten to a pulp by cheats , Russian or otherwise . <p> When it comes to all between Shirley Babashoff to Ruta Meilutyte , one may well ask : where are Fair Play , justice , morality , ethics and all those fine things easier to write than find in the result sheet of Olympic swimming ? <p> Ah , yes , sorry : so rare are such things that you ca n't just hand them out to anyone . No , they need to be kept as the sole preserve of those who need weapons with them for their day in Court , that of Arbitration . <p> Shirley Babashoff , Kornelia Ender and Enith , 1976 <p> And so we return to this : " What we have are ( very serious ) allegations . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell that to Wendy Boglioli , Jill Sterkel , teammate and whisper it to the late Kim Peyton . Tell that to Enith , who might have been the first black woman to win an Olympic swimming title ( 1976 , still waiting ) and inspire generations , tell that to Sharron Davies , to Anne Osgerby , to Margie Kelly , to June Croft , to Nancy Garapick , to Lisa Curry , to Jodie , to Mary Wayte who waited four years to defend a crown she won in the absence of the GDR because of boycott only to be reminded how good that felt when she finished fourth behind three East Germans in 1988 ; tell that to every single one of those athletes thumped into a different status , to the families and coaches and others who supported them and had to read their achievements written up as ' brave bronze ' , ' plucky fifth ' if they were lucky : dismal failure if not . <p> Tell it to the girls of the GDR robbed of their health ; tell it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe ( no , no hard and fast evidence nor due process for them ) the source of woe to have been the sauce of woe ; tell that to the women who were never known to us in elite sport because they were guinea pigs being fed the sauce so that the bad doctor could know it was safe for the ambassadors in tracksuits . <p> Which is where we turn to the SwimVortex Archive and remind those catching up why the Russian doping crisis can not be compared to the bad stuff in Turkey , Kenya or anywhere else . We are looking at a different comparison : State Plan 14:25 . <p> Nothing was done about it . IOC leaders must surely know that can not happen again if the Olympic Movement is to survive . <p> Alan Abrahamson , I beg to differ . I do so with clean athletes , their coaches , their parents and the survival of the Olympic Movement in mind . It is not the clean athlete who must compromise as they are compromised ; it is Russia and the stinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : see you in 2020 once the world has trust and faith once more in your compliance as a member of the international sports community . <p> And during that period , let the voices of Evgeny Korotyshkin and like minds win the day ; let the youth of Russia understand that a price has been paid for rotten , corrupt practices among those running the show ; grant the youth of Russia the power to turn round and say to the coach , the doctor , the local official waving a funding cheque in one hand and a syringe in the other : <p> " Stick it where the Sun do n't shine . I 'm competing clean and so is my country . " <h> From the Archive <h> October 2014 , The Month FINA Honoured Putin ... <p> Give everything , take nothing : Nada 's welcome presence was unavoidable as Berlin hosted the European Championships in the former East 25 years after the fall of the Wall in 2014 -- though someone forgot the box marked EPO when it came to anti-doping tests for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will play instead -- and my family and I will do likewise , the 25th anniversary of the beginning of the end of the German Democratic Republic marking a moment that made it possible for me to meet my wife and for us to know our sons . <p> The Peaceful Revolution came to a head this week 25 years ago with emotional scenes as Hans-Dietrich Genscher , speaking to a crowd from a balcony at the West German Embassy in Prague ( to where thousands of East Germans had fled that September ) announced the terms of the deal he had negotiated for them to travel to the West and freedom . The trains had to pass first through the GDR and as they chugged through Dresden , police were forced to stop the cross from jumping on the rolling wagons . <p> Not much more than a month later , it was , in essence , all over : 40 years of the official GDR were done , the Berlin Wall about to be dismantled as Stasi ( secret police ) made for the files archive and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to shred , too much to hide , too many notes to wipe from the slate of history , from the mundane that informed the authorities what colour people liked to paint their front doors to who might be having an affair with whom and on through reams of scribblings that noted down the precise dosages of steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs some of them clinically trialled on human guinea pigs that had fuelled the GDR sports medals and records factory . <p> It was 1990 before reunification became official so another 25-year anniversary will be declared next year and east and west parts of the new Germany will pour over the past once more , much of that done with a sense of happiness and hope , some looking back in sadness and some searching for and finding reason to look back in anger and bitterness ( east and west ) . <p> In the realm of swimming , the impact of the GDR 's demise was not fully felt until the FINA World Championships in Perth , January 1991 . I recall Michael Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media not to dwell on the doping issues . Of course , it was impossible not to do so ( Otto out and about with a bag on her back bearing the logo " Just Say No " ) - especially when , later that year , the first details of the GDR Crime of the Sporting Century emerged in the book Doping : From Research to Deceit . <p> I make no apologies for repeating words old and do so both to mark the date and for the benefit of any who may need reminding . As Germany prepares for a day of reflection on a national holiday , we take the opportunity to recall why we should never forget what came to pass . The day is all the more poignant because it marks the passing two years ago of Nick Thierry , a staunch advocate for clean sport , a coach , publisher and supporter of recording the truth no matter how hard it may be to swallow . <p> Before we proceed , I give thanks for the fall of the Wall , for what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the truth and to those who went to great lengths to report it , none less so than my colleague Karin , who sat in on the doping trials of the late 1990s and reported from them in English . <h> Doping : From Research to Deceit <p> The book confirmed -- in part through Stasi and other documents saved from the shredders by people , since deceased , who worked with the authors Prof. Werner Franke and his wife Brigitte Berendonk the existence and nauseating detail of State Plan 14:25 , complete with the dosages of Oral Turinabol administered to specific athletes , generations of swimmers included . <p> On 26 August 1993 , after the former GDR had disbanded itself to accede to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990 , records were opened and State Plan 14:25 confirmed : the Stasi , the GDR state secret police , supervised systematic doping of East German athletes from 1971 until reunification in 1990 . Doping existed in other countries but the GDR was officially unique in so far as having a state plan designed to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how great our democratic republic and socialist/communist state is ' . <p> The body and bulk of what was discovered is now held in places public and private in several countries , safe from the long arm of any single authority that may ver wish to suppress the truth . Some of that evidence was used in legal cases against coaches , doctors and others in the German doping trials of the late 1990s and subsequent compensation claims by athletes who suffered a spectrum of woes , from personal health , physical and psychological problems to the horrors of inheritance in the form of children born with club feet and a variety of other disabilities . <p> Oral Turinabol was just part of the poisonous cocktail of substances administered not only to medal-winning ' ambassadors in tracksuits ' but to many who were never destined to make it beyond the Berlin Wall . Like the bulk of good but not world-class swimmers in the world , they were club swimmers -- but with a dark difference ; they served as human guinea pigs to test the effectiveness of substances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the athletes . <p> The Times in London carried the first post-reunification interview with Kornelia Ender in December 1991 , penned by me and revealing her recollection of regular injections and pills that she now knew , along with the rest of us , to be performance-enhancing substances . News agencies , broadcasters and news publications galore from around the world revealed similar cases , after cases , many confirming the shocking depth , width , malice aforethought and criminality of State Plan 14:25 . <p> In the late 1990s , as the doping trials unfolded , a special page on the internet was created by doping victims trying to gain justice and compensation , listing people involved in State Plan 14:25 . Those people included Dr Lothar Kipke , who remains on the list of those who received " FINA Pins " , the awards given to those who have graced swimming with good service and upheld all the best of values . <p> There was never any official proposal from the USA or others with cause to speak up for their athletes to have Kipke and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to be officially recorded and publicised . This year , after a campaign to recognise victims of the GDR crime on both sides of the divide , I lodged a request with FINA to have that situation reviewed . I am yet to hear news of any progress . <p> It is well past the time when leading members of FINA , the USA at the helm of them , pressed for the kind of recognition of the past that would result in Kipke 's official removal from the list of FINA honourees with an accompanying statement acknowledging the crimes committed , as recorded by the German court . <h> State Plan 14:25 <p> State Plan 14:25 held that children ( for many of those doped , particularly in sports such as swimming , were under age ) would be doped with substances such as anabolic steroids , some never clinically tested on animals before human guinea pigs were plied with them , and without the knowledge or consent of their parents . The 1966 blueprint refers to the drugs as " " , or " supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official policy until 1974 but experimentation on athletes started much earlier certainly from 1971 with research for the plan dating back to the mid 1960s . It was the biggest pharmacological experiment in sports history . <p> The drugs , administered by doctors and coaches , included Oral-Turinabol , a synthetic anabolic agent developed for cancer patients ; testosterone derivatives ; and " STS 646 " , a drug considered too dangerous to licence inside the GDR but given to teenagers before being tested on lab rats . " The pills came in a box of chocolates , " Catherine would say in court in 1999 . You are unlikely to know her name . By the time she spoke she had suffered seven miscarriages in the years after quitting the sport in which she was fed a diet of drugs but not for international glory . " I was a guinea-pig . I was used to test drugs for better athletes so they could win for the GDR , " she said . <p> The masterminds behind the plan were Manfred Ewald and Dr Manfred Hoeppner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , doping HQ , the hub of State Plan 14:25 if you like . The room is just 3 metres square . In it he penned his reports for his Stasi ( secret police ) overlords on a fold-down table he had installed because there was no room for a proper table . The room was all taken up by boxes of steroids ready for shipping to sports programmes around the country . Hoeppner filed some 1,000 reports to his Stasi contact . Ewald was always in the loop as chief political player at the scene of the crime . In 2000 , Ewald , then 74 , was found guilty on 20 counts of contributing to bodily harm , the tip of an iceberg of his involvement in a terrible crime . <p> Ewald , who started off his court case a confident and robust man but ended it with a ruling that his health would only allow him to appear for two hours a day , received a 22-month suspended sentence and Hoeppner an 18-month suspended sentence , the fact that they had criminal convictions against their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together they had faced 142 counts of assisting grievous bodily harm . On grounds of time , the judge heard just 22 cases before coming to his conclusion that the men before him were as guilty as sin . <p> Ewald was not handed a financial penalty , as so many others were , for his part in State Plan 14:25 , on the grounds that much time had past since he had been up to his eyeballs in guilt . It took German authorities the best part of 10 years to get cases to court , even though the same evidence as produced in 1998-2000 had been available in 1992-93 . <p> At Hoeppner 's right-hand was Dr Lothar Kipke , member of the medical commission of FINA . In that capacity he bangs the anti-doping drum but back home he is one of the worst offenders in the sporting crime of the century . A former member of the Nazi party , Kipke was described in a German court in Berlin in 2000 as " the Joseph Mengele of GDR sport " . He will also be damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team travel to the US , Dr Kipke forced ... athletes to be given testosterone injections . Dr Kipke is brutal in giving the injections . He does n't consider any pain it causes to the athlete and almost rams the into the body . " -- Hoeppner 's notes to his Stasi liaison officer . <p> Hoeppner and Kipke sat at the helm of a covert network that coerced and corrupted doctors , coaches , scientists , chemists and swimmers , among others athletes . He keeps a tight ship : beyond issuing " supporting means guidelines " with specific instructions on dosages , he orders abortions : <p> " Should a pregnancy occur while anabolic steroids are being taken then it is recommended in all cases that an abortion is carried out . " Children born to athletes who had taken steroids are to be delivered in a Stasi clinic so that " a decision could be taken as to what to do " in the event of " complications " . <p> Hoeppner later got cold feet as the monster he created got out of control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ( and boys ) . Most victims were teenage girls . Carola Nitschke and Antje Stille were 13 when they were put on a steroid regime , court cases would reveal in 1999 and 2000 . In his trial , Kipke adopted the role of Nazi concentration camp guard : " I was only following orders ... " . There to hear him was former swimmer Martina , who urged her abuser to " look my 15-year-old son in the eyes and tell him you were just following orders " . Her son , Daniel , sat beside her , his clubfoot swinging under the bench . <p> NADA 's 2014 educational material seeks to have young people understand how their bodies are magnificent without the need to cheat <p> The network headed by Hoeppner and Kipke extended to beyond Berlin HQ . In Leipzig , Prof Dr Helga Pfeifer is among those rolling out State Plan 14:25 . As she confessed me in 2005 during a reflection of her GDR days and in the days after it was revealed that she had been selling flume equipment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was involved . I knew about the doping ... The doctors decided . I was informed . I knew . I did n't want to risk 35 years of sports science work and I do n't feel I have to apologise for that . I know which system I had to live and grow up in . No-one at the time knew how long that system would be in place . " <p> Pfeifer handles the sports science data at the heart some of the biggest Olympic sports , swimming included . It is unfair , she told me , to taint " brilliant " work with the doping that was a part of something bigger . Many beg to differ , if only because neither she nor we can say how good GDR swimmers might have been had fair play been the watchword of a rotten regime . Two months after the Berlin Wall fell , Pfeifer , with official government permission Down Under , was invited to the Australian Institute of Sport . Her scientific papers were still to be found in the library of the AIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others steeped in the task of rolling out State Plan 14:25 were never called to account in a court of law . Among coaches , national team coaches Juergen Tanneberger and Wolfgang Richter and the East German swimming federation general secretary Egon Muller were among those who received one-year suspended jail sentences after being found guilty grievous bodily harm for having distributed steroids to under-age athletes without their knowledge . Several other national team coaches who had continued to coach Olympic , world and European champions throughout the 1990s , also had their careers brought to a halt after being convicted in trials in 1999 and 2000 . <p> If their guilt was weighty it paled by comparison to that of Kipke , of whom one lawyer for victims said : <p> " He gave injections , he initiated experiments , and did n't care about the individuals . He knew exactly what he was doing . " <p> Kipke , 76 and retired in Leipzig the last we heard , provided a packed courtroom in Berlin in 2000 with this explanation : " At 14 the girls were biologically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff . They were n't considered minors anymore . " Or even human , some might say . <p> was found guilty on 58 counts of grievous bodily harm to underage female athletes , was served a 15-month suspended sentence and ordered to pay a $10,000 fine . That was January 2000 . By October 3 that year , time would run out on the GDR doping court cases under a statute of limitations and all those not already called would walk free . was among seven GDR officials to receive honours from FINA . He received his in 1985 , the year in which Stasi documents show that those who were spying on a spy reported back to Stasi bosses that Kipke appeared to relish administering doping in a " brutal " way . The rotten regime itself saw in Kipke a man who ought to be reined in . Dark irony indeed . <p> Among doctors called to court to account for their role in a massive deception was Dr Dorit Rosler . She would set up a surgery in Strasse in post GDR days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doping system . In court , Rosler broke down in tears when she faced some of those victims and said : <p> " I should have shown more courage . In Nazi Germany we did what we were told to do . The GDR doping machine was no different ; we were just carrying out medical orders ... have we not learned anything ? " <p> No such level of remorse from Dr Dieter , Dr Ulrich Sunder ( sounds like S ? nde , ' sin ' in German ) and Dr Horst Tausch . They all broke the Hippocratic oath and indeed the law when they administered drugs to swimmers . They were convicted of bodily harm . They continued to practice as doctors years after the doping factory their talents were put to use in had ceased to produce dark results . Among others working in the system was Dr Eberhard Koehler , who sought an injunction to try to prevent publication of a book on GDR doping in which he was named . <p> He was not alone among those wishing to keep the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that Stasi documents clearly suggested that they did . Before travel to racing outside the GDR , all swimmers were tested and their urine samples sent to the IOC-accredited laboratory at Kreischa , a place charged by the Olympic movement with the task of catch cheats . In fact , what Kreischa did was to make sure the world would never catch the GDR cheating . Sportsmen and women found positive for drugs simply stayed at home , many after serious attempts had been made to wash their bodies of damning evidence . Little wonder that not a single GDR swimmer was ever caught , even though Stasi documents would later reveal the names , with specific doses of drugs administered , of generations of Olympic and world and European swimming champions . <p> In my archive is a copy of a Stasi document that shows tests taken on four women three already Olympic champions by then -- at Kreischa , a place not far from Dresden and close to where I sit writing these words . The tests were conducted two weeks before racing at the 1989 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allowable **28;1196;TOOLONG limit . Between them they claimed six solo medals , four gold , a silver and a bronze , while all four women contributed to a clean sweep of all three relay events for the GDR . Between 1970 and 1989 , no other nation claimed a gold medal in women 's relays at the European championships . <p> Many a success was built on a little blue pill made in Jena at the eponymous drugs company Jenapharm . Its representative sat at the table when State Plan 14:25 was discussed and honed , according to Stasi papers . None was ever called to account for their role in the mass abuse of large numbers of young athletes . <p> " If the treatment with anabolics is long-term , or at high dosages , real possibility for androgenic side effects exists . Skin conditions such as acne will develop , virilisation effects such as deeping of the voice , growth of facial hair , masculine habits , increased sexual appetite , and clitoral hypertrophy will all occur . " -- Jenapharm ( drug company ) paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GDR days , won Germany 's Golden Pill Award for services to womanhood . Two years on the company was named in a law suit by 162 athletes , many of them swimmers . 's parent companies denied any wrongdoing . In a statement , Jenapharm acknowledged that the company was obliged to " collaborate in the GDR ' 14.25 ' , but that it was not a driving force behind the national GDR doping programme " . The blame rested with politicians , sports doctors and coaches . The athletes ' claims were unfounded , the company said . <p> Ultimately , an out-of-court settlement was reached and victims compensated by the pharmaceutical industry in Germany and by the German Olympic Committee , which assumed the responsibilities of the GDR Olympic body after reunification . <p> Among the victims were swimmers who in their 30s and 40s suffered defects to heart , liver , gallbladder , chronic back pain , damaged spines and reproductive organs , tumours , had endured multiple miscarriages and given birth to disabled children . <p> Some of those stories may only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime of the century because of Prof Werner Franke , a cell biologist and cancer expert in Heidelberg , his wife Brigitte Berendonk and their lawyer Dr Michael Lehner . <p> One of the few victims to have spoken eloquently in public about her plight is Rica Reinisch , who at the age of 15 won three gold medals at the Olympic Games of Moscow in 1980 , each win producing a world record . " The worst thing was that I did n't know I was being doped , " she told The Guardian years later . <p> " I was lied to and deceived . Whenever I asked my coach what the tablets were I was told they were vitamins and preparations . " <p> Stasi ( secret police ) documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped <p> Years on and Prof Franke would say : " There was no medical reason to give steroids . It was against the law of the German Democratic Republic . It was against medical ethics . Everybody knew these drugs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation knew that they would lose privileges if they refused to take part . <p> " But they also knew they would n't be executed . Some of the arguments now resemble those brought forward in the Third Reich . Those involved disapproved of what they were doing . They knew it was wrong . But they also knew it was a matter of national prestige , and was good for their careers . The Jesuits have a saying : ' For the greater glory of God . ' This is what happened here . " <p> God and goodness , of course , had nothing to do with the abomination of the GDR 's State Plan 14:25 . <p> It was from 1990 that the many who spoke out against the massive deception on which GDR sport was built felt truly free to do so . Two decades on from reunification , there are those who prefer to stay silent rather than tell the truth that unfolded at the expense of others who were robbed of their rightful claim to history . And there are former athletes who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who take daily medication to help them to cope with the fallout of the poison pumped into their bodies . <p> In 2009 , on the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall , Deutsche Welle reported the case of Berlin resident Birgit Boese , for whom just getting to and from work is a triumph . Noted the report : The 48-year-old former athlete depends on crutches to get around , and she and her husband have to forego visits together to the theater , movies or local swimming pool . " Because of the pain , we ca n't really take part in public life , " she told DW . <p> Once groomed to show the world that the GDR was best at shot put , Boese now suffers from an irregular heartbeat , high-blood pressure , diabetes , nerve damage , kidney problems , " and a list of other ailments that have made her all but an invalid " . Her journey through a nightmare started when she was just 11 , when she started at sports school and was told to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . <p> Boese and 183 other victims of State Plan 14:25 were awarded compensation in 2006 from the German Olympic Sports Organisation ( DOSB ) and the drug company Jenapharm . Each received 9,250 euros from the pharmaceutical company in an out-of-court settlement and 170 of the plaintiffs were paid another 9,250 euros from the DOSB . Said Boese : <p> " It helped , sure . But for those with chronic illnesses and who have to pay out of pocket for medications , the money did n't go that far . " <p> Officialdom in swimming has taken a ' ' approach to all of the above . This year , there were plenty of signs that Germany has long moved on : at the European Championships in Berlin in August , the corridors down which athletes , coaches media , public and others flowed to get to the stands were lined with an exhibition that related the story of the GDR 's swimming past , the Oral Turinabol and what came of it all . <p> Alongside the billboard presentations were stands belonging to NADA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other brochures for their athletic offspring , agents were on call to answer questions and information was abundantly available . Bravo ! <p> Germany has had a tough time keeping up in world waters of late but it has reached a deeper understanding with its past , settled on a better course and can be proud of having done so . <h> A Different Perspective <p> Long gone is the time to stop portraying 14 to 16-year-old victims of abuse as thieves , cheats and deceivers ( that thought as pertinent today as it was back in the days of the GDR and the 1990s ) . Those whose names flood the books of swimming records and results from the 1970s and 1980s grew up in a time and a place and in circumstances that put a torch to suggestions that they had a choice , could have objected , could have told someone , could have gone home told their parents and expected their parents to step in . <p> This was a country , at the political level and beyond sport , in which , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposed to radiation while waiting to be called for interrogation ; a country in which many were shot dead while trying to escape to a place of choice through barbed-wire barricades . <p> Down the years , I have met many of the GDR 's swim champions and medallists . In two cases , I detected a troubling tone of self-justification and defence of an indefensible system . In the vast bulk of cases , the swimmers , polite , pleasant , well-educated and getting on with what might be described as " ordinary lives " beyond the pills and potions and sports-related problems that they endure manage to speak with dignity and patience about painful episodes in their lives . <p> Some of them may well have gold medals but they are all victims to one degree of another . Victims of the likes of Kipke , who , like them , has kept his international honour in official terms . <p> All on the watch of some still at the helm of FINA . Do current IOC members want history to repeat itself on their watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear : let the record stand alongside every footnote necessary to make sport an honest place for future generations while treating victims on all sides with the dignity and recognition that they deserve . <p> Official silence has followed . On the day that Germany celebrates the first 25 years of a new beginning , may that silence deafen those who have had the power but us to do @ @ <h> It has been 
 consider the plight of swimming as a sport struggling to attract headline sponsors and looking to be bailed out by masters whose power spending and grey provides a glimpse of the future for blazers who have not yet got it : the governance structures of the sport , the pillars of bureacrat first , athlete second , have had their day . <h> No 13 -- Masters , Servants &amp; Subsidies <p> The European Championships in London last May : from my point of view as a journalists covering a fine elite meet , things went very well indeed . Take your eye off the water and look at the books : a financial disaster . The elite event was bailed out by a surplus floated over from Masters , from UK Sport and from British Swimming . No headline sponsor stepped in . The whole thing incurred a loss and the folk manning the buckets to make sure the leaky boat did n't sink were the very Masters swimmers who endured a far from satisfactory event that failed to deliver on the promise of a great experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model of governance and the way swimming pays its way in the world is entrenched : international federation seeks hosts , gets the money , the limos , the show , and shares a lion-sized bite of praise when it all goes well but takes little or no responsibility for when things go pear-shaped and carries not a cent of any loss that may be incurred . The contract holds the key . <p> Take that kind of format and apply it to a vast raft of issues that crop up with each passing event and you have the lock-breaking combination to understanding why swimming is a realm that could do so much better if it were not for the governance structures that hold it back . <p> Denmark 's Mie Nielsen at London 2016 -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The conversation twixt man in pub with a pint across the table from blazer with a bucket for his champagne lifestyle : <p> What ? The event was a financial sink hole ? You 'd have to talk to the hosts about that . <p> What ? The companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kit in a heavily subsidised environment can not use a logo nearly as big as the sign on a box of Kellogg 's Cornflakes ? We have to respect the inegrity of our sport . <p> What ? The FINA family is staying in that five-star hotel overlooking the bay while the world-class athletes that have to get up and race stay in dormitories and three-star establishments in a different part and class of town ? Of course : we 're busy and besides , we 're very important : if it was n't for us , none of this would be possible . <p> What ? The budget for per diems given to politicians and officials and various ' volunteers ' granted a ticket to the blazerati amounts to more than the entire budgets for prizes given to swimmers ? We see no reason to justify a token $300-plus a day to cover costs for our leadership ; some of them are out on the road for well over 100 days a year , do n't you know . All of this is possible because of us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business-class flight , the limo from the airport , the five-star hotel , the fitting and ownership of suits , shoes , ties , caps , hats , laptops and more and all food thrown in ( excellent food at that covered by rule C 17.9 under ' hotrel expenses ' ) ? Yes but people are giving of their time , taking time off work ... and its only fair ... <p> Time ? And effort and expertise , presumably , too ? Yes , of course . <p> So why not pay them a wage and make them responsible for their decisions , that standard model applied far and wide out there in the world of folk who work for a living and pay their taxes accordingly ? That would never work . I mean , we 'd fail all sorts of labour laws if we did n't stick to rule C17 : " Candidates for Bureau membership shall be proposed by the member from which they come . " Volunteers choose their own volunteers and that 's served us all so well for so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? Turkeys , Christmas , votes see what you mean . But who pays for all this , anyway ? Well , mainly city hosts and their taxpayers . <p> What ? I thought it was all ticket sales , entries and commercial sponsorship ? No , that would n't stretch to the kind of budgets we need . And besides taxpayers do n't even notice ; they 're generally happy to come in , put on a great show and leave with everyone feeling happy with it all . <p> What ? Even if they 're in the red ? That 's sport , old chap and if they don " t like it , we 'll find some other city that 's happy to subsid ... I mean , host us . <p> Or perhaps not . Swimming faces a watershed on governance and what it will take to stay truly afloat in the years ahead beyond the biggest of occasions , such as the Olympic Games , particularly if you want the sport 's best moments to unfold in places where there 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the above caricature belongs to some who occupy the house of FINA . The example we turn to today , however , focusses on Europe , LEN , British Swimming and the company created to run the European elite and masters Championships in London this year . The whole thing incurred a loss , while the money of Masters was used with funds from taxpayer-funded bodies in the UK to bail out the elite side of the sport . <p> If the below is happening in London , you can guarantee it is happening in many other places . <p> The questions raised form the following tale include : <p> What must swimming do to become a sport that can pay its way in the world of professional ( many athletes are not , of course ) sport ? <p> Where does accountability lie and what should those who do indeed hold responsibility be setting about to turn it around . <p> London Aquatics Centre the length ... <p> ... and breadth of it -- by PBK <p> Overlay the outcome below on industry , commerce and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might expect to see heads rolling somewhere along the line . In swimming , even if Masters wanted to call for a head to roll , which head would it be . Do n't give it too much thought . It wo n't happen : for the most part , the men ( and they are largely men ) in charge are ' volunteers ' ; they are not paid a wage ; they appear to feel little or no responsibility for the outcome ; there are no checks and balances , no overseers to say as they do to the football manager , the swim coach and many others " sorry but this really is n't good enough ... turn it round at the next event or you 're going to have to go " . <p> The lessons learned by LEN ought to ensure that Glasgow 2018 is a wholly different experience . Meanwhile , time , which may well tell , is up for the experiment of the ' ' model of voluntary governance and career sports politicians arriving for dinner and never leaving until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ought to be run like that for the sake of the prime asset : the athlete . <p> And the elite variety of such fantastic beasts could do worse than to look at the power of Masters and learn . They stood up in numbers , took to social media , put their foot down and said ' with this we will not put up ' . An apology from British Swimming . How good would that be to see FINA 's director stop hugging Sun Yang* and start saying sorry to Mack Horton , to Lilly King , to Shirley Babashoff and more . <p> Masters are older folk ; they 've lived a little and they still love their swimming but when they arrive in the pool they tow with them the experience of their age , the professions and careers and they are not tied and bound to a federation that may make life more awkward than it needs to be . <p> They are free to speak , to make their point , much like King and Horton did in Rio . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the heart of swimming governance , then expect more booing , jeering and the end of sport as we 've know it in the pool . <h> Masters Plug Hole In Subsidised Swimming in Sink Hole Of Euro Champs <p> The London Aquatics Centre in legacy mode by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> A surplus of some ? 300,000 derived from European Masters was poured into bailing out the continent 's elite Championships at the London Aquatics Centre in May after a failure to attract a headline sponsor plunged the British event into the red . With UK Sport and British Swimming having to step in to subsidise the continental showcase , the outcome from London 2016 epitomises swimming 's struggle to pay its way in a world of professional sport . <p> Given that the Masters event was hugely controversial , many are now livid that any surplus for their event was used to subsidise the elite swimming side of the coin and the failure of the sport , the European Swimming League ( LEN ) , British Swimming and the Swimming Championships 2016 Ltd company set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor for the Old World 's most prestigious swimming competition . <p> The catalogue of woe that flowed from poor forecasting and the organisation related to hosting several thousand Masters at the London Aquatics Centre included athletes being told not come to the main pool to warm up but rather find other pools across London in which to get ready in before travelling to the venue . Anyone who knows anything about London and swimming in the capital city will understand well the logistical nightmare of finding pools ready to accommodate the needs of good swimmers warming up for an event across town . Add in the costs of such things and the schedule and travel arrangements required and the Masters event was a disaster waiting to happen , say critics who had given warning of impeding doom and gloom . <p> The show went on but swimmers were told that , having paid to get to London and stay there on the promise and anticipation of racing in the 2012 Olympic pool , entry numbers well beyond levels anticipated by the federations responsible could mean that some would only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition pool . <p> Criticism was heavy in the ait and on social media from masters dubbing their event " disastrous " , " catastophic " , " woeful " and " a complete bungle " . <p> Getting ready to race -- Jeanette Ottesen by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> On the financial front , although a surplus was recorded , that does not translate to an actual profit , among concerns on the balance sheet a projected ? 420,000 income from hotel-room booking converting to just ? 21,000 as Masters made travel and accommodation arrangements independent of any offers from organisers . <p> Information obtained through Freedom of Information requests to UK Sport reveal a sport failing to fund itself and failing to find others prepared to cover the costs in return for the benefits of linking their brands and products to swimming . <p> The Masters surplus helped to cushion the blow to UK Sport 's relationship with British Swimming over what level of bail-out each of the partners on the London 2016 project would be prepared to stomach . <p> UK Sport wanted Masters to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help fund the elite side of the event . Concern proved justified when organisers could not attract a headline sponsor . Down the line that sank its teeth into all of the contingency allocated in the funding from UK Sport for the event , in the order of hundreds of thousands of pounds . <p> David Sparkes , CEO of British Swimming , told : " It was always planned that any surplus from the Masters would cover some of the shortfall but in reality British swimming and UK Sport covered this also . " <p> Asked to provide a figure for the Masters , he said : " We are unable to state the precise figures from the Masters as separate accounts were never produced only integrated accounts for the Championships . " <p> A surplus , though , is not a profit , so what kind of figure is the real make or break on the masters event given the large level of income from thousands of entries ? The CEO replied : <p> " We ca n't quantify what surplus came from Masters only that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swimming put up ? 250,000 to guarantee the event , while a similar amount came from UK Sport , the bigger of the bail-out partners . <p> Masters will now look back at May 2016 and wonder why , given the problems associated with their own event , any surplus was not spent on setting right some of the things that went badly wrong with the Masters event . Volunteers were supposed to have covered the gates and lined the path of smooth human traffic flows -- and much of that would have come at the much lower costs associated with voluntary work . In fact , the numbers were so swollen that extra staff had to be paid to man the fort . The surplus anticipated from Masters was reduced accordingly -- and by a hefty margin . <p> Members of team Sweden pose at London 2016 -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Federations had calculated how many masters to expect based on a previous events held in Yalta , Ukraine , and Eindhoven in The Netherlands . The trick clearly missed was to know the nature of masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family to compete in international events and on that score London and the Olympic pool are a much greater draw in the **31;1192;TOOLONG market . <p> Organisers have claimed , including to UK Sport , that the interest in the event which led to the reopening of entries could not have been predicted , a claim disputed by some members of what was the GB Masters Committee , a body dissolved before London 2016 but the status of which remains a matter of debate . <p> Although British Swimming told UK Sport that the Masters committee had not made the federation aware of any potential increase in the number of entries from interested athletes , Verity Dobbie , the chair of the committee , gave warning that numbers could top 7,000 in a presentation to the organising PLC head Tom Chambers , Sparkes and British Swimming 's Simon Rothwell , according to sources close to the committee in question . <p> Adding to a sense of disagreement between Masters and British Swimming , Sparkes referred in one exchange with UK Sport to compaints coming " only a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fiasco in London clearly showed otherwise . <p> Sparkes , who steps down as CEO at the end of the year , confirmed that organisers " achieved much less income from masters accommodation than was planned despite offering very cost effective prices " . Ticket sales to the organising committee were " around budget " , he said when asked to reveal what income came from sales . <p> Commercial confidence can be undermined by the kind of outcome London has experienced . The British capital is not alone : many of swimming 's biggest events rely heavily on of hosts , cities and states , and the sponsors that are attracted to swimming . <p> In that context , asked Sparkes if he could confirm that the main hole in the books came down to a lack of headline sponsor . He replied in a word : " Yes . " <p> Asked why he thought swimming struggled so badly to attract major sponsors/partners for its major continental events in one of the premium Olympic sports , he said : <p> " Finding commercial partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now they want more direct connection with fans and participants . " <p> Had Masters got a fair deal in return for their money ? Sparkes replied : " The demand from the Masters exceeded ours and LEN 's expectation and , whilst we tried to accommodate everyone , lessons have been learnt by British Swimming and LEN . The programme has been adjusted for the future . " <p> Had British swimming discussed the unsatisfactory outcome for Masters with LEN and what provisions and measures are recommended to make sure it never happens again ? Sparkes replied : " Yes , we have -- and as mentioned ... lessons have been learnt . " <p> It remains to be seen quite what those are and whether Masters , a community stacked with professional in their own lines of work , will keep faith with international federations stacked with volunteers on hefty per diems and all too often showing themselves incapable of getting a professional job done in the interests of athletes and the sport of swimming . <p> Marco Koch of Germany ready to race at London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the LEN decision ( ultimately backed by British Swimming ) to allow a much greater entry than the controlled numbers that had been catered for in the orginal event plan was not accompanied by a serious Plan B headed " How We Will Make This Work " . It did n't work for all too many numbers of Masters who felt they'de been robbed of the experience to them . <p> Sources tell that in a YouGov survey yet to be revealed , data from 27 countries , including about 25% of GB competitors and 10% of French swimmers , show : <p> Only 22% agreed with the statement that the championships were a success ( 22% of GB and 21% of foreign respondents ) <p> Mean average rating for the organisation prior to the championships was 3.45 out of 10 <p> Mean average rating for the overall experience of the championships was 4.72 out of 10 <p> In contrast , the contribution of officials and other volunteer was very much appreciated , 83% of respondents giving a " good " or " very good " thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another insightful article on the problems for the sport . You of course did n't add in that our David is standing down so he can be on the Bureau as part of the blazers , a promotion perhaps ? or a long term plan to replace Cornel in the CEO role ?

 Speedo are parting company after one of the longest partnerships between a and a kit maker in swimming history . Come December 31 , the party 's over . <p> The end of an era : Australians helped coin the use of Speedos as a generic term for of any kind . A market shifts . <p> As Swimming Australia noted today : " Speedo and the Australian Swim Team first officially joined forces at the Melbourne 1956 Olympic Games , where heroes Dawn Fraser , Murray Rose , and Jon Henricks led Australia to win eight gold medals . <p> " Speedo continued to be a part of so many historical moments and has a proven track record of success with athletes world-wide like Eamon Sullivan , Libby Trickett , Leisel Jones and Stephanie Rice and current Dolphins Mack Horton , Cam McEvoy and Emma and David McKeon . " <p> Swimming Australia CEO Mark Anderson thanked Speedo for what has been . " We part ways respectfully and thank them immensely for their support of the Dolphins " Anderson said . <p> Australian swimmers will still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee will run until 2028 . Dolphins sponsored privately by Speedo will continue to wear Speedo suits even though Swimming Australia has struck a deal with a different kit provider . <p> In recent years , Arena has made solid headway into the Australia market , with Cate and Bronte Campbell , Mitch Larkin and Emily Seebohm among those backed by the Italian global brand . <p> The identity of the new Swimming Australia kit partner has not yet been revealed but whatever that is , Dolphins will wear the new brand in Budapest at world titles next July , though suits are specialist equipment and swimmers are allowed to wear whichever brand best suits them and/or backs them . <p> In a revision of its relationships far and wide , Speedo has withdrawn from several key partnerships in recent times , including its partnership with FINA , the international federation . <p> There was tension in the Olympic pool for Speedo this year in Rio in the midst of Star Wars and the doing crisis , with Speedo-sponsored Mack Horton and Sun Yang* , of China and a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others made their feelings known about those who fall foul of anti-doping rules at the heart of a controversy in which the Australian called his rival and defending 400m free champion a cheat . Horton then took the title from Sun . <p> Speedo is also the sponsor of Yuliya , the Russian who was suspended over a positive steroid test in 2013 but came back to take Olympic silver in Rio . Though Sun and Efimova retained their partnerships as Rio ended , Ryan Lochte , long-term Speedo ambassador for Speedo , had his agreement ended over his antics on the last night of the swimming events when he embellished or invented depending on who you believe a story of being held up at gunpoint us to do so . <p> TEL-AVIV , Israel 
 Queen Sarah Sjostrom , Jenner &amp; Vorontsov <p> Sarah Sjostrom ends 2016 with 16 of the best long-course 50m butterfly efforts ever , including the swiftest 9 ; with 9 of the best 10 100m ' fly swims ever , including the swiftest 7 ever -- and 15 of the best 25 to boot . And the 200m free : Nos 5 , 6 , 7 and 12 all-time . It 's been a case of early promise and steady learning curve at the heart of a a slow-burning bright star . <p> The all-time rankings took on new meaning the moment she stopped the clock before the rest in Rio to become Sweden 's first Olympic swimming champions among women . Never before . She tried in 2008 , cam close ; she tried in 2012 , illness leaving her a frustrating fourth . <p> Among entries for the top 20 are tales of towering perserverance and sticking with it even when the drop must have hurt like hell : Sjostrom is among the most noticeable examples of that in world-class swimming , her story all the more remarkable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been flushed with challenge in domestic waters since the peak days of Therese Alshammar , that a career worth holding up as a target and example . <p> What a job from coach Carl Jenner and from another who put his mind , expertise and experience to work for a fine outcome , Andrei Vorontsov . If we look for examples of sustainability on sport , of longevity of elite careers and seek what makes it possible to have an athlete test the best in the world at 14 and almost every year after that , stroke for stroke , on the way to being at her competitive best when it most counted at 24 , then Sjostrom is not a bad place to start . <h> Four Targets Three Medals , One Gold <p> Sjostrom had a potential four targets in Rio , freestyle 50 , 100 and 200m and then the one she wants more than any other : the 100m butterfly . She got it : gold . <p> Go back to Stockholm 1912 , when the fairer gender made its debut in Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : we have one now . <p> Therese Alshammar came so close with silver in the 50 and 100m freestyle at Sydney 2000 , while Sjostrom had good chances four years ago but was knocked by illness leading into London and fell shy of best and shy of the podium . <p> On the way to Rio , there were plenty of highlights but the speedy moment that gave the game away as to what might be possible was a 24.43 stunner of a world record over 50m in 2014 . It screamed confidence into every sinew in Sjostrom . She knows she can , her body flows and floats on the cognitive . The 100 would not be the same but if you can go 24.43 flat out and 25 mid relaxed , then why not , as Sjostrom did , ponder Mark Spitz and the first sub-55 by a man all those years ago . Why not believe such speed within the bounds of her reach one day . As Carl Jenner , her coach , put it : <p> " The 50 fly she did in Boras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 50 fly . Everything worked well but then in 100 fly you ca n't have that straight bat in the first 50 because you are working on bringing it home . You have to be a bit more relaxed in the first 50 , the body position and the hips are really important because the kick is still driving you forward but you have n't got the same turnover , the same stroke rate . <p> " For Sarah 's butterfly the key has been coming out relaxed , it 's getting that easy speed , that front end speed , relaxed out and getting on to the wall fast but relaxed and that gives Sarah the ability to come home on those times on that back end speed that she has . " <p> Sjostrom 's arrival at the helm of ace at 14 and 15 years old coincided with shiny suits . No telling them what impact those were having though in one so young and displaying fine angles of buoyancy , there was a good chance she would develop into a swimmer chasing the same kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shiny suit in 2009 ) . It took six years for her to crack it -- a measure of just how impactful the buoy was -- and in Sjostrom 's case not all of that was conducive to speed , Jenner believes . <p> He told 's Liz Byrnes at European Championships in May : " When the suits came along in 2009 she was just developing through and everyone said ah typical suit swimmer . The trouble is with her was that the suit meant she was too high in the water because when she is laying on water , when she floats , she floats incredibly high . She is quite a big lady , she has got quite a lot of muscle , she is quite tall but she floats like a cork . <p> " That is natural , you ca n't teach that , she has that genetically , her body composition means she is able to float very high in the water . The suits meant her kick was coming too high out of the water . The suits helped everyone but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as they helped some of the other girls in that period of time . <p> " She 's got a fantastic body position in the water , which is hereditary . You could ruin it by putting too much muscle on her body but basically her body composition is very good for swimming . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In long-term work , Jenner and Sjostrom have sought a happy marriage of timing and strength . Says Jenner : <p> " Once you get the timing and the strength of the stroke then it is butterfly and it feels like you are flying.I think it is the most beautiful stroke when people get it right , when people float and fly through the water . It is like an art form . " <p> It is the thrill in such words that gives it away : will strive to do great things on freestyle but the heart beats that tick faster for butterfly . Says Jenner : <p> " Sarah was decent at free , back and butterfly but she had something in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated so high in the water . She can lay there and lift one leg out of the water and one hand out of the water . I see her as a butterfly swimmer . A butterflyer who is very good at freestyle . " <p> And with that , we recall the telling moments from the archive that make Sjostrom worthy of our No9 slot in this top 20 list of significant stories from the elite pool in 2016 . <p> From the Archive <h> Waking up to a new status , September 2016 <p> Sarah Sjostrom celebrates the ultimate prize in the pool : Olympic gold and in world-record time at that . By Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Sarah Sjostrom peered up at the scoreboard in confusion and had to look " 100 times before I 'd understood what had happened " at the end of the Olympic two-lap freestyle final in Rio . She had battled for her third medal of the week a bronze that completed her collection of colours after gold and silver in what turned out to be one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizzling world record of just a month before the Rio Games , Australian Cate Campbell had entered the fray as clear favourite for the crown . Delivery of gold in world record time in the 4x100m free with a closing 51.97 split at the start of the meet seemed to confirm that even if Campbell fell half a second shy of best in the solo event , she had that kind of margin on the golden side of safety 's sake . <p> Come the hour : shared gold for Penny Oleksiak ( CAN ) and Simone Manuel ( USA ) , on 52.70 , Sjostrom on 52.99 for bronze . Then Bronte Campbell , the Australian world champion locked out in 53.04 ; then Ranomi Kromowidjojo ( NED ) , the defending champion and also within 0.1 of the medals , at 53.08 ; and then Cate , on 53.34 , the 38th best effort of her career on a list with 31 swims of 53.0 or better . <p> In Rome this week with Team Arena and while relaxing with a glass of sparkling and her beau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It was weird . I could n't really believe what I was seeing . There was this next to Cate 's name , two winners ... it was so strange . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom flies to gold and the world-record in Rio by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Sarah Sjostrom -- Olympic champion by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Sjostrom , gold in the treasury in world-record time in the 100m butterfly and a silver that " feels like gold to me " a touch behind swimmer of the age , Katie Ledecky ( USA ) , in the 200m freestyle , felt no differently . In Rome for a gathering of Team Arena , photo-shoots and fun with her sponsor this past week , Sjostrom told : <p> " First of all , I was watching my own result , saw the time and saw third and then thought ' what 's going on ? ' ... I saw the American and Canadian girls had shared first . I did n't really understand what was going on . It was so hard to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd understood what had happened . " <p> When the result had sunk in , the field made for the side to climb out . Sjostrom and Denmark 's Jeanette Ottesen hesitated as they reached the deck , the race done , competitive spirit set down , the empathy of swim sprint sisters holding them back . They waited until Campbell the elder reached them and then offered the pre-race favourite consolation . <p> " You ca n't really say much in that moment . No words will help . We just tried to show her our support . There are a lot of things going on outside the pool at a Games . You can never tell . She 'd set the world record a few weeks before . It 's not easy to go into an Olympic final as a favourite . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom by PBK <p> Sjostrom knows the feeling . She was a medal hope in 2008 soon after becoming a European 100m butterfly champion at just 15 ; then again a medal and title challenger at London 2012 . Fourth , arguably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past from page to footnote in swimming history . What Sjostrom will now be remember for is not the near miss but the bullseye , the ultimate prize in the pool : Olympic gold . What she will be remembered for is becoming Swedish swimming 's biggest ever Olympic medal hauler at a single Games . For becoming Sweden 's first woman to win an Olympic swimming gold ; first from her nation to win the 100 ' fly ; first ... in short , a pioneer of her sport on several levels . <p> Had it all sunk in when she arrived home to a great reception in Sweden ? <p> " It was great to come home . We were in Rio for three weeks and I was very tired there in the last days and so it was hard to fathom what it meant . I was able to relax in Stockholm for a long time and then I had a vacation in New York . Then it starts to sink in . " <p> Joy the conclusion ? " Yes , I 'm so happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympics and I felt a lot of pressure on me on the way to the Games . A lot of that I put on myself : I really wanted to be successful ; I wanted that gold medal in the 100 ' fly . That was the best chance to win gold in my Olympic career and wanted it so much to make those 55 seconds the best of my life . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Sarah Sjostrom -- Olympic champion by PBK <p> Everything about her build-up , her season , the consistency of speed she had shown throughout the Olympic cycle to Rio , suggested that Sjostrom was among those on the list of ' safest predictions of gold ' . She took nothing for granted . <p> With a nod to the large club of those who arrived at a Games favourite for gold before leaving with a different outcome , Sjostrom added : " I knew that the favourite does n't always win the race . I needed to relax ; I just had to try to remember ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing it ' . " <p> Still , a big moment . What are the things that make confidence a louder whisper than doubt come the hour ? <p> " I was standing behind the blocks and just tried to remember how many strokes I took in the best races I had in the last couple of years and telling myself ' this should be easy now ; you know what to do ' . Competition day should be easy ( relative , when compared to the long-term efforts to get to that place ) . " <h> The Long Haul <p> When Sjostrom clocked 24.43 for the 50m butterfly world record in Boras back in 2014 , it was clear that we were looking at a game-changing moment and athlete . Not just the time but the flow and performance screamed confidence into every sinew in Sjostrom . As Carl Jenner , her coach , put it : <p> " The 50 fly she did in Boras is probably the closest thing to perfection I have seen in 50 fly . Everything worked well but then in 100 fly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 because you are working on bringing it home . You have to be a bit more relaxed in the first 50 , the body position and the hips are really important because the kick is still driving you forward but you have n't got the same turnover , the same stroke rate . <p> " For Sarah 's butterfly the key has been coming out relaxed , it 's getting that easy speed , that front end speed , relaxed out and getting on to the wall fast but relaxed and that gives Sarah the ability to come home on those times on that back end speed that she has .

No telling them what impact those were having though in one so young and displaying fine angles of buoyancy , there was a good chance she would develop into a swimmer chasing the same kind of speed ( 56 flat at world titles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years for her to crack it -- a measure of just how impactful the buoy was -- and in Sjostrom 's case not all of that was conducive to speed , Jenner believes . <p> He told 's Liz Byrnes at European Championships in May : " When the suits came along in 2009 she was just developing through and everyone said ah typical suit swimmer . The trouble is with her was that the suit meant she was too high in the water because when she is laying on water , when she floats , she floats incredibly high . She is quite a big lady , she has got quite a lot of muscle , she is quite tall but she floats like a cork . <p> " That is natural , you ca n't teach that , she has that genetically , her body composition means she is able to float very high in the water . The suits meant her kick was coming too high out of the water . The suits helped everyone but I would like to say they did n't help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that period of time . <p> " She 's got a fantastic body position in the water , which is hereditary . You could ruin it by putting too much muscle on her body but basically her body composition is very good for swimming . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom by PBK <p> In long-term work , Jenner and Sjostrom have sought a happy marriage of timing and strength . Says Jenner : <p> " Once you get the timing and the strength of the stroke then it is butterfly and it feels like you are flying.I think it is the most beautiful stroke when people get it right , when people float and fly through the water . It is like an art form . " <p> It is the thrill in such words that gives it away : Sjostrom will strive to do great things on freestyle but the heart beats that tick faster for butterfly . Says Jenner : <p> " Sarah was decent at free , back and butterfly but she had something in butterfly . Think because of her body position , she floated so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift one leg out of the water and one hand out of the water . I see her as a butterfly swimmer . A butterflyer who is very good at freestyle . " <h> Very good indeed , as it turned out ... <p> Sarah Sjostrom by PBK <p> " Competition day should be easy " , she says . Even when you 're up against Ledecky , it seemed , as Sjostrom took on the current queen of freestyle spectrums chasing history just as she is chased by rivals who struggle to match the American 's pace . <p> Over 400 and 800m , it was Britain 's Jazz Carlin who came closest , taking two silvers for self and Britain as best of the rest of the very best distance freestylers beyond the pioneer racing several Games into the future . <p> The 200m produced no world records ( of course not ) from Ledecky as the longer battles did in Rio but the winning performamce was not the lesser effort for that and unfolded in a race of racers not just clock for the American . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she recalls the 200m , silver a touch behind Ledecky and a second personal best time in an Olympic final : <p> " It my was my best time , another PB in an Olympic final . I was really happy with that because it is not easy to do that in an Olympic final . It was amazing to race next to Ledecky . I knew it would be tough ; I knew I had a fast back end ; I knew that she had even faster back end speed . I 'm not used to doing that practising back end speed in a 200m free in season . In season at home , I 'm always the one with the best back end speed . So , I knew this would be different and I tried just to to focus on my own race . It turned out that it was actually much closer than I thought it would be ; I was very happy with the time and the silver . " <p> Sjostrom , whose silver marked a first medal in the 200m in major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Championships because the continental program places it in the same session as her signature 100m butterfly . <p> Sarah Sjostrom by PBK <p> She notes the levels at which she lacked any sense of dress rehearsal for the Olympic 200m final in a lane next to Ledecky : " My focus is sprint and I 'm used to racing other sprinters . It is very different to race a distance swimmer . I had a lot of fun with it because I knew it would be very tough , that it was always going to be a challenge and that I was not expected to win . I knew I had a good chance of a medal but to win itm well , I would have been been very surprised . <p> " She is so strong . That silver , it feels like a gold medal to me . " <p> Sjostrom was aware that racing the 200m could take the edge off her 50 and 100m performances later in the week in Rio but she has no regrets . <p> " There were a lot of things behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more complicated that other events : there are many security controls to go through and there 's much more to do than even the world , where everything is easier . I knew that I would be bit more tired after 4-5 days of racing in Rio than at the worlds . I knew that to be at my best in the 50 and 100 I would not swim the 200 but I 'm very glad I did . " <p> It is a moment she will savour in an event she may never return to on the biggest of occasions : " I wo n't swim 200 much anymore -- I 'll be more focussed on the sprints . I will still do the 200 sometimes but perhaps not at the major internationals . " <p> There has been no official announcement and discussions about where everyone will fit in any new picture have yet to be held with all parties , including the pending chat between Sjostrom and Jenner . <p> " I will probably stay in Stockholm and continue to swim at the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the new coach . I have n't talked to him yet ; I do n't know much more than you do . " <p> What she knows better than anyone is that Jenner has " been like a second father for me " . Sjostrom notes : " I was 13 years old when he started coaching me . He has been a very big support . I have been working with him for 10 years and it has worked really well . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Perhaps it was time for a change , however , she suggested . " Sometimes you need to change and do new training . I want to focus on more sprint events . I 've been fast in sprint but I want to see where I can get to when I am more focussed on it . " <p> The future , she believes , holds most promise opf speed gains in the 50 and 100m freestyle , given that her technique on butterfly is alsmost as good as it may ever get . Gains oin any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns and underwater swimming , which I 'm not very good at " . <p> " I still have a lot of things to work on in dryland training , as well and I 'm looking forward to the new chapter . " <p> For now , she is doing a simple maintenance program and will not race in international waters this year again , opting out of world cup action and bypassing the World short-course championships in December . <p> Sarah and mum , sharing the load of 60kg Danes <p> " I still have no training plan for the season , " says Sjostrom . " I go to the pool when I want to and I 'm doing some weights and running to stay in shape but it 's important to just relax and not do the same routine all the time . " <p> That means fine meals and " hanging out " with family and friends , the social side of her life apt to contribute to her fitness , too , what with Great Danes to walk . Sjostrom confirms with a chuckle : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like a weights session taking them for a walk : 120kg , 60 on each arm . " <h> Next Chapter <p> Sarah Sjostrom sips from a drink made by sponsor Oatly <p> The world long-course titles in Hungary 10 months or so away will mark her next top racing destination . It is a trail she knows well as she takes in the view at the Sette Colli pool at the Foro Italico , scene of her maiden world crown back in 2009 . <p> " I 'm so happy to be back in Rome where I won my first world title and just because it is so beautiful . It brings back a lot of memories and this is one of the most beautiful pools in the world . " . <p> Time to reflect on being governed by time , even thoughts of longevity put off for another season : <p> " I 'm trying not to think in a four-year Olympic cycle all the time now . We have other big competitions before the Games Tokyo 2020 and let 's see first how many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many years . I enjoy being a professional athlete . " <p> The trips and trappings of Rome on the road with arena at the start of a new life as " Olympic champion " only serve to reinforce the feeling . <p> From the archive <h> Rio 2016 -- A promise delivered 100 ' Fly Gold <p> There was a time when her heart was questioned . When her ability to handle pressure was questioned . When her resolve was questioned . These days , she 's nothing less than one of the premier figures in the sport , a multi-event star who no longer has to answer the query : Where is your Olympic gold ? It 's draped around her neck . <p> The stockpile of fourth-place finishes at major events that once dotted the portfolio of Sarah Sjostrom was isolated to history on Sunday night , as the Swede opened the second night of finals at the Rio Aquatics Centre in the most impressive way possible . Leading from the start , Sjostrom raced away from the field , especially over the second lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-second faster than the global mark Dana Vollmer posted on the way to gold at the 2012 Games in London . <p> Sjostrom basically competed in a one-woman race , holding a body-length advantage as the athletes headed into the finish . At the touch , Sjostrom turned toward the scoreboard and eventually recognized her achievement , splashing the water in celebration . Her hand then covered her mouth , almost as if to say , " Finally . " <p> Sarah Sjostrom by PBK <p> A night after helping Canada to the bronze medal in the 400 freestyle relay , 16-year-old Penny Oleksiak dialed up another World Junior Record , her mark of 56.46 good for the silver medal and better than the 56.73 junior standard she set in prelims . Vollmer was the bronze medalist in 56.63 , her hardware complementing the gold from London and completing a feel-good comeback . <p> In 2011 , Sjostrom had the unenviable distinction of finishing just off the podium in a trio of event at the World Championships . Fourth-place finishes in the 200 freestyle , 50 butterfly and 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moxie to deliver under the glare . That characterization only grew the next summer when she left the Olympics without a medal , crashing out of the semifinals in the 50 freestyle , 100 free and 200 free and placing fourth in the 100 fly . <p> Sarah Sjostrom by PBK <p> By 2013 , however , Sjostrom began moving in a positive direction . She won the world title in the 100 fly and medaled in the 100 free , following two years later with world crowns in the 50 fly and 100 fly , and medals in the disciplines . Along the way , she generated spectacular times on a routine basis , her butterfly efforts taking the stroke to points where it had never been among females . Not surprisingly , a confidence grew . <p> " The feeling is totally crazy , " Sjostrom said . " I did n't realize it was a world record . I knew I was the big favorite . I was under pressure , so I tried to focus on no disasters . Before the start , I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . I know what to do . I was not so nervous . I was in a good mood today . I knew this was my big chance . " <p> There are several contenders to leave this Olympiad as the global faces of women 's swimming , Sjostrom among a group that includes American Katie Ledecky , Australian Cate Campbell and Hungarian Katinka Hosszu . The Swede will get her chance at Ledecky in the 200 free , then will have the opportunity to tangle with Campbell in the sprints . If she does n't emerge as the IT girl of the sport , a fistful of medals will surely place her in the queen 's court . <p> The early speed of Denmark 's Jeanette Ottesen was the only thing to prevent Sjostrom from a wire-to-wire triumph , and even the Dane could n't stay with her Scandinavian rival . Sjostrom went through the midway point in 26.01 , a hundredth ahead of Ottesen , but was .36 up on Oleksiak . Over the last lap , the margin grew . Sjostrom split 29.47 for her homecoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sub-30 back-end splits . China 's Chen Xinyi , the fourth-place finisher at 56.72 , had the other , going 29.74 . <p> Vollmer 's return to the medals stand completed an epic comeback , one in which she welcomed motherhood and enjoyed a maternity leave before returning to racing . After winning the bronze medal in the 100 fly at the 2013 World Champs , Vollmer exited the sport for a brief time and welcomed son Arlen with husband Andy Grant . <p> As Vollmer made her way back to the water , there were no guarantees the comeback would result in a trip to Rio . Rather , she approached her return as a process , intrigued to see what each day brought . She initially sought a sub-minute clocking , then chased sub-59 , sub-58 and sub-57 . Along the way , Vollmer knew she could be in contention for a third Olympiad and more hardware . <p> Fourth at the turn , Vollmer was in good position to reach the podium . Her finishing speed was going to be enough to overtake Ottesen , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objective . Splitting 30.18 , Vollmer got the job done . <p> " I 've always set extremely lofty goals and to come back here and race Sarah , that is setting it at absolutely the top bar , " Vollmer said . " Having taken all those little steps , I feel I have appreciated every day . I remember my first 100 butterfly when I came back being 1:09 and I remember thinking , ' wow , it 's going to take me a while to get back down there . ' I am more appreciative of every single moment I have out here as you just never know if you will get another moment . I did n't know if I was even going to get here , so I am extremely proud of my race . " <p> In between Sjostrom and Vollmer was the upstart , Oleksiak . Every Olympic year , a handful of teenage girls emerge as medal contenders , Ledecky and Ruta Meilutyte as examples from the last quadrennial . This year , Oleksiak has been the riser , first appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also showing talent in the sprint freestyles . <p> Unfazed by the moment , Oleksiak tried to stay as close to Sjostrom as possible on the outgoing lap , turning in 26.37 . She had plenty of firepower coming home , as she held off Vollmer for a convincing silver medal . With Oleksiak leading the way , and several other key pieces in the arsenal , Canada is surely in the middle of a surge . <p> " It is super amazing , " Oleksiak said . " I still have a few more years left as a junior . Taking that time down is going us to do so . <p> Sportsmail guides you 
 top : life expectancy soared as the human lot improved after the end of the Second World War but it now appears to have levelled off : the longevity of Jeanne Calment , who died in 1997 at 122 , has not been topped since . <p> There 's a lovely story from the life of Calment . It goes something like this : her family solicitor was also a friend of the family ; when Calment was getting on in age , the solictor offered to buy her beautiful home on the basis that she would be able , under contract , to live out the rest of her days there ; the solicitor was much younger that Mme. Calment and reached a decent age himself but he never got to live in the house he had bought , courtesy of those 122 years of longevity . <p> Human limits divide scientific opinion , the article in Le Monde notes : some say there is a very low chance of humans living to over 125 years of age being relatively commonplace . A research paper published by Nature last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researches disagree and see an upward trend that is not yet done . <p> The feature rattles through many measures , including intelligence , which in some studies appears to have tipped over the peak and is , on some measures , in decline . A fascinating read . It touches , too , on sporting limits . <p> Wars and doping were among detractors and accelerators , as were shiny suits , Le Monde notes , citing the 3% leap in 2008-09 , the short-lived era of polyurethane suits still represented strongly in the all-time world rankings 20 , 50 , 100 and 300 deep across all events . <p> The article has little to say on how training , techniques and much more in swimming have affected speed over the years . What it does suggest is that limits have been reached and there is not much more in the natural tank . <p> In swimming , the brain and its interaction with the central nervous system hold the key , some believe . More on that in 2017 . <p> Gene technology and the introduction of nanomaterials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human beyond natural limits , Le Monde 's article notes . Rules stand in the way and after a year such as 2016 , the public mood having turned strongly against winning and ' progress ' at all costs , including doping , those rules are likely to stay firm and be strengthened in the immediate future . <p> The story yet to be told of a story much told <p> All of which reminds us of the study from the German Democratic Republic in the 1980s . <p> It was 36 years ago when sports scientists , coaches and Stasi operatives gathered around a table at an office behind the Berlin Wall and tried to calculate where world swimming records could reasonably be expected to get too by the year 2000 and at what level they would reach their limit . <p> A chart was compiled , one that might even have been used to control the amount of progress necessary in the pool to stay a stroke ahead in the Cold War in the pool . In my research , I unearthed the very chart . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of extrapolating progress achieved from and it ran under the headline : <p> Dreamworld or Real Possibility ? <p> GDR , state plan 14:25 : abuse victims on both sides yet a call for reconciliation has fallen on deaf ears <p> Here is what was forecast for swimming by the year 2000 and what the limit for the sport would be , all-time ( I recommend sitting down to digest ) ... you will note that the men 's times are more realistic but then those who compiled the chart will have been working on the basis of the kind of ' progress ' made by girls and women fed regular dosages of Oral Turinabol to grant them some of the strengths that come natural to men : <p> Women : <p> 100m free : 54.79 ( WR in 1981 ) ; 51.1 ( 2000 ) ; 49.0 ( limit ) <p> 400m free : 4:06.28 ; ; <p> 100m breast : 1:10.11 ; 1:05.4 ; 1:02.7 <p> 100m ' fly : 59.26 ; 55.2 ; 53.0 <p> 200m back : 2:11.77 ; 2:02.8 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Men : <p> 100m free : 49.44 ; 46.6 ; 45.1 <p> 200m free : 1:46.16 ; 1:42.9 ; 1:39.5 <p> 400m free : 3:50.49 ; ; <p> 100 breast : 1:02.86 ; 59.3 ; 57.3 <p> 100 ' fly : 54.15 ; 51.1 ; 49.4 <p> 100m back : 55.49 ; 52.3 ; 50.6 <p> 200m IM : 2:03.24 ; 1:56.3 ; 1:52.4 <p> 400m IM : 4:20.05 ; 4:05.2 ; <p> Ian Crocker by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The 2000 prediction left the likes of Ian Thorpe and Michael Phelps close , while Roman Sludnov 's historic dip below the minute on breaststroke looks impressive , as does Ian Crocker 's ' fly storm . As you might expect , given the building blocks of the predictions oral turinabol , that sort of thing , the women do n't get quite so close . Lethal Leisel Jones gets closest : she would have got to the 2000 time six years too late . <p> Here 's a list of what happened in terms of pure numbers of GDR women left in the all-time top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 2008 , including one solitary year , that of 2007 , as a marker of where we 'd got to before the advent of shiny suits . <p> 1992 : 125 <p> 1996 : 117 <p> 2000 : 88 <p> 2004 : 61 <p> 2007 : 40 <p> 2008 : 21 <p> Between 1992 and 2000 , GDR women still occupied around a fifth of all places in the all-time top 50 best times ever set across all 13 solo Olympic events . By 2004 , they still held on to around a seventh of all places . In 2009 , their presence was reduced to 21 out of 515 places . No GDR men , pre-1990 , remained among the best 50 in any event . <p> Here are some of the most resilient of the GDR standards in terms of the swims still being German ( unified ) records in 2009 : <p> 400m free Anke M ? 4:05.84 ( 1989 ) <p> 800m free Anke M ?

Take a 2:07 200m barrier ripe for knocking over . Wherever Peaty may take that mission of his coach coach Mel Marshall 's to enter the 56 zone , what we are likely to see in terms of progress in the 100m breaststroke is a steady bunching of those still trying to crack 59 -- and all those some way off cracking 58 . <p> The wave watches up in time . How long that timeframe ? Anywhere between a month and a Mary T Meagher is the answer . <p> As the 2017 season gets the next Olympic quad well and truly underway , what are your guesses for where swimming is destined to end us to do so . <h> Daggers deny ten-man 
 It 's all been a bit like a spy story " , Richard McLaren Tells The Globe &amp; Mail <p> Russia got to chink glasses with the IOC once more in Rio - but the IPC locked the nation out of the Paralympics , with CAS backing All images are stills from " Red Herrings " by ARD <p> Editorial <p> The start to a fine feature on Canadian law professor Richard McLaren in The Globe and Mail is telling : what Donald Trump refuses to see in another realm , McLaren has been dealing with for a while now , namely that Russians have sought and are seeking surreptitious ways to lock down the truth and steer the agenda to their favour . Spy story . One the media is well aware of . <p> Be it an election , be it a urine sample passed through a wall , filthy jar for clean one , be it a cell phone of the chief investigator into a doping crisis of systematic proportions , be it the constant attacks that have happened at this website . It may all be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporter Cathal Kelly notes how Prof. McLaren , 71 , turns his phone off as they arrive at a conference room at his London , Ontario offices and tells the G&amp;M : <p> " This is just far too easy to track . In fact , I can track your phone from here . I have that equipment . " <p> Two of the first casualties of the WADA IC report : Lamine Diack , left , and Grigory Rodchenkov , who then turned whistleblower and revealed a depth of deceit . <p> McLaren no longer uses public Wifi and tells us all to " never , ever use your cellphone is at an airport " . He has even shifted his schedule to work in the hours when those trying to hack into his phone and elsewhere are less active . <p> We learn from Kelly that during the doping investigations into Russia , Prof McLaren 's <p> staff were followed <p> computer systems were ' steadily attacked ' <p> his students at Western University of Western Ontario were approached . <p> What Prof McLaren describes is nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pockets . At federation level in sport , the honey trap is among controlling measures when it comes to power in sports politics and not only in Russia . <p> High-ranking officials are among those who have been entertained in the night only to find themselves rubbing shoulders with the pimp when the sun comes up . There are sports officials out there who fell into the trap , welcomed the exploited into their rooms and would no longer dream of criticising the nice folk who made it all possible . A different time of truth is ahead of us yet . <p> Some controlling influence takes place without the need for a masquerade , so willing are some to fall into honey traps . The unwilling must be on their toes , too -- a couple of many tales from the road : <p> I recall a trip to Moscow a few years ago . We , the media , stayed in a well-known hotel . Three reporters , on average three calls through the night during our stay . " Me pretty girl can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby and disturbed our sleep throughout the days we were there . I saw some of the same faces at the swimmers ' hotel , accompanied by men who stepped out of limos in dark suits . <p> I recall a trip to China in which I was collected at the airport and driven around in the back seat of a car I could not get out of without someone on the outside opening the door for me : they 'd removed the door locks on the inside . I recall a hotel room where one whole side of the room was a giant mirror , in all likelihood with a room behind it from which I could be watched . Watched , followed and monitored almost the whole way , the almost for another time . <p> Who knows who these watchers are , who they work for and why . The good guess is likely to be close to the truth ; the purpose is the control and manipulation of events in the interest of self-interest . <p> Whoever the watchers and followers are , suffice it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aim is pretty simple : go to swim meet , cover it for your newspaper or agency , talk to swimmers and coaches about their efforts and lives , watch what the blazers are up to next , pass on the news with views , go home . <h> Spy Story <p> Reporters are not the ony ones doing the watching . In gazing into the world of Prof. McLaren , the Globe and Mail declares that he became " the central figure in a drama straight out of a spy book " . <p> " It 's all been a bit like a spy story , " McLaren tells Kelly . <p> They could have heard the same line from Hajo Seppelt , the main man at the ARD German TV team that blew the lid on the Russian doping crisis before investigators stepped in . They could have heard the same line from many others in the realm of reporters and almost all will have a story or several to tell on the score of being followed , having phones tapped and computers hacked . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stasiland by Anna Funder <p> Stasi ( secret police ) documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped <p> None of which comes as a surprise to anyone who ever took an interest in the events surrounding State Plan 14:25 . Beyond the realm of sport , I recommend Anna Funder 's Stasiland , an excellent and easy read that gets to the heart of fear and loathing and explains a great deal about why nothing that is unfolding in the Russian doping crisis ( or the cheating that goes on elsewhere ) should come as a shock or surprise . This part of human nature has been with us in sport for half a century ( at least ) . <p> No great shakes then to read that among the many names used by the Russian Military and Civilian Intelligence Services ( RIS ) , according to U.S. intelligence files , is " Fancy Bear " , the name the WADA ADAMS system hackers went by when revealing the names and medications of those who sought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mail trawls through the events of the most turbulent two years in the life of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( it is n't over yet ) . McLaren says he thought it was not " going to be too hard " nor would it " take too long " , when he was asked to lead the inquiry . <p> It all proved otherwise . He admits that when he first heard the tales being told by former head of Russia 's anti-doping control lab , Grigory Rodchenkov the hole in the wall at the Moscow lab and so forth -- he told himself " this is just nonsense " . <p> Turns out that it was n't . <p> To this day , McLaren sticks to the letters and numbers , no names , who provided some of the strongest evidence for the inquiry reports that damned Russia 's regime by pointing to state involevment in a massive consiracy to cheat in global sport . <p> Many of the key witnesses to media and WADA-commissioned agents are Russians who want change at home . Identifying them could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We should n't doubt it . <p> There were good reasons for McLaren to run his inquiry not from London , Ontario , but the original one , London , England . He believes that Russian politicians believed they could " tough it through with ' deny , deny , deny ' and that it would go away " . <p> Along the way , McLaren named Russia 's FSB ( Federal Security Service ) as a conspirator . The spy game was bound to get bigger from that moment onwards . <p> It was no coincidence that one of the very first questions from the Russian regime in public was : how many Russians in Russia did you speak too ? <p> The answer was , effectively : who wants to know ? Stretch that to ' why ' ? <p> McLaren was targetted . Schedules , hotels travel plans were changed at the last minute for the whole team . The spy alert button was switched to permanent ' on ' . <p> He talks to Kelly of the four types of witnesses approached in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted everything , questions an answers , in writing ; the Skypers ; and then those who wanted to speak but were frightened off . McLaren tells the Globe and Mail : <p> " It was a cover-up that evolved from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalised and disciplined medal-winning conspiracy . " <p> Did it stretch all the way to Putin , the president who sent a decress to his borders in 2009 calling for all anti-doping samples to be checked before leaving Russia ? McLaren tells Kelly there is ' no evidence " of direct involvement but adds " ... the FSB is the federal security police . They operate centrally . We know they 're involved . Draw your own conclusions . " <p> Putin received FINA 's highest prize from a select group of men at the helm of the us to do so . <h> The next season 
 <p> Little , if anything , has transpired as far as the clock is concerned over the first week or so of the 2017 campaign . But as this new year continues to unfold , the picture of the next Olympic cycle will see its first brush strokes applied to the canvas . <p> While a handful of major figures will see action in Austin , some top-tier performers are immersed in their collegiate seasons , with others simply dedicating themselves to their training , competition on hold until a later date . <h> Josh Prenot At Helm Of Stacked American Arsenal In 200 Breaststroke <p> Arguments can be made for several events as the in the American arsenal , but as the 2017 season shifts into full throttle , it would be difficult to discount the 200 breaststroke as the frontrunner . A look at the final worldwide rankings for 2016 reveals that the United States occupied six of the top 20 positions , with Josh Prenot sitting No. 1 off his 2:07.17 clocking from the Olympic Trials on his way to Olympic silver . <p> The caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has five of the top 20 places and has shown consistent , deep strength from the days of Kosuke Kitajima onwards but in 2016 that did not translate come the hour . Conversion to the podium is what counts . <p> Kevin Cordes , by Peter Bick <p> All six of the American ranked athletes produced performances inside 2:10 , with Prenot and Kevin Cordes ( 2:07.81 ) inside 2:08 , and Will Licon just outside at 2:08.14 . Meanwhile , Andrew Wilson ( 2:09.35 ) , Nic Fink ( 2:09.89 ) and Cody Miller ( 2:09.91 ) were impressive in their own right . What does it mean ? Well , an absolute dogfight is brewing on the way to berths for the summer 's World Championships in Budapest . <p> Unlike the 100 breast , where Peaty has an ironclad grip on the event , the 200 breaststroke is open and intriguing , and the United States has the weaponry to claim gold when the World Champs return to Europe for the third straight time . The runnerup to Kazakhstan 's Dmitriy Balandin in the Olympic final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top performances accompanied by exquisite consistency over the past year . It would n't be shocking if Prenot found a way to become the first sub-2:07 performer . <p> For Cordes , who has followed coach Sergio Lopez from Singapore to Auburn University , the talent to reign atop the world is undeniably evident . The key for Cordes is packaging his best performance on the biggest stage , and under pressurized circumstances . In both breaststroke finals in Rio , Cordes was off his best times . <p> Third at the Olympic Trials , Licon is a fascinating case study . When the University of Texas standout went at Trials , the effort marked a sizable time drop from what Licon had produced heading into Omaha . Maintaining that level of performance is obviously the first part of Licon 's pursuit of a Team USA bid to Budapest . The second part is finding a way to finish ahead of Prenot and Cordes , who have the upper hand until Licon proves otherwise . <p> Another part of the 200 breaststroke equation in the United States can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is far from a mystery . Although just a high school junior , Reece Whitley has continued his evolution into a future force for the United States , and the skill possessed by the 6-foot-8 phenom from the William Penn Charter School in Pennsylvania is off the charts . Whitley owns a career-best of 2:11.30 , but with the way time can come off the clock for teenagers , perhaps Whitley will be a factor sooner than later . <p> Unquestionably , the United States is deep in the 200 breaststroke , with more than a couple of guys capable of representing the Red , White and Blue in international action . Who is going to handle that duty ? Well , that answer is not so easy to determine . <h> Can U.S. Women Maintain Sprint Surge ? <p> Simone Manuel by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> There were a handful of reasons for the United States to celebrate sprint growth during 2016 , Simone Manuel the primary factor . With her shared gold medal in the 100 freestyle with Canadian teenager Penny Oleksiak and her silver medal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American sprinting , and provided considerable hope that Team USA will have a steady presence in the years to come . <p> Meanwhile , the U.S. featured three women ranked in the top-10 in the world in the 50 free , Manuel ( fourth ) joined by Abbey Weitzeil ( ninth ) and Madison Kennedy ( 10th ) . That status was a big improvement over the previous three years , in which the United States had one top-10 performer in 2014 and 2015 , and none in 2013 . <p> The question now is whether the United States can keep its momentum and generate additional speed in the 100 freestyle , which would help close the gap on Australia in the 400 freestyle relay . Manuel and Weitzeil look like sure bets , and Katie Ledecky with her extraordinary range is a terrific card to have in the back pocket . But there 's always room for more , and a return to form by Missy Franklin would be welcome , along with growth from Kelsi Worrell , whose freestyle efforts have been catching up with what she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Rio , much may depend not only on strengths but momentary weaknesses come the hour . <p> An out-of-the-woodwork contributor , too , would be appreciated by a nation whose only non-gold in relay action in Rio was in the 400 freestyle . If that newcomer is n't located in the next 12 months , though , it 's far from a disaster . As 2016 showed , the United States is moving forward in the sprints , and the key for 2017 is keeping the momentum alive . <h> Filling The Void In The 200 Medley <p> Michael Andrew gives thanks by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The retirement of Michael Phelps and suspension of Ryan Lochte leave the United States as vulnerable as it has been in more than a decade in the 200 individual medley . Simultaneously , the absence of those legends opens the door for new blood in the event , and challenges those heirs to keep the American tradition of excellence alive . <p> Already proven as one of the world 's best in the 400 individual medley , thanks to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Champs , Chase Kalisz figures to be one of the leading candidates to step forward , perhaps the leading contender . Meanwhile , Conor Dwyer has long found himself overshadowed by Phelps and Lochte , but he owns a personal best of 1:57.41 , and if he chooses to put focus on the shorter medley , he could be a global factor . <p> The names of Josh Prenot and Gunnar Bentz can also be tossed into the discussion , as can that of Michael Andrew , the 17-year-old rising star who won gold in the 100 medley at last month 's World Short Course Champs . Andrew is probably the most interesting name here , as he is stellar in each of the four strokes . Yet , he has much to prove in a 200m us to do so . 
 <p> The landscape of speed for the 2017 season is just now taking shape , much more obviously to come in this first year of a new quadrennial . As that form is molded , the second day of action at the USA Swimming Pro Series stop in Austin surely did its part . Specifically , the United States ' Jacob Pebley and Japan 's Daiya Seto came through with impressive early markers . <p> A finalist at the Olympic Games in Rio in the 200 backstroke , Pebley proved last summer that his career is on an upward swing . Not only did he nail down a berth on the Team USA roster at the Olympic Trials , Pebley was solid in Rio , finishing fifth in a race won by his training partner , Ryan Murphy . Now , his 2017 campaign is off to a quick start . <p> In command from the start , Pebley won the 200 back in 1:55.95 on Saturday night , an effort that got him to the wall more than four seconds quicker than his foes . More , the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his fastest time of the Olympics . That sub-1:55 outing was produced during the semifinals . <p> While Pebley dominated in the 200 back , Seto was too much to handle in his prime event , the 400 individual medley . The Olympic bronze medalist and two-time defending world champion prevailed by more than seven seconds , his time of well ahead of the 4:21.07 by Anton Ipsen . Seto 's year will include pursuit of a third straight world title and rematches with countryman Kosuke Hagino and American Chase Kalisz , the gold and silver medalists from the Olympics . <p> In the middle of a resurgence led by youth , Canada watched 17-year-old Mary-Sophie Harvey come away with a victory in the 400 individual medley , as her mark of 4:37.89 led a sweep of the podium for her country . Harvey was followed by Erika Seltenreich-Hodgson ( 4:39.51 ) and Sydney Pickrem ( 4:44.40 ) . <p> Canada maintained its momentum going later in the session as Hilary Caldwell ( 200 backstroke ) and Michelle Williams ( 50 freestyle ) also stood on the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2:09.76 to fend off 16-year-old American Eva Merrell ( 2:10.22 ) while Williams covered her lap of freestyle in 25.16 . <p> Other wins were captured by Melanie Margalis ( 1:58.78 ) and Marcos Lavado ( 1:48.90 ) in the 200 freestyle and Japan 's ( 22.44 us to do so . 
 <p> Day 2 of the Euro Meet in Luxembourg dawns . Action is underway in Luxembourg on a day that brings us our first 2017 glimpse of Olympic 100m breaststroke champion , Adam Peaty , of Britain , and Germany 's world long and short-course 200m champion Marco Koch . But not together -- just yet . Peaty has ambitions in the 200m but today it is just the 50m . <p> And for starters : 27.02 , a meet record for Peaty in heats . The standard had stood at 27.61 to Ireland 's Alex Murphy since last year . It may well be a second and more faster by close of play today . There was also a meet mark in the men 's 100m backstroke , Apostolos Christou , of Greece , on 54.19 , ahead of the 54.70 clocked by Ireland 's Shane Ryan a year ago . <p> Sarah Sjostrom , of Sweden , swam through to two finals at the helm , first on 1:01.24 in the 100m backstroke and then with a dominant meet-record 24.44 in the 50m freestyle as the only heats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoal of national team members from around Europe , squads from Britain , France , Germany , Denmark and Hungary in the mix . Summaries of the lead pace in heats can be found at the foot of this file . <p> You can watch all the action here on the Euro Meet Live Stream , including medal ceremonies for junior events from morning .

 <p> Olympic champions Adam Peaty , of Britain , and Sarah Sjostrom , of Sweden , got their 2017 race seasons underway in dashing style today at the Euro Meet in Luxembourg , the butterfly ace in sizzling form on freestyle , too , her 25.02 ' fly dash followed by a 24.01 50m free , that pace swifter than it took to win Olympic gold in 2016 . <p> for him it was a 27.11 victory in the breaststroke dash , the time the second-fastest January swim in history ( the swiftest was the 27.02 that the world-record-holder and champion clocked this morning ; <p> for her it was a 25.02 similarly dominant victory in the 50m butterfly for her second meet mark of the day and an all-time performances list that now has Sarah Sjostrom as the only name in the top 10 ranking . <p> And for her ... at the close of the session : a shattered 50m freestyle meet record : 24.01 faster than the time it took Denmark 's Pernille Blume to win Olympic gold in Rio . And then a 28.66 win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphs on the day . <p> Peaty 's win was the second of three for Britain in the first six finals , Loughborough teammate Sarah Vasey taking the 50m breaststroke at the start of the session , and Duncan Scott leading four Britain teammates home in the first five slots in the men 's 200m freestyle . <p> Molly Renshaw kept the ball rolling for Britain later in the session . Loughborough 's world short-course champion was a class apart in the 200m breaststroke , turning in 33.12 and 1:10.75 and 1:47.40 on her way to a smooth 2:25.32 meet record . And in the dash finals , Plymouth Leander 's Ben Proud matched Sjostrom 's double , on ' fly and freestyle , with efforts of 23.35 and 22.01 . <p> Adam Peaty by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Talking poolside to former French international Georges Kiehl , Peaty said that he had taken a two-month break after his stunning efforts in Rio , including Olympic gold in the 100m breaststroke and a 56 split in the medley relay to help Britain take silver . Since returning to training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the defence of his 50 and 100m world titles come July in Budapest . <p> Sjostrom 's butterfly blast shuffled the history book : she now has the best 10 efforts , all suits , in the 50m butterfly , her 25.02 today the 7th best of her career and a list topped by that stunning 24.43 world record from 2014 . No-one else has ever swum faster that Sjostrom shifted today . <p> On freestyle , her 24.01 marked the second best of her career after a 23.98 from 2014 at Swedish nationals . swimming fast in-season is nothing new . Even so , only she , and the top 2 , Cate Campbell and the retired Fran Halsall , have ever swum faster over 50m free in textile than Sjostrom 's effort today . <p> Ten years after her first races at the Euro Meet -- and having take a post-Rio break beyond an historic gold in the 100m butterfly that made her Sweden 's first Olympic swimming champion in the pool among women , she told Kiehl : <p> " That was surprisingly fast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast today . " <h> Women 's 50m breaststroke <p> Peaty 's final was second up today , the first having gone to former clubmate at Derby and in the same Loughborough squad with coach Mel Marshall , Sarah Vasey , who matched precisely her morning 30.93 in the breaststroke dash . Martina Carraro , of Italy , was sceond home , in 31.09 , third place to Jenna Laukkanen , of Finalnd , in 31.28 , with Siobhan-Marie O'Connor fourth ahead of taking time out to watch Katinka Hosszu in the 200m medley five month after rattling the Hungarian as they took gold and silver at the Olympic Games in Rio . <p> Adam Peaty by LaPresse for arena <h> Men 's 50m breaststroke <p> Peaty 's 27.02 and 27.11 represented the swiftest January swims in history over one lap breaststroke .

Next home was Scotland and Britain teammate Stephen Milne , on 1:48.66 , with England 's Nick Grainger and Max Litchfield , on 1:48.68 and 1:49.88 respectively . Matching Germany 's Poul Zellmann in firth on 1:50.97 was a third Scot , Dan Wallace . <p> Asked by Kiehl about the Brit power play , Scott paid plaudits to the drawn of world champion James Guy and noted the world relay title in 2015 and the Olympic silver medal last year .

 <p> Hungarian Olympic medallist Tamas Kenderesi reminded challengers of his new status at the Nice round of the Golden Tour in France today with a 1:55.20 victory in the 200m butterfly . <p> , who claimed bronze behind Michael Phelps ( USA ) and Masato Sakai ( JPN ) -- split 1:53.36 to 1:53.40 , in 1:53.62 in Rio last August , was gone form go on his way to even lap splits beyond an opening 26.48 of 29.38 ( 55.86 ) , 29.83 and 29.51 ( 59.34 ) .

One of his main rivals this summer will be the 2012 Olympic champion Chad Le Clos , the South African locked out of the medals in Rio in fourth place . <p> If he produced the swim of the day , national teammate Katinka Hosszu made the loudest noise among women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice , in the 200m freestyle , 1:56.81 to 1:56.98 .

 <h> Parallel Lanes : Swimming Pace In The First Five Weeks of 1998 , 2009 and 2017 <p> The first five weeks of racing this year have been fairly fast compared to bygone seasons , courtesy in large part to the speed of Japan 's best at the Kosuke Kitajima Cup in Tokyo , as well as swimmers at the Euro Meet , the US Pro Swim series and the likes of the Golden Tour in France and other such warm-up meets . <p> As part of our concluding week in the series measuring the impact of shiny suits and their continuing grip on the all-time rankings , today we take a snapshot of the pace of in-season racing , 2017 , 2009 , 1998 . One of the effects of the shiny suits was to make exceptional swimming look ordinary as the sport got all too used to gorging on . The suits also masked genuine progress on the clock and therefore in preparation , technique and those other factors that contribute to outstanding performance among those working clean . <p> Consider the quality of efforts so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watanabe is not to be topped , the Japanese teenager 's world record of 2:06.67 over 200m breaststroke the obvious performance of the year but his pace is backed up by the following picture : <p> In 11 out of the 13 solo Olympic events for women , the world No 1 and the world top 10 range is faster in the first 5 weeks of this year than it was in the same period of 2009 at the height of shiny suit pressure and for the most part considerably faster than it was in January 1998 after the World Championships of that month . <p> At 24.01 , Sarah Sjostrom 's lead pace in the 50m freestyle is as fast as Le Jingyi 's world record at the height of the China doping crisis . The difference in the technique of the two women is monumental , the smoothness of the Swedish sprinter contrasting starkly with Le 's brute-force of a windmill on a stormy day <p> At 53.21 , Sjostrom 's lead pace over 100m freestyle is a half second up on Inge de Bruin 's Olympic title-winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Japanese 200m free record is is faster than Franziska Van Almsick 's last world record from her 13-year reign on the clock and swifter than Federica Pellegrini 's first world mark <p> At 59.60 , Kylie Masse 's early world ranks topper in the 100m back is just 0.02sec shy of the world record set by Natalie Coughlin when she became the first woman to break the minute back in 2002 . <p> At 56.89 , Ikee 's Japanese record in the 100m ' fly is .2sec shy of the time warper of a 56.69 world mark set by De Bruijn at the start of a season of conversion from a status of " among challengers " to the dead cert of a 56.61 world-record and victory at Sydney 2000 <p> At , Ikee 's 200m medley at the Kitajima Cup is a touch outside the controversial 2:09.72 of Wu , of China 2sec of then then world mark in 1997 , on her way to a positive steroid test the season after . <p> There is a distinct difference between the comparative seasonal strengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events are sifter at the start of this year than they were in 2009 and 1998 , less than half of men 's events 6 out of 13 are faster at the start of 2017 than they were in at least one of the other seasons noted . <p> Men did not wear a top to their suits and that makes a big difference , very much so in shiny apparel and likely to be the case even in textile only . Suits , however , are not the only factor , the catapult in standards best observed in men 's breaststroke . If Watanabe 's world mark and Adam Peaty 's 100m opener of 58.94 at the height of preparations for the summer world titles are obvious indicators of the pace at the very point of the pointy end of business , then the top 10 range also reflects distinct progress that is likely , on that most troublesome and awkward of strokes , to come down to the way the blokes are moving through the water . <p> Ippei Watanabe at Rio 2016 -- by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the events swifter this year than in 2009 and 1998 : <p> At 53.31 , the 2012 Olympic champion Matt Grevers ( USA ) is swifter than the first of Aaron Peirsol 's six world records over 100m backstroke ( 3 textile , 3 not ) <p> At 58.94 , Peaty 's punch for Britain at the Euro Meet is a whisper away from the pace of Kosuke Kitajima when he set the first shiny suits world mark over 100m breaststroke and 0.2 away from Alex Dale Oen 's dominant 2011 world-title win <p> At 2:06.67 , Watanabe becomes the latest Japanese world-record holder . he is swimming around 1sec a lap faster than Mike Barrowman did in 1992 and about faster per lap than Kitajima did when he became the first man to crack 2:10 back in 2002 . <p> At 1:55.20 over 200m ' fly , Tamas Kenderesi ( HUN ) is a fingertip shy of the last world-record pace of Tom Malchow in 2000 and the first global-standard pace of Michael Phelps in 2001 . <p> And it is largely down to the pioneering multi-stroke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a key factor , that we find the medley events among those that have moved on significantly in the past four Olympic cycles : <p> At 1:58.40 in the 200m medley , Daiya Seto is racing a whisker away from Jani 's then timewarp pace of 1:58.16 in 1994 , the wait ended when Phelps arrived to tear up the script , taking the lead pace down to the 1:54s , Lochte 's world mark a 1:54 flat . <p> Japan features , as if often has , large on the canvas of in-season speed . Come the hour , a few convert to the podium . Come Tokyo 2020 , the Olympic hosts will be looking to raise that conversion rate . <h> Top pace and range , 2017 ; 2009 ; 1998 <p> The range in the first 5 weeks of 2017 , in the same period in 2009 and the 1998 season in which the World Championships was held in the first month of the year and provides a snapshot of how fast swimming was 20 years ago and how that speed is now replicated in-season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 free/100 , 200 back , breast and fly and 200 and 400IM ; men 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , 1500 free/100 , 200 back , breast and fly and 200 and 400IM us to do so . 
 <p> It helps somewhat to have the Olympic 100 , 200 , 400 and 800m freestyle champions on your side and even more so when Simone Manuel ( 100m title shared with Canadian Penny Oleksiak in Rio ) and Katie Ledecky ( 200 , 400 , 800 and 4x200m gold , the 400 and 800m in world-record times in Rio ) are in form ) but then the Pac-12 Championships victory for the Stanford Cardinal was a dominant of an affair . <p> Coach Greg Meehan 's squad took the trophy with 1587.5 points to Cal 's , USC third with 1250.5 , Arizona fourth on 1087.5 , UCLA on 1002 , that a result in which diving made a significant contribution in a quirk of college sport in the U.S. <p> Ledecky played a part own four American records : the 500y free , the 400y IM and the 4 ? 100 and free relays ( littlest of pools , smaller occasion but four more golden moments in the bag ) , and was named Pac-12 swimmer of the meet without having raced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimming that , while evoking memories of anti-competitive school galas of yore ' oh , no , we ca n't have that ; far too good a swimmer only 3 solo events allowed ...

Kraemer <p> Ledecky was pipped in the free , the winner Stanford teammate Manuel , who claimed victories in the 50 , 100 and 200 free , the 100 swum in 46.36 , compared to her American and NCAA record of 46.09 . <p> That race produced another 1-2 for Stanford , Lia Neal on 46.97 , next home two internationals for their respective countries , Cal 's Farida Osman ( EGY ) and USC 's Louise Hansson ( SWE ) , matched on 47.36 . <p> No matter that Ledecky was not up for the 1650 : she cheered on other Stanford teammates , Megan Byrnes claiming the win in ahead of training partner Leah Stevens , on 15:57.87 , another 1-2 for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona , on 15:59.47 . <p> Other winners included Cal 's Kathleen Baker , on 1:48.33 in the 200 back ; USC 's Riley Scott , on 2:06.20 just ahead of Arizona State 's 100y winner Silja , on 2:06.41 ; and Stanford 's Ella Eastin , on 1:51.85 in the 200y ' fly ; <p> In the 4 ? 100 free , Stanford put the cherry on the cake with an American record , courtesy of Simone Manuel ( 46.47 ) , Katie Ledecky ( 48.10 ) , Janet Hu ( 47.49 ) and Lia Neal ( 46.45 ) for a 3:08.51 , 0.3sec inside the standard set in 2015 by a different Cardinal quartet , Manual and Neal in the mix that time too . <p> The relays in college racing are often stacked with quality and those who represent their countries in global waters .

 <p> Nathan Adrian ( USA ) powering his way back to the Olympic podium in 2016 - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> American sprint ace Nathan Adrian and Chinese teenager Li Zhuhao sped to the helm of the early 2017 world rankings on the first of three days of racing at the Arena Pro Swim Grand Prix in Indianapolis . <p> Adrian 's 48.66 in the 100m freestyle matched the pace of Japan 's Shinri Shioura at the Kitajima Cup last month , while Li 's 51.34 marked the first sub 52 in the world this year and was not far shy of his 51.24 best from Olympic season for a boy who does not leasve his teenage years behind until a year out from the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games . Adrian and Shioura soon found themselves joint No2 on the rankings : Cameron McEvoy clocked 48.12 in heats at NSW titles in Sydney . <p> Adrian , the London 2012 Olympic champion who claimed silver behing Australian teen Kyle Chalmers in Rio last year , was followed home by a fellow finalist in Brazil , Britain 's Duncan Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49.60 for third . Scott waves goodbye to his teens in May this year . <p> It being that time of year , there were a shoal of faster perfotmances than the follow-up swimmers could muster in finals , while some only got warmed up in B finals . In the 100m freestyle , Brazil 's Bruno Fratus went 49.75 in prelims , while worlds medallist of 2015 Federico clocked 49.43 at the helm of the B line-up ahead of Brazil 's Marcelo Chierighini and Russia 's Vladimir Morozov , matched on 49.56 . The final proper featured a 49.76 from American backstroke ace Jacob Pebley , while Egypt 's Ali Khalafalla clocked 49.68 in heats before slipping back just the wrong side of 50 in the final . <p> Li 's 51.34 on ' fly dominated his two-lap final , Japan 's Daiya Seto next home in 52.43 , the best of the rest barely inside 54 , American Michael Andrew third in 53.95 . <p> Chloe Sutton by Ian MacNicol <p> Zipping up to second in the world so far this year , Chloe Tutton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory and chasers .

There was a 2:27.57 from Iceland 's Hilde Luthersdottir and 2:27.64 from Miranda Tucker , while fellow American Breeja Larson clocked a in heats . <p> Olympic silver medallist Josh Prenot owned the 200m , dipping below 2:10 for a 2:09.93 victory ahead of Nick Fink 's 2:10.62 , Cody Miller , Olympic bronze in the 100m in Rio , completing the American sweep on 2:11.94 and their national teammate Kevin Cordes home in 2:12.11 to block out the best of the overseas challengers on the day , Ross Murdoch , of Britain , on 2:13.08 . <p> The session came to a close with 400m freestyle finals that produced two more wins for the home crew , Hali Flickinger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rio , Jazz Carlin , mentor to a Britain development team on tour in the United States , and a 4:12.85 from Ashley Twichell . <p> The men 's race went to Zane Grothe , who stuck to Britain 's James Guy for 300m before edging ahead in the sprint for home , victory his in 3:48.14 to Guy 's 3:48.52 , Britain Max Litchfield , on for third . <p> In the midst of many an challenge at the meet , there was a 49.83 from Chinese backstroker Xu Xiayu in the 100m freestyle and a 2:28.65 in the 200m breaststroke from Ye Shiwen , the double medley Olympic champion of 2012 and 16 who has struggled to get anywhere remotely close us to do so . 
 <p> It was mostly dash day in Marseilles and after Britain 's Davies on backstroke there was a gap of almost a second , French challenger Mathilde Cini and a 28.80 good for second , with Ukraine 's Daryna Zevina , the 200m ace also at Energy , on 28.94 . <p> Japan 's Rikako Ikee graced the waters of Marseilles too : one of the international pace-setters in early racing this year , with three Japanese records under her belt already , the 16-year-old took the 50m butterfly in 26.09 just ahead of M ? lanie , for France and Marseille , on 26.12 . Italy 's Silvia di Pietro took third in 26.28 , with 14-year-old Ouchi , of Japan , on 26.78 , 0.04sec ahead of Rachael Kelly , of Britain and Energy . <p> The highlights of the day among men were to be found in the two distance events , David Verraszto , of Hungary , produced a dominant 4:10.01 in the 400m medley ahead of teammate Gyurta , on 4:13.36 , with Richard Nagy of Slovakia on . <p> Daniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Commonwealth bronze medallist in 2014 <p> A in the 1500m from Britain 's Daniel Jervis , the Welshman who made the podium at Glasgow 2014 , kept at bay France 's Joris Bouchaut , , and Albert , , his Spain teammate Antonio Arroyo home in . <p> World champion Camille Lacourt , of France and Marseille , kept the home fires burning in 25.39 at the helm of the 50m backstroke ahead of Germany 's Christian Diener , 25.72 , and the winner 's teammate Ben Stasiulis , on 25.75 , Spanish teenager Hugo Gonzalez on 25.86 . <p> The breaststroke dashes went to Italy : Martina Carraro clocked 31.18 ahead of a 31.42 from Fanny Lecluyse , of Belgium , and the winner 's teammate Arianna Castiglioni , on 31.55 ; and Andrea Toniato clocked 28.12 ahead of Spain 's Bruno , 28.28 , and Tunisia 's Wassim Elloumi , 28.32 . <p> The tail end of the session featured the women 's distance events , European champion and Olympic bronze medallist Boglarka Kapas , of Hungary , at the helm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and Olympic and World medallist over the distance , Mireia Belmonte , the Olympic 200m butterfly champion from Spain , on .

 <h> Adam Peaty : 59.99 , 58.86 , Beyond A Cody , A Kevin , A Nic , A Fink &amp; A Funk In Indy Pace Test <p> Adam Peaty is ahead of the game . Throw at him a Cody , a Kevin , a Nic , a Fink or a Funk , the fact is that he 's doing something different , has reached a higher plain of excellence . He 's driving , flowing , digging and holding form better than the rest . <p> In the curtain-closing session at the Arena Pro Swim meet in Indianapolis , Great Britain 's Olympic and World champion , who scorched a 57.13 global standard for gold in Rio , told challengers where they 'd find him in the final when he set down a 59.99 in heats of the 100m breaststroke . <p> That prelims effort turned out to be swift enough to have won the showdown but then Peaty is not only racing to see if he can get his fingertips to the wall first ; he 's out to beat the clock . <p> At 58.86 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City of Derby and nestled into the Loughborough centre of excellence with long-time mentor and the program 's new head coach Mel Marshall , was in a world of his own . <p> Consider the drop : Peaty was 0.01sec inside the minute in heats and then in the final 0.01sec inside the time that granted Cody Miller , of the USA , bronze at the Olympic Games last year . Miller came home second in Indy , on 1:00.30 , about the same away from best as Peaty , with Italy 's Nicolo ' on 1:00.33 and American Kevin Cordes 0.01sec further away . <p> Adam Peaty celebrates gold in a world record of 57.13 at Rio 2016- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Only South African Cameron Van De Burgh 's 58.69 for Olympic silver four years after the crown was his at London 2012 in 58.46 would have beaten Peaty and his Indy effort , the 13th best of his career and 21st best all-time , in textile , Van der Burgh , Dale Oen , Alex Dale Oen ( NOR ) , and Christian Sprenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> More than 2sec back from Peaty in Indy were Richard Fink , USA , and Felipe Lima , BRA , on 1:01.00 apiece , Richard Funk , of Canada , on 1:01.14 , the final closed at 1:01.63 by Miguel De Lara Ojeda , of Mexico , the big wave ahead of him . <p> Out in 27.25 , Peaty was half a second clear of Martinenghi and clear of Miller . The Brit bounced back faster than anyone in the race , too , on 31.61 , no other inside 32 , Miller the swiftest of them at 32.01 . <p> That there and back pacing has been a key focus of Marshall 's work with Peaty and will be so if and when he turns his keenest eye to the four-lap challenge .

 <p> The story of Sylvia floods back to us as the World Anti-Doping Agency conducts studies that could lead to caffeine returning to the list of banned substances for the first time since 2003 . <p> 's tale was one from the book of great sporting ironies in a history in which not a single East German swimmer ever tested positive . At least not beyond internal checks that had them testing positive on a regular basis before the IOC-accredited laboratory at Kreischa in Saxony would let the masters of systematic doping State Plan 14:25 know . Those positive tests never made it to the outside world until after the fall of the Berlin Wall . <p> was sixteen years old when she raced at the Rome 1983 European Championships and claimed silver in the 100 and 200m breaststroke behind Ute Geweniger . By then , had been on the list of those targetted for performance through steroids for three years . <p> By the time a peaceful revolution heralded the end of the GDR as the border opened in late 1989 , 's haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1986 100m breaststroke title and the 4x100m medley crown with teammates Kristin Otto , Kathrin Zimmermann and Kornelia Gressler , and a gold ( 100m breaststroke , 1985 ) , two silver and a bronze at the Eurppean long-course Championships . <p> Sylvia Gerasch -- NT archive <p> She raced on . Representing Germany she would win three gold , two silver and a bronze at the l/c European Championships , her career extending to 2000 and a sole appearence at the Olympic Games , her eight place in Sydney in the 100m breaststroke coming 14 years after she claimed a world title in a world-record time for East Germany and beyond a doping ban that became that entry in the book of ironies . <p> Never officially positive , along with all her teammates in GDR days , Gerasch was selected to race in the European sprint championships at Gateshead in England . <p> It was November 1993 . In their , organisers had placed an temptation irresistable to coaches and swimmers alike : coffee machines . <p> took a swig too many before racing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 m medley and bronze in the 100m medley . It had been a fine year , what with gold in the 100m breaststroke ad the 4x100m medley for Germany back in the summer at the European long-course championships in Sheffield . <p> Her second visit to Britain that year would not turn out so well , though the record shows that she kept all her prizes . <p> The news filtered through with a waft of beans and laughing gas . , doped in the days of the GDR by her coach Dieter Lindemann , according to her and several other swimmers , had tested positive for caffeine : 16 mg of caffeine , equivalent to six cups of coffee , showed up in her blood compared to the permitted limit of 12 mg . <p> , who recalled from her first career being given pink ( not the standard blue ) pills by Lindemann ( she said she did not take them and that some swimmers popped their pills into the aquarium and watched the female ones change colour ) , was suspended in January 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents emerged in the 1990s naming scores of Olympic champions and world record holders had been doped <p> Worth noting at this stage that the DSV , the German Swimming Association , adopted all of the GDR national records as their own and kept them in place despite overwhelming evidence of doping during the trials of 1999 and 2000 that led to criminal convictions being served on the likes of Dr Lothar Kipke , FINA medical commission agent and a silver pin honouree to this day , and penalties , too , for the likes of Lindermann and other coaches . <p> In the wake of Gerasch 's test , that same DSV shortened the suspensions it handed down for certain categories of offences spotted at national competitions . In November 1995 , the compulsory ban for caffeine was reduced from two years to three months , and then in late 2003 was removed altogether from the list of banned substances . <p> However , WADA added caffeine to its Monitoring Program for 2017 to grant scientists leave to study whether the word from the training halls , tracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caffeine being used with the " intent of enhancing performance " ? <p> Swimmers are among athletes known to include supplements containing caffeine in their diets . A caffeine-based supplement was at the heart of the anti-doping cases of Cesar , the 2008 Olympic 50m freestyle champion from Brazil , and three teammates , Henrique , Nicholas Santos* and Vinicius , in 2011 . A banned substance was found in the tests of all four swimmers , Cielo and two others let off with a warning on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport after FINA imposed suspensions . <p> Judges accepted the argument that Furosemide , not listed in the supplement they were taking , could have been introduced by cross-contamination at the source laboratory . Waked received a suspension because the case marked his second offence . <p> WADA 's study will be conducted until September .

 <p> Chad le Clos is working on surfacing once more a winner but he wo n't get the chance to do so at a home Commonwealths , Durban having been stripped os its 2022 hosting rights - by Craig Lord <p> Durban in South Africa has been stripped of its host status for the 2022 Commonwealth Games after it failed to deliver on promises to organisers , including signing contracts on deadline . <p> The news about the Games after next came as Queen Elizabeth launched the baton relay for the 2018 Commonwealth Games on a sunny early spring day in London . The multi-sports event will takes place on Australia 's Gold Coast , where organisers declared themselves Games ready 18 months out in spring Down Under last year . <p> The Commonwealth Games Federation said that Durban had , at last , submitted the information that had been requested on the detail of the event it would have hosted in 2020 but what had been received represented a " significant departure " from its original bid , the PA and Reuters agencies reported . <p> The CGF added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of the final information submitted by South Africa on 30th November , 2016 to determine whether their proposals for hosting the 2022 Commonwealth Games are consistent with their original bid commitments and the host city contract .

Kraemer <p> Le Clos ' previous coach , long-term mentor Graham Hill , followed news that his charge was moving on with a series of videos in which he gives warning to his country that it is not doing the things required to be world-class . <p> Highlighting the perilous state of the financial plan for the 2022 Games , the professor wrote : " Durban is following a global trend whereby marketing the city as a mega event destination has become a prominent neoliberal urban promotion strategy . Some of the perceived advantages of hosting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital and profits which could be used to address basic needs . <p> He added : " Also , the host city or country 's image will be boosted as a global destination for economic investments and tourists by being linked to influential and high-ranking events such as the Olympic Games , the Fifa World Cup or CWG . These international sporting competitions are said to have millions of spectators at the event itself , and also to attract billions of viewers through satellite television transmission . " <p> The gap : support for swimmers from Athens 2004 glory to this day pales to nothing when compared to $10m sweetener in soccer at the heart of the FIFA compost heap <p> He concluded : <p> " South Africa and Durban should not be gambling with the public purse and have not learnt lessons from Fifa 2010 . There were legitimate concerns that the escalation in the costs of the stadiums and infrastructure for Fifa 2010 resulted in the diversion of public funds from more urgent social priorities such as sanitation , housing , healthcare and education .

 <p> Kathleen Ledecky , who brought Stanford 's quartet home with a roar to a record on day 1 of her NCAA Championship debut - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> So it begins . The freestyle . In the book of swimming history there is a list of the first and last yards world records that stood from an age of transition to metric standardisation in global swimming . There 's all sorts of stuff there , including a medley relay from a time before butterfly . No for women , though , the ' fairer sex ' deemed to have been be too gentle to go the distances that men went . <p> They had n't heard of Katie Ledecky and Co , of course . Stanford 's quartet on the opening night of the DI Women 's Swimming and Diving Championships at the IU Natatorium in Indianapolis , Indiana , was tipped to break the American record . No prizes for any of those guesses , after all , the foursome included two women who accounted for all Olympic freestyle gold baring the dash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen Penny Oleksiak in the most bizarre outcome of the Rio Games in the pool ) and Ledecky , champion over 200 , 400 and 1500m and the swimmer of the year who helped deliver gold for the U.S. in the distance proper , the 4x200m free relay . <p> Manuel , up front , and Ledecky , at the back , were joined by Lia Neal and Ella Eastin . They 'd taken the NCAA and American record down to 6:49.42 at the PAC-12 Championship three weeks ago . And there they were in lane 4 to show the rest what happens with a touch of taper in their pioneering : 6:45.91 . Take that all ye who thought yourselves fast . Script . Torn . Up . And burned to ashes as far as previous standards go . <p> At 23.17 over the first 50 , sprinter Manuel pinned her intention to the scoreboard on here way to splits of 48.57 , 1:14.72 and into the wall at 1:41.41 .

 <p> An Independent Testing Authority ( ITA ) has been proposed by the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) as part of a " Strengthening WADA " plan issued in response to the Russian doping crisis and the resulting debate that led to a global athletics ban on one country proven to have operated a doping scheme designed to guarantee medals in international competition . <p> Putin 's regime continues to note ' we have a problem but it was n't us , honest guv ' , despite substantial evidence to the contrary . The IOC , meanwhile , has come up with a set of principles to prop up a new WADA in new clothes . <p> In the wash of words and resolutions centred on the future of the World Anti-Doping Agency and its role policing sport , the International Olympic Committee , which in October 2015 at the Olympic Summit proposed an independent anti-doping testing and sanctioning system and then let just about every woe back into the pool for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games , has come up with a " Strengthening WADA " set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testing Authority ( ITA ) . The new body is called on to " develop with each respective International Federation an International Test Distribution Plan ( ITDP ) not only by sport but by discipline " . <p> That plan must contain " a minimum number of tests for every athlete wanting to participate in the World Championships or in the Olympic Games " . <p> Further , the IOC notes : " This number to be transparent for each athlete in a discipline of a sport . Athletes not having the established minimum testing level not to be eligible for World Championships and Olympic Games . " <p> There are clear conflicts to overcome yet . Such as : <p> While the IOC 's first point is that " The World Anti-Doping Agency must be equally independent from both sports organisations and from national interests " and it later asserts that " WADA to have a neutral President and Vice-President who have no function in any government or governmental organisation or in any sports organisation " , there is also this : <p> " Since the sports organisations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must be represented equally on the WADA Foundation Board and Executive Committee " . <p> 2 . National Anti-doping authorities are supposed to execute international tests at the request of the ITA , while quite clearly that is a part of the current problem in anti-doping , given situations that developed at Rusada , and others and given that those bodies are often under the direct control of politicians and systems with links to doping as well as anti-doping . In some parts of the world , NADO equates to nothing , all tests that do end up being conducted carried out by the likes of IDTM , the Sweden-based testing agency that operates on behalf of FINA , for example . <p> The IOC builds in what it sees as a work-around when it says : " NADOs ' Test Distribution Plans are implemented independently from national interests . " There is no suggestion as to how that will be policed , though WADA 's new investigations team is , we assume , the body for that . <p> 3 . WADA would be the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a supervisory role only " and " have no power to direct or instruct the management of the anti-doping programme " . <p> Further , the ITA , while touted as " independent " would " include representatives from public authorities , the Olympic Movement and WADA as well as elected athlete representatives " . <p> Beyond the potential for continuing conflicts of interests , the IOC 's list makes scant mention of anything that might touch some of the most critical influences on young athletes who find themselves being manipulated and abused , even at the point of competing at an Olympic Games . <p> Qing Wenyi : a national junior champion in October 2015 , cremated 2 days after her sudden death in November images from China TV stills <p> WADA is left with the job of forming legislation . That opens up a world beyond anything on the IOC 's list and raises issues such as : <p> just how much work is being done to make sure a teenage schoolgirl can not enter a toilet right outside a call room with a male member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that result in controversial speed , outcome and gold , remains to be seen ; <p> just how much work is being done to investigate the gamblers who call kids out of call rooms on the cusp of races remains to be seen ; <p> just how much work is being done remains to be seen , too , when it comes to ensuring that it is impossible for a child to die in the night on an official training camp in their country without an autopsy that would be required as a condition of membership of and affiliation with federations in the realm of sport <p> just how much work is being done to nail down two missing ego tests in Russian swimming never reported to WADA remains to be seen ; <p> just how much work is being done to monitor the flow of banned substances from the maker to the medical world , the sick and the supposedly healthy in sport remains to be seen ; <p> just how much work is being done remains to be seen , too , when it comes to talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless trace elements in key substances would not be difficult but someone would have to pay for it <p> and ... just how much back-up from national laws and police authorities can WADA call for given a current situation in which police authorities in some countries have been part of the problem not the solution . <p> All such things and much more are part of the wider , complex world of cheating , manipulating and abusing . Endless testing , as history has proven , wo n't be nearly enough to ensure a cleaner future for sport . <p> The IOC 's principles are not intended to be the bible of all that will be but the list below leaves more questions than it provides answers at this stage . <p> Strengthening WADA the list in full <p> The World Anti-Doping Agency must be equally independent from both sports organisations and from national interests . This is necessary because even the perception of a conflict of interests can be considered damaging to the credibility of the anti-doping system . With regard to national interests , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system from certain National Anti-Doping Organisations ( NADOs ) , from disputes between different NADOs , and from appeals by International Federations ( IF ) against decisions of National Anti-Doping Institutions . <p> Since the sports organisations and the governments are both founding stakeholders on an equal basis , they must be represented equally on the WADA Foundation Board and Executive Committee . The role of athletes on the Foundation Board and Executive Committee must be strengthened . The representation of athletes must be by elected ( not appointed as now ) athlete representatives . The WADA boards should also include independent members . <p> WADA to have a neutral President and Vice-President who have no function in any government or governmental organisation or in any sports organisation . The candidates to be agreed upon by both founding stakeholders , i.e. the governments and the sports organisations , including the elected representatives of athletes . This was already proposed by the Olympic Movement in October 2016 . <p> The role of WADA to be strengthened and clarified to be the sole international body responsible for : <p> Accreditation of anti-doping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the list of prohibited substances and standardisation of anti-doping procedures <p> Compliance monitoring including investigation of all code signatories <p> Anti-doping research <p> Prevention <p> The IOC supports WADA 's intention to have a compliance policy which drives towards Code compliance of all signatories of the World Anti-Doping Code . This would ensure a level playing field for all the athletes of the world . <p> Creation of an Independent Testing Authority <p> An Independent Testing Authority ( ITA ) to be created . <p> The ITA to develop with each respective International Federation an International Test Distribution Plan ( ITDP ) not only by sport but by discipline . This ITDP to contain a minimum number of tests for every athlete wanting to participate in the World Championships or in the Olympic Games . This number to be transparent for each athlete in a discipline of a sport . Athletes not having the established minimum testing level not to be eligible for World Championships and Olympic Games . <p> The NADOs to execute these international tests on request by the ITA . <p> The NADOs to continue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities and WADA to ensure that NADOs ' Test Distribution Plans are implemented independently from national interests . <p> The ITA board to be restricted to a supervisory role only . The ITA board to have no power to direct or instruct the management of the anti-doping programme . <p> The ITA board to include representatives from public authorities , the Olympic Movement and WADA as well as elected athlete representatives . <p> Sanctions <p> Sanctioning with regard to individuals ( athletes , officials , coaches , doctors , etc. ) following a case established by the ITA , or sanctioning of a Code signatory ( sports organisations , event organisers , NADOs and laboratories ) following a declaration of non-compliance by WADA , both to be determined by the independent Court of Arbitration for Sport ( CAS ) , following the democratic principle of the us to do so . 
 <p> Yusra Mardini set for the heats of the 100m freestyle at the Olympic Games in Rio - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Editorial <p> Billy Elliot director Stephen Daldry has turned his spotlight on the epic tale and journey of Yusra Mardini , the Syrian refugee who fled a war zone , was made welcome in Germany , trained in Berlin and made the IOC 's Refugees Team for the Rio 2016 Olympic Games . <p> The 100m freestyle and butterly heats she raced in in Brazil must surely have seemed like a relaxing bath compared to the struggle she and her sister endured in the wash of the Mediterranean when the motor of the boat they and other refugees were in packed up and the vessel was in danger of capsizing . The Mardinis had trained in a local swim club back home and there was nothing for it : they hung on to the side of the boat and kicked their way to shore . <p> Mardini was welcomed by Germany along with many hundreds of thousands of others suffering similar plight . She made her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin . She joined the training group and found herself on the way to the Olympics when the IOC hit upon the idea of a Refugees Team to show solidarity with the plight of those who find themselves homeless in times of crisis . Visa stepped in to sponsor a journey of a different kind . <p> There 's another side to every story and this tale could well extend to the role of politics in sport and the conflict at the heart of the Olympic Movement . <p> On the one hand , we had a refugees team in 2016 and the world celebrated the presence of Mardini and others in Rio . On the other , 2017 brings a FINA World Championships in Budapest this July in a country that has put its refugees behind bars , imposed stringent quotas and caused consternation in other EU countries , Germany at the helm , when it comes to openers and observation of the Geneva Conventions . <p> The IOC , like FINA and other international federations , writes into constitutional rules that the athlete should leave politics at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running FINA and other such organisations never do that themselves . <p> FINA granted Vladimir Putin its highest honour in the midst of the Ukraine crisis and on the cusp of the Russian doping crisis and then , in the context of the latter , refused to listen to warnings and advice from WADA , the media , the World Swimming Coaches Association and its own anti-doping experts , three of whom resigned in protest over the swimming body 's handling of a turmoil that was in part of their own making . <p> Putin , in his capacity as a big player in world politics , has lent weight to the Syrian president Bashar Hafez al-Assad and assaults on that man 's own people , the kind of fighting that resulted in the likes of Yusra Mardini losing her home and a life in her native country . <p> FINA has also granted the same highest honour of the federation to the leadership of Doha in Qatar for a similar overriding reason as that behind the prize for Putin : they lead nations that have hosted FINA world championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and money ) . <p> The trend is a bad one . Turn to Amnesty and other human rights organisations and we find the activities of these FINA prize winners written up in dark and damaging tones , be that in the reports into and stories of refugees having to flee conflict zones or be that the tales of foreign workers who have lost their lives in dubious work conditions on sports venue in Qatar . All a million miles from solidarity with fellow humans on the move , vast numbers through no fault of their own . <p> So , next stop Budapest . Neither FINA nor the Hungarian government nor the organisers of the world championships in July would wish the aquatics showcase to be roped in with global politics . Indeed , they would doubtless reject any talk of such things , sport being sport and politics politics . None of which alters the realities in the mix . <p> 10-year-old of Bahrain gets set to race at the FINA World Championships by invitation in Kazan , Russia , in 2015 -- by Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in 2014 , FINA invited a 10-year-old to its world short-course championships . There was widespread criticism in the swimming community and the media at the time . That centred on the question : why ? And the only answer boiled down to : she had a word with dad , said she 'd like to swim in a world championships , and the organisers in Qatar and at FINA thought : " Great PR , we can show that Arab women do swim " , even though they do n't ( some do swim but not really when it comes to elite sport and just about all but a handful of examples , if that ... Dawn Fraser and her pace of 1956-64 would still be ' pace-setting ' in that part of the world ) . <p> Indeed , you will struggle to find a single world-class swimming program in the Middle East bent on getting a woman to the ultimate podiums in the sport at the age of 16 , 20 , 24 , 30 and so forth . It just is n't done once a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rio and the Refugees Team was there to serve as a form of solidarity with humankind that earned widespread support and was hailed in the Olympic Movement and among blazers far and wide as the way to go . <p> FINA does not include paralympic swimming in its stable of sports but does have a tiny community of high divers given the same status of world champion and access to the same kind of prize money as swimmers with rivalries running deep into the tens and eve hundreds when we measure what constitutes pointy end world-class . <p> No word from FINA yet as to whether it will follow the IOC 's example and invite and others to Budapest for its showcase event in solidarity with refugees . After all , if a 10-year-old from Bahrain with a dream shared by many thousands of young swimmers across the globe can get to race at world titles when thousands of other truly world-class swimmers sit back home and watch it on the telly under the nation rule , then why not . <p> The backdrop to whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sort of headlines and troubling news : <p> Hungary has a right to do what its electorate vote for , of course , just as the likes of human rights organisations and fellow EU nations has a right to condemn the Budapest government for taking the decisions it has . <p> The point in sport , however , is : <p> How does FINA marry this one ? <p> Will it now invite Mardini and other refugees ? If not , why not , given the events of 2014 and 2016 ? <p> Will FINA be granting its highest honour to Hungarian politicians , just as it did for Putin and Qatari leaders ? <p> The answers will tell us much about whether blazers wish to do as they preach to athletes , namely leave politics out of it . If you honour those steeped in the kind of politics that involve some of the biggest global issues of our time and some with their hands dipped in blood , some human watch organisations allege how could that possibly equate to leaving politics out of sport ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damascus in 2015 , survived a perilous crossing of the Mediterranean , was welcomed in Germany with many others fleeing their war-torn country and went on to compete at the Rio Olympics . <p> One of her great quotes is this : <p> " I thought it would be a real shame if I drowned in the sea , because I am a swimmer " <p> Yusra and her sister Sara were both swimmers . They travelled from Syria to Lebanon when the need to escape the risk of death came to call . On to the Turkish port of Izmir , where they climbed into an overcrowded dinghy bound for the Greek island of Lesbos . <p> Less than half an hour into the crossing , the motor stopped . Choppy seas threatened to sink it . There were three swimmers aboard . The Mardini sisters and another passenger , also a woman . <p> Nothing for it : for three hours they kicked and pulled and pushed the boat ashore in the water . <p> Yusra Mardini by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Some time later , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coach at the swimming club in Berlin , welcomed them into his squads and within months Yusra was selected as one of the 43 stateless athletes for Olympic competition . <p> After the 100m butterfly heats in Rio , she said : <p> " Everything was amazing . The only thing I ever wanted was to compete in the Olympics . I had a good feeling in the water . Competing with all these great champions is exciting . I 've only been back swimming for two years so we 're only now getting back to my levels of before . " <p> Martini is now 19 , still swimming but also travelling the world from time to time acting as an ambassador for refugees , meeting President Obama and Pope Francis and delivering speeches to the World Economic Forum in Davos . <p> Now , she will be the focus of a blockbuster . Working Title Films -- makers of Love Actually , the Bridget Jones series and Billy Elliot has acquired the rights to develop and produce Mardini 's life story as a feature film . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human cost of the tragedy and the incredible fortitude , perseverance and hope of one young woman who struggles for a future . Yusra 's dream of living in peace is the story of our time . " <p> The film is set for a 2019 release . Martini told The Guardian this week : <p> " I want to make all the refugees proud of me . It would show that even if we had a tough journey , we can achieve something . " <p> Will she be invited to Budapest ? Will she have something to say about Hungary 's refugee policies ? Will FINA add politicians much criticised to its list of swimming honorees alongside us to do so . 
 <p> Olympic champions and podium places set the pace on the last night at the NCAA DI Women 's Swimming and Diving Championships at the IU Natatorium in Indianapolis , Indiana , Katie Ledecky and Simone Manuel claiming two more wins apiece , apart and then together in the concluding free relay that sealed the meet in emphatic style for Stanford . There were also further wins for USA Olympic teamsters Lilly King and Kathleen Baker . <p> It helps having the winners of the 100 , 200 , 400 and 800m free Olympic titles on your side . This was Stanford 's first win since 1998 . <p> It was n't the 15:03.92 she clocked for the American record last November but in 15:07.70 , Ledecky , world champion and record holder over 1500m , not only claimed the 1650y crown to make it three solo wins as the NCAA drew to a close in Indianapolis but gave a further hit as to the margin by which she would pulverise the world short-course record over 1500m if she were ever tempted to the kind of little pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't been official world record in the 1650y since 1968 , when the standard belonged ( and still does ) to Canadian Angela Coughlan at .

He believed passionately in not only teaching his swimmers about swimming but about life , education and a broad perspective key to the lives of young people beyond their days following the line in the depths between the lane lines . <p> Katie Ledecky ( USA ) Patrick B.

It was 2009 when Elaine Breeden , of Stanford , clocked 1:49.92 in the 200y butterfly . College swimming awaits yet a sub-1:50 swim at the NCAA showdown , the meet mark a 1:50.61 from Louiseville 's Kelsi Worrell last year . <p> This year , triumph belonged to Stanford 's Ella Eastin in 1:51.35 . She trailed Katie McLoughlin at the 150 mark before popping a 28.70 last 50 , California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place in 1:52.37 .

At Pac-12s last month the standard was takend down to 3:08.51 by Manuel , Ledecky , Janet Hu , Lia Neal . <p> Today , the same quartet , racing in the same order , sliced the speed back to 3:07.61 Manuel was out in 46.02 , Ledecky split 47.59 , Hu 47.63 and Neal 46.37 . Georgia took second in , California third in . <p> All of which left Stanford boasting a 526.5 points tally . Mind the gap . California ( 366 ) , Texas A&amp;M ( 292.5 ) , Texas ( 252 ) , NC State ( 194 ) and USC ( 176 ) . <h> Comments <p> March 19 , 2017 <p> While going from the duck pond of short course yards to summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an exact conversion , there 's a lot of positive you can take away for the Americans for later on this year . <p> 1 . Ledecky is still atop her game , though hopefully she learns a bit of a lesson here on early in the race . It seems like she got a little ahead of herself in the 200 and 1650 . <p> 2 . Leah Smith 's excellent 4:28 should not be overlooked amid the usual Ledecky accolades . Given how she 's tracked from spring to summer in the past , if she does n't go a 3:59 low at some point this summer , it will be a disappointment . <p> 3 . Simone Manuel is not a one meet wonder . Would love to see her go against a fully fit C1 this year . <p> 4 . Not sure how Comeford 's 200 will translate into the trials at the big pool , but she is definitely interesting . Like Texas A&amp;M , Louisville often has a knack for finding talent and turning B level juniors into A level seniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter training block this year and will hopefully have continued good results in 2017 . Also good to see Katie McLaughlin starting to return to international elite form after the neck injury . <p> 6 . No matter what you think of her brashness , Lilly King continues to back up words with results . <p> And as someone who enjoys it when the good ones come from unexpected places , love seeing Farida Osman continue to progress and it would be great to see the Egyptian flag go up to the rafters for a us to do so . 
 <p> Team GB swimmers will finalise Olympic preparations in the city of Yokohama after the British Olympic Association ( BOA ) signed training venue contracts with three facilities in Japan to secure Team GB 's multi-sport camp for the Tokyo 2020 Games , British Swimming announced today . <p> The Tokyo Games are scheduled for July 24 to August 9 , 2020 . Says British Swimming : " Based in the Greater Tokyo area in the city of Yokohama , the swimming camp will contribute to the BOA 's biggest ever pre-Games preparation camp and be able to accommodate up to 90% of Team GB selected athletes for the Games . The camp will allow athletes the opportunity to acclimatise and complete their final preparations for Tokyo 2020 just a short journey from the heart of Tokyo in dedicated venues . <p> " We 're really excited about the agreement between the BOA and Yokohama . It 's a great facility and we 're looking forward to working with all involved in helping us with our final preparations ahead of the Tokyo Games . We will be in Japan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again to make sure everything is set for us . Our plan is to go there for a British Swimming holding camp prior to the World Championships in Korea in 2019 which is the perfect practice ahead of the Olympic year . <p> Agre Marks Set As Youth Nationals Start in Wellington <p> As youth nationals got underway in , Gabrielle Fa'amausili clocked 56.21 in the 16-18 years 100m free to crack the New Zealand age record that had been held by Lauren Boyle at 56.54 since 2005 . In other action , Lee took the 17 years 200m butterfly in an age mark of 2:14.39 , inside the 2:15.70 held by Samantha Lee since 2010 . There was also an age mark in the 16 years 50m breaststroke , Ciara Smith matching the standard at 32.33 , while Orlando set an age record of 31.38 in us to do so . 
 <h> John Betrand , Aussie Swim President , Weighs In On Coates : Will He Say The Same Of FINA ? <p> Swimming Australia president John Betrand has hinted at a shift in attitude at the helm of the organisation when it comes to the jobs-for-life culture more than alive and kicking in international sports governance . <p> In the wake of a challenge to John Coates ' 26-year leadership of the Australian Olympic Committee from Hockeyroos Olympic champion Danielle Roche , Betrand writes in The Australian today that neither his nation nor the Olympic Movement should fear change . <p> Coates had done an " outstanding job in the past ' ' , writes Betrand , who captained Australia 's winning America 's Cup campaign many moons ago , but he questioned whether the top man had been in the top seat for too long . <p> Earlier this week , Roche invited Coates to consider a transition period in which she or another successful candidate would work alongside him in readiness for handover in the near future . <p> For Coates , stepping down in Australia would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one job begats another . Coates has held sway since 1990 . Since Rio he has been under pressure at a time of shrinking medals tallies for Australia as a whole at the Olympics , cuts in government funding and controversy over the efficiency and use of performance centres . <p> Roche 's challenge was met with political response familiar to any who observe the world of Olympic and international federation politics and places where athletes are told to leave their politics at home but the politicians rarely do . Coates 's spokesman , Australian Olympic Committee media director Mike Tancred , ? accused Australian Sports Commission chairman John Wylie of orchestrating the Roche challenge . <p> Swimming Australia , in common with all Olympic sports , has two votes in the May 6 ballot that will decide the row , at least until Tokyo 2020 . <p> Bertrand , head of a sport nursing several big bruises from Rio 2016 but able to boast " No2 nation status " nonetheless , writes in The Australian : " Increased success in Tokyo is a challenge for us all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should be seriously considered . <p> " Although the current chairman has done an outstanding job in the past , his current tenure of 26 years -- 30 years , if he is re-elected is a very long time . Long tenures risk an ingrained culture that is less likely to adapt to change and innovation needed to compete with other nations who have adopted best practice . ' ' <p> Bertrand says that best practice in business and sport limits tenure in office for board members to eight years and board chairs to 12 years . <p> Comment : <p> FINA in focus : Julio Maglione , top right , is the latest in a line of federation presidents going back to George Hearn in 1908 <p> ' points are good . They match those made by critics of FINA , the international swimming federation . In July , Octogenarian Uruguayan Julio Maglione , now too old to survive as a member of the IOC , will stand for the presidency of FINA once more after breaking a campaign promise in 2009 that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In moves steeped in politics and a power play driven by Olympic brokers from the Middle East , Maglione campaigned for the FINA constitution altered at his suggestion when he stepped up from hon. treasurer to president in 2009 to be changed once more to allow him to stay for a third term . <p> The ruling FINA Bureau includes hon. members still travelling the globe for the federation who were first in office in 1972 . Mustafa , of Algeria , is a case in point : the president of FINA for 20 years before Maglione 's 2009 challenge , Larfaoui had sat at the top table for 37 years before being replaced . And even then , he remains . <p> Maglione first joined the Bureau at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles . He stepped up to Hon. Treasurer in 1992 and remained there until his 2009 challenge for the presidency . If he is successful in being reelected this summer , he will have been at the top table for 37 years by the time e ; actions come round once more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have Maglione step down mid-term . When the constitution was last changed , a new position was created : First Vice President . It was given to Husain Al Musallam , of Kuwait . <p> By establishing such a role , FINA 's leadership has effectively put into place a Kuwait succession plan with IOC links . first made the FINA Bureau in 1996 . In once sense , he would suit the presidency well : like Algeria and Uruguay , Kuwait has no world-class swimming program capable of competing with the top 40 nations , let alone 20 , in the pool . <p> The wisdom of ignoring some of the biggest stakeholders in swimming will be put to the test if the World Swimming Association , a body established to mount a challenge to FINA authority , takes flight as planned . <p> FINA 's structures , policies , stretching to gender equality issues , and rules on age limits and voting procedures are now even out of date with the IOC , one of the swimming federation 's major sources of funding , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to the world of global water , we can believe that he believes in his own message and the words he pens today in The Australian . <p> If they were for the purposes of local politics and a domestic audience , then we can place his words twixt a Roche and a hard place and know that they are worthless to those who would like to see an end to the woeful state of swimming governance that Betrand and others of his ilk in the United States and elsewhere could influence if they were serious about representing the best interests of athletes ( many an Australian a victim of the malaise down the years ) us to do so . 
 <p> Michael Phelps talks the thrill of the wave with coach Bob Bowman at Melbourne 2007 world titles - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> This week marks the 10th anniversary of what was described as " the greatest performance of all-time " in the pool . <p> Seven golds , four solo world records and a championship record at world titles in Melbourne 2007 . Michael Phelp 's tally was the precursor to the eight golds he would claim at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games the following year , the perfect dress rehearsal denied him by a USA disqualification in the heats of the 4x100m medley . <p> Beijing 's bonanza was the bigger tally and result , the ultimate arena the one that merits the higher plinth in the pantheon , but on some levels Melbourne and a week that witnessed the birth of Dolphin as the Fifth Stroke has the edge : no shiny suits getting in the way , no goggles filling up with water and the first time a man had matched the 1972 tally of Mark Spitz in global competition in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff of chewing the cud in the pub but some things are certain : Phelps ' Melbourne 2007 performance provided a thrilling week-long spectacle , flushed the history book with one of the most outstanding athletic achievements in sport and produced this gem of a reaction from USA head coach Mark Schubert : <p> " There has been nobody that 's been not just as dominant but as versatile . His performance this week was the greatest performance of all-time . I do n't really look at it by medals but by the dominance and by the records and the way he handled it from ever to event to event . I just did n't notice any weak points ... and then ( in the 100 ' fly ) when he goes to touch the wall and his head is clearly behind but he still finds a way to get his hands on the wall . He can do it from behind , he can do it from the front , he can do it when its close , he can do it when its not close . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schubert replied : <p> " It 's very difficult to say but when you shatter the world record in the 200 ' fly like he did and beat the field by 3sec in a world championship , that 's mind-boggling . " <p> The ripple effect was high on Schubert 's radar : " I communicate alot with Bob , just to kind of help me with benchmarks to inspire other coaches and swimmers and he just tells me about some of the things Michael does in training which are phenomenal . Also the way he competes in-season and out of season . " <p> Honing -- Michael Phelps by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> To mark the 10th anniversary of a special week , we dip into the archive and recall a moment when the job was done and media met Phelps and coaches Bob Bowman and Mark Schubert at the end of this result : <h> Mark Schubert : This Was The Greatest Performance Ever <p> Michael Phelps , his long shadow , the torso that twisted history and the folk by his side all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full flow at the mike , hunched forward and flanked by his coach Bob Bowman on one side , US head coach Mark Schubert to the other . <p> Suddenly Phelps interrupts himself -- and the media . His attention is gone , lost in the world he revels in . On the monitor at the back of a press conference room in which just 14 journalists sit to listen to the greatest performer in the pool of all time -- contrast that with the gathering of 250-plus peering in on the troubled world of Ian Thorpe -- former Baltimore training partner and US teammate Katie Hoff is on her way to making history , as he had just done himself , over 400m medley . <p> Phelps 's eyes widen , he turns to raise an eyebrow at Bowman , who smiles back like a father watching the unfolding mirth on the face of a child thrilled by the wonder of his world . " There she goes , it 's gon na be a world record , " says Phelps . Hoff stops the clock at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the past . <p> When Phelps and Bowman leave the room , Schubert notes with a grin : " He knew exactly with 100 to go that she was inside world record ... " . Mind on the matter , hearts beating as one . <p> Was this key to the phenomenal performance of Team USA ? Schubert gave an American answer : " Coming in here we knew that the last time the United States had really lost a major international competition was here in Melbourne in 1956 . " No mention of Fukuoka 2001 and the gold count that counts the most , one that placed Australia ahead . <p> Still , the point was made : it was n't going to happen again here in Melbourne . " All the athletes really feel a strong part of that tradition , " said Schubert . <p> " What I 'm always impressed with is how they help each other from the time they came together on the training camp at Geelong . We saw things like Brendan Hansen giving Tara Kirk breaststroke lessons , sharing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the board . We have tremendous chemisty from kids all over the country who just want to see each other succeed . Its very gratifying . Its one of the best team performances we 've ever seen . " <p> Michael Phelps ended his career on his own terms , on a high and wearing his own brand of kit , MP by Aquasphere -- photo by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> How important was the spirit of helping ? " The spririt of helping is all the difference , " said Schubert . " They really feel part of each others ' success . They are so supportive if someone is disappointed ... they pick each other up . " <p> The critical moment , the watershed , the turning point was Phelps ' drubbing of Thorpe 's 200m free world record , he believed : " Once we got the ball rolling , particularly with Michael 's swim over 200m free : that 's what really lit the fire . " <p> Why , Schubert asked , was the rest of the world simply unable to keep up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think about making sure we 're good , I do n't think about that . " The opposition dodged with a smile , Schubert returned to explaining the positives of US swimming : " We have a tremendous advantage because of the number of people who swim and are involved in swimming . " <p> Then the words that can only serve to demoralise those on a distant shore still further : " We 've felt for a number of years that we 've underachieved compared to the population we have in swimming . Right now we 're trying to focus on utilising our talent . Developing talent like Phelps and Coughlin really helps that , and helps us to continue our tradition . I truly feel we can get better from here . " <p> The low point in US swimming , he thought , had been 1988 after the boycott years had left a gap in the flow of inspiration . The 1976 Olympic men 's team that won every title barring the 200m breaststroke that went to Britain 's David Wilkie , unfolded because " we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning from mistakes has become part of the genetic make-up of Team USA . Take the mistake of Ian Crocker the heats of the medley relay . " You know , its sports , " said Schubert . <p> " They 're still young adults and they are all trying their best and we made a mistake and we are sure not going to blame our guys , and we going to learn from it and were going to move forward and do alot better a year from now . " <p> The torso that twisted swim history Michael Phelps with the man who help him get there , Bob Bowman all images by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Yes , it deprived Phelps of a sure eighth gold medal -- sure because the US heats time was faster than the winning Australian effort in the final but the moment would be lost in time , Schubert predicted . <p> He recalled Bruce Furniss at the 1975 worlds , when in the 800m freestyle relay " he jumped by a mile " . A year later Furniss won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team took gold in the 800m free relay , breaking the world record twice in the process . Then " everybody forgot about it ( 1975 ) ... that 's what its ' going to be like with this , " said Schubert . <p> Did Phelps now rate alongside Mark Spitz ? " Mark Spitz 's performance was tremendous and has inspired the US for many years , and that is kind of been the benchmark but if you look at Michael 's performance from the standpoint of all four strokes , his relay split leading off the 400 free relay , where that would have ranked him in the 100 free , and continue through the 400 IM and the 200 ' fly , and know if he had swim the 400 free that would have been an interesting phenomenon ... " He adds : <p> " There has been nobody that 's been not just as dominant but as versatile . His performance this week was the greatest performance of all-time . " <p> And it included five individual golds . " I do n't really look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the records and the way he handled it from ever to event to event , " said Schubert . " I just did n't notice any weak points ... and then ( in the 100 ' fly ) when he goes to touch the wall and his head is clearly behind but he still finds a way to get his hands on the wall . <p> " He can do it from behind , he can do it from the front , he can do it when its close , he can do it when its not close . " <p> Which was the best of all his efforts ? <p> " It 's very difficult to say but when you shatter the world record in the 200 ' fly like he did and beat the field by 3sec in a world championship , that 's mind-boggling . " <p> Phelps not only inspires his team in competition , Schubert revealed . " I communicate alot with Bob , just to kind of help me with benchmarks to inspire other coaches and swimmers and he just tells me about some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also the way he competes in-season and out of season . " <p> He cites efforts in California and the world 200m ' fly record set at Missouri a month out from Melbourne . " There 's no doubt that when you break a world record a month out when still in hard training , that it was pretty obvious we would be see something special . <p> " We did n't know it would be this special . " <p> Had America been graced with the birth of another Phelps ? " He 's got to be out there . We are going to find him , " said Schubert . There may be some wait but only a fool would doubt the course of history . <h> 2017 and time promises to go by so slowly <p> Schubert may well be right one day . There 's some waiting ahead , Phelps having taken his Olympic tally to 23 gold and 28 medals in all at Rio 2016 before waving goodbye for a second and last time . <p> It was the day after Phelps ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the Golden Rules and episodes that shaped his charge down the years . <p> The grin of a mad scientist at the corner of his mouth , Bowman told me : <p> " At the Melbourne World Cup in 2003 I stepped on his goggles deliberately . He said ' hey , someone stepped on my goggles ' . I said ' Oh ... well , you 're just gon na have to go without them ' . " <p> How useful that proved when water filled Phelps ' vision in the 200m butterfly at Beijing , Cseh chasing . <p> Michael Phelps , 15 , and two blokes who have n't yet realised they 're in the presence of a boy who will become the most decorated Olympian in history <p> In Phelps , Bowman found the raw materials that he had been looking for at the North Baltimore Swim Club . Said the coach : <p> " At 11 , he was so fast , he had to swim with older swimmers ... but by the end of the practice , and at the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap moving up forward to the front of the line with each repeat swim . It was so remarkable , I 'd never seen anything like it and when I went home that night I could n't sleep I was so excited , but of course I did n't tell him that . " <p> Instead , Bowman piled on the metres and challenges . After one particularly bruising practice , Phelps leapt out of the water and started splashing water at some of the girls watching nearby . " I said ' you should be very tired , that 's the hardest practice you 've ever done ' , " Bowman recalled . <p> " I 'll never forget , he looked me straight in the eye and said ' I do n't get tired ' , so I made that my life goal to see if I could accomplish that . " <p> The rest is history , including an amazing week at Melbourne us to do so . 
 <p> Olympic 1500m freestyle champion Gregorio Paltrinieri emerged from a 10km battle at sea in fourth at the LEN European Open Water Swimming Cup in Eliat , Israel , today . He clocked 1 hour 50mins and was just shy of the best pace of open water specialists in his first-ever 10km international battle at sea . In germs of the distance , all in a day 's training for the defence of his world crown over 30 laps in the pool come Budapest in July . <p> On his way there , past Italian trials in Riccione next month , Paltrinieri will take in several more tests , including a possible challenge with Australian rival , friend and occasional training partner Mack Horton at the Sette meet in Rome in June . <p> Today in Eliat , Kristof and Hungarian teammate Katalin Somenek took the men 's and women 's races . <p> The opening leg of the LEN European Open Water Swimming Cup was highlighted by the ' ' of Gregorio Paltrinieri . In fact , the Italian , who clinched the Olympic , world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years , returned to the open water races as he had been a usual participant in this discipline before he turned 17 ( and his attention solely to pool competitions ) . <p> In the men 's race , Russians Kirill Abrosimov and Evgenii completed the podium , while in the women 's event Spela , of Slovenia and Nikolett Szilagyi , also Hungary , collected the minor spoils . <p> For Paltrinieri , open water is not entirely new : in his junior days , he raced at sea and in lake but had never covered a 10km in international waters . Speaking through LEN , he said : <p> " I enjoyed the race after all , managed to keep up with the others for most of the time . In the last lap I felt as if I was losing the necessary energy to go with the leaders and I fell behind . Still , it was a good experience , totally different from pool swimming but I learnt a lot here . " <p> Olympic Champion Gregorio Paltrinieri of Italy tests his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to do so . 
 <p> A deal designed to make a Potsdam swimming centre an official excellence performance unit in Germany has fallen through . The German swimming federation ( DSV ) failed to reach a deal with the Brandenburg swim authorities and others over " personnel decisions " for the centre , the DSV 's choice of 1991 world 1500m freestyle champion-turned coach , J ? rg Hoffmann , rejected by the local powers that be . <p> Sylvia Madeja , the President of the State Swimming Association of Brandenburg , rejected DSV proposals in an official letter cited by the German media . The DSV 's position holds that the Potsdam training centre would only be given official status with Hoffmann at the helm on the deck . <p> The National Swimming Federation Brandenburg , the Olympic Training Centre in Brandenburg and the Ministry of Education , Youth and Sports of Brandenburg welcomed the DSV 's decision to grant Postman centre status . However , it rejected the plan on the basis that all those bodies wanted a say in appointing staff . <p> In a move that will earn the sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany coach Henning Lambertz stated that the coach appointment should belong to the experts employed by the federation , including himself . <p> was given until today to find a compromise with " cooperation partners " but he stated that the " Potsdam swim centre will only be a national centre with J ? rg Hoffmann or not at all . " <p> told the FAZ : <p> " This is not happening to me at the other federal bases in Essen , Heidelberg , Hamburg and Berlin . Everywhere else they were glad that the DSV had found a suitable candidate . Only Brandenburg ... us to do so . 
 <p> So busy was Katie Ledecky in the pool on her way to a Rio 2016 follow-up to the first Olympic title she claimed at London 2012 at 15 years of age that she forgot how to ride a bike . <p> In an interview with The Washington Post today , the first and only other winner of the 200m , 400m and 800m Olympic freestyle titles since fellow American Debbie Meyer in 1968 , recalls a moment after Rio where back home in Bethesda she agreed to go on a bike ride with her brother in the local park only to discover that she was distinctly wobbly on two wheels . As the paper puts it , quoting the swimmer : <p> " Once I got going , it came back , " she said with a laugh . " I would consider myself a pretty good biker now . " <p> Ledecky , off the back of her debut NCAA Championships for Stanford described the experience of college team in glowing terms when in came to the Richter scale of thrills : <p> " In terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world championships and the Olympics . Just the way you 're swimming for your team there 's something different about being a part of a group you spend all this time with , working toward the same goal . You get behind the blocks for your race , knowing you have a chance to help your team . " <p> She 's settled in well at Stanford , telling the Post : " I really did feel like a normal freshman . Of course , there were a few people who 'd come up and want pictures during orientation . But the best part is I was new to campus , too , and wanted to meet as many people as I could . " <p> She later adds : " I love school . I love the environment . I enjoy all my classes and I 've met some amazing people , professors , classmates , roommates , teammates , " she said . " Everything has been great . " <p> The 2016 women 's swimmer of the year , Ledecky gets around campus on ... a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , as it was with Bruce Gemmel at Nation 's Capital , she 's a coaching dream , Meehan telling the Post : <p> " Sometimes , you kind of stop being a coach and become a bit of a fan when she 's in a groove . You 're watching stuff that no one has really done before . " <p> No decisions yet as far as world championships , via trials , in a year that is likely to see her defend the 200 , 400 , 800 and 1500m free titles . It is possible that the 100m free , for the relay , and the 400IM could us to do so . 
 <p> Thiago Pereira of Brazil celebrates a world s/c record of 1:53.14 over 200IM at the und Europa a in 2007 - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The 2012 Olympic 400IM silver medallist Thiago Pereira has announced his retirement . The 31-year-old 's statement was scheduled for the Pr ? mio Brasil Ol ? , in the Cidade das Artes , Rio de Janeiro , the event that will celebrate the achievements of Brazil 's best athletes in 2016 , the year of a home Olympic Games . <p> The swimmer 's farewell would see him called on stage to deliver news that has been the subject of speculation in recent months as Pereira pondered his future and suggested there was still a chance that he would swim on to Tokyo 2020 . He will not , his racing days done . <p> Pereira finished 7th in the 200m medley at Rio 2016 and raced one last time , at the Jos ? Finkel Trophy in September in Santos . He then declined to compete in the ? a Open , a short-course meet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clube was not renewed for 2017 . <p> Having left his long-term base in Los Angeles , he moved to Sao Paulo , where he lives with his wife Gabriela . His future includes swim clinics and seminars . <p> Pereira 's international career stretches back 13 years . Injury in 2005 made the world titles in Montreal that year the only major international he has bypassed since making the Brazil team the year before . <p> Ryan Lochte and Thiago Pereira emerge from the 200IM final at 2013 world titles in Barcelona by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Pereira , who was coached by Dave Salo , Jon Urbanchek and Alberto Pinto da Silva during his career , raced at six world championships and won a silver and two bronzes as a world-class medley man . Four medals at s/c worlds are also part of his treasury . In 2007 , he held the world s/c record over 200m medley , taking the 1:53.31 of American Ryan Lochte down to 1:53.14 at the world cup in Berlin in November 2007 .

The American finished fifth in the 200m butterfly at 15 years of age at Sydney 2000 , the London 400IM the only other time he entered an Olympic final and emerged without a place on the podium . <p> At Pan Am waters , he claimed 23 medals , his exploits oft accompanied by cries of " Vai Thiago " from his mum , Rosa , the Folha de Sao us to do so . 
 <p> Deep in the detail of Brexit negotiations -- Britain 's exit from the European Union , scheduled for 2019 after two years of settlement talks is an intriguing question in the realm of sport : an EU request for Olympic status . <p> Part of the process of Britain 's exit from the EU requires both sides in the talks to agree what size of bill the United Kingdom will be asked to pay to cover future commitments to pension and other long-term arrangements it signed up for beyond 2019 before the June 2016 vote in which just over half of the electorate voted ' leave ' and just under half voted ' stay ' . <p> The Olympic question crops up in the breakdown of that ' future bill ' : Britain was among nations that agreed to fund a pilot program designed to test opinion on whether the EU should field a continent-wide team at the Olympic Games from 2024 onwards . <p> Britain was the srongest opponent of an EU identity at the Olympic Games . After Brexit is complete , however , the UK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the issue , which could be as early as April 1 , 2021 . <p> As such , if the favourite to win the race to hold the 2024 Olympics , Paris , wins the day over Los Angeles and gets to host the Games 100 years after the French capital last did so , there is a chance that athletes from EU member states would compete under the Flag of Europe and its circle of 12 golden stars on an azure background . <p> Among proposals is for the flag sometimes called the " Stars of Unity " to be added to the national flags of each EU member state for the Olympic Games as a compromise designed to ensure that individual countried do not lose their identity in what for the majority of sports is the ultimate arena for their athletes . <p> The International Olympic Committee is also keen to preserve the political status quo : the 27 ( 28 with Britain ) nations of the EU would continue to have their own delegates in the Movement but just as the Australian , New Zealand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United Kingdom , the EU is keen to have its stars represented at the Games . <p> EU discussion papers include talk of the Olympic medals table and whether the EU nations should be represented as one unit . The United States would , more likely than not , be among those opposed to any such move . <p> In swimming , the USA had a stellar Rio 2016 , with 33 medals topped by 16 gold . The combined tally of EU swimmers matches that total of 33 , though the count would include 10 not 16 gold medals . Across all sports , the USA 's tally at Rio 2016 would be swamped by the EU , with or without Britain . With GBR , EU athletes won more than 80 golds , without GBR , the EU would have topped the USA by almost 10 gold medals . <p> That EU tally in the pool includes Britain 's gold and five silver medals but the detail of that raises another contentious issue : the Scottish Parliament voted to hold a second referendum on independence form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU . <p> Dan Wallace by Ian MacNicol <p> There is no specific timetable for that Scottish vote as yet but in sporting terms , a break-up of the UK would be for Great Britain . <p> In swimming , the two silver medals in the 4x200m free and 4x100m medley relays included three Scots in one quartet namely Stephen Milne , Duncan Scott and Daniel Wallace over 4 ? 200 -- and one -- Scott in the medley quartet . Wallace , in kilt and sporting a Braveheart smile , flew the flag for independence in a show of strength at the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games last time the Scottish people voted . It was a close call for Remain . Brexit has now placed a question mark over the issue once more . <p> Under proposals at the EU , if Scotland were to leave the UK and return to the EU fold , it could field an Olympic team of its own at Paris 2024 , complete with a bratach na h-Alba ( St Andrew 's Cross or the Saltire ) adorned with the Stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " There will be no referendum .

 <p> So , the day dawns for the return of the return of Maria to elite tennis courts with a volley of criticism -- and what early reports from Stuttgart says was ' polite applause and some whistling ' from the crowd -- over the ease with which athletes can make their way back from doping bans . <p> The former grand slam champion served time out in the sin bin after a positive test for meldonium , the substance for which there 's been much toing and froing from anti-doping authorities and sports blazers . Swimming relevance ? <p> Well , it was also the substance for which the tennis player 's fellow Russian , swimmer Yuliya , tested positive for several times last year but had her cases set aside before she made her way back to the Olympics -- after serving a suspension for a different banned substance found in her system in 2013 -- to become the most booed swimmer in the history of the Games . <p> Efimova , banned for 16 months after a positive test for a banned steroid that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken -- while claiming it was all a mistake and misunderstanding -- has something else in common with Sharapova this sporting season that continues to include the unsporting . <p> Both have earned the ire , wrath and criticism of fellow athletes who feel that they are competing against rivals who put rather too much emphasis on finding ways of getting one over on other competitors by going beyond the excellent diet required for the athlete to convert fuel to hard work and then success on the big day . <p> As she prepares to make her way back to world titles and the global community that jeered and whistled her to and from her blocks in Rio last year sets its sights on Budapest in July , we find Efimova touching the raw nerve of her fall from grace . <p> Pop it in google : L-Carnitine . <p> First point : L-carnitine is not illegal <p> Point 2 : L-carnitine is not a banned substance ( but infusions of more than 50ml in the space of six hours are prohibited ) <p> Point 3 : it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as are things like testosterone ) <p> Point 4 : L-carnitine was developed pharmaceutically for sick people , not you and I and the healthy whose bodies already produce it in the quantities we need . <p> Put the right keywords in a search engine and you will be driven to numerous other references . <p> And here are some other points : <p> Myriad body building websites crop up and a tidal wave of folk offering supplementation wide , broad , deep , you name it -- products galore , the vast bulk of which , according to some experts in sport , medicine , ethics in sport and anti-doping , are completely unnecessary to world-class performance . <p> Here 's what L-carnitine is : an amino acid ( a building block for proteins ) that is naturally produced in the body . <p> So , why take more of it than your body tells you you need ? <p> Image courtesy of FreeDigitalPhotos.net <p> L-carnitine supplements were designed for medicinal purposes . For example , for people whose natural level of L-carnitine is too low because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as valproic acid for seizures ) , or because they are undergoing a medical procedure ( hemodialysis for kidney disease ) that makes high demands on the body 's L-carnitine production . L-carnitine is also recommended in some cases for strict vegetarians and others who have to follow a narrow diet , or happen to be a premature infant . <p> The Russian media report that accompanies the news of Efimova 's endorsement includes a reference from the manufacturer of the supplement Efimova is endorsing that notes the difference between the " pharmaceutical " market and the " sports nutrition " market . <p> The Allsports Info website quotes Aleksey , CEO of the maker of Pro , as saying : " We are very pleased to start a cooperation with Russia 's first professional team in swimming , Team Efimova Team ... We hope that our joint venture will be a success : athletes on Team Efimova exercising with help from our L-carnitine can achieve new heights -- and thanks to the huge popularity of Yulia Efimova that will increase the awareness of our products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-class athletes who tell you that they take nothing beyond their standard diet in order to achieve the level of fitness they do , while others obviously believe that they can not do without help -- and it in that place that we find product makers right there with them . <p> From the Russian media report on Efimova , we also read : <p> " ... the factory in Italy supplies L-carnitine only for the pharmaceutical market , it is not used for sports nutrition " . <p> There is then a boast that the Russian product is more pure than its Chinese counterpart being used in the sports field . Apparently , the impurities in a Chinese product include ammonia ( hence the fishy smell ) . <p> Medical sources remind those thinking of taking L-carnitine , as they do with may substances to be found in household medical supplies , that side-effects can include nausea , vomiting , stomach upset , heartburn , diarrhea , and seizures . Oh , and it can also cause the " urine , breath , and sweat to have a ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice . <p> Special precautions and warnings are aimed at the pregnant , those breast-feeding , those with an under-active thyroid , anyone who has suffered kidney failure and anyone who suffers from seizures . <p> Here 's another reference : L-carnitine is also used for conditions of the heart and blood vessels including heart-related chest pain , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , heart complications of a disease called diphtheria , heart attack , leg pain caused by circulation problems ( intermittent claudication ) , and high cholesterol . <p> Crikey . Does n't sound much like the stuff required of some of the fittest people on the planet . You know the folk : Olympians , swimmers among them . Truly some of the most robust humans you could care to meet when it comes to tickers that tick , lungs that pump and muscles that work on when the same parts of blood and flesh on others would simply opt out and take the bus . <p> So why would a swimmer be out there endorsing this stuff , apart from the obvious cheque we assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can convert L-carnitine to other amino acids called acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine . But , no one knows whether the benefits of carnitines are interchangeable . Until more is known , do n't substitute one form of carnitine for another . L-carnitine helps the body produce energy . It is important for heart and brain function , muscle movement , and many other body processes . " <p> And those functions work perfectly well every day in the bodies of you , me and most other ' normal ' folk going about our daily lives . It is the sick who require help with that process if and when their condition demands it according to the professional view of a medical doctor . <p> However you view what the term ' sports nutrition ' ought to mean , certain is that Efimova is now putting her name and face and Speedo 's goggles on supplementation this season . So what , you may say . After all , the supplements market is big and bountiful -- and , anyway , this stuff is n't illegal . Besides that , athletes do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that help to pay their way in the world . <p> Well , yes , indeed to all that , points taken . Then again , no getting round the trouble with Efimova and her past : she was based at Trojan in California all the while she was testing positive for a steroid and returning positive tests for meldonium ( regardless of the fact that no penalty was imposed and dosages were deemed too low to worry about and so on and so forth ) . <p> The meldonium saga was messy on a number of levels . Those using it were taking a substance simply unavailable to large numbers of their competitors even when it was and then after it was not legal in WADA terms . Manufactured in Latvia and sold as heart protector , meldonium was not and is not approved for use in much of Europe , the United States and other places in the world . It was placed on the last of banned substances lost because it kept showing up in certain sports populations and WADA wanted to know more . The motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what we 're talking about . Efimova was a member of a team at Trojan led by a coach called Dave Salo . He is a man known in swimming circles for having told his swimmers ' no supplements required ' and last year told that he believed the ' war on supplementation ' was lost and that it would be better having Efimova back in the USA than have her back home and under the influence of the wrong people . And that despite his efforts . <p> One of the things he asks his swimmers to think about and then observe is his belief that a diet of normal food that takes account of the workload of the swimmer is all that is required . Supplements are not -- but if you must take something and feel you need it , come and talk . <p> Trust . Efimova did not tell him , before the positive test emerged , that she had walked into a food supps store in Los Angeles and bought a product that listed a banned substance on a label she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was taking meldonium , either , before it came to light that she had indeed taken it . <p> The good news , perhaps , about her endorsement of an L-carnitine product is that we may have a little more insight into what is fuelling her rude health . <p> Trust . That is what those in tennis criticising Sharapova and her blanket access to wild cards on her way back to the courts are having trouble with . <p> The Stuttgart tournament at which Sharapova made her comeback today reshuffled its schedule to accommodate the Russian 's return . Sharapova won at her first moment of comeback . In similar style Efimova returned from her ban with toppers in 2015 . Such events do n't go down well . Speaking at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells , former World No.1 Caroline Wozniacki spoke words echoed far and wide when she said : <p> " I think it 's very questionable , allowing -- no matter who it is -- a player that is still banned to play a tournament that week . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When someone has been banned for drugs and something that is performance enhancing , I think that you deserve a second chance like everybody else , people make mistakes , but I think you should fight your way back from the bottom . " <p> FINA included Yuliya Efimova on its 2014 annual calendar of " stars " after she tested positive for banned substances in October 2013 <p> Efimova did not fight her way back up and into the trust of her fellow competitors in 2015 . She waltzed back in just in time to qualify for a home world titles in Kazan , danced her way to the podium and likened her doping ban to a minor traffic offence where ' you lose your licence and then you get it back . End of story . <p> Only it was not the end of the story . That goes on . <p> Trust . That was the very word used by three senior folk at FINA when arguing that you can not make anti-doping regimes even ' tougher ' than they are . One said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> True -- for indeed there is a great deal of trust involved . It has always been that way . It is what people expect . <p> They also expect the custodians of sport and the anti-doping authorities to go after fairness when trust has been clobbered about the head with a syringe , pills and potions and the will of rogues . <p> Trust . That is what those who booed and jeered Efimova in Rio -- and may well do all of that against this July in Budapest -- have trouble with when contemplating the choices of the Russian swimmer . <p> Trust . At a time when Russia has a mountain to climb to persuade the world that it will not , in future , turn to external aids to performance for its success in the sporting realm , boasts from supplement manufacturers that with their aid " Team Efimova ... can achieve new heights " will be widely seen as insensitive ( at the very least ) . <p> Swimming and those who coach it , govern it and take part in it at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of what is not allowed but what is and what is not advisable . A cultural shift is overdue . <p> Meanwhile , we have a big medal contender once more heading to world titles swimming in the opposite direction to the advise from the then home program she received while a visitor in the United States and against the tide of opinion that is summed up by USADA 's take on supplements at its Supplement 411 online resource : <p> Against the tide of this kind of advise for young athletes ( that 's the bulk of the world elite swimming community ) , to be found at the UK anti-doping website and other similar resources in Europe : <p> " ... UKAD suggests taking advice from your Doctor or a nutritionist if you have access to one -- if you do n't then contact your NGB . They can talk to you about how to get the best performance from your diet before you need to supplement it . Most nutritionists would agree that a balanced diet incorporating principles of sports nutrition should be sufficient to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would advise athletes to alter their diet , training and rest strategies and hydration routines rather than resort to supplements as you are still maturing . " <p> It is against that backdrop of opposing views and approaches to performance sport that we highlight the good news on Efimova 's endorsement : transparency is now a part of her message and mindset on performance sport . <h> Comments <p> April 27 , 2017 <p> This is extremely concerning as this legal supplement ; Levocarnitine has clearly been proved to be performance enhancing . Check out this study ( double blind randomized ) over 24 months published in the journal of Physiology 2011 : <p> Am I missing something or is WADA not doing its job . Maybe it 's time to have a limited legal supplement list ie supplements you can take ie whey protein vitamins etc and everything else is banned . Also TUE 's should be restricted to genuine medical emergencies and approved for use out of competition only with a suitable waiting period before the athlete can compete again . <p> Also , using any medication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug should be a doping offence . <p> We have had athletes artificially enhancing performance from Meldonium and other substances for years until WADA woke up and banned them but these athletes simply identify the next medical drug or substance and use outside of medical indications to enhance performance . <p> WAKE UP WADA ! ! ! <p> Pavel Buyanov April 27 , 2017 <p> , all that . Also , create rules and laws that will ban anyone for life . Even for the first offense . <p> What disappoints me the most in what is going on in Sport right now is that Sport lost its spirit . I was an athlete . Now I am a coach and I feel like the only true Sport spirit remained on the age group level . And , maybe , some college level . <p> The problem is not in WADA or FINA or IOC . The problem is in people . We lost the true values and indeed are not able to trust each other anymore . <p> The war against drugs can not be won . It @ us to do so . 
 <p> Liam Tancock , still in the swim with , looks back on what it took to be a winner <p> Sunday Essay <p> If the new generation were commanding attention in the pool at the recent British Championships with some record-breaking performances , there were some interested onlookers from times past in the crowd at Ponds Forge , among them former double 50m backstroke world champion and world record holder Liam Tancock . <p> Tancock retired in November 2016 after a 10-year international career that encompassed two Olympic Games , five World Championships long-course and one short-course , three Commonwealth Games and two European Championships , long and short . <p> His medal cabinet may well have breathed a sigh of relief , creaking under the weight of metal from his numerous trips to the podium starting at the 2005 worlds in Montreal where he marked his senior international debut with 50m bronze . <p> Liam Tancock -- in the swim with <p> All told , Tancock claimed 25 international medals -- 18 of them long-course -- notable among his collection 50m gold at the 2009 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mark of 24.04 still unsurpassed . <p> There were five Olympic finals in Beijing and London , fourth the nearest he came to the podium at the latter in the medley relay following his fifth place in the 100m backstroke . <p> Soon to turn 32 , Tancock is still immersed in the swimming world , heavily involved in , a global sportswear brand that produces custom-designed club kit and leisurewear . <p> The Exeter-born swimmer spoke to 's Liz Byrnes about his career , the highs and lows , psychology and bullying accusations in sport today . <h> Consistency and psychology <p> Tancock was an athlete who could always be relied on to perform on the big stage , something he attributes to his mental approach . <p> " I reckon it 's probably down to mindset . I was one of those people who went to the big meets and performed : I loved it . It did n't matter about the races in between . Whereas I find lots of people worry too much about those races which are practising for the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> He adds : " I practised those skill sets before I went to the major competitions and I could see what I could do and I had already practised it on a different level . It did n't matter about the result through the year , it was about the result at the end of the year , that major meet . <p> " Mindset is a really strong asset to have and I think that is definitely one of my strengths . I did n't care who I was racing and I actually thrived off racing the best and I think too many people step away from racing the best . <p> " They want to be the best and they want to win all the time whereas I wanted to race the best and try and beat the best and I managed to do that a few times which is pretty special , " says Tancock . <p> Liam Tancock -- reflections -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> That also involved Tancock stepping out of any comfort zone to test himself and his limits physically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about getting in there -- for me it 's not necessarily racing when you are the best . I swam freestyle and I certainly was n't the best at freestyle but it put me under pressure and I raced against the best when I was n't necessarily going to win . <p> " I was part of the freestyle relay at pretty much every major meet between Beijing and London so I was in there with some of the best athletes . <p> " But sometimes taking yourself out of the comfort zone whether it 's long course or short course , or a different event or different stroke -- that is what having no fear is about . Not just swimming your race when you know you 're going to win . " <p> Ever evolving , Tancock took something out of every race , even when a slip on the block at the start in Canet undermined his chances of victory . <p> In the heat of battle he resolved to concentrate on his back 50 , taking from the race another lesson -- that of expecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to you and making the best out of it : I could have stopped and got out of the water there and chucked the dummies out of the pram , taken my goggles off and said right I 'm no longer swimming but I turned that negative into a massive positive . <p> " Which not only helped me in that race , it helped me in my next race and my next race . You might turn up to the Olympics and miss your bus , you might turn up and there 's a fire alarm -- something might happen and if you are not prepared for something like that to happen , you 're ill prepared . " <h> The effect of the Sweetenham Era <p> Days of conversion and transformation : Bill Sweetenham and Sylvia Armiger , Logistics Manager of British Swimming at the time the Australian was performance head , with Melanie Marshall and Sarah Price , then Britain team captain <p> When Tancock made his international bow , Bill Sweetenham was at the helm before the baton was handed on to Michael Scott and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structures set up under Sweetenham have been instrumental in Britain 's current success . Says Tancock : <p> " You see changes all the time . I was involved from the early ages when Bill and John Atkinson were at the helm and a lot has changed since then . But I think that what they set up at the beginning , what Bill set up , is actually why we are doing well at the moment . There was a system to set up world-class coaches and if you look at the world-class coaches there 's some unbelievable ones like my old coach Ben Titley , James Gibson , who coached me in the last few years of my career , Dave McNulty and Mel Marshall , Fred Vergnoux . " <p> " They all came through that system in Britain that was under that Bill Sweetenham regime that gave them the confidence and pushed the boundaries and made them great coaches and in turn that can make great athletes . <p> " So a lot of hard work back in the day and I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes and it is really good to see . " <h> The elite sporting environment and its fine lines <p> There have been allegations by athletes of bullying by coaches across para-swimming , canoeing and cycling . was subject to an investigation himself , little more than a month after Tancock 's senior debut , one which ultimately cleared the Australian . <p> For Tancock , then , is one man 's bully another man 's hard , tough coach guiding the athlete to their shared goals ? <p> Tancock said : " It 's a fine line and I do n't think I am good enough with words to say what that is . It is a fine line between what is acceptable and what 's not . <p> " There are plenty of allegations out there . It 's really tough and it can only really be on an individual basis . " <p> " I sat down and watched a film the other day -- ' Whiplash ' about a band leader and a drummer and their relationship of being elite . Ultimately the coach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was intense , it was ruthless and it was ridiculous . " <p> He adds : " But it 's elite and it 's really interesting and I think it takes a certain person to become an Olympian -- they are perfectionists , they are a certain type of individual , they 've got certain traits . In terms of accusations going around all sports there is a fine line . Sometimes those lines are crossed and I think everything has to be looked at on a very individualised basis between athlete , coach and governing body . <p> " But it 's a very tough environment to be in and there is a lot of pressure on all parties -- it is cut-throat , it is ruthless and you see that across all sports . " <h> The London 2012 Olympics <p> Liam Tancock -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Great Britain won three medals in London thanks to Rebecca Adlington 's freestyle double bronze and Michael Jamieson 's 200m breaststroke silver . <p> That fell short of UK Sport 's medal target of five to seven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed three in the pool and three in the open water . The team and management came in for fierce criticism at a home Games where many other sports had enjoyed great success . <p> Former team director Dennis Pursley headed back to the United States immediately after competition and Scott resigned in November 2012 following a review into the team 's performance which concluded that the best way forward was for the reins to be handed over to a British coach . <p> As to why Britain under-performed , Tancock hinted all had not been well . <p> He said : " I think you have to look really deep in that stuff to understand what was really going on at that time . <p> " For me it was absolutely brilliant , I loved every experience of it . I went out there and did my utter best . And it was the same as happened in Rio and happens all the time , people miss out by 100th of a second and those 100ths of a second can make a big difference . <p> " You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want . I 've done a degree , I 've done dissertations and you can read results and put information in or take it out but until you are actually in that environment I guess you really never know . <p> " So I think as a nation we were actually pretty strong and I think the line changed as the meet went on but I was focused on what we had to do in the water not what was going on around me . It 's always tough when you are focused on stuff that is not going to aid performance so I never did . And I still wo n't . " <h> Highs and Lows -- and Back to A Winning Mindset <p> The former Loughborough swimmer describes becoming world champion for the first time with his 50m victory in Rome as " a massive highlight " . So too was the fact he repeated the feat two years later in Shanghai , minus the shiny suit . <p> However , it was his mental approach after he first broke the world record in the semi-final that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster and I was quite excited by that . But people 's mindset was like this is yours to lose now whereas I did n't think about that at all . <p> " I was like what ? No it 's not . I 've not got it , I 've found a quick time but it 's a race tomorrow , anything can happen . The job 's not done in the semi-final , it 's done in the final . So my mentality was very much this is a race , let 's race and I stepped up . " <p> Liam Tancock -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Tancock echoes Adam Peaty and the Olympic 100m breaststroke champion 's natural state to of never feeling the burden of expectation from others . <p> " I think lots of people get nervous and worried and scared going in ranked number one but I think lots of people around you can affect you as well and it 's how you accept that . People talk about going into an Olympics -- oh a home Olympics do you feel pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how you perceive that and you have got to accept pressure which I just did . <p> The warrior was in him : " People can do what they want , people can say what they want , people can think what they want but my focus was to go in there , swim as fast as I can regardless of what 's happening around me . It 's just a different way to look at things really . " <p> Even the low of breaking his wrist in 2006 became a positive . A tumble down three stairs following the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne not only threatened his immediate future at the European Championships but that was also his chance of making the British team for the 2007 worlds . <p> Along with his coach at the time Ben Titley , the pair hatched a plan , Tancock in the water every day kicking , gym work including single arm bench presses and a special cast was made . <p> In the end Tancock was part of the medley relay squad that took bronze in Budapest that summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows you can bounce back from these things which can make you or break you . " <h> Comments <p> May 1 , 2017 <p> Very interesting and informative piece , Liz , and am very impressed by both Tancock 's attitude and . <p> No country can just blindly copy another 's system and hope for identical solutions . Like in law , every case has its own specific set of facts and circumstances and in swimming these include the size of one 's talent base ; the national economy ; demographics ; geographical location as well as levels of public sector support/capacity for private sector investment . <p> Having said that , GBR are certainly proving a model that probably all swimming nations who are NOT the USA should be closely studying and seeing what can be adapted to their own situations . And I AM extending that up to and including the likes of AUS who are still seemingly drifting in the parallel reality that they are still the 2nd biggest fish in the pond rather than just one of us to do so .

 <p> Coach Greg Meehan summed up the ' external ' status of his new charge Katie Ledecky quite well when he said : " ... there is a little bit of a sense of what 's next , if she 's already doing the things she 's doing ? " <p> Olympic champion in the 200 , 400 and 800m freestyle , World champion and record holder in the 400 , 800 and 1500m by dominant margins over the all-time next best in each event , Ledecky has two Olympics and five gold medals in her treasury . <p> Paul Newberry , of the Associated Press , throws it forward in a fine state-of-play interview with the woman swimmer of the year for the past four seasons when he notes " Now that Michael Phelps has retired again , Ryan Lochte is serving a suspension for his antics in Rio de Janeiro and Missy Franklin faces the daunting challenge of bouncing back from a disappointing Olympics , Ledecky is the undisputed star of the mighty U.S. program " . <p> Ledecky , the prospect of her being THE focus at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't really think of it in those terms at all . Just taking things step by step , focusing on my own goals , and not letting anything else get to me has always been what I 've done a good job of and what I need to continue to do moving forward . " <p> Debbie Meyer -- the first and only woman to win three solo Olympic freestyle titles -- images , stills from the International Swimming Hall of Fame and Sacramento Hall of Fame <p> Each coach in turn has been blessed in that sense and others by the raw material -- physical , intellectual and psychological capacities -- that is Ledecky . Yuri Suguiyama guided her to London 2012 and gold at 15 years of age in the 800m free before Bruce Gemmell served as her mentor through the next quad . And what a quad that was , culminating in Ledecky becoming the first woman since Debbie Meyer in 1968 to claim the 200 , 400 and 800m Olympic titles , Meyer having been the first to achieve that when the 200m was intriduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turn . A different chapter for the swimmer and a coach who places his new charge in the following context : <p> " She 's already achieved levels in this sport that , outside of Michael , no one else has gotten to . Michael was more dominant in the spread of events he could cover . He 's the most amazing swimmer I 've ever seen . But I think Katie is much more dominant in her ( freestyle ) events . So there is a little bit of a sense of what 's next , if she 's already doing the things she 's doing ? " <p> Steady as she goes . He adds : " This is only year one , " Meehan said . " We 're continuing to learn each other and push the envelope in some ways . We 'll get through this year and next year , then we 'll start looking at big-picture goals . " <p> Freestyle is the big thing ; lots of talk of the 100m but by Tokyo 2020 the sprint may well be back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4x100m relay will remain a part of Ledecky 's list of targets after she helped the USA to Rio 2016 silver and herself to a collection of five medals , the fourth gold earned in the 4x200m . <p> Jazz Carlin tracks Katie Ledecky on their way to the top two spots in the 400m freestyle in Rio -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Ledecky will arrive in Budapest -- forget the test of U.S. Trials unless something truly unexpected were to intervene -- for world titles the favourite for the 400 , 800 and 1500m free , while the 200m is more open to chances for others if Ledecky shows up in top form . <p> The expectation is that she will continue to be dominant but by the time you get to 3:56 and 8:04 and the like the chances of wielding axes is somewhat reduced . Anyhow , Ledecky does n't see it like that : <p> " I do n't focus on outdoing myself . I 've just got to focus on what I want to achieve and not let anything else stand in my way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain in the summer that may include learning to drive as he teens pass into history . <p> Kathleen Ledecky -- steady as she goes -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Stanford coach Meehan notes the helpful timing of Ledecky 's curve in terms of her long-term prospects when he tells Newberry : <p> " Oftentimes after the games , there will be a lull for these athletes coming out of the Olympics . Sometimes , during that down time , they can have that post-Olympic depression . But I think moving into a new environment , being excited about some new challenges , that really helped with the transition . That kept things moving , kept things us to do so .

 <p> Kyle Chalmers , time to reflect and find the best pathway for his health - by Delly Carr / Swimming Australia Ltd <p> In another case of athlete safety and welfare over results in the water , Kyle Chalmers , the Australian who last year in Rio claimed Olympic gold in the 100m freestyle , has withdrawn from the World Championships in Budapest this July over concerns for his long-term health . he is to have surgery required for his long-term health . <p> A heart condition caused Chalmers to skip races in the past year . Now , Swimming Australia has issued the following statement : <p> The break will enable Chalmers and his medical team to further explore his heart condition , known as Supraventricular Tachycardia ( SVT ) , without the added responsibility of having to be in peak form and ready to compete for Australia in July . <p> The decision was not made lightly and involved careful consultation with Chalmers ' doctor , his coach Peter Bishop and Australian Dolphins Swim Team Head Coach , Jacco Verhaeren . <p> On making the tough decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kyle 's best long term interest to get the surgery done sooner rather than later . This will enable Kyle a good recovery period , before preparing for a home Commonwealth Games in 2018 " <p> Swimming Australia Head Coach Verhaeren said the health and well-being of all of the athletes was of paramount importance . <p> " We are at the beginning of a new Olympic cycle , and for some of our athletes we need to look at longevity to allow them to stay at the highest level for longer . For some that may mean having more of a focus on study , a different season planning with other competitions , or the chance to follow up a niggling injury or medical issue and then comeback refreshed and revitalised when it is right for them . <p> " Kyle has our full support and we know he will use this time away from competition positively and to his advantage to return for a home Commonwealth Games in 2018 and beyond , " Verhaeren said . <p> Chalmers will have the surgery in the coming weeks , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Budapest will take place internally and be announced shortly . <h> Comments <p> In all honesty , the only sensible decision to make in these circumstances . One 's health , and indeed one 's life , are far more important than a sporting career however distinguished it may be . <p> If the reports are accurate , it would appear that the procedure will be a catheter ablation which essentially the faulty electrical pathway which has been causing the arrythmia . What is a slight concern is that there had already been a previous procedure carried out in the past which does not seem to have been ( fully ) effective . <p> One can only wish him all the best . If he returns to top level swimming and his previous levels of performance , all the better but ultimately , let 's just see him healthy again and without us to do so .

 <h> King The Olympic Queen Of Trash Talk Set For A Rematch With Empress Of Controversy <p> Lilly King - Olympic gold beyond the wag of a finger that summed up the mood in the swimming ranks fed up with the return and continued presence of dopers in their midst - by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> " It 's sad someone has to say it . We should n't have to say , ' Hey , do n't cheat . ' That 's kind of idiotic to me that I even have to be the person to do that . But I 'm fine with it . It 's really not that hard of a job . Just reciting facts . " <p> Guess who ? Lilly King , of course . Yes , she 's back and from tomorrow , the Rio 2016 100m breaststroke champion will be racing at U.S. nationals and world-championship trials in Indianapolis , seeking passage to a follow-up to a debut Olympics that transcended gold in the pool . <p> King won top prize , too , for telling like it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't do justice to the justice King had in mind when she wagged a finger at Yuliya , the Russian who when based in California tainted Trojan hosts and self by testing positive for a banned steroid in 2013 . <p> Yuliya Efimova -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Rikke Pedersen by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Let 's remind ourselves of the hurt and harm . Efimova had claimed the 200m world title that year ahead of world-record holder from semis , Rikke Pedersen . It was October 2013 when the positive test came in . The anti-doping system failed to block Efimova 's passage to her blocks in December that year , as process proceeded , and the Russian added insult to Danish injury by defeating Pedersen once more , this time for the European short-course crown , denying the Dane a victory in Herning . <p> Efimova argued that she had simply overlooked the label of a product she bought in a store in Los Angeles . If only she 'd noticed the named of the banned substance on the tin . If only she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to take as a supplement against the wishes of a coach who believes such things are unnecessary and -- the woe of other doping positives in the mix -- had good reason to understand the risks . <p> A hearing was told by Efimova that she 'd made a mistake . They accepted her story and gave her a lenient 16-month ban , the timing of which meant that she could make it back just as she needed to race at Russian trials for a home world titles in Kazan in 2015 . She had to hand back the fool 's gold of Herning but Pedersen never did get to feel the flow of love from a home crowd denied a celebration that will never be remembered as such , medals handed over in the back room of sport never quite as real as the moment they were won . <p> Efimova claimed the world 100m crown in 2015 . Her win was one of the least popular of the meet , at least among visitors just as the full implications of the Russian doping scandal were starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had exposed wrong-doing of a specific kind that transcended the truth of a general " doping is a global problem " . <p> If the doping positive and the leniency of lawyers irritated those who think those falling foul of the WADA Code should at least serve their full time in the sin bin , for what they have done and in order to send the right message and set the right tone on clean sport , then Efimova 's attitude at Kazan 2015 tipped the scales further in favour of the downside . <p> If she appeared to grin and her way around Lithuania 's Ruta Meilutyte and certainly got to the emotions of the London 2012 Olympic champion and 2013 double world champion , Efimova invited further when she likened her doping ban to a minor traffic offence in which ' you lose your licence and then get it back again ' . Simple . But not really . Eurosport and several other media outlets , TV and print , criticised Efimova for not taking her ban and status seriously . <p> It might have ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the substance had been banned at the start of 2016 . To cut a long saga short , she was temporarily suspended , then let off and returned , along with others , to Olympic waters . <p> Regardless of the technicalities of her affair with meldonium and the merits of a ban on a substance not fully understood by WADA at the time it made the banned list , the worldwide swimming community spotted a rat in the form of this : here she was again , taking a ' supplement ' ( one neither available nor approved for use in the USA where she was based ) without having told her coach . <p> Trust was fatally eroded and Efimova became the most booed and jeered swimmer in Olympic history . Star Wars in the Rio pool touched a little on the return of Russians at a time of revelations of urine samples being passed through plugholes to a secret lab for switching the filthy with the fake clean at the Winter Olympics -- and the same lab as used for the 2015 World swim in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue with cheats in swimming that saw Sun Yang* booed to his blocks and back , too . <p> Yuliya Efimova , at the centre of the big stink in Rio last year -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Lilly King -- By Patrick B. Kraemer <p> 2017 . <p> Efimova , these days racing for the eponymous swim club she founded back home after being told she would not be welcome back at Trojan , reigns supreme on the clock at the helm of the 50m , 100m and 200m world rankings for the year . <p> A season after minor spoils over 100 and 200m at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games , she seeks gold ahead of King and Co . That she is in the form of her controversial swimming life is not in question : <p> Also , having a rival such as Efimova tends to bring out the best in King . Growing up in Evansville , Indiana , one of her favorite athletes was renowned NBA trash talker Reggie Miller , who starred for the home-state Pacers . <p> She still gushes when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympics . <p> " I 'm an Indiana girl , and he 's like the trash-talk idol , " King said , breaking into a huge smile . " We actually got to hang out a little bit . He 's my buddy now . We 've got each other 's back . " <p> Sometimes , King goes a bit too far . <p> At the NCAA championships , Looze cringed when he heard King explain her success by flatly declaring that she trains harder than anyone else . <p> The coach pulled her aside afterward for a little chat . <p> " Lilly , that may be true , " Looze told her . " But please think about how that comes out . You 've already got a target on your back , trust me . " <p> King pondered the advice ever so briefly , then came back with a retort that epitomized her feisty nature . <p> " Yeah , but I swim better that way , " she insisted . <p> Lilly King -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Before that , Newberry writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so be it . ' <p> " That 's just who she is , " said her dad , Mark King . " It 's not a show for the media . It 's not a show for television . It 's authentic . " <p> Kind describes swimming as a " very P.C. , country club kind of sport " . She describes herself as " not very P.C. or country club " . <p> Read what that 's meant for coach Ray Looze of Indiana University in Newberry 's article . He saw it coming that famous wag of a finger at Efimova in Rio long before it happened . That 's who King is -- in and out of swimming . <p> Do n't mention Trump , unless you 're on the side of people who do n't take kindly to liars . <p> The source of what some see as defiance , others just as a girl , now woman , determined to speak her mind is pinned in her father 's memory as the moment when she " connected positive thinking with positive performance " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age title after entering the race as one of the best 10 . <p> The attitude and self-belief " never really left her after that " , says dad . knows it , too . <p> ( L-R ) Lilly King and USA teammate Tom Shields -- two in a big shoal of world-title ticket contenders this week by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> King got beaten by Jamaica 's short-course queen Alia Atkinson in the 100m at world champs in the titchy pool last December . No great shakes for an Olympic champion -- unless you take into account the thing that matters to such folk : they hate to lose at tiddlywinks and ping pong on training camp , let alone championship deciders . <p> King got stuck back into the work and Looze says she 's now fighting fit and gunning for Meilutyte 's 1:04.35 world record in Budapest next month , via trials this week . King 's Rio win was 1:04.93 . <p> knows it is within reach if he 's read the runes right when he tells Newberry : <p> " Right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's in a great place mentally , recharged , excited . She 's really excited to go to Budapest . She wants to race Yuliya again , and whoever else comes along . " <p> Await the wag and do n't be too surprised if you hear a boo or two : the fight for clean sport is not done ; the time when dopers will not make their way back to the realm of racing they tainted and get to compete alongside those they us to do so .

 <h> Barelli : ' $5m For Swim League Of Nations ; War On Doping &amp; Conflicts If I Rule FINA ' <p> Paolo Barelli , the Italian challenging for the Presidency of FINA , has issued his manifesto just over three weeks before delegates from more than 200 nations votes in Budapest to either stick with a broken status quo steeped in crisis or opt for reform of a model of international federation governance that has past its sell-by date . <p> In a move that will delight leading swimming nations and those who feel that success is something to work for and to be rewarded , budgets will increase for development but a sum of $5 million would be allocated " amongst the Federations according to the ranking of national teams as established yearly by FINA and based on the results achieved at the most important international competitions " if Barelli wins the race for the top seat . <p> Swimming has never recognised the success level of nations in the pool before in terms of linking funding to achievement in that way . In addition , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at FINA events and allow multiple sponsors on suits and caps and other equipment . <p> On doping , Barelli backs calls for an " Independent Testing Agency " and says FINA must take a much more aggressive stance : <p> " The devastatingly negative effect of doping in sports must be the reason for its total eradication . We must stick by our principles of Fair Play and severely punish anyone who acts against the true ideals of aquatic sports . In other words , while I am in favour of zero tolerance against doping , we also need to protect , celebrate and promote any demonstration of honesty and integrity without hesitation and at all times . " <p> The World Cup and other series in the FINA stable would be overhauled to be more appealing to athletes , programs and sponsors . A Panel of Experts would be established to consider the future format of all FINA events . <p> There would be age restrictions for serving as an official in FINA governance -- and a new audit commission would be established to take oversight of FINA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his campaign manifesto , pledging greater transparency , more support for the development of the sport , a greater voice for the major stakeholders , including athletes and coaches and a tougher stance on clean sport and anti-doping . <p> His bullet-point overview states : <p> FINA is not a financial institution with the objective of setting money aside . I want FINA to give all the support possible , including economic support , to the Federations <p> I will ensure the FINA Development Programme is given a more defined role which will be tailored to positively impact on all Federations <p> I want Athletes , Teams , Federations and Organisers to feel that events are organised with their collective interest at heart <p> I will ensure that FINA remains focused on the promotion of aquatic sports worldwide <p> I will make it a priority to introduce drastic measures to ensure that any type of conflict of interest within FINA is avoided <p> I will make FINA take a more aggressive and innovative stand in its fight against doping <p> I feel FINA must capitalise on both the experience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The president of the Ligue Europ ? ene de Natation ( LEN ) and the Italian Swimming Federation , Barelli concludes : " I trust that my Manifesto will gather a large consensus and the National Federation 's support . These will both be necessary to foster together the change that FINA needs for its ever-growing affirmation and an ever-brighter future for our sports ... feel free to share the document with your audience , and I hope that in the years ahead we will build the future of FINA together . " <h> In Full -- Paolo Barelli 's Manifesto For Change At FINA as Presidential Candidate : <p> Spotlight on swimming -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> The Federation Internationale de Natation -- FINA , is the lifeblood of aquatic sports in the world . My pledge is to dedicate the resources , work and energy essential to engendering its success . This Manifesto outlines seven drivers that will secure this objective . <p> FINA has undoubtedly forged ahead in recent years and has positioned itself as one of the most successful and effective of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , economic wealth and the public recognition of our athletes . <p> This has only been possible through the very hard work and continued investment carried out by Federations all over the world . However , FINA is not a financial institution with the objective of setting money aside . <p> My vision is that FINA must give all the support possible to the Federations , including economic support , in order for them to contribute further to the growth of the aquatic disciplines worldwide . ' FINA is not a financial institution with the objective of setting money aside . <p> FINA must give all the support possible to the Federations , including economic support ' 1 Support to Federations for International Activities <p> We must recognise that , were it not for the top Athletes , the outstanding success achieved would not have been possible . Success is accomplished by attracting viewers to the media and through spectators at FINA events being assured of watching great Athletes giving great performances . <p> FINA must take a more proactive approach in establishing and promoting initiatives that have the objective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits , we must ensure economic ones feature prominently . <p> In this regard my Programme provides a number of specific initiatives amongst which are : <p> The introduction of an annual contribution amounting to not less than $5,000,000 to be allocated amongst the Federations according to the ranking of national teams as established yearly by FINA and based on the results achieved at the most important international competitions . These funds will be over and above those already allocated by FINA in respect of team travel and accommodation to Federations and prize money for athletes . <p> Increasing the number of sponsors ' logos on all technical equipment -- tracksuits , swimwear , t-shirts etc . At present , apart from the logo of the technical supplier , we have the limit of one sponsor . <p> I intend to increase this significantly in terms of both the number of sponsors permitted on all technical equipment and the actual size of such logos . This will certainly provide an opportunity for Federations to generate a higher visibility and the potential for an increase in income . <p> Spotlight on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Federations for Development and for Continental/Regional Activity <p> When referring to Federations , we should underline that it is all the FINA Federations which promote the FINA aquatic disciplines practiced by millions of people around the world . <p> All Federations carry out the important role both of spreading " the culture of water " throughout the world whilst producing future athletes and champions . I strongly believe this can only be achieved through a robust Development Programme . Granted that FINA 's objective is not that of setting money aside , this Development Programme must ensure that whilst all Federations are invited to attend major events such as the FINA World Championships , they are also given the opportunity to participate in their continental or regional competitions and to be supported , also financially , for key Learning and Development Initiatives . <p> To achieve this , I believe the FINA Development Programme must be given a more defined role that can positively impact on all Federations . <p> ' I believe the FINA Development Programme must be given a more defined role that can positively impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearly contribution of $5,000,000 shall be introduced and utilised to : <p> Increase and support key aquatic activities such as Clinics , FINA Schools and Training Camps in emerging and developing countries in order to improve the technical level and the performance of athletes concerned . These funds will be over and above any others already allocated for such purposes through the FINA Development Fund . <p> Support the organisation and participation of the National Federations at events . The continental and regional competitions are of key strategic importance as they represent both a testing ground for high level activity as well as the foundation for the development and promotion of the aquatic disciplines . To ensure that these events are successful , they must be organised to a level of true excellence attracting the widest participation possible . <p> 3 . FINA World Cup , FINA World League and other FINA Events The FINA World Cup , the FINA World League and other FINA events in all the disciplines must necessarily modify their format in order to truly appeal to all the stakeholders . <p> The athletes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are organised with their collective interest at heart . <p> ' The Athletes , Teams , Federations and Organisers must feel that these events are organised with their collective interest at heart ' <p> Spotlight on swimming -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> Unfortunately , today , the participation in the Swimming World Cup is far too low and the event itself does not really attract the interest of either the Federations nor of the majority of the athletes . The Swimming World Cup must ensure the number of events are programmed in order to maximise participation . This should not be limited to attracting the number of athletes but also the level of athletes desired in order to better promote swimming worldwide . <p> To favour the strongest and most engaging calendar of FINA activities , I plan the establishment of a discipline specific , appointed Panel of Experts . <p> The members of the Panel will be chosen for their expertise and according to the ranking of the nations they represent in the different disciplines in which they excel . Each Panel of Experts shall study the programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative measures to be considered by the Technical Committee and the FINA Bureau . <p> The panel would include the Chairman of the Technical Committee and the Bureau Liaison responsible for every discipline . <p> 4 . FINA Event Allocation FINA events have become synonymous with success and attract millions of spectators through various media . <p> It is also a known fact that the organisation and staging of events such as the FINA World Championships or other main competitions require substantial financial support . Furthermore , the commercial rights payable to FINA are very significant and are also an important source of income for FINA . <p> The risk of solely chasing the financial goals linked to the organisation of FINA events , is that they can only be allocated to a restricted number of countries . Whilst appreciating that such allocations are also determined by the investment certain countries are prepared to undertake , it must be remembered that FINA should be focused on the promotion of aquatic sports worldwide . <p> ' It must also be remembered that FINA should be focused on the promotion of aquatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that a more equitable formula be adopted in order to sustain both the financial interests of FINA and the promotion of our disciplines in as many countries as possible around the world . <p> 5 . Good Governance and Transparency <p> I intend to tackle the issues of good governance and transparency ensuring that these are upheld in everything we do in FINA by addressing the following four key areas : <p> The FINA Code of Ethics defines the situations which can potentially lead to a conflict of interest and political interference . To ensure absolutely transparent behaviour , it is simply a matter of properly applying the existing FINA rules . Unfortunately , these rules are far too often intentionally ignored or misinterpreted , hence leading to very unclear and ambiguous instances . <p> Many of us are aware of conflicting situations which occur regularly within the FINA leadership . These often arise when certain individuals place their personal interests and desires ahead of FINA 's needs . <p> This is simply not acceptable and must not be tolerated . It is my firm intention to introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any type of conflict of interest within FINA is avoided and this shall be carried out to ensure that transparency is guaranteed at all times . <p> ' It is my firm intention to introduce drastic measures to ensure that any type of conflict of interest within FINA is avoided ' <p> The fight against both conflict of interest and political interference must carry the same weight as the war we wage against doping . <p> Clear Separation of the Political and Judicial Roles <p> The FINA Executive presently decides whether a case should be transferred to the Disciplinary or Ethics Panel . This is yet another clear conflict whereby the political authority is establishing the judicial process , hence impinging on its autonomy . <p> My programme clearly separates the political and judicial roles , thus empowering the legal bodies to inquire independently and sanction any offenders accordingly . Adherence to the Constitution and Clear Terms of Office The number of mandates for the President and Bureau members , as well as the age limit to be a FINA elective candidate , must be agreed upon once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be changed according to one 's personal agenda . <p> As you will recall , at the 2011 Congress in Shanghai , it was decided to limit the eligibility for the Presidency of FINA to 2 terms of office . The Congress also decided to set the age limit for the candidacy for FINA President at 80 . In 2015 the Congress changed all this again . It removed the 80 year age limit and introduced the maximum number of terms for the President to three . <p> Such actions are bound to raise suspicions . I plan to clearly establish within the Constitution that the President shall have a maximum of two terms at the helm of FINA . Furthermore , the age limit at the time of election to any post shall not be over 80 years of age , as was also provided for within the International Olympic Committee , before being lowered to 70 years of age for recently elected members . <p> Audit Committee <p> At present there is no audit committee within the FINA structures . The proposal of the FINA Bureau at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three members who shall be indicated for approval to the Congress by the FINA Bureau itself . In order to ensure further independence and autonomy , it is my firm intention to propose that the Audit Committee should be composed of 5 members who shall each be nominated by the individual continental bodies . <p> Further , I also plan to have the FINA Financial Report published annually on the FINA website so that it can be viewed by whoever is interested . This will once again clearly demonstrate my will to introduce good governance , transparency and sovereignty more deeply within FINA . <p> 6 . The Fight Against Doping <p> I am absolutely convinced that FINA needs to be more aggressive and innovative in its fight against doping and any form of change to the principles of fair and correct behaviour . <p> ' FINA needs to be more aggressive and innovative in its fight against doping ' <p> The devastatingly negative effect of doping in sports must be the reason for its total eradication . We must stick by our principles of Fair Play and severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports . In other words , while I am in favour of zero tolerance against doping , we also need to protect , celebrate and promote any demonstration of honesty and integrity without hesitation and at all times . <p> In my programme , I am suggesting that FINA must seek to cooperate with an external independent body under the authority of WADA and the IOC . <p> This entity shall be responsible for the management of doping control and the eventual punishments to be imposed on offenders . <p> To further strengthen the war on doping I will ensure adequate funding is made available to promote : <p> The establishment of such an Independent Testing Agency in cooperation with other leading Sport Authorities <p> The development of a programme aimed at preventing doping in aquatics and spreading a culture based on values such as correct and fair behaviour , and respect of rules and competitors . <p> 7 Capitalising on Experience <p> Spotlight on swimming -- by Patrick B. Kraemer <p> In the FINA FAMILY we know each other ! Nonetheless , I believe that , at this stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some personal information . I am 63 years old and was born in Rome where still I live today . I am married to Rita and have two sons , Gianpaolo and Alessandro . <p> In my sporting career , I was crowned Italian Champion 20 times and national record holder on 22 occasions . I participated at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games and was a finalist twice at the Montreal 1976 Games . I won a bronze medal at the second edition of the FINA World Championships in Cali in 1975 . <p> I studied and trained at Indiana University , USA , between 1973 and 1975 . <p> In 2000 I was elected President of FIN , the Italian Swimming Federation , after having previously held the post of Vice President . I was first elected to the FIN Bureau in 1987 . <p> I was Head of the FIN Delegation at five Olympic Games : Seoul 1988 , Barcelona 1992 , Atlanta 1996 , Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 . <p> I was responsible for the organisation of the two editions of the FINA World Championships held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international scene , I was elected Vice President of COMEN -- Conf ? d ? ration M ? ? enne de Natation -- in 2004 . <p> In 2012 , at the Congress held in Cascais , Portugal , I was elected President of LEN -- Ligue Europ ? enne de Natation . Prior to this , I served as a LEN Bureau Member between 2008 and 2012 and also as Deputy Chairman of the LEN Technical Swimming Committee . <p> I was elected FINA Honorary Secretary in 2009 and re-elected in 2013. * I served as a member of the Executive Board of the Italian Olympic Committee ( CONI ) . I was also honoured by with the Gold Star for Sport Merit . <p> As President of FIN , I am also responsible for the " Life Saving " organisation in Italy , recognised by the State Authorities and by the International Life Saving Federation -- ILS . <p> I was appointed as Councillor responsible for Sport and Tourism for the Province of Rome in 1999 and held this post until 2001 . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian Republic , from 2001 till 2013 , and held responsibilities in Sport , Education , Surveillance Authority of Public Broadcasting , Employment and Social Solidarity . <p> In my private activity , I manage and invest in businesses in the services and financial sectors and I am a recognised us to do so . 
 <p> You 'll know what to do should you spot that tendency to gnash teeth as the results pour in : what -- only 4th , 5th and 6th in the world in Phelps ' signature -- whatever became of USA Swimming in these days ? That sort of thing . <p> Ignore the sirens : the USA is in fine fettle and will be , once more , the force to reckon with when it comes to meda hunts across the board topped by the efforts of the outstanding . <p> The 200m butterfly finals got U.S. nationals and world-title trials off to a fine start in Indianapolis this evening , Jack Conger ( Rockville , Md. /Nation 's Capital Swim Club ) taking the men 's crown a slither ahead of two others on 1:54s . <p> Conger 's 1:54.47 pipped Pace Clark ( Memphis , Tenn. /Athens Bulldog Swim Club ) , 1:54.58 , Chase Kalisz ( Bel Air , Md. /North Baltimore Aquatic Club ) , medley ace and Olympic silver medallist over 400 on all strokes , reminded how tough his nation is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the world have raced inside all all the world 's trials on the way to world titles in Budapest from July 23-30 . <p> Two of those blokes just happen to me Americans , too , and all three podium placers celebrated the best they 'd ever been . <p> Michael Phelps , by Peter Bick <p> Conger eeled his way inside a 1:54.54 best from back in 2015 at a pace more than 2sec swifter than his Olympic trials effort . Making up for it also meant a debut national team selection for a world titles . True , Michael Phelps went inside Conger 's new best 26 times during a career topped by the world textile best of 1:52.09 and the world record of 1:51.51 . That was then . <p> Conger nailed the race and nailed the meaning of here and now when speaking through USA Swimming : <p> " It was just a really good feeling ... With Michael Phelps gone that butterfly is completely wide open , and I wanted to stamp my ticket and make a statement . " <p> Clark paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , his 1:56.27 from semis at Olympic trials last year confined to the past . And Kalisz ? Looking good . He entered 2017 with a lifetime best of 1:56.48 and then clobbered that three times on the way to the Indy final , two high 1:55s on tour bettered by a 1:55.60 in heats before a debut sub-1:55 in the final .

 <p> With 15 Olympic champions past and present among their number and with athlete representation a keyword , the formation of the Global Association of Professional Swimmers ( GAPS ) was announced on Tuesday by Katinka Hosszu , the triple Rio champion who a fortnight ago slammed FINA and called for reform of the sport . <p> So far the organisation numbers more than 30 swimmers , among them 2016 Olympic champions Kosuke Hagino , the Campbell sisters Cate and Bronte , Sarah Sjostrom and Adam Peaty , who has been vocal in demanding athletes be given more of a voice . <p> Hosszu had criticised FINA on social media last month for scrapping the World Cup format in which she had thrived in and out of the pool while also highlighting a lack of transparency , accusing the governing body of being self-serving with a lack of engagement with swimmers . <p> She pointed to the history of Wimbledon and the ATP , even advocating boycott as a means to force through change . <p> It seems that her words stirred a number of swimmers and in a post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are proud to announce that with more than 30 members , including 15 Olympic champions , the Global Association of Professional Swimmers ( GAPS ) is coming to life today , with its members already representing all the continents of the globe . <p> " Our goal is to have more members and to listen to all of you .

We expect swimmers to be treated as equal partners . We expect that they will sit down and start talking to us . We expect that they will listen to the voice of the professional swimmers and we expect to have a say in important decisions about the future of our sport . " <p> Unlike the PSA , which is official registered , Hosszu 's new grouping has only a group of names to date . Its basic website does not name officers and any structure through which it hopes to lobby official bodies . Even so , the world titles and associated press conferences and mixed zone interviews will be laced with a charged and powerful atmosphere beyond the racing . <h> Hosszu 's statement in full : <p> Dear Fellow Swimmers , <p> " Many things can change in sports in a span of two weeks , not only races and championships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly a week to award all the medals of the Olympic swimming competition , and the same will happen in the World Championships this year in Budapest . <p> " In the last two weeks I 've learnt an important lesson : this amount of time could be enough for an entire sport to start heading into a completely new direction . I was hoping that my last letter would have a light bulb effect for many of you , but even I underestimated the rate at which everything would happen . I do not mean the fact that the press would quickly jump on the topic , or that many people who were never interested in swimming will start asking questions about the sport , but I mean the speed and ease at which all of us , the swimmers , have started to come together as one . <p> " As I believed , many of us were on the same page , well aware of the problems of today 's swimming . We had the same way of thinking when it came down to finding solutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , most of us were not only ready to openly talk about the problems , but ready to act in order to reform the sport of swimming , even if those changes might be against our own personal interests . This whole movement has immediately eliminated many of our dividing lines , with different nationalities , languages , time-zones and cultures all coming together as one . <p> " We are proud to announce that with more than 30 members , including 15 Olympic champions , the Global Association of Professional Swimmers ( GAPS ) is coming to life today , with its members already representing all the continents of the globe . <p> " Our goal is to have more members and to listen to all of you .
