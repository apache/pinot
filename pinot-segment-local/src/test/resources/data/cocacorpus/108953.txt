@@97602510 @1802510/ <h> Cancer , Lactate , Fat and How to Decrease all Three <p> ( CC BY-SA 2.0 ) by Shawn Henning/Flickr <p> Most of us know that exercise has many benefits , not the least of which is preventing cancer . Although many reasons have been proposed for this effect , it has n't  been clear until now exactly what the link was . I do n't  know about you , but for me , actually knowing what is happening when I am doing something that is important for me , like exercise , makes doing it a whole lot easier ! <p> Based on the findings of a new study , researchers speculate that a sedentary lifestyle , combined with too much sugar in our diets , may lead to an excessive accumulation of lactate , thus setting the stage for cancer . <p> The study , " Reexamining cancer metabolism : lactate production for carcinogenesis could be the purpose and explanation of the Warburg Effect , " published in the journalCarcinogenesis , describes how lactate plays a critical role in the process of how normal cells become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the body . <p> Led by Inigo San Millan , director of the Sports Performance Department and physiology laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulders Sports Medicine and Performance Center , the research suggests that lactate is specifically involved and necessary for the stages that follow the formation of the cancerous cell . These stages are the process by which new blood vessels form inside the tumor , the cancer cells ability to elude the bodys immune response , and cell migration with metastasis and the cells metabolism . <p> " With this paper , we open a whole new door for understanding cancer , showing for the first time that lactate is not only present , but mandatory for every step in its development . " <h> Lactate and the Warburg Effect <p> Lactate is produced by our bodies in response to aerobic exercise and serves as a fuel for the muscles , delays fatigue and prevents injury . <p> This crucial role of lactate in cancer cell formation may explain why people who exercise regularly are at a lower risk of developing cancer . In athletes and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn lactate into an energy source , thus stopping it from accumulating in excess . <p> During strenuous exercise , our breathing rate increases to deliver more oxygen to the working muscles . At some point we reach a limit for our oxygen uptake and energy unitization , and we go from aerobic to anaerobic mode , where we need to make lactate from a chemical that is already stored in our bodies . This conversion will give us energy for one to three minutes of intense activity . <p> High-level athletes and people who work out regularly are better able to utilize the lactate they produce and less goes into the bloodstream where cancer cells can utilize it . <p> In the early 1900s , Nobel laureate Otto Warburg noticed that cancer cells consume a lot more glucose than normal cells . The Warburg effect refers to the fact that cancer cells undergo more breakdown of sugar and produce more lactate compared with normal cells . <h> Lactate and the Formation of Sugar <p> Muscular activity requires energy . This occurs in our muscle cells by the breaking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . <p> The sugar , in the presence of adequate oxygen ( aerobic ) is broken down into readily available energy . If there is not enough oxygen ( anaerobic ) or not enough sugar , then the lactate that was formed is taken up by the liver , where it is converted to a small amount of a sugar and released into the bloodstream for energy that the muscle cells can use for a while until either more sugar is available , the muscular activity stops or the energy runs out and the muscles stop functioning . <h> What This Means in Terms of Exercise <p> Now that we know that we must rid ourselves of excess lactate by exercising , and we want to decrease our body fat , how do we go about doing that ? <p> Aerobic exercise with the goal of decreasing body fat should be done for longer than half an hour , because we first need to deplete the available primary energy source creatine phosphate and glycogen before significant fat metabolism can occur . It is during a long duration of moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Exercising for longer than this 30 minutes shifts the primary energy sources that are metabolized from sugar to the fatty acids in the stored fat that is under the skin . <p> If you are going to combine weightlifting , or any type of high-intensity training , with aerobic activity do the lifting or HIIT first for about 30 minutes because this will maximize later fat-burning efficiency . <p> If you are wondering how intensely you need to work out , a good sign is that you are sweating . <p> In summary , it will be helpful to exercise for 45 minutes to an hour , do enough to be sweating a fair amount , and do it consistently for the rest of your life . 3780 @qwx863780 <p> In my personal case the greatest discovery was the link between regular exercise and good mental health ( or skip the exercise for too long and fall into the abyss of depression or anxiety , your choice ) . <p> Super interesting !

@@97602518 @1802518/ <h> Using a Gastric Balloon Can Lead to Substantial Weight Loss <p> Elipse Balloon , via the Allurion website . <p> It has been known for a long time that a mass trapped and partially blocking the gastrointestinal system will cause weight loss . A gastric balloon is basically an inflatable space-filling medical device that when temporarily inserted into the stomach will result in weight loss for the individual . The likely mechanism of action is that it makes it easier to adhere to a low-calorie diet by inducing feelings of satiety or fullness . <h> Where Does this Device Fit into the Weight Loss Spectrum ? <p> Think of people and their weight on a spectrum . Ideally , we have the person who has remained in their proper weigh range for their life with the occasional weight gain and loss for women during pregnancies.They have usually done this with adequate activity and a reasonably healthy diet . <p> Then we have the person who has slowly gained weight with aging , but uses more aggressive diet and exercise to either return to an acceptable weight or repeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanently into the obese category . <p> Then we have the person that is not successful with adequate diet and exercise programs who becomes obese and does not lose the weight . This is the best candidate for a gastric balloon . <p> Finally , we have the individual who becomes very obese and can not , for various reasons , do much about it . This final example is a candidate for weight loss surgery and possibly the gastric balloon . <h> Gastric Balloons <p> Gastric balloons have been in use since the early 1980s to provide a weight-loss option in selected patients when diet and exercise have failed and surgery is not warranted or desired . However , using the traditional gastric balloon is not innocuous . The insertion procedure is costly and has the potential for serious complications . <p> Most gastric balloons have required endoscopy and anesthesia for placement , and all have required endoscopy and anesthesia for removal . There have been incidents where the patient has not come back for removal or the balloon has migrated into the intestines , causing severe complications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 27 to 45 range . After placement , the balloon remains in the stomach for about six months , and is then removed . The weight loss during this balloon therapy with diet and exercise counseling averages about 18 kg ( 39.7 lbs ) . In obese individuals with metabolic syndrome , the weight loss achieved after 6 months of balloon therapy combined with diet and exercise counseling is about 15 kg ( 33 lbs ) compared to 5 kg ( 11 lbs ) with diet and exercise counseling alone . <h> There 's a New Gastric Balloon in Town <p> New research on a gastric balloon has been presented at this years European Congress on Obesity . This new balloon can be swallowed by the patient and does not need to be removed . It has been shown to be a safe and effective way to induce substantial weight loss . <p> Dr. Roberta Ienca of the Sapienza University of Rome , Italy , and colleagues evaluated the efficacy and safety of the new ElipseG Balloon from Allurion Technologies and found it to be safe and effective . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obese individuals ( 29 men and 13 women with a mean age of 46 years ) with BMIs from 30-45 ( mean BMI 39 ) who had previously failed to lose weight by diet alone and who had refused treatment with other balloon designs . <p> The balloons were swallowed under fluoroscopy to make sure they were in the correct location and then filled with 550ml of liquid . The balloons remained in the stomach for 16 weeks , after which they spontaneously opened , emptied and passed from the stomach and were excreted . The patients were observed every two weeks . <p> During the final month of treatment , the patients were put on a very low calorie diet to enhance weight loss and maximize the results to increase patient satisfaction . Once the balloons were excreted , patients were transitioned to a Mediterranean style diet for weight maintenance . <h> Results <p> After 16 weeks , the mean weight loss was 15.2 kg , mean percentage excess weight loss was 31 percent , and mean BMI reduction was 4.9 . At the 4 , 8 and 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 8.9 kg and 11.5 kg was recorded . During the last month on the very low calorie diet , a mean weight loss of 3.7 kg was recorded , similar to that seen between weeks 4 and 8 . <p> There were no serious adverse events . There was some nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain but these were either self-limiting or resolved with medication and did not return . The researchers also reported seeing significant measurable improvements in patients obesity-related health problems such as diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol and metabolic syndrome . <p> Dr. Ienca concludes : <p> The Elipse Balloon appears to be a safe and effective weight loss method . . . Because the Elipse Balloon does not require endoscopy , surgery or anesthesia , this may make it suitable for a larger population of obese patients not responding to diet/lifestyle treatment ; and also for use by a variety of clinicians nutritionists , dietitians , and internists who currently do not have access to or are qualified to fit endoscopic or surgical weight loss devices . Furthermore , the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant cost savings . <h> Discussion <p> This new gastric balloon design seems to address the limitations and problems associated with the prior generations of gastric balloons . The ElipseG balloon is enclosed inside a capsule and is attached to a thin , flexible tube long enough to remain outside the patient 's mouth once it is swallowed . After swallowing , it can be slowly filled with up to 600mL of liquid in less than ten minutes without the use of anesthesia . When the filling process is complete , the tube is removed by pulling it back out through the patient 's mouth . <p> This balloon is designed to remain in the patients stomach for three months , at which point a self-releasing valve opens , allowing it to empty . Because the empty device is small , flexible , and smooth it soon passes out of the stomach and is excreted through the gastrointestinal tract . In past balloons most complications occurred after the three-month point . The patients can return for another treatment if they desire additional weight loss . <p> At this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States , but I think it is only a matter of time before it does . 3780 @qwx863780 <p> These things are so insanely UNNATURAL I can not get behind these things . Diet and exercise are truly the only things I could ever recommend to people in regards to how they can get to a weight they 're comfortable and healthy at ! <p> I understand your viewpoint . Think about it from a doctors perspective . We may have patients that because of their excess weight , are vulnerable to , or already have , serious health complications . If these patients are not willing to , or can not do your diet and exercise program even though we have suggested that , should we abandon them ? That 's why devices like these were invented and bariatric surgery was designed . Theory is one thing , but reality is another . <p> Janis ! <p> I know you read my reply to GiGi .

Treatment should involve a spectrum of moralities such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least we were compassionate and tried to offer our best . <p> When someone reaches my age , its more difficult to lose weight .

The Dr. , told me that I could die , our son could die , or both of us , my son and I could die if my blood sugar did n't  go down . After our son was born , the Gestational diabetes went away .

One of my best friends , Carole , had lap band surgery 6 years ago . Carole is a former girlfriend , and we remain close . <p> She chose lap band surgery to lose about 30 vanity pounds . If she never lost the weight , she was still a bombshell . Gorgeous , and a delightful human . Her fiance at the time pushed her toward the surgery . <p> After a couple of years the device did something it shouldnt have ( I 'm still not sure exactly what ) , and thinks went very bad .

I 'm one of just a few friends who are still connected with her . she has the body of a little old lady and not too much hair . <p> A lap band is quite different than the procedure you shared , which I had never heard of until i read this earlier this week . But as I chewed on it though , its the mentality of searching for a fix that i am against , more in support of the mentality of changing the culture(s) and the food system which led us here . <p> The procedure you write of may well be safe , and may save lives . What though , and this is a sincere question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> One of the reasons I have drifted away from writing about and commenting too much on weight loss is that I have been witness to what goes wrong when we seek the fix and not the change . <p> Thank you for sharing your experiences here .

Perhaps it has come a long way historically , but I suspect that the obstacles the field faces now are vastly different than in prior times . One would think that society would have evolved in all this time to have taken a course to help itself rather than make living a reasonably healthy life such a difficult task . In that world , we would not even be taking about all these strange procedures that have become commonplace . SMH

Behaviors , such as meditation , that can help us relieve stress let us think more clearly and thereby make better decisions about our health and fitness challenges in the moment . <p> That is called using willpower . In addition to meditation , getting adequate rest can also enable you to not get stressed so easily . Also , as you meditate , it does n't  hurt to visualize your goals , and when you finish , write them down . <p> For those of you who find meditation difficult , all the better , because the training you put into being able to meditate is time that you will be developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will strengthen your resolve to do it . <p> Meditation can take many forms . Running for all these years has been a moving meditation for me . This consistency was my willpowers best friend and went a long way to enable me to create an overall health and fitness routine that I could maintain . <h> Using Willpower Helps Develop it <p> It might be easy to assume that I have been able to run most every day because of the willpower I was born with , but the truth might really be that the running actually developed , trained , and strengthened my willpower . Once I did this , it applied to all areas of my life . <p> Willpower and self-confidence have a lot in common . Both can be developed and made stronger by being successful with repetitive challenges . Each time you succeed with using willpower , it will become easier to use it the next time you need it . <p> Try not to make your goals so large that even the strongest willpower will not be able to get you there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievable , just not so small that they are actually insignificant . This is especially true if you have medical issues that you are trying to improve or the potential for serious medical problems that you are trying to prevent . <p> Think of combining your willpower with other peoples will . There is strength in numbers and willpower is no different . Having others who you work out with or eat healthy with can be very helpful , especially at those times when you feel less inclined to do an activity or to pay attention to what you are eating . <p> Some think that our willpower is a limited resource . If it is , consider how most anything we have has limits . If we exercise , we need to rest our muscles and allow for recovery . If we are emotionally spent , we need time for that to recover also . <p> Being aware of these limits can give us the power to work within them . Obviously , we can assist our willpower by planning ahead for our meals and exercise , and doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have to resist . <p> Think of willpower as a journey moving in a direction toward a goal . Know that any journey can have setbacks . As long as there is overall movement in the forward direction , the journey is still active and so is your willpower ! 3780 @qwx863780 <p> Moving meditation . I like that . I always thought of mine that way . I did n't  know if I had to be in a dark room clearing my thoughts , or if no , it could be on a long walk or even while reading a book . I suppose its possible . I like to think about willpower . <p> This is great advice . Meditation has helped me " recenter " myself and " refocus " on what really matters . I see willpower as a combination of self-acceptance , acknowledgement of my strengths and weaknesses , specific and realistic goals , and a sincere desire for improvement . Willpower works better when combined with peacefulness , which is where meditation becomes very useful . : - ) <p> " Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goal . " <p> I think conceptualizing willpower this way helps a lot . It makes the process of gaining more willpower a long term venture , instead of a temporary thing . The " journey " aspect to willpower reminds me I am making progress when I 'm tempted to think Im making none at all . <p> Great advice Dr J ! I agree that starting small and teaming up with others is an enormous help . Luckily will power and self discipline are two things I have a lot of ! On an interesting note I have always found it.fascinating that people who like to overeat or drink too much always like company . So the reverse is true too , I guess it makes them feel better about their choices or lack of willpower ! <p> Support definitely helps ! ! ! ! I think it is important though to mention as you wrote eloquently that it has to come from within too you have to get the mind in order &amp; back it up with support AND your own internal push . Some people hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those that do n't  like willpower .

@@97602550 @1802550/ <h> Set Point Theory and Weight Loss : New Ideas <p> ( CC BY-SA 2.0 ) by Ian Dick/Flickr <p> The original set point theory states that the body maintains its weight and body fat level under the control of an internal regulatory mechanism . Therefore , strictly according to this theory , everyone has a set point that we have basically no control over , and our body is biologically and genetically determined to weigh within our set weight range . <p> Set points vary for each person . Some people have a high setting , meaning they tend to have a naturally higher weight as a set point , while others have a low set point and therefore a naturally lower body weight . <p> Scientists estimate the average person has a set point range of about 10 to 20 pounds , meaning at any given time , there is a 10- to 20-pound range at which their body will be comfortable and not resist attempts to change . <p> For me , and other people who are at the weight they want to be , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body will find ways to increase our metabolism and mitigate the damage . Unfortunately , most of the press about set point theory focuses on the aspect of weight loss and maintaining that loss . <p> As hard as it is , many people do manage to lose weight initially , but than that nasty set point starts taking over , making it even harder for us by adjusting our appetite and metabolism , and not in the directions we want . Our appetite increases and our metabolism decreases . This can lead to binge eating , frustration and our giving up . After all , why try to lose weight when its impossible to maintain our hard fought losses . <h> Is This All Really True ? <p> Some research has shown that our metabolic rate does decrease after we lose weight , possibly even lower than that of a similar-sized person who has never been overweight . That means that a formerly obese person has to eat less or do more daily exercise to maintain the same body size . <p> Ghrelin , the hunger hormone , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually have higher levels of ghrelin , so they are going to feel like eating more often . <p> Exercise needs will increase after weight loss if we are going to maintain the loss . The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that people should get 150 minutes of exercise per week to maintain good health . But people who are trying to lose weight or maintain weight loss may need 250 minutes or more to slim down and keep the weight off . <p> Finally , data does show that 80 to 90 percent of dieters do regain lost weight or even more within a year after losing it . <p> Many researchers do not believe in the set point theory . Studies have concluded that even though eating less and losing weight does produce a lower metabolic state , the effects are transient , and the metabolism returns to normal once we start eating at a consistent level again . <h> Is There Evidence for a Set Point that Regulates Human Body Weight ? <p> There is some evidence for the idea that there was an active biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product of our acquired unique genetics , heredity , and the environment . <p> The body seems to respond more to weight loss than to weight gain . <p> However , our standard western diet has a large effect on negating this regulation . When this happens , the body 's original set point changes due to our excessive intake of calories . Because of this abundance , a prior set point is not enough to prevent weight gain , and we must become active in making our own healthy decisions . <p> Now our environment has become the main determinant of what we will weigh . <h> Set Point Theory 2.0 <p> Just when it looked like our original set point was not going to help us anymore , research from the University of Copenhagen has demonstrated that the difficult struggle to maintain a weight loss in obese individuals can be overcome .

I love to cook and keeping track of calories is a cinch . The only time I 've struggled is when I ate addictive foods and tried that whole intuitive eating thing . Nope . Not for me . <p> I remember learning about set points in my Human Behavior class in high school ! I never considered 10-20 pounds , though . I thought it was a matter of a few !

It works , for sure , but with age and pregnancy and emotions , its not as clear cut as it used to be . <p> Based on my personal experience , I believe you can re-set your set point if you adopt a healthy ( eat real food , avoid processed food ) , volume controlled ( eat when you are hungry , stop when you 're comfortably full ) , eating lifestyle . There is always a period of adjustment which probably will be difficult , but eventually you 'll be running on " automatic , " just like you do other daily functions such as brushing your teeth . There is always hope . <p> It is all very interesting &amp; I have read about that damn set point for years ! : ) For me , I think I am NOT the norm . My body has always fought me all thru the years . Never got easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have fat cells , they shrink but want to grow again .

There is a turnover of cells , but the number seems to remain relatively constant . I think you are a good example of a person with a set point that works very hard to be in a different shape . 
@@97602554 @1802554/ <h> The incredible stretching stomach : How competitive eaters do it <p> After watching an event like the Nathans Famous hot dog eating contest or the gluttony contests in Japan , most viewers are sure to wonder what makes it possible to eat that much food without literally losing it , and maybe whether their bodies could be pushed to such extremes as well . <h> Competitive eaters are n't  built like you and me <p> A study from the Journal of Roentgenology ( that 's the study of radiation , in case you were wondering ) discovered that people who eat competitively and people who are just big eaters do n't  deal with food the same way . <p> An unnamed competitive eater and a man who liked to eat a lot were both studied with real-time X-rays while they ate hot dogs . <p> The regular guy , who was six foot two and weighed 210 pounds , ate seven hot dogs with no buns before feeling full . The X-ray showed that his stomach was full of hot dogs and that there was no real stomach stretching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was five foot 10 and 165 pounds , chowed down 36 hot dogs in 10 minutes and said he was n't full when the researchers told him to stop . His stomach swelled to hold the massive contents , making him look more like a pregnant woman than an otherwise slim man . <h> Training for eating <p> The competitive eater said he had trained himself to be able to eat mass quantities of food , and now he no longer feels hunger . <p> Pictured is a normal womans stomach on the left after eating as much as she could eat and Miyakes stomach on the right after consuming a 5,000-calorie meal of pork and curry . So perhaps oogui champs around the world have learned this same mechanism for stretching their stomachs . <p> Or it could be there 's something else special about them that makes it possible for them to eat so much . For instance in a new book by Japanese oogui champ Gal Sone ( Natsuko " Gal " Sone ) , a doctor suggests that the ability to eat tons of food without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abnormal abundance of bifidobacteria in the gut or just an amazing ability to metabolize fat . <p> Whatever the reason these superhuman eaters can do what they do , its still pretty disturbing to watch , and potentially harmful as well . Doctors say its possible the stretched-out stomach one day wont stretch back , leading to permanent nausea and vomiting that would require surgery to fix . So do n't  try this at home . 
@@97602556 @1802556/ <h> Laughter and My Trip to The Ringling Circus Museum <p> I recently met my dad at the famous Ringling Museum in Sarasota , Fl . We went to their circus museum ( they also have a great art museum ) . Dad and I were like kids at the circus as we did a lot of laughing . Laughter is something we all take for granted , but when looked at more closely , there is really a lot of serious scientific stuff going on amidst all the mirth . <h> Laughter in the Brain <p> There are several brain areas that are involved with genuine laughter . These are involved in a wide range of processes , such as promoting arousal and feeding behavior , reducing pain perception , digestive functions , blood pressure , senses such as touch and temperature , memories , making decisions , emotional reactions , visual attention , language and imagining the states of others . <p> In addition , there is also activation of gray matter that is known to play a role in analgesia , or pain relief . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activated , that releases endorphins , which are known to decrease pain and increase euphoria . <h> Laughter Can be Medicine <p> Its well known that a positive frame of mind really does make us feel physically better and actually does affect our physical state . A small study showed that a sense of humor and gentle laughing in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is associated with positive psychological functioning and enhanced quality of life . <p> Negative emotional states , such as depression and anxiety , are well known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease . Higher levels of carotid arterial compliance , which is a measure of the arterys flexibility and its ability to endure increases in pressure , is a sign of healthier arteries . Carotid arterial compliance , as a measure of general vascular function , has been shown to increase significantly for up to 24 hours after extended laughing . <p> A large-scale study of almost 21,000 men and women aged 65 or older resulted in the finding that people who never or almost never laughed had a 21 percent higher risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than those who laughed daily . <h> Laughing at Our Fitness Center <p> A new type of yoga called laughter yoga involves breathing exercises and forced laughter . The effect is more genuine laughing with practice . An initial study showed a positive increase in heart rate variability , improved immediate mood and lessened levels of longer-term anxiety after laughter yoga classes . <h> Laughing as We Age <p> A study looked at the effects of laughter therapy on depression , cognition and sleep among elderly people living in assisted living facilities and concluded that laughter therapy is a useful , cost-effective and easily-accessible intervention that has positive effects on depression , insomnia and sleep quality in the elderly . <p> Unfortunately , the trip to the circus museum was n't all laughter for me , though I 'm sure some others got a laugh out of my unintentional physical comedy . When looking for a parking spot in their very old parking lot , I managed to turn into a section that did n't  have its entrance where I thought it was , and I ended up driving over a steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't there for twenty seconds when another car drove over after seeing what I had done , and unbelievably , this man , who looked like a retired Ringling Brothers Circus strongman , got out and informed me that he was going to push the car back to safety . Which he did . We all had a good laugh when I thanked him for his kindness ! 3780 @qwx863780 <h> 9 Responses to " Laughter and My Trip to The Ringling Circus Museum " <p> Well that is a nice story in the end ! I drove over a snowbank today .. and it was n't pretty . I 'm glad you do n't  have such problems these days . Laughter is my favorite thing . Even when you do it so hard , you 're sure you 'll get sick . You never do ! <p> For me laughter is everything . I live on it , off it , around it Its my everything . I laugh " at everything " according to my husband . But that 's because I just find light in every moment and I do n't  dwell on depressing situations !

@@97602564 @1802564/ <h> Dr. J on Being Your Own Worst Enemy and Becoming Your Own Best Friend <p> ( CC BY-SA 2.0 ) by Allen Skyy/Flickr <p> Are we our own worst enemies ? Sorry , its a trick question because the only answer is yes we are ! Its really not a question of whether or not we are our own worst enemy ; that is a given . The only question is to what degree are we doing it , and how can we do it less . <p> Here are 10 ways we are our own worst enemy , and how we can turn them into being our own best friend . <h> 1 . You have Unrealistic Expectations and that Continually Disappoints You <p> Perhaps you think that if you can dream it you can do it . Well you cant . Its one thing to have a dream , and quite another to have an unrealistic fantasy . <p> We should all expect a lot from ourselves , but when our expectations are very unrealistic we will often be very disappointed . This is especially true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of others than ourselves . <p> Be optimistic , but realistic . <p> If I could have lived my childhood dream , I would have been an NBA point guard . So what if I did n't  make the cut for my middle school basketball team ? I 'm sure if I just kept practicing and hiring coaches I could have overcome my obvious physical limitations . <p> The fact is , when I was in college , I used to play basketball at lunch time with our schools head basketball coach . During one hard-fought game , I made a beautiful floating runner shot and he said , " You are a pretty good basketball player , J ! " Dream accomplished . <h> 2 . You Focus Too Much on Material Things <p> There are a lot of material things that you may want , but having them is often either out of reach or acquiring them will create more problems for you than you can handle , like crippling debt . <p> Learn to focus on the small things that can give you pleasure every moment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise you happiness , but we have the power to make the choice to be happy by appreciating the little blessings in our lives . Learn this skill so that during more trying times you can keep this important focus . <p> I had a friend in high school who was from a very poor family . One day he said to me , " The best things in life are free . " <p> The amazing thing to me at the time was that he had never heard that expression but was just coming from what was inside him when he said it . He has gone on to have a wonderful life , always having enough . <h> 3 . You Focus on What You Do n't  Have Rather than What You Do <p> Its so easy to forget about what we do have when we keep wanting more . This applies to much more than actual stuff . <p> Our health , the love we share , the friendships we have or did have with special people that came through our lives are all more important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful for . <p> There have been countless times in my career when I would start to lose sight of how lucky I am only to come across a patient who was involved in a life or death struggle , often courageously , and that has jolted me back to my very fortunate reality . <h> 4 . You are Too Hard on Yourself <p> Sure , its important to work to be the best you you can be , but you do n't  want to be so critical and faultfinding of yourself that you are never satisfied and content . This will tend to impede your progress and limit your true potential . <p> If you do this , try to find out why and where it is coming from . Perhaps your parents voice is still within you , for example . Perhaps you are this way because you are over-reacting to your parents voice . <p> Seek your own true voice between those . This can help you learn to be happy where you are even as you strive to be more . <h> 5 . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our best friend and worst enemy also , because just as our bodies do , our minds can also give us false information . Sure , its important to think about certain matters carefully , but over-thinking can get us into trouble . There are definitely times when we must learn to trust our gut feelings . <p> I feel the world will give us accurate guidance in making important decisions in our lives . Usually the messages are quiet at first , but then become more strident if we do n't pay attention . Do n't  fight against these feelings too much or you will probably make some decisions that you will regret . <p> I once read a story about the worlds laziest man . He became quite successful by inventing easier ways to accomplish things because of his laziness . <p> Sorry , this was a story . You will not be able to do this . Sure , you can find a few useful hacks , but I would n't bet the bank on making it a lifestyle . <p> Besides , it is character-building to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build your self-esteem and self-efficacy . These qualities will lead you to reach greater accomplishments than you could ever imagine . <p> Put in the hard work . It will be a gift you give yourself . <h> 7 . You Make False Assumptions and React Based on Them <p> This is a good example of our brain giving us false information . It happens to everyone . <p> The keys are vigilance and recognition . Not everyone thinks or behaves in the same way as you do . <p> Even so , it does n't mean that they are coming from a malicious place . Their desire may be for harmony , they just present it in a different way . Make sure you are separating facts from assumptions until you know the whole story . If you have to make an assumption , assume the best about others . <h> 8 . You Feel You Ca n't Ever Succeed So You Give Up Too Easily <p> Everyone fails . Its what we do about it that defines us . Of course we can not succeed at everything we attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to do . <p> What we do not want to let happen is to fail at things that we can do because we continue to doubt our abilities . When we start doubting our ability to succeed we will be doomed to failure . <p> Be realistic and see when to make things happen and when to let things happen . Knowing when success is possible and when you are putting effort into a lost cause is not an easy skill to acquire , but learning it will save you a lot of time and heartache . <h> 9 . Not Making the Choice of Closure and Moving on <p> Sometimes we become stuck in life . There is a certain safety in being stuck , but it is not in our best interest . We must learn to run from this kind of safety if we are ever going to reach our highest potential . <p> We may feel we need closure from some event to be able to move on . Understand that closure is a choice that we make , not something that is given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you closure is a foolish never-ending dead end . The same can be said for holding on to the past . Holding on to a past dream when it is impossible to have it in the present will lead to our persistent grief . <p> Why hold on to something that only hurts you ? Can the gains of others sympathy really be worth the pain ? <h> 10 . Not Accepting What You Say You Want <p> I had a friend who always bemoaned the fact that her sister never told her she loved her . One day while we were talking she admitted that her sister had recently told her that . Sensing her ambivalence , I asked her what was wrong . Her answer , " I did n't  like the way she said it . " <p> If we are wise we will take what others give us in a positive way because it will only make us feel better about them and ourselves . To reject these opportunities makes no sense . We must be open to seeing ourselves clearly and be willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , its the best way . The advantage is that we have the power of changing ourselves , while we do not have this power over others . <p> Now go in there and makes better friends with yourself ! 3780 @qwx863780 <p> If you have personal stories that you would like to share about being your own best friend , please do . <p> I have to say , I am certainly my best friend ! Sure I had days where I might be a tiny bit hard on myself , but actual FRIENDS can be a tiny bit hard on you too I mean , its called TOUGH LOVE and not everything should be sugar coated ! ; ) That being said , I am also my own amazing cheerleader ! <p> Hey ! Are you in my head ? ? get out of there . I 'm way too hard on myself but I am aware of it . I 'm often reminding myself to be nice to myself . I think I 'm guilty of all of these except for #8 Tenacity is one of my best qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream so big and just think things would come for me . Just magically . Without the work . I do n't  even know that my dreams have gotten much smaller , or its just that I realize they 're not easy . But worth it . And #6 ! Which I think has been similar for me . <p> " It 's so easy to forget about what we do have when we keep wanting more . This applies to much more than actual stuff " A valuable life-lesson , Dr. J ! Perhaps we need a " Thanksgiving day " once a month ? We work so hard accruing things , stuff , position , prestige and then what ? Seems like a good plan : be nice to others , and to yourself ! You will find more joy ( happiness ) and contentment . Thanks , Dr. J ! <p> I would love to say that none of this applies to me because I am so evolved but I think it all does . I am in a situation at the moment where I feel stuck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being the victim . However on an intellectual level I think I must be getting something out of it or surely I would make the right decision and change it . Then I over think the right decision . When others fight or flight sometimes I freeze and it is no solution !

@@97602569 @1802569/ <h> 10 Prescriptions to Get You Out of Your Comfort Zone <p> Sometimes medicine can be a bitter pill . Here are a few uncomfortable prescriptions that may be a little hard to swallow at first , but I guarantee they will make your life sweeter as time goes on . Its all too common for us to deeply entrench ourselves in our comfort zone , and as time passes that comfort zone will tend to shrink inward around us . <p> The best way in my experience to combat that is you just got ta take a deep breath and push back against that envelope before time licks and seals it around you . These suggestions may require a leap of faith , but the benefits of doing them are countless . You will have more skills , pleasure , friends , happiness , joy , opportunities , improve your mind , prevent disease , be healthier and the list goes on and on . Pushing the envelope , moving away from safety , doing the uncomfortable may be one the best things you will ever do ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ways to push the envelope is to take on a personal fear of yours and face it head on . What you find on the other side of that fear may be your greatest joy . My mom was afraid to fly , yet one day she was able to face that fear and actually fly with me in the Arrow . I 'll never forget her face after that flight as she gushed with joy over her being able to face that fear and fly with her son ! <h> 2 . Learn a Second Language <p> I recently saw a professor , now retired , who used to work at the hospital . In conversation , I asked him what he had been doing since he retired . He initially said he had no interest in going back to the hospital as he had a lot of life to live . Then he said about two years ago , he went back to school and learned Italian . Not only did that exercise his mind , but it expanded his world into a whole new culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Italy very soon . I loved listening to his excitement and optimism about his future . The benefits of learning a second language are many , including being smarter , improving our memory and decreasing our chances of getting Alzheimers Disease . <h> 3 . Talk to a Stranger <p> I cant remember all the times Ive talked to strangers . Maybe they have a support group for that , but when I think back to some that I do remember , I always have a good memory . There is an old saying about a stranger is a friend you just have n't made yet , and for me , it has been true . Just yesterday , I saw a huge truck that seemed to be in my little neighborhood by mistake . Rather than driving home , I went over and was able to give the driver the directions that he needed . I know we both felt good about that interaction . The vast majority of people are good . Talking to each other is the bridge that will unify us all to be kinder to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I used to feel positive things about people but rarely said anything to them about it . Now I make it a point to tell people how I appreciate them , or how they have helped me , or improved my life , or were kind to me . No one has yet said they did n't  like it . Often , they do n't  know what to say as it seems to be more unusual to share kindness verses criticism . Sometimes they will say something kind back . Its not a weakness to be kind , and really you will find it becomes a strength . <h> 5 . Learn a Musical Instrument or Join a Choir <p> Music is the cosmic dance . It is entwined in our DNA . I taught myself to play guitar . I 'm not very good , but I 'm good enough to always enjoy playing , and occasionally others enjoy my playing . There are many instruments , including our voice , to chose from . Some are quite easy to learn like the Strumstick , so do n't  say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments also . Drums can be very therapeutic . <h> 6 . Learn to Meditate <p> There are so many rewards that you will discover if you add a daily meditation to your life . It does n't  have to be for long , even five minutes will be enough . It will center you . It will give you an inner calmness as well as improving your mind , emotions and overall self-discipline . Talk to anyone who does meditation and they will all tell you how wonderful it is . It can be guided using a tape , or non-guided using the breath , or you can just allow it to happen by sitting in stillness or saying a repetitive mantra . The possibilities are endless . <h> 7 . Track Your Eating and Your Expenses <p> Journaling and keeping track of what you eat has allowed many people to turn the corner in their quest to be healthy and fit . Its all too easy to overeat and not be aware of it . Keeping an accurate account will be eye-opening , especially if you are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Keeping track of money is very similar to food . I was just talking to someone about this topic and she told me how , at a crucial time in their lives , she and her two children pledged to each other that they would all finish their educations . She was able to save enough money to go back to school by carefully tracking her expenses , and by creating a bare-bones budget , she and her children , were all able to keep that promise . <h> 8 . Attend a Support Group <p> It does n't  matter if you need the topic or group , sometimes the group needs you . Be a supportive , caring listener . Do not be a complainer , even if that 's what others are doing . Be a problem solver . You will learn so much about others and yourself in that interesting therapeutic environment . <h> 9 . Volunteer <p> There are so many way to be volunteer . With the nearing holidays , you can help feed the less fortunate at many churches and other organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers . Schools , churches , the YMCA , all need volunteers . Most local governments have lists of needed volunteer positions in the community . It will be the gift you give yourself . <h> 10 . Try to Accomplish the Impossible <p> OK , I 've always liked the story of Don Quixote . I 'm not asking you to achieve the impossible dream , but you can set a very difficult goal for yourself and accomplish that . Perhaps you can take something that you do at a comfortable level and work to severely raise the level as a long-term goal . Choose something that will make you use all your mental and physical strength to get yourself to achieve this goal . The reward is building the internal fortitude and strength so that you know that you will be able to set any goal for yourself and then achieve it . For me it involves the martial arts . I originally did this in my 20s , then took a long hiatus . Now I am fully involved again . Its hard , as I have to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I am focused on doing my best and the feelings of my attempting this are truly rewarding . Besides I made a new BFF , Ice ! <p> There are many things I could have added to this list , but you get the idea , and you are welcome to make personal choices . Just remember to do things that get you out of your comfort zone . It will be the best uncomfortable you ever felt ! 3780 @qwx863780 <h> 7 Responses to " 10 Prescriptions to Get You Out of Your Comfort Zone " <p> Excellent . One of your best .

Does that mean its working or not working ? <p> I 'm glad you have been facing your fears . Its probably better to be awake during meditation . There are several articles online giving tips as to avoiding falling asleep . Perhaps a guided meditation will help you . <p> Facing fear is so tough . 9 times out of 10 whatever Ive been fearful of has turned out positively . I look back on the time wasted because of fear and it makes me laugh , yet I am still fearful of certain things ! <p> I was n't aware that learning a second language could reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think of Rosetta Stone ? <p> Most people often find that on the other side of your biggest fear is your greatest joy ! <p> I do n't  know enough about Rosetta Stone to have an opinion . I think that as we get older , its harder to learn a new language . However , it certainly is possible . The more we can immerse ourselves in the language , the faster we will learn it . <p> Meditating helps with the neuroplasticity of your brain . Not something we think much about , until you or a loved one has an acute brain injury , either through an accident or a stroke . Meditating can make a world of difference in that persons recovery .

" Babys got new clothes " now . <p> Depending on your skill level and experience , you may need to let your nails grow for a few weeks so you can control the slippery one during this step . If this is too difficult , you can save yourself a lot of time and nail issues by just buying a turkey fryer and throwing that baby straight into boiling oil . Do n't  worry , it wo n't look like a newborn after its cooked . <h> Gravy <p> Use every ounce of the copious remaining juicy fat that 's left in the turkey pan . If you took the easy way out and boiled the baby , just use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( whole grain died with Pilgrims ) , copious salt , and throw in that stick of butter cause your waist is a waitin . <h> Stuffing <p> Stuffing is our babys consummate best friend . To make a good one , start with butter , and a lot of it . To this add plenty of salt , white bread , or corn bread like we use in the South . If it needs more juice , just scrape the turkey pan for that . Then stuff it into the turkey with your bare hands ! <h> Mashed Potatoes or Potato Casserole <p> We like our mashed potatoes around these parts . Its an old family recipe from young family members who died happy with heart disease in the 50s in their fifties . I cant give you the secret recipe , but I will tell you , since I am alone writing this , that if you use the stuffing recipe and substitute white potato for the white flour and bread , it will be close enough for Yankees . <p> If you decide to make a potato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of marshmallows , maple syrup , brown sugar and only a half stick of butter . <h> Corn <p> This is not fresh corn on the cob ! Only use canned corn with plenty of added salt and BUTTER . <h> Green Bean Casserole <p> Start with canned green beans . These can be found very close to the canned corn that you buy . Do not dare to serve these plain with only butter . Top the canned beans with canned fried onion rings . I hear Durkee , which conveniently rhymes with turkey , makes a good one . Top with grated cheddar cheese and a slab of crumbled bacon . Just pile it on . <h> Cranberries <p> No Thanksgiving meal would be complete without cranberries . Never use whole fresh cranberries . Get the canned jelly variety . This is the only dish where butter is optional . <h> Pumpkin and Pecan Pie <p> When its time for dessert , you will really be glad you prepared your stomach for this meal . If you had your fill of pumpkin pie at Halloween , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Top with plenty of real whipped cream and/or ice cream . <p> That 's it !

But do n't  worry , if there is ever a better way to have your cake and eat it too , Dr. J will be happy to tell you about it , and in the meantime <p> Do n't  forget to use butter ! 3780 @qwx863780 <p> Also , entire sticks of butter in the turkey while its cooking ? Right . We do fail you with the green bean casserole , though . They 're hand-picked and local ones lightly steamed ! Not even any bacon or fried onions . Boo !

At least , that 's how it 's supposed to work . <p> You may be rolling your eyes right now if you 're reading this in 90-degree Phoenix or 45-degree Buffalo , but for most of the rest of us , spring is about as good as the calendar year gets , walking-wise . The air is fresh , the flowers are blooming , the greenery is vibrant . It 's time to renew our relationship with America 's healthiest and most popular form of exercise . <p> The health benefits of walking are copious and for anyone visiting CalorieLab , probably familiar : lowered blood pressure , reduced stress , increased energy , enhanced creativity , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as simple as it seems " just one foot after the other " there are a lot of elements to walking , and there are ways to maximize the positive results to be derived therefrom . <p> Fortunately , a list of these has been compiled by the University of Californias Berkeley Wellness center . Here are some of their more general recommendations . <p> Walk briskly , and for a minimum of 30 minutes a day or 60 minutes four times a week . If your schedule does n't  permit that , substitute shorter and more frequent walks , aiming for the same total walking time . <p> Wear a pedometer to tabulate your steps . Your goal should be a total of 10,000 steps a day , and the more of them you can generate in your fitness walk , the closer you 'll be to that number . <p> To speed up , take quicker steps rather than longer ones ; a greater-than-natural stride can put excessive strain on your legs and feet . <p> Vary your terrain . Try to get off the beaten path , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gravel or hiking trails than on firm , flat ground , and if you really want to spike your calorie burn , find some nice soft sand to walk on . <h> Getting the Most Out of Walking Season <p> There is also a meteorological factor in getting the most out of walking . AccuWeather and the consumer health-tech company Withings partnered to crunch a small mountain of data to determine how the climate effects our walking patterns . Depending on your age , gender and prevailing local climate , you may want to adapt your walking regimen to allow for those effects as they pertain to you . <p> Overall , our favorite temperature range for walking , as measured by average daily steps , is in the 60-69 degree Fahrenheit range , and the more our locale 's temperature varies from this moderate zone , the less we walk . At the extremes , we take 14 percent fewer steps when it 's colder than 15 degrees , and 10 percent fewer when it tops 90 . <p> But while severe cold tends to reduce our walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically all on us , guys ; women 's step numbers are affected about equally by heat or cold , whereas men 's are considerably more reduced by cold than by heat . <p> As a rule , residents of cities in the comfort range walk the most , but local topography is also a significant variable . Case in point : San Francisco and Shanghai have about the same average temperature , but in S.F. , which has so many steep hills that they had to create an entire cable car system , people take around 500 fewer steps per day than in relatively pancake-flat Shanghai . <p> And finally , unless you live in L.A. there will sometimes be rain , and when it is heavy , we walk about 12 percent less than on dry days . But in this case , it 's the women who are more likely to walk less than the men " perhaps , suggests my wife , because some men do n't know enough to come in out of it . <p> The point of all this ? That for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of walking each day , you may be unconsciously falling short of that minimum due to inclement environmental conditions . With that in mind , you may want to deliberately ramp up your activity levels on days dominated by sucky weather . <p> Lastly , the most beneficial walk is one which you do not finish by being carted to the nearest ER because you strode into a tree or off a subway platform or in front of a moving bus . And those things now happen with rapidly increasing and alarming frequency thanks to our ubiquitous appendage , the smart phone . <p> Distracted walking injuries have become so common that the National Safety Council included them in its annual injury report for the first time last year . Indeed , the number of injury incidents associated with cellphone usage has ballooned from under 500 in 2000 to more than 2,000 as of 2011 , and according to one study , they now account for about one in every ten pedestrian injuries that wind up in emergency rooms . 3781 @qwx863781 <h> 2 Responses to " About Walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Walk safely .

Well , SOMETHING would be a good place to start . <p> Try some things like having governments take actions to help prevent obesity such as introducing tough regulations to protect all of us from the marketing of unhealthy food , ensuring that schools promote healthy eating , making our neighborhoods safer , encouraging workplaces to offer and promote healthier food choices and physical activity options , and introducing taxes and subsidies to make healthier food cheaper and unhealthy food more expensive . <p> On a global level , The World Obesity Federation suggests that all countrys central health offices introduce and expand health screenings , and offer weight-loss , weight-management and treatment services to those who are already overweight or obese . <p> Of course this does n't  include the multitude of things that individuals can do with the decisions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , though by looking at the data , the people have spoken . <p> Did you know that obesity can shorten your lifespan a decade or more as well as make the last two decades of your life very physically difficult ? <h> 19 Responses to " World Obesity Levels Skyrocket From 1975 to 2014 , or How Doing Nothing Appears to be the Option " <p> Healthier foods can still be overeaten . Self-restraint and an acceptance of medically sound data is a good start . I am OK with junk food marketing .

We have no problem treating diabetes , hypertension , depression , osteo-arthritis , coronary artery disease , and sleep apnea ( all associated with obesity . ) So why are we reluctant to Rx obesity ? Treating start with addressing lifestyle . Start . That 's the FIRST step . Personal decisions , personal choices . Focus on fitness and a food log .

Thanks for the post , Dr. J ! <p> Something is right ! As a mom of two young kids , Im appalled at the amount of sugar they have everywhere now , compared to when I was a kid and was allowed sweets like .. once a week . And no screen time too ! We have four acres and we really make our kids get out there . I can start with it at home , but not sure how to help on a bigger scale . <p> Yes yes yes ! Love this " If You Want to Keep Getting What You Are Getting , Keep Doing What You Are Doing " and totally agree . The sugar and everything else being dumped into the food is horrific . I have no problem being a mean mom and banning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! <p> I like the idea of making our neighborhoods safer , so we can walk without worry . We have had several breaking in our neighborhood lately . We live in a scary county that 's full of heroine and meth . Ive been trying IF-g lately with encouraging results . Trying every day to tame the food tiger ! Maintaining , but not losing . I need to get more exercise . <p> I think the only solution will be the evolutionary one , and I detest that . Eventually , the humans that survive will be those who are " naturally thin , " as they say , people who feel no particular attraction to sugar and fat in large quantities if humans survive that long ourselves as a species . Those people who can eat a half a brownie and then not think about it any further will survive and breed kids with the same tendencies . <p> Which makes me wonder if , eventually , we wont lose the ability to techno-engineer our food , and the appetite for sugar and fat wont become adaptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . <p> I question all the time the accuracy of these overweight studies . Do n't  get me wrong . I notice more fat people around . <p> However , there is no doubt in my mind that the Lancet study did not arrive at its numbers via a statistical sample of each countrys population which could give you at the most , a 99% level of accuracy . Nor could they account for every person in every country in the world . <p> I 'd like to add that rather than bmi , body fat percentage should be measured and used . Its very simple : above 15% for men and 22% for women you are fat . <p> I see numerous folks with a " healthy range " bmi that are fitos ( fat inside and thin outside ) . <p> I strongly believe that based on BF% at 90 to 95 percent of the world population is fat . <p> I 'm sure this study is not perfect , and I realize there are other measurements besides the BMI . They probably use BMI because that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to say , your BF limits for not being fat seem a bit low . Maybe by DEXA scan , as those really find the fat : - ) <p> The fact is that I 'm deeply concerned about the viability of the worlds health system as statistically all kinds of diseases rise exponentially above my recommended BF percentages , which will eventually bankrupt it . <p> In addition , those above the limit also drain the planets limited resources which eventually will turn our planet into another Mars .

On top of that some studies claim that even if you do exercise , it does not blunt the dangerous effects of sitting . When I look at my behaviors at work , I guess I was just very lucky , because none of these studies had been done yet telling me not to sit too much . <p> Some of the negative results of being inactive , especially sitting , are increased risks of obesity , high blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , cancer , depression , and possibly Alzheimers disease and type 2 diabetes . <p> The American Cancer Society has reported , in a 14-year study , that men who sat for six hours or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost 20 percent higher than men who sat for three hours or fewer .

Our bodies were designed to move , and they decay faster when we do n't  . <p> There are times when you do n't  want to stand . If I was a neurosurgeon or ophthalmologist , or if I had to do micro-surgery such as joining blood vessels of nerves together under a microscope , I would work sitting down . If you need to use fine-motor skills when working , sitting is probably the way to go . <p> If your job requires various lengths of time to do certain tasks , adjust your sit-stand schedule to those rather than be on fixed time periods .

Most people do n't  consume enough water ( divide your weight in pounds by two for the number of ounces you should shoot for each day ) , and since the Dukan diet emphasizes water intake and forbids soda and sugary drinks , dieters who replace these beverages with water are already creating a calorie loss . <p> Why it did n't  work for me : Water intake was n't an issue for me , but omitting coconut water from my diet was a mild irritation . Coconut water is an excellent post-workout beverage : each low-calorie cup contains 10 percent of your recommended daily value of Vitamin C , 6 percent DV of calcium , 15 percent DV of magnesium and 11 percent DV of dietary fiber . Prior to the Dukan diet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was eating a ton of dark , leafy greens , whole grains , fresh fruit and vegetables items that contain much of the same nutrients as a multivitamin . <h> Exercise on the Dukan Diet <p> ( CC ) lululemon athletica/Flickr <p> Unsurprisingly , the Dukan diet requires participants to exercise daily , avoid elevators and take stairs whenever possible . The suggested routines on the Dukan diet online slimming coaching program emphasize both body-weight exercises and cardio workouts ; any fitness expert can endorse the health benefits of such a plan . I had no trouble with this portion of the diet ; I jumped right back into a daily routine , dusted off my bicycle and discovered some amazing running trails . <p> Why it works : Every diet plan ( fad or otherwise ) endorses daily exercise , and for good reason . Exercise reduces your risk of several health conditions and diseases , improves your mood and burns calories . Weight training improves muscle tone , strength and physical appearance . Exercise benefits every lifestyle , and when paired with a reduced-calorie diet , exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off your frame even faster . <h> I Lost Weight , But Not Because of the Dukan Diet <p> Back to my 6-pound weight loss . Im convinced that my weight loss on the Dukan diet was n't due to the menu ; instead , it was because I 'd stopped drinking alcohol , ate all my meals at home and began exercising daily . If every pound is 3,500 calories , I lost 21,000 calories over 21 days , or about 1,000 calories per day . That sounds like a lot , but when alcohol is in the mix , the numbers add up quickly . Cutting out my after-work glasses of wine saved me around 250 calories a day , while my daily runs and weight-lifting sessions burned 500 to 700 calories . And let 's face it : dining out three or four times a week did n't  do any favors for my daily caloric intake . <p> Can you lose weight with the Dukan diet ? Of course . You can also lose weight with Weight Watchers , or Atkins or any other diet . Your best bet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiness from your friends , family and hobbies instead of at a fast-food restaurant , quit drinking and exercise every chance you get . <p> An interesting read , and a good take on the Dukan diet . I , personally , followed the diet for several months and lost 4 stone in weight ; but that 's me . <p> My weight loss does bring me to my point though ; I do n't  think the diet was for you ! The Dukan diet ( as stated by Mr Dukan himself ) is really aimed at obese people . My weight when I started the diet was 14 st 8 lb . I 'm 5 ' 6.5 " . I was obese ! ( Just ! ) The diet worked great for me . I 'm now ( today ) 10 st 10 , have a much better diet plan , a healthy exercise plan , and I 've got rid of all the nasties that add on the weight . I 'm currently in the " consolidation " phase , and its working well . <p> However , why do I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily runs burning 500 to 700 calories . That equates to a distance of 7-10 kms . No obese ( or even heavily overweight ) person can do that sort of exercise daily . This is the sort of exercise I can manage now ! With an extra 20+ kilos of weight on my body I could barely run 4km at a slow pace . <p> If I 've got the wrong end of the stick , sorry . But I do believe in the diet , several of my friends have followed it successfully , and there is a community of people I follow on twitter that are having similar success ( as long as they manage to stick to it ! ) <p> The point about boredom is well made though . I am lucky , I have the sort of mentality that can eat roast chicken ( plain ) , and low fat yogurt daily for weeks on end , most people cant . This , more than anything , is the diets failure . Of course , you cant really blame the diet for the boring taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of weight to lose is going to be on the diet for some time , and the lack of interest should be a consideration for people up front . <p> Yes , there are different elements that you correctly described that aid weight loss on the dukan diet plan . But is n't the point of any good diet exactly that , combining all elements that will help a person lose weight but also teach them about healthy habits so that they can use them after they finished dieting ? I 'm a healthy person and I have been exercising all my life . I gained 10 kg when I moved continents and even though I was exercising and eating healthy , I was not able to move scales for more then 2 kg . My friend recommenced the dukan diet and results were amazing . I lost 7 kg , defined my muscles and because of that also lost cellulite . During my time of the diet I twisted my ankle while kickboxing and yet , my results were great . <p> I 'm a great advocate for this diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein , you cant go healthier ) and its great because it has fast results which is a massive bonus that makes people stick to the diet . <p> But as you note , healthy lifestyle is the ultimate and the only long term solution to weight problems . And if people think that going back to eating junk and not exercising will keep the scale numbers down , they really have n't learned anything through the process . <p> Marissa , All good points ! I do have to say that this diet did work GREAT for me . My situation was n't that I was obese . I am also a runner , but at age 46 my weight crept up 10 pounds over the course of a year , and I could n't lose it ! I went on a 1000 calorie a day diet and did double sets of high intensity intervals for 3 weeks , and did n't  lose one ounce . I was frustrated ! <p> With Dukan , I lost 5 pounds in attack ( yay ! ) , then my weight did n't  budge for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 5 , and after a total of about five weeks I had reached my goal . The 10 pounds are gone ! So , I 'd say your results were very much like mine . However , in my case , running and calorie restriction and even HIIT was n't working and Dukans plan did . So I will be moving on to " consolidation " , and hoping to make Dukan a way of life for good , as the lifelong plan really calls for little more than vowing to keep Thursdays as pure protein days , and staying active . Clearly diets are n't  one size fits all , but this one did work for me : ) <p> I 'm so discouraged3 weeks on Atkins , 1 week on Dukan , no weight lossI might go down a pound , them up a pound , down 2 up 2 , down 1 up 2I havent had carbs or sugar or anything in over a month ! And since January 1 no sugar , white flour , potatoes.it just wont come off ! ! ! On over-the-counter thyroid , l-carnitine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose <p> Sounds to me that you did n't  give the Dukan a fair try . Ive been on it for a while now and lost 50lbs from my heaviest of 267lbs . I was n't exercing a lot at first but now regularly run 5km twice a week and do a longer run up to 13km on the weekend . I also have been cycling distances of up to 50km . <p> Fibers is abundand if you go looking for it . What 's wrong with Brocoli or cabbage or spinach . Also your are allowed 1 tbsp of virgin olive oil everyday and can make some very tasty salad dressing if you go looking for some recipes . <p> This diets works for everyone if you stick with it to the letter and give it a chance to work and that means more then a couple of weeks . <p> Strongly recommend the dukan . First diet ive ever tried ive been very strong avoiding anything with fat in it . I did a 7 day attack phase dropped 6 kg the week following droped 2 kg nd steady since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go be carefully to only have super veggies asparigus carrots betroot . You should n't worry to much on losing weight but restating ur hole bodys way of performing . If the weight stops dropping in the cruise phase do another 5 day attack phase . The hardest part for me was the tiredness and stress levels from carb and sugar craving give it a week after the attack phase and ul be crave free . I would n't stres about your kidneys as its not a long term pure protein diet unless ur old a frail the kidneys will be fone for a few months just avoid the bottle whilst on the diet . I 've got 54 days to go by then i 'm hopeful to be at my cons phase . Goodluck pepes itll all pay off in the end . <p> This is really a silly article . Written by someone who clearly does n't  have a problem losing weight with a few life style changes , can pound out runs with no second thought and is comfortable in the gym . She also probably wanted to she 'd half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her really anyway . <p> This is effective for people who are too heavy to run , who ca n't sleep at night due to sleep apnea and whose weight is a health issue . In 4 months your life is radically transformed . <p> Comments like " I ran out of things I wanted to eat " mean you do n't  understand what a true diet is or how to make one work . <p> Marisa we will see you after 2 kids , 40 pounds that wont budge , absolutely no time to get to the gym and no energy if you did manage it . When you are in a different place you will reconsider . <p> I agree with most of the comments . I have lost almost 15 kgs and it has been a very positive experience for me . I believe that the diet effects some kind of chemical change , because no amount of calorie restriction and exercise has helped me lose weight . Also , 3 weeks on a diet can definitely be long enough . You have to approach the Dukan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boring , I must also agree . I tend to be able to eat the same food for days and months on end . So , for instance , I found a type of mustard I liked , added some sweetener to it and added it ( in very small quantities ) over almost all the types of meat I ate . This diet has worked for at least 4 people I know personally , over more than 6 months <p> I had lost the weight I needed to but gained few pounds back , now i have been trying to loose these four pounds for a long time with no results . I do n't  know what to do . Being a vegetarian I don " t have many choices or protein . Any suggestions would be great . Thanks <p> Hi , it is great to read all about the diet , I am starting today so will be looking for inspiration to make it happen for me apparently if I follow the diet I will be my goal weight of 59.8 kilos on March 15 , 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect the cronic disease I hope not as I really need to get healthy and lose the obese weight . <p> Hi there , loved your take on the dukan diet however it works fantastically for me . Two years ago I embarked on changing my life via dukan I lost 3.5 stones in just three months and then followed the consolidation phase for another painstaking 7 months I managed to keep it at bay for 2 years and recently have fallen back into old habits and put a stone back on so I am back to square one doing the attack phase . <p> I 'm 10 stones 7 lbs at the monument and am on day two of attack but already I feel my clothes are looser and I know its going to work . I 'm at the gym everyday everyday except Saturday and Sunday so I 'll let you know but this diet is fast and super effective the only downfall is the headaches from sugar withdrawal which I am now recalling in great detail . But each to thier own . <p> Perhaps dukan is not for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot quicker than most diets and results are fast . I encourage anyone to try it but do n't  cheat as it brings you back to the beginning there 's no room for hidden carbs . I 've never cheated on this diet and while in it I 've consistently lost weight every week you so need to check the foods you are eating really are carb free even things like which brand of pickled onions to use as some have hidden sugar ( carbs ) on the vinegar ! Perhaps this is why it never worked for you or perhaps doing high levels of exercise combined with high protien diet protest you to gain more muscle which is why cardio exercise is promoted so much on the dukan ! <p> Guys try it see what you make of it ! My friend lost 8 stones in 7 months and has never felt better between us we have lost 10.5 stones honestly its worth a try xxxx <p> Interesting article . Things you have to remember about Dukan are : first , it works only if you stick to exactly as prescribed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Attack or Cruise ) you have blown it . You are aiming to turn off your carbohydrate metabolism at this time . Secondly , if it has taken you several years of over-indulgence and eating exactly what you fancy and sitting around on your backside , the its fairly unreasonable to expect any diet to take it off very quickly . Thirdly , although the initial weight loss can be very fast the consolidation phase is absolutely necessary to make sure that you do n't  pile the weight back on and this phase takes time ( 11 days per kilo lost ) . And lastly , there is plenty of choice of things to eat in all the phases . You might find it restrictive if all you 're thinking about is food . Going on a diet is the best time to focus on something else work , hobbies , volunteering , whatever . Begin every meal in a state of thankfulness that you have enough to eat every day , a roof over your head , etc . It is vital to look after your health but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A couple of years back I had massive success on the Dukan Diet . I went from 19st 13lbs to 16st 2lbs in around 4 months . For a 6 ? 5 male , I was pretty impressed with the results . This was the first " fad diet " or any real diet I 'd followed to the letter . Almost 4 stone of weight loss was definitely down to the Dukan Diet , however <p> I attribute a contributing factor to my job at the time . I worked in Event Management and was on my feet for 6-10 hours a day , 5 days a week . Running around like a headless chicken on a diet like this certainly helped . My weight loss did slow down during phase 2 from 1lb one week to 3lbs the next but I still stuck with it . The funniest thing was after phase 3 I pretty much started eating what I wanted ( within reason ) and was still losing weight ! My metabolism had clearly changed and it helped me look and feel a lot better . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Around weeks 8-12 I suffered with constipation even though I kept eating the oat bran , had plenty of veggies and drank the required water . <p> 2 ) It affected my home life as I could n't indulge when the other half fancied a slice of cake or perhaps a meal with her parents and trying to explain all I could eat was Meat , Cottage Cheese , Veg and Yoghurt ! <p> Obviously either of these downsides may not affect anyone or may affect others . Either or the diet itself did work well for me and I would recommend it if you can do the daily exercise as well . <p> The Biggest Positive was . <p> I will never get to almost 20st AGAIN but I have put around 2 stone back on and still feel good . I exercise daily now and have a sensible diet . The Dukan Diet ultimately helped me trigger myself into eating better , feeling the benefits of weight loss and control my cravings . <p> Emily , I bet you are not obese and probably not even overweight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of body built ? Do n't  repeat anything , If you have just a few pounds to shift stick to veg and proteins and add extra activity such power walking ( not plain stroll but the proper brisk power walk ) or little jogging . I had very much same results when first tried Dukan , It took me two weeks to see any results at all and five weeks to shift 10 pounds of which 5 was water weight . <p> There is direct link with your starting weight , height and type of body built . The heavier you are the better results you get within very short time . The rapid weight loss during the attack phase is caused by loss of water . We all seem to know that , but do we know why ? Carbs are responsible for water retention in our bodies . The moment we stop eating them we start going to the loo much more often than usually . Therefore , when you think about it it becomes clear that if you are not that big , there wont be too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are super big then obviously the amount of water will be significantly bigger and instantly reflected on you scale . <p> Hardly anyone factors type of body built when it comes to weight loss . Endo , Ecto Mesomorph . I 'm the worst type Endomorhp , rather large frame , pear shape , whith small waist and big bum ( which I hate ) . This type is cursed with slow metabolism . I have to work and diet twice as hard as the other two types . Nevertheless , knowing all this I manage to stay on track in terms of fitness and weight management . Being aware that i 'll never be stick thin I 've adjusted my diet by upping proteins and cutting curbs as well as fat . I run at least 3 times a week and since this is more of a lifestyle than a diet , i 'd eat something naught now and again but always go back on track . Patience and knowledge are crucial in this battle . Good luck : ) <p> Hi guys and gals . I 'm 30 and have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternating pure pritein days and veg/protein days . Just eating veg and meat and non fat dairy when ever i get hungry . Is this diet suicide or should I continue till my goal weight this way ? <p> The diet worked wonders for me , I was weighing 65 kg and wanted to come down to 53kg , Im 1.68mts . It worked great , I also , like one person commented , can eat the same thing over and over , so maybe that really helped . I did n't  exercise as much , but I walked to work everyday so I took that as my workout . I do recommend it , but you must follow it strictly to see quick results . One more thing ! You must take it as a lifetime way of eating , I went back to my old ways and also gained much weight when I had my son , so now I 'm doing the diet the second time around . Let 's see if it works as well as the first time : ) <p> The Dukan diet is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will not have cravings . If you cheat , go somewhere else . You will never be hungry on this diet because you can eat as much as you want ( of the allowed foods ) no calorie counting . Take a year to lose 20 lbs ( at the start ) and stabilize so you wo n't get it back . Good luck ! <p> You need not be obese , but you have to have endurance . This is not for everyone . Everyone should chose one he can deal with . If you want coconut water , this diet is not for you . <p> A few years ago i only weighed at about 65kgs . I was n't big , but i was chubby and i hated it . My goal was to get to early 50s and I tried every single diet and nothing worked because i was already a normal weight . The dukan diet worked so well for me even though its meant for Obese people . I lost 12kgs in only 2 months which for me is incredible . Personally this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> AND , i lost that amount of weight without even excersing much at all . But i did not have ANY cheats at all , no sweeteners either , i was fully committed and it paid off . <p> I did the Dukan Diet too ! Three years ago I lost 2 1/2 stone over 5 months . I went on to stage 4 July 2014 , sticking to one protein day a week , eating treats like pizza and chocolate in moderation , and I am still down 2 stone . I love the diet . I think its important to find the right diet that works for the individual . <p> Hello Martha , How are you doing today , I understands you , They knew the happiness and good future that you will start experiencing once your Man gets back to you that 's why they want him dead in Nigeria so that you wo n't see him again and they knew He loves you alot and wants to be with you .

I thought about this saying today in relation to how destructive people feel negative self-talk is and how important it is to eliminate it or replace it with positive self-talk . <p> I 've noticed that many of the people who talk so negatively to themselves are often struggling with their health or fitness and are looking for the reasons that they are not doing much about it . Sure , they claim to want to change , and they claim to know they need to change . They may even say that they are trying to change , as if trying was anywhere near doing something ( Yoda taught me that ) . The one other thing these people have in common besides negative self-talk is that they are not acting on it , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether changing the negative talk to positive has any real effect . <p> I can be pretty hard on myself with negative self-talk . " You have no aptitude for adversity . Show some courage ! Do n't  be such a wimp ! What is wrong with you ? " are some of the many statements that I have said to myself. - Honestly , I do n't  know if negative self-talk makes a difference . I have done it plenty , yet I do n't  think it hurt me . Perhaps the reason is because my talk may have been negative , but my actions in fitness and medicine have been mostly positive , and actions speak louder than words . <p> ( CC ) Meg Wills/Flickr <p> In my opinion , its not the negative self talk that is stopping us , its the lack of positive actions in our life . The value of positive self-talk may actually be much less than we think in more serious situations . <p> In an article prepared by Julia E. Weikle on self-talk and self-health , she states : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although it will most likely be used by those who have a high internal locus of control and place a high value on health , it can also help relatively healthy people in health maintenance programs . <p> Of course , positive self-talk can help us by reducing internal stress , but negative conversations with oneself can also be quite instructive , because negative thinking can lead to our recognition of what problems we have in our lives . <p> " Negative thinking , then , is the most productive , the most useful , and the healthiest thinking to adopt when risk is high , " wrote Ruth Dailey Grainger in " The Use and Abuse of Negative Thinking , " which was published in the August 1991 issue of the American Journal of Nursing . <p> Harriet B. Braikers article " The Power of Self-Talk , " published in the December 1989 issue of Psychology Today , states , " It might be better to call it logical and accurate .

" <h> Its Really All About Action <p> Why do we keep looking for that little needle in the haystack when its the size of the haystack that 's our problem ? It seems to me that it is not so much our words that are the problem , its our lack of doing anything about our harmful situation that 's hurting us .

Some people do respond well to shouting and berating pro basketball players being a good example . Other people improve faster when given unconditional support . For those people , being yelled at , either by oneself or by an authority figure , wont have the desired effect . Any change will be out of fear or aversion , and probably wont last . I would guess most people need some mixture of positive and negative reinforcement . <p> Though I 'm 67 and give myself lots of negative talk , it seems I cant get the 45 years of my mothers negative influence out of my head .

If you cant stop your mothers negative voice by yourself , and you truly feel it would be good if you could , please consider seeing a therapist who can assist you with this . <p> Dr. J , growing up playing hockey , I often heard positive and negative reinforcement often . The coaches that would give me positive reinforcement usually got the best result . I had one coach tell me our lines nickname was " Hollywood " because we were the stars of the team . : - ) Conversely , I had a coach once tell me I would never be much more then a 1-2 shift a period player . Hearing that hurt , but it did n't  work the way it should , which was motivate me to work harder and prove him wrong . I accepted it , and never quite panned out to be the hockey player I was capable of being . <p> The same goes right now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remind myself that my goals are achievable , after a good workout I congratulate myself , but never do I get too egotistical to forget that this is an unforgiving sport . The best coaches and motivators are the ones that let the players and athletes motivate themselves . <p> " it 's not the negative self talk that is stopping us , it 's the lack of positive actions in our life " how come I have n't thought of that ?

It was Wansink , noted Cornell professor of nutritional science and sort of the Neil deGrasse Tyson of diet and nutrition , who published a study that found that restaurant diners tend to order and consume more calories when their waitperson is overweight . <p> And now comes another study from Wansink , which indicates that there are similar motivations to overeat woven into your kitchen environment at home . <p> Some of these dietary hazards are well documented and no longer news : for example , leaving bags or boxes of snack or junk food out on kitchen counters , clearly visible and available , rather than tucked away in cupboards . <p> But Wansink has stumbled over a heretofore hidden one : a messy kitchen . It appears that those who are unable to maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits . <h> More Chaos Leads to More Unhealthy Snacking <p> Wansink 's experiment in this matter involved 100 women , half of whom were assigned to write about a time when they felt in control , and half to write about a time when they felt out of control . They were placed , one at a time , in a kitchen to do the writing . The kitchen was either pin neat , or cluttered with dirty dishes , old newspapers , mail and the like . The writers were also provided with identical selections of snacks in the form of unlimited crackers , carrots and cookies . <p> The condition of the kitchen did n't affect the consumption of the crackers or carrots , but the messy version sent the cookie intake spiking , especially in the case of the writers given the out-of-control theme . Among that group , the messy-kitchen women consumed twice the amount of cookies as their neat-kitchen counterparts . The in-control writers ate healthier snacks overall , but again , those in the cluttered kitchen were more cookie prone . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that enable people to relax their sense of self-discipline in other areas , such as eating and nutritional choices . But these external cues , they noted , could be muted or amplified depending on the individual 's sense of self-control . <p> This was n't the first study of environmental ambience and eating behavior to suggest that a messy setting lowers people 's inclination to reject unhealthy food choices , but this was the first to take the question into a typical kitchen , where most eating behavior takes place , and to introduce the element of feelings of control . <h> Clean Your Space to Make Healthier Choices <p> The implications are fairly clear , and it 's not hard to come up with plenty of common situations that involve physical disarray , emotional stress , and unhealthy food . Wolfing down whatever is handy amid the chaos of getting the kids ready for school and yourself ready for work ; assembling an evening meal in a kitchen with still-unwashed breakfast dishes and people needing help with homework ; grabbing something edible , probably from a vending machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through lunch in your clutter-strewn cubicle or office . <p> The takeaway seems to be that you may not be able to limit the stress of an active daily life , but you can at least try to cope with it in an orderly setting , and that this is significant when it comes to healthy eating . <p> In practical terms , this could mean taking your lunch away from your immediate workplace , or at least keeping your desk free of work-related litter and your office organized , or keeping the kitchen countertops clean and uncluttered and the dishes in the dishwasher , or imposing a ban on extraneous activities in the kitchen during meal preparation . <p> Tidying up your immediate environment may require some effort , but that 's actually a bonus : along with taking control of your surroundings , and hopefully also your eating habits , you work off a few calories in the process . <p> In a word : neat . 3781 @qwx863781 <h> One Response to " When it Comes to Limiting Excess Calories , Neatness Counts " <p> I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came first , the messy kitchen or the messy personality .

@@97602681 @1802681/ <h> Is There a Best Time to Run or Exercise ? <p> ( CC ) lululemon athletica/Flickr <p> Ive been a runner for many years . Strapping on the shoes , donning the appropriate weather running attire du jour , soir or nuit , I never gave it much thought as to when I was running , but more that I just was running . There has been some debate as to whether there is a best time to run or exercise . Most of the studies that have been done have looked into running at night , in the late afternoon and evening , or in the morning . <h> Running at Night <p> I have heard people say that they feel that they run faster at night . I can attest to feeling the same , except when I would shut my eyes and pretend that I was asleep . <p> While in medical school , because of how early I was required to be on surgical rounds , I would often run in the dark , early morning hours . During the cold winter months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat and facial covering , I felt like a ninja , nearly invisible in the darkness . I would be very careful to alert the rare other night runner as I approached so as not to startle him or her . <p> I had a neighbor who liked to run at night in the hot Florida summer who was , shall we say , different . Once he told me about how he would run , only wearing the darkness of night as his cover at 2:00 a.m . He had run a 2-hour , 40-minute winning marathon time , so there was no denying his running ability , though I admit I did question his sanity for running in the neighborhood naked , no matter the hour . <p> Research suggests that we do not really run faster at night , but that we only imagine that we are running faster . Our brain perceives our speed based on incoming visual cues from our surroundings . One such speed cue is called motion parallax , where nearby objects seem to move by more quickly than objects that are further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of linear motion , our brain can compare the relative speed of objects both nearby and far away , but at night , our limited view in the darkness makes us unable to see faraway objects , so our only gauge for speed are the barely visible nearby references . <p> I have the same experience of feeling the plane is moving faster when I fly close to the clouds and have them as a nearby reference . <h> Running in the Late Afternoon and Evening <p> Some research does indicate that evening workouts are actually more energy-efficient , powerful and allow for higher endurance compared to morning workouts . This is because of our normal circadian rhythms , and that our core body temperature peaks in the evening . This loosens up muscles and makes them more available for improved movement . Similar research suggests that lung function , alertness and flexibility are also enhanced in the evening . Other studies confirm that evening exercisers perform better on physical performance tests , including aerobic capacity , endurance , reaction time and strength . All of this combine for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , usually meaning between 4:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m . <h> Running in the Morning <p> There are many benefits to running in the morning . Research shows that morning exercisers are more consistent with the workout regimens than those who work out in the afternoon or evening . In addition , morning exercise seems to promote better sleep quality than afternoon or evening exercise . <p> Initially in Florida , I ran after work or even during the lunch hour . Eventually , however , I converted to being a morning runner , and for the most part I stay there to this day . I really feel its a great way to start the day awake and alert ; it also burns fat more efficiently because I do not " break-the-fast " with breakfast before running and allows me to be consistent , as our day can often get in the way of our best-laid plans to work out later . <h> State Dependency <p> There is also a condition called " state dependency " or " state-dependent learning , " where the condition or environment in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember the material . Its too bad that I was n't able to take my medical school examinations at midnight with a strong cup of black coffee or I would surely have been a straight-A student . <p> It looks like the principle of state-dependency can be applicable to physical actions as well . A study was done to determine whether metabolic and cardiorespiratory adaptations to exercise training are greater at a particular time of day . Twenty-seven subjects performed cycle ergometer tests in the morning and in the afternoon after a six-week training schedule . Ten subjects trained regularly in the morning , seven subjects trained in the afternoon and 10 did not train . Compared with each other , subjects who trained in the morning had relatively higher post-training thresholds in the morning , while subjects who trained in the afternoon had relatively higher values in the afternoon . <p> " This is evidence of circadian specificity in training and supports the notion of planning physical preparation to coincide with the time of day at which ones critical performance is scheduled , " wrote the authors . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day that you train . So if you 're training for a race that starts in the morning , for example , its a good idea to do the majority of your training in the morning . <h> Conclusions <p> Other than the usual line that anytime running or exercise is better than no time running or exercise , my suggestions are these : <p> If you are interested in maximizing your health and fitness , do it in the morning . <p> If you are interested in maximizing your athletic accomplishments , do it in the late afternoon or early evening . <p> If you are looking for state-dependent performance , drink a cup of strong coffee and do it at midnight ! 3780 @qwx863780 <h> 28 Responses to " Is There a Best Time to Run or Exercise ?

Although the majority never or rarely dieted , 92 percent reported being conscious of what they ate .

That 's the thing its really hard to get across that I do n't  have some sort of golden willpower . I just really honestly like steamed vegetables and baked chicken breast .

That 's what I do ! A ten minute capnap is better than any rush from sugar or coffee . No hangovers and its truly replenishing ! <p> For the most part , I 'd fit into that category , but when I turned 45 , I did buy a scale and I get on it every morning . It does n't  fluctuate much at all , but I do sort of mentally tell myself to eat light when it goes above 130 .

I guess that counts as " only became aware of their weight at older age . " I definitely fit into the " no guilt " thing , as well . Listening to people connecting food to guilt is one of those things that makes me feel like an immigrant from Mars . <p> That is very interesting ! Ive been mindlessly slim my whole life .

" I imagine you were a little skeptical of whether that was true . Most of us have much more experience with receiving gifts as the center of attention while we are children so its not hard to understand why we question the phrase . <p> The first time I can remember having the experience that its better to give than to receive was when I was still very young . I traded my very expensive large metal Dinkey Toy truck for my best friends 3-inch plastic rocket ship . I really liked giving that truck to my friend in exchange for that little rocket ship , but my parents were not too happy about that deal I made and punished me . I did n't  like receiving that ! <p> Have you ever worked really hard on making a gift for someone ? Do you recall your anticipation of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing their joy ?

The family did not have much money but did have a lot of love for one another . My friend stayed up all night Christmas Eve making gifts for her parents and four younger siblings . She really embodied giving is better than receiving . It snowed that Christmas morning , and there were deer in the yard . <h> Giving Really is Good for You <p> Psychologists have long studied giving and receiving and looked at happiness and the benefits of altruistic behavior .

I do n't  like that game . <p> Nonetheless , we were informed that we would be playing it at the party . I decided to wrap a very pricey statue that I had been given that I did n't  really like as my contribution .

We have a large complex brain , but we have an animals body . Our brains can think , reason , and make important decisions to help us . Our bodies are controlled by a complicated neuro-endocrine system of numerous chemical transmitters and hormones . How we work with this throughout our lives will determine our health . <h> The body is the problem <p> So what is the role of our body and its systems ? In the beginning , in utero , we were fed 24/7 as our bodies developed with our mothers diet . After birth , we were fed numerous times through the day and night as our bodies craved nutrition . Eventually we learned and adapted to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our caretakers . <p> For most of us this morphed into the common three-meals-a-day routine , breakfast , lunch , and dinner . Our bodies learned this schedule and signaled hunger three times a day . As we grew and became independent , we did not stick to this childhood schedule , but rather began to eat on an irregular and inconsistent routine . We became driven by frequent food availability and unhealthy processed food . <p> Eventually , no longer confined to a schedule of hunger , feeding , and satiety , our bodies began to continuously send hunger signals , and we began to reflexively eat . Add to this the addictive nature of our distorted food supply , and we have trained our bodies to be hungry all of the time . We no longer know when we feel real hunger .

Consider using photos . You need to understand how much and how often you are really eating . Eventually you can transition to portion control , but you are not ready for this maintenance technique yet . <p> Start to regain normal control by eating on a consistent regular schedule .

The entire party of six were not able to be seated for more than an hour after their reservation time , although Emily noticed that some of Dan Tanas " six-person " booths had been vacated several times . When asked , the maitre d said that he was waiting for a table at which to seat them because they were a " larger group " ( tapping at the cousins belly , tactfully ignoring Emily ) .

His company is now offering expanded frames , which afford an extra 1-1/2 to 3 inches per side . These supersized " cluster units " are especially popular in employee lunchroom facilities and truck stops , Padgitt notes .

I found the back of the booth to be uncomfortably CLOSE to the fixed table . I guess the large booth to table distance is not uniform at all Claim Jumpers . There is no way a heavier person would have been able to sit there . <p> Personally I think those who are thin ( I have been very thin my whole life prior to my two kids and I 'm working on getting back there ) should show a little compassion for those who are overweight .

In any case , Grant is now losing weight , and Emma gaining it , and both are happier and healthier , The End . <h> The moral , perhaps , of the story <p> But there are two points worth mentioning that can be drawn from this anecdote . First , no person is an island , even those who are nearly the size of one , and the health being harmed by your gross overweight and self-indulgence may not be yours alone , but also that of a loved one . <p> Second , this would seem to have some bearing on the question of whether overweight parents tend to produce overweight children because of their common genetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , if " fat " genes were running the show , Emma would have responded to stress by eating , as Grant did . <p> Some families may indeed be afflicted with a genetic predisposition to overeat .

The point is that parents who do not take their physical health seriously shouldnt be surprised if their offspring adopt the same attitude . <h> When stuffing your face , lower your pace <p> If Why We Eat can play as significant role in weight gain as What We Eat , so , it seems , can How We Eat .

Indeed , in one study , a group of rapid eaters packed away an average of 646 calories per meal , while a slow-eating group polished off just 579 . <p> And one more statistic : 11 minutes .

However , it does not follow that this means they will COPY their parents behavior . So , in the case of food , if the parents have positive habits surrounding food , the children will follow this . However , if the habits are negative , the child stands a chance of adopting negative habits , although not necessarily the same ones as the adult .

The timeless theme is that starving people will break the law , if need be , in order to get enough food to survive . The twist is that we may be entering an era where a dangerously obese people will break international law , if need be , to avoid the kind of food that is making them obese . <p> Let 's put this in the following current global context : Every population everywhere on earth is getting fatter . We know this from a megastudy of 1,698 individual studies of adult obesity involving 19.2 million people in 186 countries over 40 years . The results , published just recently in The Lancet , came to precisely that conclusion . <p> Since 1975 , obesity rates have risen in every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as Somalia and Angola , and even North Korea , where the obesity rate soared from 1.6 percent to 2.8 percent even though you practically have to be running the country to be downright fat . <p> The average adult human is now three times as likely to be obese as was the case 40 years ago . In some places the increase has been fairly breathtaking . China , for example , went from an obesity rate of just 0.5 percent to a hefty ( no pun intended ) 8 percent now . But the runaway leading population in the obesity derby is the one scattered among the 20 Pacific island countries and territories , which include Samoa , Tonga , Fiji , Micronesia and other island states . <p> According to a 2014 World Bank report , male islander obesity rates range as high as Tonga 's crippling 52 percent , and worldwide , four of the seven countries with female obesity rates of 50 percent or higher are Pacific island nations . The consequences for the health of the population have been appropriately dire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one in every five adults has diabetes , and rates spike as high as 37 percent for some islands . ( For purposes of comparison , the diabetes rate in the United States is just over 9 percent . ) <p> This is potentially calamitous , given that these islands are geographically isolated and largely impoverished both economically and medically . In practice , this means , for example , that life-saving dialysis treatments are almost prohibitively unavailable due to distance and cost , and do n't even ask about kidney transplants . <p> Everyone who has impartially studied this obesity crisis pins the cause of it on a drastic shift in the islanders ' diet , from locally grown fruits and root vegetables , livestock , and abundant seafood , to an imported western menu of packaged and processed food rich in fats , sugar and other refined carbohydrates . In short , junk food . <h> Desperate Measures <p> This is well known to the various island nation governments , which have responded with surtaxes on sugary beverages to pay for programs to promote healthy eating through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it has made a dent in the regional obesity rates or diabetes epidemic . <p> The situation is so desperately unhealthy that one island nation , Vanuatu , where the adult diabetes rate is nearly 25 percent , is considering whether to respond with equally desperate measures : a proposed wide-ranging ban on all imported unhealthy foods . One Vanuatun province , Torba , has already announced just such a ban , to take effect this month , on all imported food at tourist-oriented businesses and government events . The intention is to expand the ban to all of Torba and beyond if this limited ban stands . <p> And that 's no sure thing . The problem is that Vanuatu is a member of the World Trade Organization , and the WTO , is its name implies , promotes the expansion , not the prohibition , of world trade . <p> And while such a ban may the only thing that will forestall an avalanche of obesity-linked diseases and health problems , that may not be enough to move the WTO to suspend open-trade rules in Torba 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island communities have successfully banned tobacco imports , and the territory of Tokelau was allowed to ban imported soft drinks . But Tokelau is a possession of New Zealand , an influential WTO member . The Republic of Samoa , in contrast , is on its own . And after it banned the import of intensely fatty turkey tails , which had become a favorite local staple dish and whose popularity had risen along with Samoa 's obesity numbers , the WTO informed it that it was in violation of the rule against banning individual food imports . The Samoans had been striving for years to join the WTO , which was expected to be an economic blessing , and so , in return for being admitted therein , they agreed to lift the ban . <p> So , if tiny Torbu declares an unhealthy imports ban , will the WTO bring its muscle to bear against Vanuatu ? And if it does , will a small , isolated , marginal society on the edge of the world choose to blow off the global trade network that is its economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island societies not have a right to protect their people from a future epidemic of preventable illnesses and deteriorating health ? And is the rest of the world , the WTO included , not obligated to respect that right ? <p> The citizens of Torbu may find themselves confronting a choice between their physical and economic health . That 's a familiar dichotomy these days , expressed as , say , the choice between clean air and cheap coal , or between agricultural pesticides and costlier vegetables . In its starkest terms , it boils down to this : your money or your life . <p> Of course , so does our own national healthcare system . 3781 @qwx863781

Its a big part of why I still think that " intuitive eating " is like perfect pitch in that you either have it or you do n't  , and while you can use tools to cope with the lack , you cant make yourself have that skill if you just do n't  . <p> Thankfully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups and scales and other tools for folks who need glasses for their stomachs . <p> I like how that study takes all factors into account : genetic , environmental in utero , environmental after birth . <p> Its likely that a combination of those factors is at play in humans as well . <p> I grew up in a house where pressure was on to eat a lot , and where no real limits were put to how much one should eat . I had to completely reconstruct my relationship with food when I moved out . A little over 15 years later , its still an effort for me to keep food intake under control . I figure it will be a lifelong struggle . That being said , I am mostly successful at it , so there is hope . : - ) No one needs to be a helpless victim of overeating . <p> A physiological factor ( that might be genetic ) is the discomfort caused by overeating . Some have a very low threshold for that . One example is a good friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor ) , who feels stomach pain every time she eats slightly too much . I wish I received that kind of immediate feedback from my body <p> I agree with Janis that if you do n't  " have it " , you will have to develop tools to cope . <p> However , I disagree that a behavior observed at 4 years of age is necessarily genetic . A LOT happens in those 4 years . Just look at any study on the development of gender . : - ) <p> Epigenetics must really be in the air , that 's what D has been focusing on in his lab lately . <p> a thought provoking post . I enjoyed the humorous twist on those famous Shakespearian lines . If it were so , that some people were genetically dispositioned to eat more , it may explain the big weight differences between me and my sister though there is only three years between us <p> I read this , honestly , on the heals of eating an entire pizza , and a pint of ice cream last night . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while as I prepare for another bodybuilding competition in March . <p> There was a time when the pizza and ice cream was a weekly thing , and I could n't get enough of it . I would eat until could not swallow . So many factors working though . Partly genetic . Partly the result of riding 100 miles plus every week , and maintaining a heavy hiking , and lifting schedule . Partly due to availability and access . <p> At the end of day , as I have said before , every bite I have ever taken was by choice , as was every drink I ever drank . And so it goes <p> Happiness , I know a woman who is also quite thin ( very much a jock , too ) who remarked that she felt that the difference between being very thin and very heavy was which you disliked more : a feeling of hunger or a feeling of fullness . <p> Agreed on gender although I think that behaviors with food give such immediate physical feedback that they are probably harder to manipulate too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highly addictive cocaine-like food substances ) . I do n't  know though I could see how ones behavior with food might be influenced by a perception that parental affection hinged on it . <p> I love eating . And I can over eat just like anyone else . That being said , I only " pig out " on healthy food , which in my mind is JUST FINE . If I get a stomach ache though WHOOPS ! <p> I do feel sorry for the people in this world who binge uncontrollably . The people who do n't  even know what they 're doing until they finish 2-dozen donuts and a whole pizza . I do know people who do this too , and its a very interesting disease that is extraordinarily hard to overcome . <p> I find it utterly fascinating what scientists are able to dig into these days , we 've come a long long way in what we know about our physiology in a relatively short time . The Curies would be amazed . <p> I also wonder how climate / geography affects certain groups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns to pie this time of year , perhaps to help my Irish genes ready for a long cold winter . <p> First , I have to say that as a science type ( many years ago ) , I cant fathom the idea of studying pigs that closely yuck ! ! ! And , I 'm from a family that is very diverse as far as weigh . My sister is several inches shorter than me but probably weighs close to 2x what I do I think genetics is a factor and lack of exercise is an even bigger factor . <p> On the other I used to eat A LOT ! ! ! ! When I was heavy , I could eat forever &amp; yes , it was in the house I grew up in too that is the way we ate <p> When I lost weight but had times I let myself have a treat , there were times I would eat 7 or 8 cookies in a sitting before I learned that it was OK to treat myself on a regular basis vs. deny myself for way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I so get the binge eating disorder . I honestly think I could be that person if I had not got hold of myself early on &amp; even now not wanting to go back to unhealthy AND not wanting to have others care for me as I age <p> I completely get this and believe it . BUT also think we can learn to change our behavior and overcome the genetics . the ole ITS LOADED IN THE GUN BUT WE CAN CHOOOOOOSE NOT TO SHOOT IT idea . and echo the others too . you are funny and talented Dr J ! <p> I do n't  like being defined by numbers/genetics/or family history . Although those things play a role in my makeup , I also know that defining myself by those things may have made me think I was incapable of losing 150 pounds AND keeping it off . <p> However , as that 2009 Swedish study I wrote about recently said : the genes are hugely influenced by the environment . If a child with an " unfortunate " genetic eating disposition grows up in an environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overweight or obese . <p> Interesting study , and one hopes it will lead to more compassion and awareness that its not an equal playing field when it comes to weight control . But yeah , I agree , lots of other factors besides genes can come into play . <p> I 'm a little lukewarm about that idea . I do n't  trust us with really involved genetic manipulation were the same species that came up with the Chernobyl reactor design and the Ford Pinto . Letting us futz with the house of cards that is our DNA cant end well .

@@97602736 @1802736/ <h> To be more thinnish , try being more Amish <p> As noted here recently by Sarah White , scientists have found that there is a common gene variation that makes people more likely to be overweight , but three or four hours of moderate exercise each day can nullify the genes effect . <p> In fact , persons with the fat-inclined variant gene who got lots of physical activity were no more prone to excess weight than those without the variant , and weighed an average 15 pounds less than those with the variant who did n't  exercise . <p> The scientists suggested that those with the fat-inclined gene need , almost literally , to exercise their butts off . Unfortunately , this raises the question of just how people are expected to add three or four hours of workouts to their daily schedule . In fact , there may be at least a partial , practical answer . <p> The key is that the scientists who made this discovery did so by studying the Amish of Pennsylvania , a people not renowned for gym memberships or extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any kind . And therein lies the key to their physical fitness . <p> The Amish do not avail themselves of the labor-saving devices and electronic diversions that the rest of us enjoy . They labor . And when not laboring , they do n't  sit and gape at a video screen . They work off calories simply by hand and foot : house cleaning , gardening , walking , athletics , and so forth . <p> This may not seem like a serious exertion program , but the Amish are prodigious eaters of food as fattening as anything at KFC pork , gravy , black bread , more gravy and according to the scientists , it certainly works for them . Perhaps it will work for you as well . <h> The Amish exercise plan no shunning of electricity required <p> This does n't  mean that you have to buy a mule for transportation and cut the power lines to your home . It means that there are ways you can , let 's say , " Amish-ize " your lifestyle with potentially good results for your waistline . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drive . Probably half of their lack of excess poundage can be traced to that alone . There are surely certain places that you presently go to on a regular basis by car that you could get to without great inconvenience by bicycle . <p> This would actually give you bragging rights over the Amish , who generally travel by horse-drawn conveyance rather than bike . There 's not much calorie burn when the horse is doing all the work . <p> In addition , the Amish are largely an agricultural community . They grow their own food to a significant degree , which means they are engaged in digging , weeding , furrowing , tending , and harvesting crops to a great extent . In the process , they simultaneously get exercise , raise healthy , nourishing , low-fat produce , and save money . How can you pass up a deal like that ? <p> And you neednt make a big , onerous deal out of it . A few tomato plants , a few zucchinis , a row of snap beans and one of lettuce , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weed-free and watered on a regular basis will keep you moving . <p> For that matter , if you have a yard , you have a number of calorie-burning possibilities . Start with the lawn . If someone else currently mows it for you , discharge them and mow it yourself . And no Amish no-noes such as a riding mower or motorized push mower ; get yourself a sturdy manual lawnmower and go to it . <p> Similarly , if you currently use an electric or gas-powered hedge trimmer , replace it with a simple pair of hedge shears . Sand things by hand rather than by power tool . And so on . In general , the idea is to abandon the use of electrical or gas-powered tools in favor of manual alternatives wherever possible . <h> Exercise during chores , and no games for you <p> The same with household appliances . You ca n't be expected to hand-launder everything , for example , but eschewing the clothes dryer and lugging the clean wash into the yard and hanging the items on a clothesline can provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neednt be vacuumed ; they can just as easily be swept . The same goes for driveways , sidewalks , patios , walkways , or other outdoor surfaces that you currently just clean with the hose . <p> And finally , to repeat : The Amish do not have TV sets or video games . Study after study has linked the amount of time spent glued to the tube or console with the amount of excess weight on the gluee . The more you separate yourself from these electronic sloth enablers , the better . <p> Go for a run . Rake some leaves . Shoot some hoops . If you 're really serious , get yourself a butter churn . <p> Adopting a more Amish lifestyle could do wonders for your health and weight . And you do n't  even have to go to the prayer meetings .

Read on for our quick guide to the top 8 food allergies . <h> Food Allergy Statistics : The Big Picture <p> Food allergies affect 4 percent of adults and just under 5 percent of children under the age of 5 , according to the latest statistics from the National Institutes of Health . In October 2008 , the National Center for Health Statistics released a data brief on food allergies in U.S. children ; the following tables are from that brief . <p> here 's the NCHS 2007 breakdown by gender , ethnicity group and age range for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose 18 percent in children under the age of 18 between 1997 and 2007 that 's an estimated 3 million affected children . <p> Kids with food allergies are also far more likely to have respiratory or skin allergies than their classmates without food allergies . <p> Todays kids are also more likely to be hospitalized due to a food allergy than in prior years . <p> A closer look into the Big-8 food allergies reveals some compelling statistics . Read on for a snapshot of the top 8 food allergies . <p> An allergy to cows milk is n't the same as lactose intolerance . Those who are lactose intolerant have a deficiency in the lactase enzyme , which breaks down lactose into sugar ; these individuals can typically tolerate some lactose in their diet , but they ca n't digest it fully , according to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse . Those with a milk allergy , on the other hand , can experience severe , even life-threatening reactions after consuming just a sip or two of milk . <p> Food Allergy vs . Food Intolerance <p> Food allergy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often confused . Food allergies provoke the immune system to react to trigger foods it identifies as harmful ; allergy symptoms can be life-threatening . Food intolerance provokes the digestive system ; its symptoms are uncomfortable , but not life-threatening , and include diarrhea , bloating and stomach cramps . <p> Egg allergies cause an abnormal reaction in affected individuals immune systems when they consume egg proteins in any form . Egg allergies primarily occur in children , but most kids will outgrow the allergy by the time they reach adulthood . Those with an egg allergy should consult their doctor before receiving some vaccines , as these immunizations may contain egg protein ; well dive deeper into specific shots in a later post . <p> Exposure to even a trace amount of peanuts can trigger peanut allergy symptoms , which range from mild but uncomfortable to severe and life-threatening . Peanut allergy is the deadliest of the food allergies in that it is the top cause for food-allergy-related anaphylaxis deaths . <p> Shellfish allergy symptoms are most often triggered by lobster , shrimp and crab . Unlike some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergy typically develops in adulthood or late childhood . Some people are allergic to fish , but not shellfish . Similarly , someone may be allergic to shellfish , but not crustaceans . Those with severe shellfish allergies can experience an allergic reaction from simply handling shellfish or inhaling airborne shellfish proteins in a kitchen setting . <p> Soy allergies typically appear during childhood , but adult soy allergies are also possible . Soy appears throughout processed food , which makes it quite difficult to avoid in a standard American diet . Those with a moderate to severe soy allergy may also experience allergic reactions after consuming other legumes , such as peanuts , beans , licorice and lentils . <p> Those with a wheat allergy are sensitive to albumin and globulin , two proteins in wheat . This allergy is slightly different from celiac disease , whose sufferers are sensitive to gluten proteins .

Wheat Allergy <p> Celiac disease and wheat allergies share wheat as a culprit , but the two conditions differ considerably . Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune disease ; it causes the body to produce antibodies that attack the villi in the small intestine when the affected individual consumes gluten . People with a wheat allergy can grow out of their allergy ; people with celiac disease have the condition for life . <p> 35 percent of wheat-allergic children will continue to carry their allergy into their teens . <p> 20 percent of children who have a wheat allergy also have allergies to other grains . <h> Symptoms and Diagnosis <p> The best way to diagnose a food allergy is to head to a physician or an allergist for a professional opinion .

I was entertaining a guest from Germany and had taken her to Cedar Key . We had been running all around the island for most of the day and had been having too much fun to think about eating . <p> Unfortunately , some people would not have had such a carefree attitude . There is a real fear in many about hunger , and they avoid this feeling to their detriment ! <h> What 's this Hunger All About Anyway ? <p> Hunger and hungry are not the same . The feeling of being hungry probably came to be because we needed some stimulus to motivate us to eat . It was n't enough to eat just a little because food was not always easily available and going without it for too long could be fatal . <p> Hunger became the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat as much as we could because we were unable to predict when the next feeding opportunity might occur . Thus , hunger motivated us to survive . <p> Fast forward thousands of years and now gathering and eating our food is a relative pleasure . There is no logical reason for most of us ever to worry about going hungry . Yet this fear of being hungry can persist and can be the drive that causes us to overeat . <p> Subconciously we are preparing for the famine that never comes , and because it is no longer necessary to spend most of our time running down prey , we have become sedentary , no longer burning off the excess calories we have consumed . The result is what the statistcs reveal . Two-thirds of us are now overweight or obese . <p> Hunger , on the other hand , is a different feeling . It is persistent . It is physical , not emotional . It does not crave a specific food . It gets stronger with time , and it does n't  go away until we become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , something to be eradicated and fixed , and as a world we have done a pretty good job of this .

Such people have developed a fear of hunger and are afraid to be hungry . <h> Fear of Being Hungry <p> Its hard to understand why people would be afraid to be hungry . Perhaps it was subconsciously learned when a child was forced to clean their plate or constantly told how food was necessary for health . I have heard people say that the hunger they feel is very painful and disconcerting , as if they feel it much more strongly than most others do . <p> Regardless there is a physical and emotional fear of being hungry . One of the reasons that bariatric surgery seems to work is it seems to depress the physical feeling of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it does not address the emotional fear of being hungry . <p> Years of dieting , alternating overeating and deprivation , may be one of the causes of the emotional fear of being hungry . This experience is not helpful if you are trying to lose weight . Dieting will be very hard because the deprivation of calories and the feeling that its terrible to be hungry do not go well together . <h> Dealing with the Fear of Being Hungry <p> The first step is to face the fear . Allow yourself to feel hungry . What you will find is you will still be all right . You can still function , and it will pass . There is no need to panic . Have a plan , have a schedule , and you will be fine . Soon your body will learn the schedule and work with it .

If you cant do this alone , get a professional to help you understand . - <p> If you do want to lose weight , you must build habits and be in control by sticking to a schedule for weight loss .

The " good source of protein " recommendation that you cite is based on the amount of protein per calorie , not the absolute amount of protein . If you drink about 6,600 cups of coffee per day , it will both fulfill your daily caloric needs as well as supply you with a good amount of protein per day ( not to mention that it will kill you because of the caffeine and excess water ) . You can get some more funny results by searching for other foods that have few calories and are eaten in very small amounts . For instance , black pepper is an excellent source of dietary fiberif you eat a quart of it every day . The point of the nutritional profiles is not to tell you that you should try to get all of a particular macro- or micronutrient from that one food .

When shes not writing or speaking , she conducts a private nutrition practice in Jamestown , New York . <p> Food labels now list the amount of trans fat in foods . Consumers , however , need to develop some strategies to use this new information effectively . <p> The amount of trans fat per serving is listed on food labels underneath total fat , along with other types of fat , like saturated , polyunsaturated or monounsaturated . Although trans fat occurs naturally in some animal fat , most trans fats in the American diet come from partially hydrogenated oils . These are vegetable oils that have hydrogen forced into their chemical structure to give them a longer shelf life before spoiling . Because hydrogenated oils harden , they can be used in margarine or shortening . Almost a third of the fat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that trans fat is unhealthy , but researchers do n't  yet agree on what amount is safe . There is no recommended limit or Daily Value ( DV ) for trans fat . For now , the message from nutrition experts is to get as little as you can while eating a balanced diet . You should n't try to eat zero trans fat , because you would have to avoid foods that provide healthful nutrients and only trace amounts of trans fat . <p> In some ways , trans fat has the same effect as saturated fat . Trans fat raises blood levels of LDL ( " bad " ) cholesterol just like saturated fat . Although some researchers suggest that trans fat reduces good ( " HDL " ) cholesterol , supporting evidence is inconsistent . Both saturated fat and trans fat may promote cancer development , too . But there is insufficient evidence to draw that conclusion yet . <p> When you try to reduce trans fat in your diet , you should consider both the amount of trans fat and saturated fat in your food choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average about 5.8 grams of trans fat a day ( about 2.6 percent of our calories ) . We consume four to five times as much saturated fat . <p> One simple strategy to lower your consumption of trans fat and saturated fat is to add the amounts listed for both on one product and compare that total against the totals of other products . <p> You can even compare this total to the DV for saturated fat to see roughly whether its high or low . Comparing this total to a benchmark designed for saturated fat alone may seem too strict . But the DV for saturated fat is high for two reasons . It overestimates the amount needed by people who should have less than 1,800 calories per day because they are sedentary or overweight . It also overestimates how much the average person with high blood cholesterol should have . Their saturated fat should be below seven percent of their calorie total . <p> Checking the combined total of saturated and trans fat is an important health strategy because food manufacturers are experimenting with a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these oils may reduce trans fat , but since they contain higher levels of saturated fat , there is no overall improvement . <p> The old suggestion to check the list of ingredients for partially hydrogenated oils to avoid trans fat is now less accurate advice than before and unnecessary . Plant breeding techniques have developed variations on common oils that contain fewer polyunsaturated fats , which require less hydrogenation to remain stable . Other fats may be blends of oils with varying characteristics . Since trace amounts of partially hydrogenated oils may be used to stabilize a product , do n't  rule out a food simply because you see a hydrogenated oil listed . <p> If there is less than 0.5 grams of trans fat in a standard serving of a product , the label can declare that the trans fat content is zero , or the product is " not a significant source . " But remember , if you eat three times the serving size of one of these products , you could get up to 1.4 grams of trans fat , an amount you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't  forget that portion size matters . <p> ( This article was provided by the American Institute for Cancer Research in Washington , D.C.

If anyone happened to catch the National Institutes of Health presentation of their 2005 dietary guidelines ( which this author should have , considering her credentials ) , then you would note that the experts did two very important things : <p> ( 1 ) They noted that they sold the American people out in a " compromise " with the food industry ( though they did n't  phrase it that way , of course ) <p> ( 2 ) They noted that , unofficially , you should avoid trans fat altogether . While the information was n't in their guidelines ( which they took 5 years to produce ) , they told this to the reporters questioning them . <p> So the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say one thing publicly and another off the record . Trans fats should be absolutely avoided at all costs . They have no health or nutritional benefits and they are toxic to your body in the way that rat poison would be toxic to your body there are no acceptable amounts of either in your diet . This author may lump trans fats into the same category as saturated fats , but this is completely wrong . Saturated fat has a great deal of health benefits butter and eggs , as two examples , are some of the healthiest foods you can eat . <p> Further , it is NOT saturated fat or cholesterol which causes heart disease , but rather arterial inflammation . And what is the leading cause of arterial inflammation ? Carbohydrates ! <p> Finally , if you continue to eat trans-fat laden products , you are supporting the big corporations who are unwilling to make the switch to healthier alternatives . Do n't  take the advice of these talking heads who are intentionally misleading the American public and worsening the health crises in this country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cancer were almost unknown now they are epidemicand you can thank all the processed foods , trans fats , MSG , high-fructose corn syrup , synthetic sweeteners , preservatives , and high-carb/low-fat medical advice for that ! <p> In closing , it should be noted that for a Canadian trans fat label to say " 0 , " the product must contain less than 0.2g ( 200 mg ) of trans fat per serving less than half the American label requirement .

The concept of the yo-yo diet , where the dieter repeatedly loses a significant amount of weight only to repeatedly gain most or all of it back , over and over , has become a cliche in the world of weight control . <p> The question that bedevils repeatedly backsliding weight losers is : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusive goal ? <p> USA Today recently pressed a number of professionals in the field for an answer , and came up with several . <p> Biology : Every body is programmed to maintain a specific set weight , and the more one falls below that set point , the more the body will chemically try to return to its " norm , " primarily by increasing its output of a " hunger " hormone called ghrelin , and decreasing a " fullness " hormone called leptin . It takes a serious chunk of time at ones new , lower weight for the body to adjust itself to that new set point . <p> Cultural environment : Cheap , high-calorie food is constantly being promoted , extolled and marketed to us in the media , and is not just universally available but nearly unavoidable .

@@97602776 @1802776/ <p> A form of sugar called trehalose that shows up on food ingredient lists in Japan may be set to appear on food labels in the United States , and a controversy resembling that over HFCS could erupt , despite determinations by government oversight bodies that the product is completely safe . <p> Besides Japan trehalose is also coming into more widespread use in various European countries . Although its not yet common in the United States , the Food and Drug Administration has accepted without objection the manufacturers claim that trehalose is " generally accepted as safe " ( GRAS ) . <p> GRAS foods are exempt from the usual legal food additive requirements . In 1983 the FDA accepted another sweetener , high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) as GRAS , and today the controversial sweetener is as ubiquitous on United States packaged food labels as trehalose currently is on Japanese food labels . Will the GRAS classification of trehalose ultimately result in its use in the United States market in a big way ? We do n't  know , but its worth keeping an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States <p> Like HFCS , trehalose is a natural substance , found in mushrooms like shiitake , some sea algae , and sunflower seeds , as well as shrimp and various insects . The blood sugar of bees consists of trehalose . However , extracting it in industrial quantities was prohibitively expensive until the Hayashibara company in Okayama , Japan , invented a way to make it in bulk by adding enzymes to starch . <p> Trehalose has several properties that are attractive to food manufactures , and Hayashibara began to market it to them as the " natural miracle . " It has a mild , sweet flavor that does n't  interfere with a products basic taste , yet it acts as a preservative , a water-retaining texturizer , and a suppressant of off flavors and odors . It can also be used to partially replace conventional sugars . <p> And Hayashibara has n't  limited itself to food . They have successfully sold trehalose for use as a fabric deodorizer , a moisturizer , and a medical solution ingredient . <p> As an example of the use of trehalose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crispy snack cracker called Cheeza . More than half of a Cheeza crackes by weight is chedder cheese power , with trehalose coming in second on the list , then some oil and various flavorings and coloring . Cheeza contains no wheat flour or similar ingredient , yet somehow a cracker can be made from cheese , trehalose , and oil . <h> The Sweetener Controversy to follow HFCS ? <p> If trehalose enters the United States market in a big way , Hayashibara may discover Americans innate paranoia about eating foods containing anything with a " chemically " sounding name , however natural it is . " Trehalose " is not destined to be an easy marketing sell , and the name alone may be putting off American food manufacturers . ( Another theory is that American food additive companies are waiting for Hayashibaras patents to expire before making it themselves domestically . ) <p> Although Japanese soccer moms do n't  check food labels for trehalose as obessively as their American counterparts do for HFCS , Google Suggest offers " trehalose dangers " ( in Japanese ) as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web , and some sites discuss concerns . Hayashibara has taken preemptive action with a consumer facing trehalose website , an irritable phallic mascot character from outer space named " Treha , " and television commercials promoting the substance and safe and nutritious . <p> If trehalose ever begins to show up on ingredient labels in a big way in the United States , we can predict with a certain amount of confidence that the health danger conspiracy theories will not be far behind on the internet . Although it comes too late to be blamed for the obesity crisis and autism , were sure that some malady will be found to pin on it . <p> There 's no reason to believe health " connspiracy theories " regarding trehalose will show up . What can be expected is for the intelligent to review all the available data on it . <p> If people were to find it was created as an ulcer drug that caused tumors in mice and then marketed as a food " additive " to avoid drug safety testing ( as was the case with aspartame ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumsfeld and George H. W Bush to gut the FDA of anyone protecting the public from it , people would probably think twice about ingesting it as well . <p> To imply that such documented facts are " conspiracy theories " is to discard rational thought and careful consideration of the facts in favor of advocating ignorance and denial of documented facts . <p> Bob , your comment was bit incoherent , so to clarify , all the ulcer/tumor/Rumsfield stuff you 're talking about refers to aspartame " conspiracy theories , " not trehalose conspiracy theories , right ? So far , as of 2014 , our 2010 prediction of a trehalose backlash has not occurred . <p> I hope it does n't  get approved in the US . I have trehalose intolerance and would no longer be able to eat safely if it is used as a sweetener in the US . Ill head the backlash just because I do n't  want to die of the awful stomach flu symptoms it gives me . Its easy to avoid trehalose now because the only thing its naturally in high concentrations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more often naturally and people who are intolerant can expect to have to change lifestyle . Let 's not introduce something that does not occur naturally too often in high concentrations as a sweetener . <p> I too have a trehalose intolerance , although it is not common . It would be great if this sweetener , derived from mushroom sugar , will be listed as Trehalose in ingredient summaries and not by some unrecognizable name . It would save me a great deal of pain , suffering , and future trips to the ER to set me right again . Heads up , if you cant eat this simple plant based sugar , its reported as an ingredient used in Taco Bell beef filing . I 'm learning I have to be proactive &amp; check what is in the food that I eat . Adequate disclosure , like Taco Bells , would be helpful though . More foods containing this can be discovered with a search . <p> I found this site while searching " how to get more trehalose in my diet " because it now is found to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower weight . It also has good properties for neurologic disorders such as Parkinsons . So far , shiitake mushrooms and sunflower seeds seem to be the only food with the trehalose in them . SoYES PLEASE let 's have approval asap . <p> FYI trehalose is simply two glucose molecules linked together , but it has some unique metabolic differences from fructose and sucrose.

@@97602802 @1802802/ <h> The Army Wants You to Develop a Whole New Set of Physical Skills <p> The U.S. Army just announced that it plans to thoroughly revamp its basic physical fitness test , which could be significant for a considerable number of civilians . That 's because many Americans basic idea of an exercise program mirrors the classic Army fitness test : a certain number of push-ups , a certain number of sit-ups , and a one- or two-mile run , and there 's your basic weekly or ( bi-weekly or whatever ) workout . If it was good enough for the Army , it was good enough for us . <p> But that attitude no longer holds up . The old fitness tests are no longer good enough for the Army , and thus by extension , are no longer good enough for us . According to the military , one of the major shortcomings of the old tests was that they did n't  correlate with the physical demands the soldier would actually encounter in the field of battle . The Armys new tests will be designed to test ones capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat of combat strength , endurance and mobility . <h> These Tests Could Save a Soldiers Life . By Convincing Him to Ask For a Discharge . <p> The new " combat readiness " requirements of the revised fitness test include : Running a quarter mile with a rifle , negotiating an obstacle course in full combat gear , sprinting through a course of traffic cones , crawling under and leaping over obstacles while aiming a rifle , running along a balance beam while carrying 30-pound ammunition boxes , and dragging a sled loaded with 180 pounds of sandbags ( to simulate dragging a wounded soldier to safety ) . <p> For the civilian exerciser , of course , these new tests present at least two major problems . First , most of us would find them inconvenient and difficult to replicate . After all , how many average citizens happen to have a balance beam , or a sled , or ammo canisters on hand , to say nothing of the 50-plus pounds of weaponry and body armor involved in " combat gear .

In fact , based on statistical reality , we are not even close . So when I saw a recent study that implied that it could be easy to break the habit of making poor food decisions by just having a few environmental prompts , it caught my interest . <p> If this was some weight-loss-quick scheme , I would have immediately discarded it , but this was a serious study , published in a juried journal that was claiming the key to weight control could be easily accomplished . <h> Let 's Look More Closely at the Study <p> Titled " Contexts Paired with Junk Food Impair Goal-Directed Behavior in Rats : Implications for Decision Making in Obesogenic Environments , " the study , published in Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience , suggests that people who often binge-eat readily available , well-advertised and seductive junk food could use some simple environmental cues to help themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our food choices and how we eat , lead author Linda Corbit , assistant professor at the University of Sydney , and her staff , took rats and plied them with poor-nutritional foods such as cookies , potato chips and jelly candies versus the standard nutritional chow until the rats were habituated to the junk and were not able to make good nutritional choices based on their instinctive ability to cognitively evaluate the value of their food . They then performed two experiments on the rats . <h> Nothing to it <p> The first experiment looked at mindful choice versus habitual control . As stated , the subjects were initially given repeated exposures to a junk-food or standard-chow environment . During periods of food deprivation , the rats were trained to press levers that provided either a sugar reward or chow pellets . Then , once they were full , they were once again placed in a junk-food or standard-chow environment in order to see whether these distinct situations would affect their food-seeking behavior . <p> The result of the first experiment showed that being in a junk-food environment did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior in their food choices than being in a standard-chow environment . <p> Then the researchers , in a second experiment , looked at whether altering the environment would have an affect on this habitual junk-food-seeking behavior . The rats underwent the same procedures as in the first experiment except , this time , different distinct sound cues were played whenever rats were placed in junk-food or standard-chow cages . <p> This caused the rats to associate the specific food type with a different environmental cue . The result was that the cue played in the chow cage improved the rats sensitivity to the nutritional value of the food . Then when these rats were later placed in the junk food cage after having been fed , using the sound cue that had been paired with the chow food was all it took to take these rats out of their induced habitual mode of behavior and back into where they made better food choices . <h> Like Falling off a Log <p> From the study : " These results show that environments paired with palatable foods can impair goal-directed control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a cue paired with chow . This has promising implications for assisting individuals in controlling their eating behavior in environments designed to deregulate it . " <p> In other words , the study showed that environments where tasty high-fat and high-sugar treats were routinely consumed induced habitual control and the rats lost the ability to make- nutritional choices based on the current value of food , yet with environmental cues the rats could easily be brought out of this state . <h> Discussion <p> There is no question that we are in a constant stream of sensory information guiding us away from living a healthy and fit lifestyle . We are often distracted from making measured , healthy decisions . Are we really just creatures of habit ? Certainly poor habits can be well-entrenched , as demonstrated by what we see every day in our unhealthy world . <p> If the frequently habitual nature seen in rats can be translated to people , this study has potential to be helpful . With this in mind , the researchers suggest using simple interventions , such as reminders of how unhealthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk-food cues by using a smart phone app to decrease the consumption of unhealthy food . They also feel that even simply putting up signs that point out healthy food options in a food court can be an effective way of bringing us to where we can make our own decisions . <h> It Ai n't  So Easy Peasy <p> Now scientists , who are you kidding , and what have you been smoking ? <p> As I read the study , I began to worry that the general lay publics fantasy of quick and easy weight loss , which has disappointed millions of people and wasted their time and money , was now seeping into the hallowed halls of scientific research . <p> People who are in need of help with weight control have eating patterns that are not dictated by a mindful , conscientious decision-making process , but rather by their desires and emotions related to satisfying foodstuffs . Sure , there are many cues that encourage them to eat more , but that 's just the surface of the problem . These advertisements merely guide people to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose junk versus more healthy choices . <p> Perhaps a sound cue paired with chow food was all it took to take rats out of a habitual mode of behavior and back into a volitional mind frame , but with people , I 'm thinking electro-shock therapy for the most effective cue , although a rubber band snapped on the wrist has been shown to help in some behaviors , but that 's in people who really want to change . <p> The scientists did suggest that humans can come up with their own preventive cues , which may move them out of habit and into health . <p> I suggest carrying a Taser , and if a readily available environmental cue is needed , rather than use the quote , which originated in my town , " Do n't  Tase me Bro , " when one is tempted to eat unhealthy junk food , just hand the Taser over to a nearby person and say , " Tase me Bro !

Or making it a bit easier for you to lose some weight ? Or , if you 're a woman of childbearing age , helping to protect your unborn baby from developing serious childhood allergies ? My advice in each case is simple : go nuts . <h> Once they come out of their shells , they 're the life of the nutrition party <p> I 'm a big nut fan myself . I manage to nibble on either peanuts ( in the shell , unsalted , because , you know , sodium ) or mixed nuts ( salted , because that 's apparently the only way they come and I 'm too lazy to rinse them off* ) on pretty much a daily basis . I 've always liked nuts just because I liked nuts the flavor , the texture , the crunch , and yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health benefits of nut consumption , and now I really really like nuts . Here are some of the reasons . <p> The more often that you eat nuts , the less likely you are to die of cancer , heart disease , or respiratory disease . For that matter , regular nut consumption lowers your statistical risk of dying from anything . This is based on a massive study of almost 119,000 American men and women for over three decades that was reported in the New England Journal of Medicine . And the more nuts consumed , the better . The death rate for people who ate nuts even a few times a month was 11 percent lower than for nut-abstainers ; and for those who ate nuts on a daily basis , the death rate was an attention-getting 20 percent lower . Pass the pecans . <p> This benefit accrues to nuts all across the board , even nuts that are not , technically speaking , nuts . The above study included walnuts , almonds , Brazil nuts , cashews , hazelnuts , pistachios , macadamias , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact are not members of the nut family , but rather are legumes ( edible seeds contained in pods ) , along with peas and beans ( although in the strict botanical sense , the only true nuts among all the nuts eaten by humans are the hazelnut and the chestnut , the rest being non-nut seeds or fruit kernels ) . <p> Why peanuts behave so much like tree nuts in the matter of health pluses is not clear , but that 's the case . A study of 120,000 middle-aged adults conducted in the Netherlands that focused just on peanuts found that eating 10 grams ( 1/3 of an ounce ) per day cut ones likelihood of dying over a ten year period by 23 percent compared to peanut shunners , and measurably boosted the peanut consumers resistance to diabetes , respiratory illnesses and neurodegenerative disease . ( But do n't  overdo it ; the study found that the health benefits peaked at just 15 grams per day . ) <p> Eating plenty of nuts can help you lose weight . Stop laughing : there are a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a slender physique . One Spanish study that ran for over two years determined that frequent nut eaters were 43 percent less likely to become obese or even overweight compared to never-eaters . Given that nuts pack roughly 150 to 200 calories per ounce , with 80 percent of that in the form of fats , these research results seem highly counterintuitive to say the least , but the track record is what it is . The best explanations offered for this phenomenon are that nuts tend to replace even fattier and more caloric alternative snacks such as chips and cookies , and that they may be more filling and hunger-suppressing than other munchies since , unlike most snack foods , they deliver significant amounts of fiber and protein . <p> Nuts are in fact loaded with a fairly impressive array of healthy substances , including cholesterol-lowering plant sterols , triglyceride- and blood pressure lowering omega3 fatty acids , copper , magnesium , folic acid , selenium , and chemical compounds that generally bestow antioxidant , anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer benefits . For that matter , even the fats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of the monounsaturated type , which boost the level of our pal HDL cholesterol while keeping a lid on the insidious LDL levels . <p> Perhaps the most unlikely benefit of nut consumption is that it may be the key to reducing or even preventing nut allergies . An analysis of data compiled on nearly 11,000 children born between 1989 and 1995 and published in JAMA Pediatrics found that peanut or tree nut allergies were significantly fewer among children born to mothers who had eaten more nuts than average during pregnancy . The results , published in JAMA Pediatrics , support the growing belief among pediatricians that exposure to allergens during pregnancy helps boost the childs tolerance later and reduces his or her likelihood of developing allergies to those food items . In the case of peanut allergies , which can produce reactions so severe as to be life-threatening , this may be the most important health weapon in the nut arsenal . <p> The lesson to be derived from all this research seems unmistakable and irrefutable : The next time you feel the urge to munch out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the literal sense , that is. 3781 @qwx863781 <p> I definitely agree with everything that 's been written here !

A new study shows that teens are pretty smart when it comes to their health , and are very aware of the benefits , both physical and mental , of physical fitness . <p> The study was conducted by Concordia University in Montreal and surveyed 1,000 high school students from both public and private schools . It showed that teenagers are aware that exercise can lift self-esteem and boost confidence .

@@97602827 @1802827/ <h> Weight Watchers SmartPoints Formula in Detail : A Step-by-Step How-To <p> In December , 2015 , Weight Watchers announced another sweeping change in its Points system . SmartPoints replaces PointsPlus . If you 've gone rogue by doing Weight Watchers solo , you need to join up again to access the new tools and purchase the new recipe books and calculator . <p> We did another dive into Weight Watchers published patent applications , but as yet we 've found no trace of the SmartPoints formula . So we read the marketing materials , and then we rolled up our sleeves and started analyzing sample nutrition data , keeping in mind what we had learned from the PointsPlus patent documents about how Ms. Miller-Kovach and her team like to structure formulas . And the solution came quicker than we expected . Without further delay , here 's CalorieLabs conjectured SmartPoints formula : <p> The result , SP , is rounded up or down . The values Calories , Sugar grams , SatFat ( saturated fat ) grams , and Protein grams are taken off the U.S. or Canadian Nutrition Facts labels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CalorieLabs nutrition database or other source . For restaurant foods you 're at the mercy of what they disclose , and few restaurants disclose sugar values at this point . Important note : In the new Beyond the Scale program , of which SmartPoints is one component , vegetables and fruits are zero SmartPoints , no matter what the formula says . Its impossible to " remove " produce from Nutrition Facts data and restaurant-disclosed data , but for home-cooked recipes you have that control . <p> For each of the three multiplication groups in the formula , the first value in each grouping ( 1 or 0.8 ) represents a weighting factor , and the second number ( 4 or 9 ) represents the number of calories per gram for the macronutrient . A weighting of 1 means the value is unweighted , so in effect you are penalized for eating sugar and saturated fat by having their calories doubled ; but you are encouraged to eat protein because you get its calories reduced by 80 percent . The calories per gram figures , 4 for sugar ( a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat , are the standard estimates used by all nutritionists , and referenced by Weight Watchers in previous patents . The divisor of 33 scales the final number down to the range to which Weight Watchers members are accustomed from their past experience with the Points and PointsPlus systems . <h> Simplifying the SmartPoints Equation <p> Simplifying the formula , <p> Reduced to decimals , <p> In all cases , the value of SP is rounded up or down . <p> Expressed as a series of instructions : <p> Obtain the calorie value for the food and multiply it by 0.0303 <p> Obtain the sugar value and multiply it by 0.1212 <p> Obtain the value for saturated fat and multiply it by 0.2727 <p> Add these three numbers together <p> Obtain the protein value and multiply it by 0.0970 <p> Subtract this number from the previous result <p> Round up or down to produce the SmartPoints value <h> Could You Do This in Your Head ? <p> Is it possible for mere mortals to figure out the SmartPoints in their heads while shopping , without pulling out your mobile phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and doing this regularly will stave off senility . here 's how to do it : <p> Note : See the next section for a simpler way to do it in your head . <p> First you need to remember the four pieces of data you need . Calories is one , and it should be easy to remember . Then there are sugar , saturated fat , and protein . Remember sugar and saturated fat because they are famously " bad " stuff ; and protein is " good , " in that its what other diets like Paleo and Atkins think you should eat a lot of ; dietary fiber is also good , but its not in the formula : just remember that its covered by the free fruit and vegetables rule . <p> Calories has no multiplier . The multiplers for the non-calorie nutrients are 4 , 9 , and 3.2 for sugar , saturated fat , and protein . Remember these by remembering that the calories per gram for the three macronutrients , carbohydrate ( which includes sugars ) , fat , and protein are 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has more than twice the calories of carbohydrate and protein . The formula uses these values as is , except the protein multiplier is weighted down to 80 percent , 3.2 . <p> Remember that you start with the calories , then add ( as a penalty ) the bad stuff , and finally subtract the good stuff , protein . Subtracting is good because it makes the points lower . <p> As for doing the math itself , try these tricks : ( 1 ) Round off after every operation ; ( 2 ) remember that 4 is close to 5 , which is half of ten , so you can add a zero and cut in half , and then round the result down ; ( 3 ) 9 is close to 10 , so you can add a zero and round down ; 3.2 is close to a third of 10 times , so add a zero and cut into a third . <p> Finally , dividing by 33 is simply moving the decimal point left one digit and taking a third , or you can simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the previous result . <p> The key is to not try to get exact results with every operation : round and estimate as you go , and if you remember that you rounded down a bit for the last operation you can round up a bit for the next . <p> We 've found that if you can accept a plus-or-minus 1 point degree of accuracy , you can get pretty adept at estimating SmartPoints in your head in the grocery aisle . <h> An Even Simpler Version <p> If you 're willing to give up a little accuracy , a variation of a formula given by Mary Melick in the comments below is very easy to apply . Marys formula figures the SmartPoints contributed by the calories first , and then adds and subtracts from that figure based on the nutrient values and dividing them by simple integers . In our testing the results are about 10 percent off using Marys original divisors , but we 've modified them to be more accurate . <p> Finally , you move the decimal point one space to the left ( i.e. , divide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final estimate . <p> To the extent that you can keep the remainders/decimal results in your head and more-or-less take them into account , your figure will be more accurate . For example , if you get about 1.3 from sugar and 1.3 from saturated fat , rather than rounding them both to 1 , you can consider them together to be 3 . <p> Although easy to remember and handy , Marys formula is nevertheless a ( very close ) estimate . To make it perfect the 8 , 4 , and 10 would need to be unrounded decimal numbers , and you 'd be better off just remembering the real formula at the top of this page . <h> Why We Think Our Formula is the Real Formula <p> Not only does our formula produce points that match our sample SmartPoints test data , it fits the prior pattern established in Weight Watchers patents over the previous 5 years : <p> The standard whole number calories-per-gram-values are used . <p> These values are modified by weighting factors that are clean decimal numbers divisible by 0.05 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale the value to something in the general range of the previous Points systems . <p> All required numbers are available in the Nutrition Facts label . <p> The first three factors above need to be met to conform to the established pattern of using only clean , pretty numbers in all formulas created by Karen Miller-Kovach and her team , as documented in previous patents . The last factor is necessary for any formula to be applied to a broad range of food in the real world , although the vegetable and fruit exception makes it impossible to compute perfectly accurate SmartPoints values for other than homemade food because Nutrition Facts labels and restaurant disclosure data include all ingredients in the numbers . Weight Watchers has a recipe tool that reportedly ignores vegetable ingredients when computing SmartPoints . <p> On the one hand , the fact that you can not exclude vegetables in packaged and restaurant food and are thus penalized with higher SmartPoints functions as a disincentive to eat those foods and to stick to home-prepared food . Healthwise this is good , but it is n't very convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WeightWatchers wants to put pressure on food manufacturers to license the SmartPoints system and trademark so they can print the SmartPoints value directly on packages , and incidentally provide a new income sourde for Weight Watchers . <p> At any rate , try this formula out on your own food and see if it matches the results that you get from the WeightWatchers tools . If you find any discrepancies , please comment below or send us e-mail , and include the four nutrition numbers as well as the SmartPoints value that the official tools produced , so we can try to troubleshoot our formula . <p> Its interesting to note the evolution of what Weight Watchers considers important . The original Points system encouraged a low fat diet with a reasonable amount of fiber . PointsPlus added in an emphasis for high protein foods . Now SmartPoints throws out fiber from the formula altogether ( although admitedly zero-points vegetables and fruit encourage fiber consumption ) , and penalizes high-sugar and high-saturated fat foods . <p> We cant help but think that Weight Watchers is ( 1 ) chasing popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members have been able to game . Of course , even the new system can be gamed , for instance by chug-a-lugging monounsaturated olive oil . <h> Bonus Content for Numerologists <p> We noticed that the formula can be restated as 1-squared times calories plus 2-squared times sugar plus 3-squared times saturated fat minus 4-squared-divided-by-5 times protein , all divided by 33 . <p> October 2015 pre-SmartPoints post is below <p> In late 2010 Weight Watchers International announced a major overhaul of its popular Points system formula , the first in over a decade . The previous formula penalized high fat foods with more Points ; foods known to be high in dietary fiber could reduce the Points to a certain extent . <p> The new formula , PointsPlus , still takes into account all three macronutrients , protein , carbohydrate , and fat , without penalizing fat as much , favoring protein to an extent , and significantly favoring dietary fiber . <p> CalorieLab has examined public U.S. and international patent documentation and referenced analysis by other independent nutrition publications in order to determine the probable Points Plus formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian markets . <p> Note:Many online resources still reflect 2010-12 era reverse-engineered curve fitting iterative formula approximations and are not correct . Blind online calculators that do n't  show the formula that they are using are particularly suspect . <h> Step-by-Step , Numbered <p> First were going to give you a step-by-step method for determining the PointsPlus in foods that you can do with a calculator or program into an Excel spreadsheet . <p> Although a few packaged food manufacturers and restaurants license the PointsPlus system from Weight Watchers and print the values on their packaging and menus , most often the dieter has to figure out the number of Points himself by referring to disclosed macronutrient values on packaging and menus . Since nutritional disclosure varies in its details by country , the Weight Watchers PointPlus patent includes several variations of the basic formula . Were presenting the U.S. and Canada variation here . <p> Get the four gram values for protein , total carbohydrate ( just " carbohydrate " in Canada ) , total fat , and dietary fiber from the Nutrition Facts label of packaged food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Divide total carbohydrate by 9.21 . <p> Divide total fat by 3.89 . <p> Add the results of 2 through 4 . <p> Divide dietary fiber by 12.5 . <p> Subtract from the sum obtained in 5 the quotient from 6 . <p> Round up to the nearest whole number . <p> For an easier-to-remember formula , you can round the four divisors to 11 , 9 , 4 , and 12 , respectively . <p> Here it is in the form of a formula : <p> where Carbs is Total Carbohydrate , including Dietary Fiber and Fiber is Dietary Fiber alone ; and please note the the final fraction is subtracted from the previous sum , and the final figure is rounded up to a whole number . <p> Note : This formula works in the United States and Canada , where a quirk in the Nutrition Facts labels includes dietary fiber in the Total Carbohydrate figure . In other places the carbohydrate figure listed on packaged food labels is exclusive of dietary fiber , use that carbohydrate figure in step 3 , divide by 35 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step 7 . <h> Weight Watchers Points Background <p> Weight Watchers is a meeting-based diet program that has been rated highly for effectiveness by Consumer Reports , and US News and World Reports . The primary gimmick of Weight Watchers has long been its Points system ( usually styled in all caps ) , for all practical purposes a branded proxy for calories , but with smaller , friendlier numbers . The number of Points worth of food and drink that a member can consume per day is determined based on the same sort of factors that a physician would look at to figure out recommended calories : body weight and height , age and sex , and activity level . <p> In November 2010 Weight Watchers announced that a new system , PointsPlus , would replace the then current Points system . ( Around this time other new versions of Points were introduced around the world , with differences tailored to the specifics of local packaged food nutrition disclosure regulations . ) The new system added protein into the equation and reduced the penalty for fat . Weight Watchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to improved understanding of metabolism and weight loss mechanisms . Skeptics pointed out that members had to purchase new calculators , reference books , and cookbooks . <h> The original Points system <p> The formula for the original Points system was : <p> where C is total calories , F is fat , and R is dietary fiber . This formula penalized fat by in effect multiplying each calorie sourced from fat by 5 relative to carbohydrate and protein calories ; and dietary fiber was encouraged by subtracting back out a multiple of the calories from fiber for the first 4 grams worth . <p> So the original Points system promoted the traditional American low-fat approach to dieting , and made up for the lack of fat by promoting filling dietary fiber . <h> The Current PointsPlus <p> Weight Watchers does not discuss the formula behind PointsPlus , but presumably it is based on U.S. patent 8382482 , filed in August 2009 and published in February 2013 ( various other U.S. and international patent application materials and documentation relating to this system and differing in details have been available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The patent describes a number of formulas and variations for various purposes , with various modifications , but the core formula for determining " food energy data , " the precursor to a foods Points number , seems to be formula 10 in the Description section of the patent ( the so-called United States and Canada formula ) . <p> That base forumula in the patent is : <p> where the values with the subscript ms represent the grams ( " mass " ) of each macronutrient ( protein , carbohydrate , and fat ) , as well as dietary fiber ; the C values represent the number of calories per gram for each macronutrient ( 4 for protein and carbohydrate , including dietary fiber , and 9 for fat , the standard values used in nutrition science ) ; and the W values represent weighting factors applied to each macronutrient , 0.80 for protein , 0.95 for carbohydrate , 1.00 for fat , and 0.25 for dietary fiber . ( In other words , they 're only counting 80 percent of the protein , 95 percent of the carbohydrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count all the fat calories . In the patent these weightings are justified by metobolic theories that may or may not have a basis in science . ) Recall that the previous Points system significantly penalized fat , while allowing you to go hog-wild with protein . PointsPlus only slightly penalizes fat relative to the other macronutrients , while adding protein to the equation to prevent protein binging , although protein gets off with lighter weighting than the other two macronutrients . <p> As with the previous Points system , dietary fiber is given special treatment . On U.S. Nutrition Facts labels , carbohydrate is given as a total figure , with a breakout of its sugar and dietary fiber components . In the PointsPlus equation dietary fiber is subtracted out of the total carbohydrate number , then added back in , with its own lower weighing , 0.25 . Many simplifications of the PointsPlus out there do n't  make this clear , and it may appear that dietary fiber is subtracted : The more fiber , the fewer points . In fact , the carbohydrate number should have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietary fiber is added back , with its lower weighting . The more fiber , the higher the Points , but only a quarter of the nominal calories in fiber is counted . Depending on the type of dietary fiber , only half or maybe less is metabolized , so the formula seems to be partially taking this into account . <p> On the whole , the PointsPlus system seems to be closer to out-and-out calorie counting than the Points system . No macronutrient is given a free ride , and the weightings are more even than before , at or within 20 percent of 1.00 , full weighting . <p> There are some alternative formulas in the patent for special cases , such as alcohols and sugar alcohols , different types of fats , and various classifications of food healthfulness . We do n't  know if this is just obfuscation and patent claim creep , or if any of these alternative formulas are in use in the presently released version of PointsPlus . And as mentioned above , there are regional variations of the formula to take into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the formula in commercial use by Weight Watchers has been tweaked subsequent to its introduction . The only way to tell would be to test the formula against all the foods listed in current Weight Watchers reference materials , and nobodys done that . But spot checking seems to verify that formula 10 is the basis of the current PointsPlus , with the exception of a blanket zero Points value for most fresh fruits and vegetables . Of course , these do have calories , but the idea is that few people will pig out on fruit and vegetables to an extent that will affect their weight loss . <h> At the End of the Day , PointsPlus is Calorie Counting <p> Getting back to the formula above , the result is FED , or " food energy data , " not Points . What is FED ? Its a slightly massaged calorie value as far as were concerned . And you can easily get the full calorie value from the Nutrition Facts label without a calculator . So after all these years Weight Watchers switched from Points to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself or buy reference books , rather than just reading the calories off the box ? Yep , that 's our opinion . But that would not be good for Weight Watchers unique selling proposition . So Weight Watchers takes the output of the formula above , the FED , and divides it by 35 to produce PointsPlus . Why 35 ? The patent says that its done " for the customers convenience . " We think that they do it because the result brings the number down to the same range as the original familiar Points system , and it makes the calorie connection less clear . There are many benefits to the Weight Watchers program , which ranked first in Consumer Reports 2013 diet season diet rankings , including peer motivation and realistic menus that your family can also eat . But the PointsPlus system is , in our opinion , simply an obfuscation of calorie counting . The good news is that calorie counting ( or calorie restriction ) is the only diet technique that works . If putting numbers into a calculator to figure out Points keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While we do n't  go into how to compute the daily Points you 're allowed under the PointsPlus program , you wont be too far off if you simply take the number of daily calories you would need to maintain your weight at your goal weight ( in the range of BMI 18.5 to 25 ) , subtract 1,000 calories ( for a two-pound-per-week weight loss velocity ) , and divide by the magic " customer convenience " number of 35 . For instance , if you take the generic FDA womens guidance of 2,000 calories , reduce that by 1,000 calories to 1,000 , then divide by 35 and round up , you end up with 29 Points . ( This builds in the weekly " fun points " into the daily number . ) <h> More Formulas <p> For the mathematically inclined the following formulas present the PointsPlus in various degrees of simplification . <p> Now for a version of the patents " Formula 10 " above , but with numbers substituded for the constants and the 35 divisor added to produce PointsPlus . <p> I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturated Fat by 3 Sugar by 7 then subtract Protein divided by 4 but can only be one point subtracted regardless of Protein grams . For example 8 grams of protein still only yield -1 point . <p> It looks like the protein grams are dependent upon other points too . Has anyone else tried to guess the calculation how close am I ? <p> Thanks , Becky . We 'd appreciate any details on how you worked this out , or where we might find more information . Editor <p> Weve put up our best guess of what we think the formula is , and were pretty confident about it . But you guys can help us out by putting it to the test and commenting here . Meanwhile , we are scouring patent filings in an attempt to locate the SmartPoints patent and the official formula documentation . <p> I say put in the protein , subtract the fiber from the carb number and add the sugar to that number , then the fat number add sat fats to that and then add the fiber number . this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same for me . I hate having to buy another tool from W.W. THIS IS USING THE OLD BLUE COMPUTER , TO FIND THE POINTS PLUS . WORKS FOR ME . THANK-YOU <p> I have tried 30 calories equal one point . Every 3 grams of sat . fat raise it one point . Every 7 grams of sugar raise it another point . Every 8 grams of protein lower it one point . This has been working for me . <p> So you use a divisor of 30 rather than 33 , and multiplers of 4.29 , 10.00 , and 3.70 instead of 4 , 9 , 3.2 . These numbers are all rather close . Our formula matches the data output from Weight Watchers calculators better , however . For instance , if you input 750 calories with 25 grams of the three nutrients , you 'll get 30 SP from Weight Watchers ( we have been told ) and 30.15 SP from our formula ( which rounds down to 30 ) . However , your formula produces 33.78 ( rounding up to 34 ) . <p> Expressing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rounding to integers ) : <p> SP = calories/33 + sugar/8 + satfat/4 protein/10 <p> This produces , for 750/25/25/25 a SmartPoints estimate of 29.60 ( rounding up to 30 , the same as Weight Watchers calculator ) . <p> Give our numbers a try . Dividing by 33 is easy , since its the same as 3 SmartPoints per 100 calories . <p> Hi Carolyn I have just joined weight watchers and do not have time to go through loads of emails to find out how to calculate the SmartPoints on different packages . Thank you for spelling out how to calculate the point in a simple way . I really like people like you that save me time . I only wish the CalorieLab would listen to you : ) , as most people are busy and need things explained simply and easily . Regards Maureen <p> We assume you mean a version that uses kilojoules instead of calories ( since all the other values are already in grams , the unit used on Nutrition Fact labels in the United States ) . <p> There are 4.1840 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to divide kJ by 4.1840 and then proceed as normally . Another way would be to separate out the calories/33 part and change it to kJ/138 , adding that to the sum of the other factors divided by 33 . <p> 1 . I used to be able calculate " Points Plus " values from nutrition facts labels ( I had found the formula to use in US Patent Application 20100055652 paragraphs 42 and 53 ) . This comes in handy when scanning a bar code is not possible . <p> 2 . Thank you for your " Smart Points " formula . There are fewer steps in the calculation versus " Points Plus " so I will be able to use it when needed . <p> 3 . Total calories on the nutrition facts labels are calculated using 4 calories per gram for protein and carbs and 9 calories per gram for fat rounded to the closest 10 calories . Your formula does the same plus it adds the saturated fat and sugar calories a second time and it subtracts 80% of the protein calories . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 , 2009 , patent applications that formulas to treat saturated fat ( see paragraphs 46-48 ) and sugar from alcohol ( see paragraphs 49-52 ) were already included for use " In certain embodiments " . <p> I believe that in the patent application that you cite the PointsPlus formula is Formula 4 between paragraphs 45 and 45 , not the ones you mentioned . The C factors there are the macronutrient calories-per-gram factors of 4 for carbs and protein , and 9 for fat . Formula 4 in that application is the same as Formula 10 in the granted patent that we cite in our PointsPlus explanation . <p> We cant find any forumula in any Weight Watchers patent documentation that includes calories to the right of the equals sign . So we do n't  think that the SmartPoints patent has been published yet . <p> Sugar alcohols are used in the Atkins diet : They are not carbs , so they can be used to sweeten food while still technically not breaking any Atkins rules . This led to commercial desserts made with sugar alcohols , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gaining weight . But at the time that those patent applications were filed , Atkins was still big , so Weight Watchers may have been thinking of how to incorporate " support " for sugar alcohols into their diet . But since sugar alcohols are not disclosed on standard Nutrition Facts labels , they would be a pain to deal with . <p> This is much simpler and seems to work better for me . I have tested extensively using sample values and comparison with the online calculator . Credit goes to Weight Watcher Geek with thanks to Thomas Mills Hinkle . BRILLIANT ! <p> In Excel I used = ( 0.0305*B2 ) -(0.098*C2)+ ( 0.12*D2 ) + ( 0.275*E2 ) to get SmartPoints , Where B2 , C2 , D2 &amp; E2 are the respective cell addresses for calories , protein , sugar and sat fat inputs . The results were entered in column F ( no decimals ) and rounded up or down automatically depending upon the closest whole number . <p> Carole : The WWG version of the formula is simply the formula expressed in decimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to read the entire post , search for " reduced to decimals " on the page ) . <p> However , the WWG formula is very slightly off , as you would expect for numbers derived from a linear regression : <p> The calorie multiplier should be 0.0303 , not 0.0305 . <p> The protein multiplier should be 0.0970 , not 0.0980 . <p> The sugar multiplier should be 0.1212 , not 0.1200 ( although rounded to two decimals , it would be 0.12 ) . <p> The saturated fat multipler should be 0.2727 , not 0.2750 . <p> The differences , which are all in the third and fourth decimals , will not make a difference in most calculations . Add a column to your Excel spreadsheet and see if our numbers differ . <p> On the spreadsheet that WWG used to test his formula , line 14 is this : <p> calories = 1,627 , sugars = 0 , saturated fat = 117 , protein = 2 <p> He gets 82 SmartPoints , which he acknowledges in the spreadsheet is incorrect . Our formula produces 81 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat a food like that , so as a practical matter , either formula will be fine , but were pretty sure that ours is exactly right and the WWG formula is off by a small amount . For the WWG formula to be right , it not only has to provide results that are accurate in all cases ( which it does n't  for the line 14 data , for instance ) , but it also has to be a decimal reduction of a formula of the sort that Weight Watchers has used in their patent applications , which we have produced for our formula . Editor <p> I follow the exchange plan from the 1970s-have the books and it works for me . Each recipe has the calories listed as well as calories for fat , carbs , etc . If I stick to 1200-1300 calories per day I 'm good ! <p> Hi , thanks for these formulas . I find I prefer Points Plus . Since WW is no longer supporting his plan and my pocket Points Plus calculator is getting old , I want to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an error above which indicated 0.95 x 4 = 3.38 . I get a product of 3.8 . Which is correct ? Thanks <p> Jane : Yes , you seem to have found an error in the PointsPlus pre-multiplied forumula image . Well remove it and leave up the version with all the factors shown . Thanks ! Editor <p> Great job with the formulas ! What gets me is they no longer include the personal SmartPoint daily/weekly allotment in the new member packages , so that you buy the $10 calculator on top of your other fees ! These calculations are much appreciated and look forward to seeing someone tackle and crack the allotment calculation . Until then , I 'll continue with the PointsPlus program : ) <p> Great info ! Have you figured out , or found a source for the formula for calculating how many SmartPoints are allowed per day for a person ? I wrote an app for tracking and calculating PointsPlus points , and I want to update it for the new formula , but I can not find the formula to calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ok so I have been trying to stick with the PointsPlus system but everything seems to be changing over to SmartPoints I can not afford to rejoin at this time and I am curious what is the formula to determine how many SmartPoints I will get each day and for freebies each week . This is really upsetting me that I ca n't figure this information out without paying every month . It was working so well for me but now everything is different ! ! Thanks ! <p> I cant afford to sign up now but want to begin with the Points Plus again . I have the calculator but do n't  remember the amount of points I 'm supposed to have each day . It was the lowest amount but I do n't  remember what it was . Can anyone help me ? Thanks ! ! <p> I joined weight watchers last month , but have tried several times to find a list of points for different foods and I do n't  mean points for their recipes . No luck . Isnt there just a plain list of points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just plain every day food ? ? ? <p> I think that Weight Watchers was much more simple before they went to point system . Back to the older days when they did the food exchange diet . That was the best and still works . All these changes ( with the points ) are nothing but confusing and do n't  really work as well .

Read future installments in our Food Allergies archives . <p> Human beings are the only only species to consume the milk of another species . There is no human requirement for milk from a cow . The majority of the worlds peoples do not come from cultures that have a history of dairy consumption . These people often have problems digesting it . And with the advent of modern mechanized dairy production , milk may not be as pure as it once was . Lactose ( the carbohydrate found in milk ) intolerance which causes a range of unpleasant abdominal symptoms , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 75% of the worlds population . Even though consuming dairy is unnatural and problematic for many people the US Food Guide Pyramid recommends 2 to 3 servings . One serving is defined as 1 cup of milk , 2 slices of cheese or 3/4 cup of yogurt . Whole cows milk is a high-fat fluid , designed by nature to turn a 60 lb ( 30 kg ) calf into a 600 lb ( 275 kg ) cow in one year . The consumption of high-fat dairy products has also been found to cause atherosclerosis , heart disease and stroke . Finland which has a death rate from heart disease that is among the highest in the world , also has one of the highest rates of dairy product consumption . The African Bantu woman provides an excellent example of good health . Her diet is free of milk and still provides 250 " 400 mg of calcium from plant sources , which is half the amount consumed by Western women . Bantu women commonly have 10 babies during their life and breast feed each of them for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatively low calcium intake , osteoporosis is relatively unknown among these women . Low-fat milk and cheese products are still significantly high in total fat , saturated fat and cholesterol . For example , 2% milk has become much more popular than homogenized milk , yet it still derives one third of its total calories from fat . Skim milk mozzarella with approximately 15% milk-fat is considered a low-fat cheese , yet a 1-ounce slice contains 5 grams of fat , totaling 56% calories from fat ! So do n't  be fooled by the " skim milk " label . The wide range of skimmed milk products available in grocery stores reflects health concerns over high-fat dairy products . But for many people , low-fat dairy products may still be an unacceptable alternative . Low-fat dairy products linked to heightened allergies The high protein content of low-fat dairy products is actually more allergenic than dairy products with a high-fat content . 3 Dairy products are one of the leading causes of food allergies and food sensitivities causing allergic responses in people of all ages , especially infants and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are allergic to cows milk protein . Infants who react to milk also have a greater likelihood of developing allergies to other foods . Allergies to dairy products can cause a wide range of symptoms including irritability , restlessness , hyperactivity , depression , abdominal pain , cramps or bloating , gas , diarrhea , bad breath , headaches , lack of energy , constipation , poor appetite , mal-absorption of nutrients , nasal stuffiness , runny nose sinusitis , asthma , shortness of breath , rashes , and eczema <p> North America has one of the highest consumptions of dairy products , and also the highest incidence of osteoporosis " a disease of brittle bones formed through the loss of calcium . The dairy lobby has many campaigns and advertisements encouraging people to consume large quantities of dairy products to ward off this dreaded disease later in life . Regardless of how much calcium you take in , the amount your body can actually absorb and retain matters more . The high animal protein intake typical of North American diets can make it difficult to retain calcium . Digesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To neutralize the acid , the body may rob calcium from the bones . Years of this pattern can contribute in osteoporosis later in life . Elderly women with a high dietary ratio of animal to vegetable protein intake have more rapid neck bone loss and a greater risk of hip fracture than do those with a low ratio . This suggests that an increase in vegetable protein intake and a decrease in animal protein intake may decrease bone loss . Several studies have found that in comparison with animal protein , soy protein decreases calcium excretion , a result of the lower sulfur amino acid content of soy protein . To prevent osteoporosis it is also important to get enough Vitamin D , avoid smoking and limit coffee and alcohol . Weight-bearing exercise such as running , dancing and walking is especially helpful . Drinking large quantities of cows milk has long been recognized to produce iron-deficiency anemia in infants . Cows milk contains less than 1 mg of iron per quart . Very little of this iron is absorbed from the intestinal tract because other constituents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Litres of milk per day . This tends to satisfy their hunger and they are left with very little appetite for the necessary iron-containing foods . Breast milk is the best source of iron for infants . Ovarian cancer is more common in Northern Europe than in Asian populations and the consumption of milk products may be the reason . Studies have found that there is a higher risk of ovarian cancer in women who consume lactose . This was the conclusion of a study published in 2004 , that tracked 80,326 participants in the Nurses Health Study . A Swedish study of 61,084 women found that high intakes of lactose and dairy products , particularly milk , are associated with an increased risk of serious ovarian cancer but not other subtypes of ovarian cancer . Several studies have linked cows milk to diabetes in children . Something in milk may cause an immune reaction in diabetic children leading to the destruction of the bodys insulin-producing cells . Breast-fed infants who are not fed cows milk seem to have a measure of protection against diabetes . Avoiding cows milk may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of 4,701 ten to sixteen year-old adolescents from 11 European countries found that cows milk and animal product consumption were associated with higher rates of type 1 diabetes when Icelandic data was excluded . Stopping dairy food often improves menstrual cramps , endometriosis pain , allergies , sinusitis and even recurrent vaginitis . Other problems associated with dairy food may include : benign breast conditions , chronic vaginal discharge , acne , fibroids , and chronic intestinal upset . There might be some correlation between over stimulation of the cows mammary glands and subsequent over stimulation of our own , resulting in benign breast conditions . People who regard milk as " the perfect food " rarely think about milk as a commercial product " prone to the hazards of mass-production . The modern-day cow is bred , fed , medicated , inseminated , and manipulated for a single purpose " maximum milk production at a minimum cost . In order to produce milk , a dairy cow must give birth . To maximize their milk supply they are artificially inseminated every year , meaning they are pregnant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their calves are traumatically taken from them shortly after birth . The resulting surplus of calves feeds the veal industry . With genetic manipulation and intensive production technologies , cows produce an average of 9,500 kg of milk per year " seven times more than they would produce naturally . When their milk production wanes after about four years , dairy cows are sent to slaughter where their worn out bodies are ground up into hamburger . These unnatural conditions make the modern dairy cow highly prone to stress and disease . The most damaging stress-related disease is mastitis ( an inflammation of the udders ) . It reduces milk yield and directly affects milk quality by altering composition and increasing the somatic cell count ( pus ) . The National Mastitis Council estimates that it costs about $200 per cow per year on the average dairy farm . Mastitis is one of the leading cause of culling . Antibiotics , mostly common penicillin , are given to cows for treatment of mastitis . Cows are not supposed to be milked for 48 hours after receiving penicillin . When this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small amounts . In 1993 , Food and Drug Administration in the United States approved the use of a synthetic growth hormone , rBGH ( also known as rBST ) . This genetically engineered hormone , so far banned in Canada and Europe , has no therapeutic value but to boost milk production . This can cause additional stress , and more frequent bouts of mastitis . Foods rich in calcium include dark green vegetables such as broccoli , bok choy and kale , beans , tofu ( made with calcium ) , tahini , sesame seeds , almonds , figs , seaweeds , and fortified soymilks . Since the consumption of animal protein increases calcium requirements , a person following a vegetarian diet may have much lower needs . Although some plant foods contain oxalates and phytate that can inhibit calcium absorption , the calcium in plant foods is generally well absorbed . Soymilk is loaded with phytochemicals : particularly isoflavones , genistein and daidzein . Studies have found that these substances reduce the risk of cancer.Most soy milk today is fortified with calcium , B12 and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterpart . Soy protein consumption has been shown to reduce the levels of cholesterol and lessen the incidences of atherosclerosis . Soy also has beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes .

The idea behind the study was to determine why , in most cultures , being slender is considered more attractive than being overweight , especially in the case of females . <p> There have been two basic schools of thought on this matter . The cultural school holds that humanity has essentially been sold a bill of goods in regard to attractiveness by commercial and media interests . <p> Most " fat acceptance " activists seem to embrace this viewpoint , and blame advertising and television in the main for our thin-is-beautiful bias . The people shown in print ads and TV commercials have traditionally been trim and fit , and although this appears to be changing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations . <p> But having worked in the ad industry , I can tell you why advertising has equated thinness with attractiveness : because the general consuming public has for the most part held that view . In a few cases , thinness is an element of the product being pitched : diet foods and exercise devices are obvious examples . But the vast majority of ads featuring slender models use them to convey the notion , almost always inaccurate , that " if you use this product you 'll look like this . " <p> Still , advertising , and media in general , are merely exploiting a preexisting human inclination to find thinness more attractive . This is n't to defend them , but they did n't  create our pro-thin bias , they just cater to it . Theyre guilty of pandering to an arbitrary and unfair social prejudice , but in my opinion they 're a dead end if you want to find the origin of that prejudice . <h> And Its Not Evolution <p> The other school of thought is that we view thinness as more attractive because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that among early humans , the slender were more healthy , less prone to infertility or to such herd-thinning ailments as heart disease , diabetes and stroke , not to mention being able to run fast when their life depended on it . Over the ages , our DNA became programmed to value thin persons of the opposite sex as those most likely to pass it on to subsequent generations , and it hardwired us to prefer the slender over the stout . <p> The problem with this theory is that it is seriously flawed in the context of human history , and even more important , prehistory . The single-greatest survival challenge faced by humanity for most of its time on earth has been getting enough to eat , and being blessedly , healthily overweight should , given its survival advantage , have human DNA thoroughly enamored with the extra-full-bodied. - But with the exception of a handful of cultures , just the opposite is the rule . <p> The debate over why human beings in general equate slenderness with loveliness continues , and will until someone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our genes tells us that potential mates of low weight are more desirable than those who are heavy. - And now the kicker : the study cited way back in the opening paragraphs may have done just that . <h> In Which We Think Weve Come up with the Answer <p> " Physical fitness is booming for a number of reasons having no more to do with health than tire rotation . For openers , fitness is vigor . Vigor is youth . Youth is everything . " <p> I wrote that in an article for a magazine in the 1980s titled " In Sweat We Trust . " It has always been one of my favorite lines . Sometimes as a writer you crank out a phrase that sticks in your mind as a possible genuine truth that you fortuitously happened to stumble over .

" The top attractiveness ranking went to the very lowest end of the weight spectrum , a BMI of 19 , well off the expected 24-25 leader . <p> In search of an explanation , the researchers quizzed the 1,300 evaluators regarding their perception of the people in the photos .

Women are at their peak fertility level , and run their lowest risk of serious disease , when they are 18 to 20 years old . And the typical BMI of a woman in that age range is between 17 and 20 , a perfect fit with the studys projected ideal BMI of 19 . <p> It also makes cultural sense .

@@97602846 @1802846/ <h> The Sweeter the Beverage , the Sourer Its Effect on You <p> Visitors to CalorieLabs " breaking news " page , Lab Notes , may have noted a post of mine last Thursday titled " Diet Soda Linked to Stroke , Heart Attack . " The gist of the item was this : A team of researchers from the Columbia Medical Center and the University of Miamis Miller School of Medicine crunched a mass of data based on 2,564 people who participated in a program called the Northern Manhattan Study , a search for factors tied to higher incidences of stroke . The search turned up diet sodas . <p> What they found was that people who drank at least one diet soda every day had a 43 percent greater likelihood of experiencing a vascular event , primarily stroke or heart attack , than persons who either drank fewer than six diet sodas per week or drank regular , non-diet sodas . That held even when they controlled for factors such as hypertension and diabetes . Persons in those latter two groups moderate diet soda drinkers and drinkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vascular illness than persons who drank no sodas whatsoever . <p> This diet-soda downside was not by any means a wholly unexpected discovery . Almost exactly a year ago , Marissa Brassfield posted an item on CalorieLab News about a study presented to an American Stroke Association conference which concluded that diet soda drinkers increased their stroke and heart attack risk by fully 61 percent . Some health professionals dismissed those findings because of flaws in that particular study , but it now seems that they were merely exaggerated . <p> What 's troubling about the new , improved study , however , is the implication that soda aficionados are actually safer with the basic sugary variety than the diet stuff . That 's flat-out wrong , and for a number of reasons . For openers , most obesity experts place sugary soft drinks right at or near the top of the list of leading contributors to our national overweight epidemic , and to the many health problems associated therewith . <p> Consider that a typical 12-ounce can of cola delivers approximately 10 teaspoons worth of sugar , the same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glazed chocolate doughnuts . In that context , the idea of knocking down several colas a day verges on scary . Especially if you also consider a firestorm-causing report in the current Nature magazine by health scientists at the University of California , San Francisco , which declares sugar to be so toxic and addictive that sugary drinks should be slapped with a tobacco-like " discouragement " tax , and their sales to children be restricted or banned . <p> There were also some intriguing points made by research physicians cited in Marissas post , such as that consuming sweet sodas , even of the diet variety , gives us a craving for more sweet things , and may be as habit-forming as sugar itself . And that many people who drink diet sodas do so to " buy " themselves the caloric license to eat more non-diet sweet foods . The point being that those who drink diet sodas to excess tend to consume other , less dietary things to excess as well , which may be the actual cause of their vascular vulnerability . <p> Bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch to something less risky , do n't  make it something sweet . A nice iced tea , for example . Hold the sugar .

A Greek study that involved 386 adults who were being treated for hypertension found that those who took midday naps recorded daytime blood pressure readings that were five percent lower than those of non-nappers over 24 hours . The reduction held when controlled for age , sex , BMI , smoking status and exercise level , as well as salt , alcohol and coffee consumption . While the five percent figure seems modest , reducing systolic blood pressure by as little as one percent can cut the risk of cardiovascular illness by up to ten percent . The hypertension patients who napped were also getting by with fewer medications than the non-nappers.

Actually , this premise has n't  been tested on exercising in general , but some British researchers did study it with respect to bicycling last year , and found that to be the case . <p> Here are the particulars : A dozen male college students were asked to ride stationary bikes at a pace they could keep up without discomfort for one half hour , while listening to six songs of varying tempos on headphones played at whatever volume they liked .

@@97602851 @1802851/ 3782 @qwx863782 <p> ( CC ) Kate Ter Haar/Flickr <p> Often when some well-intentioned person feels the need to complain about the primary reasons that an individual can not lose weight , it is usually identified as their lack of willpower , desire and motivation . <p> The truth is , that although some people do have these qualities at their disposal , the vast majority of individuals do not . That lack is not an excuse to be irresponsible , but it might be a reason to use a different , more practical method in attempting to reach our health and fitness goals . <p> Recent research from the Rush University Medical Center , presented in the August issue of the Journal of the American Dietetic Association , suggests a new counseling approach that views obesity as a result of our neurobehavioral processes , the ways in which our brain controls eating behavior in response to cues in the environment . Unlike current approaches to dietary suggestions for the treatment of obesity , which stress the notion of personal choice and willpower , this model suggests focusing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal ones . <p> " Typically , overweight and obese patients receive education about dietary contributions to weight gain , and they are simply encouraged to fight the powerful urge to eat the delicious foods that are available almost everywhere in the environment and instead , make dietary choices consistent with weight loss , yet we know this approach rarely works , " said Brad Appelhans , Ph.D. , a clinical psychologist and obesity researcher at Rush University and the head of this research . " Even highly motivated and nutritionally informed patients struggle to refrain from highly palatable foods that are high in sugar , salt and unhealthy fats . " <p> The three neurobehavioral processes that have been implicated in obesity and overeating are termed food reward , inhibitory control and time discounting . Food reward includes both the experience of pleasure one receives from eating and the motivational drive to obtain and consume highly palatable foods . Those individuals with greater sensitivity to reward seem to have stronger food cravings for sweet and fatty foods . This sensitivity , when coupled with our easy access to numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable to overeating and weight gain . Inhibitory control relates to our ability to suppress our urges to eat when faced with the choice of tasty unhealthy food options over perhaps less-appealing healthy ones . Time discounting is the human tendency to devalue delayed rewards . " Most of us would rather receive $200 today rather than $300 a year from now , " said Appelhans . <p> If we have a dietary lapse , the study recommends that it can be more beneficial if we view the problem as our difficult interaction with a toxic food environment and not as a reflection of poor personal choices or our lack of willpower . This way we can problem-solve and look for practical ways to avoid the situation happening again rather than punishing ourselves for failing . <h> Practical Ways to Deal With Overeating That Do n't  Rely on Willpower <p> Remove high fat , sugar , and salt foods from the home and workplace . <p> Shop with a grocery list or using online grocers . <p> Learn stress management techniques that do not rely on the use of food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Focus on achieving short-term goals , such as cooking a healthy dinner on three nights of the week or eating the prescribed number of fruit and vegetable servings per day , rather than focusing on long-term weight loss goals . <p> Plan ahead for challenging eating situations such as work by making meals and snacks in advance and taking them with you or looking at online menus and choosing what you can eat before going to the restaurant . <p> Write a list of foods that you do not want to eat and carry the list with you to help keep you focused on your goal . <p> If you must be in a work or social environment where food is present , sit as far away as possible , and try to avoid facing the food . <p> Ask that person at work who always has food on his or her desk to put it in an opaque bowl with a lid . <p> Think about setting an example for others .

@@97602857 @1802857/ <h> The No S Diet : Reinhard Engels on his 13-word diet book ( as featured in Womans World ) <p> CalorieLab spoke with Reinhard Engels on the occasion of the publication in book form of his runaway internet diet plan success story , " The No S Diet , " soon to be a Womans World cover diet . Engels himself previously described the No S Diet in a September 2006 guest post on CalorieLab ( the diet has been simplified to 13 words from 14 since then ) , and CalorieLab contributor Robert S. Wieder later riffed on the concept with several tongue-in-cheek alphabet-based diets of his own . <p> CalorieLab : Congratulations on your book , The No S Diet , which was published by Perigee Press earlier this month ! You describe it as one of the simplest and easiest-to-follow diets ever devised . Given that , could you quickly describe how it works ? <p> Engels : Sure . Very quickly , in fact . You can find the whole system on the cover of the book : " No Snacks , No Sweets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. " <p> CalorieLab : That 's it ? <p> Engels : That 's it . You eat three meals a day off an ordinary plate . It can be anything you want , other than sweets . And you are exempt from these rules on the weekends and " special days . " <p> CalorieLab : And this actually works ? <p> Engels : I admit it does seem suspiciously cute . And frankly , I do n't  think I was completely serious when I came up with the system in late 2001 , to try to solve my own personal weight problem . But then I actually lost 40 pounds and found that I was able to keep it off over time . Since I 'm a software engineer , when I saw that my system actually was actually yielding results , it seemed natural to put up a website about it +G www.nosdiet.com . And to my surprise , despite the fact that I have no diet or fitness credentials whatsoever , other people took a gamble on " cute " and tried the system , and some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 , 100 pounds. +- <p> CalorieLab : How do you account for this success ? <p> Engels : I think that the simplicity of the system which some readers may see as just a gimmick is actually key to this . To quote Albert Einstein , its " as simple as possible , but not simpler . " All other diets start and end as a series of conscious decisions : avoid this kind of food , count this substance . But you ca n't count unconsciously . You cant detect the glycemic index of foods unconsciously . These behaviors are way too complicated for that . <p> The No S Diet , like these other diets , starts as a bunch of conscious rules , but what 's different about it is that its rules are simple and natural enough that they gradually become routine and automatic . They become habits . And that 's the key to sustainability . <p> CalorieLab : What do you mean when you say that the rules are " natural ? " <p> Engels : By " natural " I mean that they resemble traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Usually , when the diet of a particular thin and healthy culture is examined , its the differences that are emphasized , such as eating some unique " miracle food . " But the thing is , the " miracle foods " for all these cultures are all completely different from one another . How can these profoundly different factors account for the common end result , a thin and healthy population ? I think it makes more sense , instead of asking what makes a particular skinny culture unique , to ask what all the skinny cultures have in common +G and what we had in common with them before we got so fat . The answer is not miracle foods . The answer is certain broad patterns of eating , certain behaviors . For example , in these cultures , whether you 're talking about France or Okinawa , eating is meal based , formal , and social rather than the 21st century U.S. status quo of being snack-based , casual and solitary . Big , multi-course feasts and sweet treats are reserved for publicly recognized special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hungry " means in this age of superabundance . It might never been formulated exactly as Ive done it , but No-S provides a close enough approximation to these traditional eating patterns to resonate deeply . <p> So in a sense , even though the No-S Diet book only came out early this month , and the No-S Diet web site is only 6 years old , the No S way of eating has been around for ages . There is deep historical and broad cultural precedent for eating like this . Its not some strange , new , risky thing . Someone on the websites forums suggested renaming it the " grandma diet . " <p> CalorieLab : Why did you choose these particular " S " rules ? " <p> Engels : Not just because they start with the letter S +G though it certainly is convenient that they do . The esses ( snacks , sweets , and seconds ) represent the three biggest , most egregious forms of dietary excess : stuff that you really do n't  need , stuff that 's easy to identify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are n't  going to be miserable going without ( at least until the weekend ) . And , as I 've already mentioned , this is all stuff that we have historically gone without , for the most part . <p> CalorieLab : Are n't  these rules open to abuse ? What if someone piles on an enormous plate ? <p> Engels : Technically , you can do this . You can pile your plate a mile high . But I can pretty much guarantee that you wo n't . Because itll look awful . Even if you live alone by yourself in a cave , you 'll be too embarrassed to do this . <p> One of the core ideas behind the No S Diet is that merely by making excess visible , you provide a very effective disincentive . People permit themselves to overeat in large part because they deceive themselves about how much they are eating . If you forced them to see how much they were eating , they just would n't do it . And that 's what you do when you limit yourself to three single-plate meals a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unavoidably obvious when you 're eating too much . Not only can you eyeball excess like this +G its hard not to . No counting , weighing , or manuals required . <p> This visual disincentive might not work every single time . You will eat some individual overloaded plates . But over many hundreds and thousand of single plate meals , over a lifetime of meals , itll work often enough . And that 's all you should really care about . <p> Engels : " No snacks " is the rule people seem to have the most trouble accepting . But I think its also the most important rule . <p> People act as if snacking is this natural thing that would be cruel to deprive themselves of . But the truth is , historically speaking , snacking is a very recent eating behavior . No one did it to any degree worth mentioning until very recently +G when we promptly started getting fat . According to an analysis of USDA food consumption data by David Cutler at Harvard University , 90 percent of the increase in calorie consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from snacks , from between meal eating . For women , its 112 percent calories from meals have actually gone down . <p> So with this one rule , just two words , you 've got a 90-plus percent solution to the problem of over-consumption . I think that 's pretty compelling . <p> You 'll find the same correlation when you look at the issue across societies : obesity rates move in step with calories derived from snacking . The skinny French snack on average less than once a day compared to our three . The even skinnier Chinese barely snack at all . <p> I think the reason snackers eat so much more food is simple : its impossible for them to keep track of how much they 're eating without resorting to unsustainable behaviors like counting calories . They ca n't eyeball excess anymore , as they could with discrete meals . Excess sneaks right past them in lots of tiny increments , none of which seems like much in itself , but it adds up , at the end of the day , to a tremendous amount . <p> Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear anything but pro-snack messages ? I think its simply a matter of " follow the money . " You cant sell " no snacks . " Snacks , on the other hand , especially the booming " healthy " snack segment , are a multibillion-dollar industry . And , disturbingly , the surest sign of having made it as a diet guru these days is having your name on an " energy bar " of some sort , so they 're all in on it , too . <p> CalorieLab : You say " no sweets " during the week , but does that mean no sugar at all ? <p> Engels : No , and that 's an important distinction . " No sweets " means no foods where the primary source of calories comes from added sugar +G stuff that obviously tastes sweet . A good rule of thumb is , its a sweet if it tastes sweet enough to be a dessert : so cookies , cake , sugar soda , candy bars , Cocoa Puffs . If the rule were " no sugar , at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients and making yourself and everyone around you crazy . And there 's really no need to . The obvious part of the problem is most of the problem . <p> CalorieLab : What do you mean by " days that start with S ? " <p> Engels : Saturdays , Sundays and " special " days . Special days are major national , religious , and personal holidays +G days when you probably would n't have dieted anyway , so you might as well not feel guilty about it . <p> There are no explicit rules on S-days . You can eat whatever you want . You have total freedom . Some people find this scary at first , but for most people I think its enormously liberating . Eventually , most people find that S-days work best when they just break one or two of the rules to give themselves a treat . <p> S-days are a safety valve , an incentive and a reward for good behavior during the week . Realistically , there 's no way most of us are going to go without sweets or even just freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving vent to this in a controlled way without having it boil over unpredictably .

If you know you can have that cupcake your officemate is eating that all you have to do is wait till Saturday you 'll have a much better chance of resisting temptation than if you knew you could never legitimately have it . <p> CalorieLab : Is the No S Diet hard to stick with over time ? <p> Engels : Its hard in a different way than most other diets . It can seem harder at first because it does n't  pretend that there is some trick to bypassing the work of building new habits +G it does take willpower and patience and discipline . But the hard part is all up front . Once you get past this initial hump , once you 've turned the rules into unconscious habits , it gets easier and easier . <p> This is in stark contrast to the way other diets work . Forbidden-foods diets , like Atkins , seem great at the outset , because you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compensate for never eating pasta or pizza or potatoes again . But it gets old fast . You really start to miss the forbidden foods . And then you crack . Counting calories is the same way . It can be fun for a week . Sort of a game . But after a few months it becomes a time-consuming chore . Every meal becomes a math assignment . Its almost a tossup whether you 'd be more miserable sticking your diet or quitting and getting fat again . <p> Which brings me to another great thing about the No S Diet : its never really hard in the sense of being unpleasant , even at the very beginning . It might take discipline , it might take patience , but it does n't  take suffering . In fact , you 'll enjoy food more . The spotlight of three single-plate meals does n't  just catch excess , it focuses appreciation . And you 'll enjoy your sweets on weekends and holidays more than you ever did before . <p> Lastly , its socially unobtrusive . People do n't  have to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan , for instance . Most of the time , they wont even notice you 're on a diet , much less be inconvenienced by it . <p> CalorieLab : How long does it take to see results ? <p> Engels : It varies tremendously , though since its a very moderate , long-term diet , results tend to be slow . I tell people not to think about results at all +G but to focus on behavior instead , on achieving a consistent minimum level of compliance with the literal rules . Instead of obsessing over the scale , which most people are not psychologically equipped to handle , get a calendar and mark off successful days in green , failures in red , and exempt S-days in yellow +G or use the free online Habit Calendar found at nosdiet.com . That way you keep the focus on what is directly under your control . Do this well for a month and results will follow +G sustainable results . Youll have built a results-generating factory of good habits . <p> CalorieLab : How did the book come about ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the usual " send out a proposal and deal with a thousand rejections " thing . An editor at Penguin saw that a lot of people on the bulletin board of another diet book shed published ( The Shangri La Diet ) kept on referencing the No-S Diet , so she emailed me to ask whether I 'd be interested in writing a book . So basically the book deal fell in my lap . Writing the book with two small children at home , a demanding day job , and a website to run , took a bit of sleep deprivation , but having that deal in place was a huge incentive . <p> CalorieLab : Who is your co-author ? <p> Engels : Ben Kallen is a freelance health and nutrition writer , formerly a staff writer for Mens Fitness and Shape . He had originally contacted me about turning another one of my self-improvement websites into a book ( Shovelglove , the sledgehammer workout ) . So when I got the No-S Diet offer , it was a no-brainer to ask Ben to help . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Engels : Since I 'm not a celebrity or an expert with impressive credentials , we basically had no choice but to let the book speak for itself . Fortunately , it seems to be doing that rather well . People really seem to like it . They like the diet itself , but they also seem to appreciate the tone of the book , because it does n't  take itself too seriously . <p> So , our main promotional tactic has been to send copies of the book out to media sources that might be willing to review it . If we can get people to actually pick up the book and look inside , its better advertising than anything else we could do . The LA Times listed it as one of " Ten Hot Diets " a week after it was published . I 've landed a number of radio interviews . And Womans World is doing a cover story on the No S Diet , coming out April 7th . <p> CalorieLab : How did the Womans World cover story happen ? <p> Engels : We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she really liked it . She told me that she reads a lot of diet books in her line of work , and that while most of these are terrible , she really enjoyed ours . I put her in touch with some successful No-S dieters from the website and she was impressed by their stories . She told me its very unusual and promising for a diet to have success stories before the book is published . The only tricky bit was that we needed a young and " very attractive " female cover model who had actually done No-S . I was a little nervous that we would n't find someone in time , because though I knew a lot of No-S dieters on the bulletin board met their requirements in terms of age and weight loss , I was n't sure if anyone would be interested in adding " cover girl " to their resume . I kept my fingers crossed and ran an impromptu little " beauty contest " on the forum how I managed to do this without being completely offensive I still do n't  know but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) was rubbed the wrong way , and I quickly got loads of pictures from beautiful No-S dieters ( thank you again , if you are reading this ! ) . In less than a week , the Womans World editors settled on their choice , and booked her a flight for a photo shoot in New York City . <p> CalorieLab : Do you have any other plans for new products or services relating to the diet beyond the book and your free Web site ? Any further books ? <p> Engels : One of the nice things about the No S Diet is that it does n't  require any additional products or services . You do n't  need any special scales or meals or shakes or bars . You do n't  need to buy anything extra from me or anyone else . All you need is less food . You 'll actually save money . Something astonishingly rare in the diet world . <p> But diet is not the only problem I 've thought about , and I do have a number of other free self-improvement systems besides the No-S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have also attracted a bit of a following . They share the same common-sense and humorous approach and the emphasis on habit , on psychology and motivation rather than physiology . Theres Shovelglove , the sledgehammer workout you can do in your living room ; Urban Ranger , an inspirational metaphor to bring back purposeful walking into your life ; Weekend Luddite , for managing electronic distractions ; and an interactive " Habit Calendar " to track and build new habits . And a bunch more . I have a hub site called everydaysystems.com to link these all together . So , I think there 's at least one more books worth of material . If I can convince enough people buy the No-S Diet to get a publisher interested I 'd be delighted to write it . <p> CalorieLab : What is your background ? <p> Engels : I studied English Literature as an undergrad and trained as a librarian , but I somehow wound up as a computer programmer writing bioinformatics visualization tools at MIT . I have absolutely zero relevant credentials in terms of diet or fitness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athlete , but I actually think this lack of credentials and fame is a plus . <p> For one thing , Im convinced that overeating is not a problem that requires obscure , expert knowledge . The solution is obvious . You need a way to see the excess that you 're cramming into yourself the spotlight of 3 single plate meals a day . And then you wo n't overeat . Its that simple . Its about preventing self-deception , not mysterious food substances . <p> Taking diet and fitness advice from celebrities and athletes is also a terrible idea . People who get paid millions of dollars a year to be in top physical shape are not going to have anything relevant to say to the vast majority of us who are n't  . The secret behind ALL of those Hollywood diets is six or more figures of financial incentive if you had someone offering you that much money to be thin , believe me , youd figure it out too , somehow . <p> So , paradoxically , being an ordinary working schlump juggling kids and a totally unrelated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . <h> 7 Responses to " The No S Diet : Reinhard Engels on his 13-word diet book ( as featured in Womans World ) " <p> I love this idea of the No " S " s .

We know something is wrong , but we cant quite figure out how to make that change happen . Life is giving us messages , yet do we listen to them or turn a deaf ear to the growing noise ? Sometimes we can look at something right in front of us and still not see it . Rather than focus on the go of life , maybe the answer is in knowing what to stop ! <p> Stop saying you are a work in progress unless there is actual progress . Put your emphasis on the work part and there will be progress . <p> Stop waiting for tomorrow . If it has n't  come by today , it is not coming .

You can do most things if you take the time to learn the skill . If there is something that challenges you , learn to do it . Saying you cant is rarely the truth , you just do n't  want to . <p> Stop saying you are trying when you are not . Climbing halfway up a mountain is trying . Standing at the bottom and looking up is not . <p> Stop doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results . What you have been doing is not working . Do something different , not the same behaviors that do not work .

Just making that one simple diet change removing soda and other sugar-sweetened drinks such as sports drinks and juice drinks can help you peel off the pounds . In fact , a recent article published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition pointed out that just 12 ounces of sugar-laced soda a day could pile on 15 pounds in a year . <p> Just do the math . The most popular soft drink sold nowadays is a 20-ounce bottle or can , which comes to 250 unnecessary calories and nearly 17 teaspoons of sugar . The sugar is usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obesity and other health woes . <p> I 'm not even talking about those popular , humongous 42-ounce soft drinks promoted at some fast food restaurants and many convenience stores .

Here are eight tips to curtail your soda guzzling when you hanker for this empty-calorie beverage : <p> Drink water . Drink a glass of good old water instead .

This is much more flavorful and satisfying than a soda . <p> Try green vegetable juice . If you 're really adventurous and really want to get out from under your soda habit , drink a glass of green vegetable juice instead . ( As you 'll notice , I 'm not recommending fruit juice , because that can be quite high in sugar , too . ) <p> Give goat yogurt a chance ! Be daring and concoct your own blended goats milk yogurt beverage with cinnamon or nutmeg .

When you 're absolutely desperate and insist on having a soda , then share it with a friend so you only get half the calories , half the sugar , and half the caffeine that youd otherwise get . <p> Work hard for your soda . If you 're not ready to say no to soda just yet , then make yourself " earn " that empty-calorie , nutrient-free beverage . First take a walk for a half hour . Then jump rope for five minutes . Then play with a hula hoop for another five minutes . Then drink a glass of water . Next , before downing that soda , chew on an apple , pear , or some strawberries , with a handful of almonds .

Why ? Goals help you stay focused on the changes you have to make in your eating and exercise habits to get you to the weight you want to be . Goal setting is an organizational tool that provides the groundwork for successful weight loss . <p> Your main goal may be to drop 60 pounds by the end of the year or to fit back into your size 8 clothes by next month . That 's your long-term , or final , goal . Short-term and intermediate goals help you reach your long-term goals . For successful weight loss , that means setting daily or weekly food , exercise , psychological , and behavioral goals . <p> Food goals . These include your plans to change what you eat , how much you eat , or the types of food you eat , and might even include taking a cooking class , starting a collection of low-calorie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you most enjoy eating . The long-term goal for most dieters is to eat fewer calories , which often means eating less of certain types of food . Short-term goals toward that end include learning about portion control and starting to eat only single helpings of the foods you tend to overeat . <p> Exercise goals . You set exercise goals to increase your activity one way or another . Your short term exercise goal might be to join a gym or , if you already belong to a gym , to add another workout to your routine this week . If you 've reached a plateau and cant seem to lose any more weight , your short-term exercise goal might be to change your exercise routine to try to boost your metabolism . <p> Psychological goals . Changing your mindset is key to successful weight loss . Your psychological goals may include changing the way you think about yourself , about food , about exercise or about being a healthy person . Your long-term psychological goal may be to improve your self-esteem . In that case , your short-term goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to stop putting yourself down for your mistakes , or to seek psychological counseling to help you make changes you have n't been able to make on your own . <p> Behavioral goals . If your eating habits how fast you eat , eating on the run , skipping meals , etc. contribute to your weight problem then one of your long-term goals might be to improve them . To do this , start with short-term goals such as slowing yourself down by chewing food slowly and completely before you swallow , or putting your fork down between bites . In this way , goal setting will help you establish healthier habits that will help you lose weight . <p> Keep your goals simple and realistic . If you 're commitment phobic , it sometimes helps to set extremely short-term goals , to be accomplished within a matter of hours rather than within a day or a week .

And my first few days of running no doubt proved a little harder because I was more uncomfortable than I needed to be thanks to some old shoes and cobbled-together outfits . <p> At some point during the week I remembered that I had some old Ryka shoes ( even older than the Everlasts , but in much better shape ) that I 'd bought for working out at the gym back when we had a gym membership . The model is called Solace , and they do n't make them any more , but I think it may be an honest-to-goodness running shoe .

I did it the first time and sweltered , then I read an article that said that once you 're warmed up your body heat makes it feel 20 degrees warmer than the actual air temperature . <p> I do n't think my jogging sprints make that much of an impact , but I decided I needed to follow the article 's advice that I should be wearing shorts ( it recommends shorts when the temperature is over 55 ; it 's more like 70 when I 'm running ) . I guess a trip to the store is in order . <h> Pushing Through <p> For the final day of week one of Couch to 5K , I decided to head back to my neighborhood , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed the first cue because I was walking by a lawn mower at the time , so I go a little longer to make up for it .

As a runner , I did a quick calculation . 500 calories is five miles of running . Do it in 30 minutes . That 's five , 6-minute miles . That 's a pretty hard run ! I do n't think this unnamed circuitous company is being straight with me . <h> Just Tell Me the Truth <p> I 've long been an advocate of truth in advertising . You do n't want to know how many times I 've just yelled at the TV , " Just tell me the truth ! " <p> I found an interesting study , done by an independent body , evaluating the usual calorie burn by women at this curlicued facility . Researchers at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse in conjunction with the American Council on Exercise ( ACE ) monitored 15 healthy women aged 25 to 56 through two arched workouts . They concluded that each training session burned an average of 184 calories , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 calories for the lowest value . Their bottom line was that the typical catenary workout burned about as many calories as one would acquire by eating half a donut . I guess the good news is that if you try to balance your calorie intake with calorie usage , you wo n't have to be lamenting that you ate the whole thing . <h> Exaggeration of Calorie Usage Claims <p> It is all too common for exercise programs to exaggerate their calorie usage claims . After all , they are a business , and they are trying to sell their product as a removal tool for your product . ( One of the reasons I 've always suspected the scales at grocery stores weigh us less so we will buy more food . ) <p> It 's not just with a weight loss/ fitness business , almost every individual aerobic machine , exercise class , or fitness DVD or tool will make calorie burn claims that are inflated . Its important to remember that the calorie counts on machines are just estimates based on the makers standard , supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the size , muscle mass or experience of the exerciser . It is estimated that cardio machines can overestimate calories burned by from 10 percent to as much as 30 percent . Remembering the initial example of running 5 miles in 30 minutes , a better tool is using your perception of exertion based on experience and this will probably be your best guide . I know that from my experience with running . Whether I time my run or run for distance , I can make a very accurate estimate without a watch or using a measured course . <p> A similar thing with exaggerated and inaccurate numbers also occurs in aviation that every pilot must be aware of , since each airplane has official performance data that are considered accurate for the type of planes we fly . The problem is if we average pilots expect to achieve the same numbers for takeoff , cruise and landing distances that the professionals did when establishing them , we will at best be disappointed , and at worst , we will have a very bad day . <h> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key here is to not get too focused on numbers , unless possibly the scale , a tape measure or the size and fit of your favorite pair of jeans . The estimated calorie numbers do not mean anything if you are not losing weight or inches . In addition , I do not put much stock in all the added muscle you are building with an exercise program in the short term . Muscle is hard to build , and takes time to accomplish . If something is amiss , it is probably due to an over-estimation of calorie burn or an under-estimation of calorie intake . Because of this Ive rarely focused too much on calorie numbers , except in the beginning of my fitness journey when I educated myself on the basics of food and calorie contents , and now when a new food product or menu item appears . If I did n't see the results I was looking for , I 've always figured I needed to exercise a little more or eat a little less . <p> If you feel that keeping track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would suggest that in the beginning you under-estimate the calorie usage and over-estimate your calorie intake , then adjust prn ( as needed ) depending on the results you are experiencing . <p> One of the things that often derails weight loss attempts is being disappointed with the results of what we feel are sincere efforts . Not falling for exaggerated claims or inaccurate numbers , and staying focused on realistic goals will help you keep on keeping on . <p> Thank you Dr. J. for including the caveat about muscle . Muscle is hard to build even for a 17 year old boy who works out two hours per day , and eats everything but the family cat . The best study I have seen relating to this came University Of Texas about 10 years ago , when 500 women were assigned a rigorous 3-day per week workout plan , and a lean , protein based diet for 1 year . Of the participants who concluded the trial , the average net gain in lean body mass was under 1 pound . These were healthy women , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear this almost daily , " I have to eat more to support all the muslce I have gained .

As an example , some days my muscles feel sore ( maybe for no discernible reason ) . So on those days , I 'll do an easy slow jog , and not huff , or puff , or break a sweat . Rest is as important as pushing oneself . Of course , there are days when I feel like doing quite a bit of sprinting ( quite a bit being relative , of course , I am no super athlete ( ! ) , and so , I do . <p> Same goes with eating . Some days , I am pretty darn hungry , so I eat quite a bit . ( Try to eat slowly enough to gauge when I 've had enough . ) Other days , I do n't  feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . <p> I feel that my body knows what to do , and if I tune into its signals , than Im on the right track . <p> BTW , sorry for my disappearing actwe are selling a house , buying a house , its tax time , etc. , so I 'm a little swamped right now . <p> Interesting postI generally never pay attention to fitness ads . I love running and figure I 'm probably getting the biggest bang for my buck as far as exercise and calorie burn are concerned . To be honest though , I run to be strong and fast not to lose weight . I could definitely be substantially skinnier if I just walked instead of ran . Running makes me so hungry ! But I love it ! <p> One of my kickboxing instructors claims that his hour class burns 600 calories . It seems high , but its a fast class and I do n't  have the best grasp of calorie burn , nor intake . I just keep intake lower than burn , and all works out smooth . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked " probably around 1200 " , and I had to challenge him on that . He attributed most to afterburn , and was surprised to hear that that is very tiny , if it exists at all . <p> Regarding muscles , I do n't  think I build them . Under a steadily decreasing layer of flab , my legs and arms are rock hard , but I do n't  think they 've added any weight , nor bulk , just hardened . Do n't  really know , or care , how that works anymore than I care how many calories I ingest/burn . <p> If you feel that keeping track of the numbers is necessary for your successful efforts , I would suggest that in the beginning you under-estimate the calorie usage and over-estimate your calorie intake , then adjust prn ( as needed ) depending on the results you are experiencing . <p> YES , over estimate the calorie intake !

Our society loves to play the " fool ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true to yourself to get the results you want . <p> I do watch all of the above , calorie intake , my exercise , the scale .. yet I really count on how my clothes fit &amp; that pair of jeans I use to measure . <p> Loved this : staying focused on realistic goals will help you keep on keeping on . <p> YES ! <p> As for muscle , I am that rare case that builds muscle quicker than most even when I overtrain .

I have a poem about how I learnt : I 'll see if I can dig it up . I still swim twice a week at the gyms pool and will contu=inue to do so until summer when most mornings I 'll head down to the beach and swim for half an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly the most enjoyable though I used to enjoy running <p> I think some people cant swim due to their fear of water . My son suffers from this and due to this , its an immense struggle to teach him how to swim . Although he does love swimming pools and the ocean , he just cant get over the fear of putting his head under the water . I too have never heard of the " pool potatoes " term but very funny . <p> I 'm not a natural swimmer , nor a fan of cold water , waves , chlorine , sunscreen , goggles , or swimsuits riding up my ass , so do n't  tend to do much swimming . On the other hand , I 'm SO GLAD I was taught to swim at a young age . I have friends who did n't  learn , and they can never be quite comfortable being on boats or walking alongside piers or anywhere that a false step could mean drowning . <p> Water is for ingestion and cleaning , not recreation . Getting in over my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 100-degree day Besides , I sink like a rock . I know people who float , just without effort on their part . I 'd go six feet straight down in a six-foot pool . <p> I guess I would tend advise not getting into alligator-infested water inthe first place . : - ) <p> I learned to swim at a young age . I was actually very good &amp; won some competitions at the local pool but as I got older &amp; more " vain " about the crazy hair I have &amp; no longer wore it in braids like I did as a kid , well , no water sports for me ! ; - ) <p> I learned to swim at age 3 and never really looked back . I never swam competitively , but I have always felt very comfortable in the water . I got my lifeguard certification in high school and also became a pretty serious scuba diver . I swam a mile when I was in 9th grade . Swimming has never been an obstacle to me . <p> It always does blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to swim . I wonder how much they missed in their youth . <p> I was never really able to learn to swim as a child other than a weak self taught dog paddle . I went for swimming lessons as a child and because I was unable to learn to put my face in water without getting water up my nose and they would n't let me use a noseplug I had to drop out . <p> I started to associate the " chemical " smell of the pool with the fun of swimming , and it invigorated me to smell it . <p> It does make your hair a bit stiff , but if you shower before swimming and wear a silicone swim cap over the wet hair ( and shower afterwards , of course ) , the effect is minimal . And if your pool uses an ozone system , the amount of chlorine is smaller . <p> Athletes swim hours per day . The rest of us swim hours per week or month , so the exposure is n't so bad . <p> I live here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been enjoying exploring my back yard . I have been hiking in the mountains of the Kennebec Highlands for an hour+ and then swim a half mile on the open water of Long Pond most days . The swim takes about 30 minutes ( of course , more if the water is choppy and the weather is windy ) . The water is very cold and feels great after working up a sweat on the mountain . I am not breaking a sweat with my swim , in part , because once I 'm a quarter of a mile out from shore I want to be sure to make it back safely ( there are some fishing camps nearby ) . Plus , my technique rots . I 'm doing a kind of modified breaststroke . I enjoy looking around at the beautiful wildlife : osprey , loons , ducks , blue heron , bald eagles and keep an eye out for moose ( they can really make time in the water ) . I would like to know how much strength and how much cardiovascular training I 'm getting from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighs 163 pounds and is 53 ? . Can someone please help me determine this ? Thanks . <p> First , I think it is wonderful that you are doing this and enjoying it as you do ! <p> There are calculators on-line that can tell you how many calories you are burning . I need to say , however , that swimming is not the best way to lose weight if that is what you are trying to do . For the most part , we need to raise our body temperature to burn fat , and being in water , especially cold water really limits this . Because of that , we tend to burn carbohydrates mostly with swimming . That leads to our getting hungry soon after swimming and most people then eat too much to lose weight . I would suggest you add a walking program to your swimming , thirty minutes to one hour a day . In addition , there is some thought that swimming causes us to add fat as insulation to our bodies , just as seen in water dwelling mammals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour or more each day up the small mountains in the surrounding woods . I figure that gets my heart thumping , tones up my muscles and is good for the bones in my lower body . Recently , some great chanterelle mushroom varieties are ready for harvest . That has transformed my hikes into mushroom walks . I could spend hours in the woods , which is why I always carry a compass and a map . The swimming is for enjoyment as well as exercise . My arms in particular are much more muscular and toned since I started my Summer swims . The real challenge will be transitioning into a Fall/Winter routine . I do 90 minutes of yoga twice a week . I switch over to snowshoeing in place of hiking . I have n't been swimming ( other than during the Summer ) I 'm not a big fan of pools . But , there are a number of pools in the nearby cities of Farmington , Waterville and Augusta ( each about a half hour away ) . I would like to improve on my swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weight loss , that 's a no go . I would very much like to lose weight . Unfortunately , quitting smoking on July 19 has led to weight gain not loss . I 've gone from 155 163 . Its enough to drive me back to smoking ( my resolve is week ) . <p> Please do not continue to smoke , it is THE most unhealthy behavior there is and it has negative affects on everything ! <p> I apologize for not noticing that you hiked . If you truly want to lose weight you need to journal what you are eating with accurate portion amounts so you know how many calories you are consuming . I imagine you will be surprised . Then decrease your calorie consumption so you are in a negative balance , but not to severe and just stick with it . As you make progress you will learn more about your needs as well as find the motivation you need to be succewsful. 
@@97602907 @1802907/ <h> Do You Have to be Fat to Understand Fatness ? <h> If so , there goes Dean Ornishs gig . And mine . <p> Charles Passy , a financial columnist for Dow Jones , has written a fascinating and , to me , somewhat unsettling column for marketwatch.com on a subject he knows intimately : being a fat man . <p> The piece is fascinating because of his basic attitude toward fatness , which is ambivalence . On the one hand , he freely discusses having " paid a price for " his own personal fatness , both financially in thousands of dollars spent on weight-loss programs and finally bariatric surgery and emotionally and psychologically , in being the butt of others and his own jokes , having to master " the art of self-deprecation , " and living with the fat mans " hidden shame of who he is and fear of what will become of him health-wise . " <p> And yet Passy is almost pugnacious in his insistence that fatness is not some kind of character flaw or shortcoming . He dismisses what he calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Christie as an example of a fat guy with the willpower of a bulldozer . He also discounts ignorance and indifference as obesity causes : " Were not fat because we want to be . " What it boils down to , he declares , is that , " We just like to eat . If you do n't  get it , good for you . " <p> The problem is , I do n't  get it , and maybe that is n't particularly good for me , given that I am paid to write about obesity and overweight and dieting and related subjects . That brings us to the part of his piece I found unsettling . The part where he stated , " It takes a fat man to understand another fat man . The thin man will never understand the fat man . " If he s correct , I am somewhat over a barrel , given that I am not fat and never have been . I have n't always been thin , but I 've always been closer to that than to fat , and always within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : does that disqualify me from writing about overweight and obesity ? Do I have no business commenting on a condition that I do n't  share and thus ca n't truly understand ? This is n't the first time I 've mulled over those questions , and it probably wont be the last , but , confronted with Passys point of view , I feel obliged to decide what my answer is . And my answer to both questions is No . <p> For one thing , I have the exquisite cover provided by my esteemed fellow columnist Dr. J , who discusses these subjects on a regular basis and who , for sheer fit-and-trimness , probably makes me look like a sack of cornmeal . He embodies the fact that you can bring valid opinions and genuine expertise to the subject of excess weight regardless of your body type . Passys own cardiologist is n't a fat man , but it was that doctors assurance that Passy was a heart attack waiting to happen that convinced him to get his stomach banded . Beyond that , people who write about NASCAR drivers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly understand them either , but they can still know the subject matter . <p> And finally , its equally possible that being a fat man would lend a perspective to my view of overweight and obesity that would render me less able to write about the subject objectively . In fact , I think that may be the case with Passy , in one respect . He dismisses the " willpower " issue rather offhandedly , concluding that " I do n't  think I lack willpower , either . " But this is a guy who admits that he hated being fat , or at least hated most of the things that went with being fat other than the eating ; a guy who spent a fortune on , and I quote , " Weight Watchers , Jenny Craig , Slim-Fast , low-carb dieting , hi-carb dieting , Overeaters Anonymous , hypnotherapy , nutritional counseling and a few types of medications " and who ultimately underwent a major surgical procedure that kills one in every hundred patients , and all of this because , " for some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> There may be some significant difference between an inability to resist food on the one hand and insufficient willpower on the other , but I 'm having a hard time making the distinction . Indeed , my first impulse might be to say , " Come off it , Charlie , you just ca n't stand up to your appetite . " But then I remember that I 'm a thin man . And maybe he s right ; maybe I just do n't  understand . Which I can happily live with . Because if I can only understand fat people by becoming a fat person myself , forget it . No deal . Let me simply cite the last line of Passys column : " The fat man always wishes he was thin . " <h> 10 Responses to " Do You Have to be Fat to Understand Fatness ?

Food does become central to many obese peoples lives . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) thing , you would n't understand " statement . I think any empathetic person can understand . <p> I feel willpower in one area does not translate to willpower in every area . <p> A doctor does not need to have or have had a disease to be able to understand or treat it . <p> Your writing and understanding of the whole health , wellness , and fitness area is excellent , and I feel that all of your readers , including myself , are lucky that you have dedicated your skills to this arena !

My lifelong interest in health has led me to become a certified personal trainer . On the other hand the majority of my potential clients are not going to be in a good or excellent health condition . I want to understand them as a friend and a mentor to create a change that is more than physical . <p> Hi Robert , Well , I think both perspectives are useful . Sometimes a cooler detached mind says that logical thing that needs to be said , especially those things based upon science . <p> On the other hand , having personally gone through losing about 55 pounds and keeping most of that off for several years now , that experience helps me personally connect to others about the mindset issues . <p> If it were as simple as getting fit and eating less calories , everyone would just *simply* do that . Nobody wants to be fat and have jokes made about them . However , as anyone who has been called " fat " knows , there is a bunch of mind games involved . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind games in order to succeed . On my blog , I often address mindset to lose weight . So both perspectives are needed . <p> I 'm a 350 lb woman who has lost 120lbs and kept it off for 4 years . I kept that weight off by making some changes to my life that I could live with for the rest of my life . Now I am looking for and experimenting with other changes . Some things I can live with and some are a disaster for me . I think many people regardless of their size or experience have valuable things to say that I can use . I also think maybe have truths to share that work for them and at least at this time I do not comprehend what they are talking about . Nobody gets to speak for all of any type of person ! That 's my opinion anyway ! <p> This is an interesting perspective . I am overweight , and have been told that I am obese with a BMI of over 30 ( last calc @ 33 ) . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times have been able to loose 20 odd lbs , only to put it back on . here 's the deal though , I am fitter than most people , I can ride my road bike for 100 miles anytime , I ride about 200 mi a week , I am active every day in intense activety , at 50+ years my max heart rate is 185 , and my recovery to time to 100 is less than 30 seconds , my resting heart rate is 55 . So I am fit big deal I suffer from the traits of being fat I am diagnosed as pre-diabetic and my physician is testingme for high blood pressure . I am a fat man wishing I was thin and someday I will get there . I do n't  think you need to be fat to understand what being fat is , I believe that fat people need support from others to continue the efforts to maintain or improve their health , and Iprefer to be consulted by a thin person . Having a fat person instruct me on life choices to get thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sometimes , we need to experience a certain thing so that we can fully understand the feeling of having a certain condition or situation but it does n't  mean we need to gamble all the time , we can learn by other peoples experience , in fact we can read a lot of articles on what we like to know . <p> Greetings , I am pleased to share with the group , some of very interesting finding of our research on HIV / AIDS , ( the objective was to find out CURE for HIV/AIDS ) .

Laboratory studies ( in vitro ) of this project were carried out in Nagoya University , Japan and clinical trials were conducted in Pakistan . Thirty one HIV / AIDS +ve patients were treated with the test compound , 17 of them were cured ( post treatment PCR negative ) and in 9 patients mean viral load decreased by more then ( 72% ) . p value &lt;0.001 .

I have been addicted to food , starving , exercise , etc . I have had some very great conversations with people who have been addicted to drugs and alcohol .

When shes not writing or speaking , she conducts a private nutrition practice in Jamestown , New York . <p> Studies keep linking diets high in red meat with increased cancer risk . Could part of the risk from large amounts of meat reflect an unhealthful balance between vegetables and meat ? The Mediterranean and Asian eating patterns have a well-established link with lower cancer risk . These diets both limit meat and strongly emphasize an abundance of vegetables . <p> One reason the vegetable-to-meat balance might be so important are compounds in vegetables that act on potentially harmful substances produced by meat . When meat is processed , smoked , grilled , fried or cooked well done , it can lead to the formation of carcinogens that can damage DNA and begin the process of cancer development . Several types of compounds in vegetables ( and fruits ) stimulate enzymes that convert such carcinogens to inactive forms , which are then excreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cauliflower and cabbage are especially known for compounds called isothiocyanates . These compounds take aim at meat-formed carcinogens . Studies suggest that meat is one of the major causes of colon cancer . Research shows that people who eat about four , half-cup servings of cruciferous vegetables weekly may reduce their risk of colon cancer by 20 to 50 percent . <p> Garlic and onions contain sulfide compounds that can also inactivate meat-formed carcinogens . In a large analysis of several studies , people who ate four to five cloves of garlic a week were 31 percent less likely to develop colon cancer compared to people who ate from zero to one clove per week . <p> Vegetables also provide dietary fiber , which can bind to heterocyclic amines ( HCAs ) , one class of carcinogens produced when meat is cooked at high temperatures . When fiber binds to HCAs , it may prevent HCAs from being absorbed out of the digestive tract . The HCAs are then excreted before they can travel through the body and damage cells . <p> Diets high in meat and low in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause an increase in free radicals , which can damage DNA . It can also lead to cells reproducing too quickly , leaving less time to repair possible DNA damage that can lead to cancer . Vegetables provide antioxidant vitamins and protective compounds that prevent and possibly repair DNA damage from free radicals . People who followed a Mediterranean-style diet for two years had blood levels that showed a 40 percent lower level of inflammation than that of a control group . The control group was asked to follow a low-fat diet without the emphasis on such healthful foods as fruits , vegetables and olive oil . <p> Researchers now suggest that one reason red meat is linked to so much more cancer risk than poultry and fish may involve its higher content of a particular form of iron called heme iron . Studies indicate that heme iron may damage the lining of the colon . Some preliminary laboratory studies show that heme iron may interact with estrogen in promoting hormone-related cancers , such as breast and prostate cancers . <p> A diet high in vegetables may help to balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rats given food with added heme iron showed a 50 percent increase in colon cell growth . The amounts fed to the rats are equivalent to humans eating two-and-a-half cups of cooked spinach and five ounces of red meat daily . <p> Follow-up studies showed that chlorophyll the substance in vegetables that makes them green kept heme iron from damaging colon cells and beginning the cancer process . If this comparison to humans is accurate , green vegetables have a reasonable chance to reduce risk from red meat kept to the recommended limit of three ounces or less a day . <p> ( This article was provided by the American Institute for Cancer Research in Washington , D.C.

There are many voices in our heads . Some are from our parents or other authority figures from our childhoods telling us what we should and should n't do with our lives . Some are from ourselves , but they are more that rebellious voice left over from those formative years , always saying the opposite to all the " shoulds " we 've heard . Finding your true path amid the many voices may not be as easy a task as we might imagine when we first begin our voyage . <h> Do What You Love <p> " Do what you love " is a commonly heard refrain from those in the know . That phrase has probably led a lot of people to either waste their lives looking for " it , " or feeling that they are wasting their lives because they are not doing " it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you cant do . We have a limited amount of time and energy to live our dream . In my opinion , we will have a much more fulfilling life if we live the dream we can than to try to dream the dream we cant . <p> One frustrating behavior I see is where people decide what the " it " is and put all their time and energy into going for it despite the enormous amount of feedback that the world gives them that this dream of theirs is totally unattainable , unrealistic , and destructive both financially and emotionally to their lives and the lives of those near and dear to them . <p> The other behavior I see is where people are not willing to seek a compromise in their lives . They may have to make the sacrifice and do the often-unpleasant work that is required . Then they will still be able to do what they love , but perhaps as their hobby or avocation rather than their primary job or vocation . <h> Are Sayings Always Helpful ? <p> Focusing on sayings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful . If we look hard enough , we can always find a saying to support any dysfunctional behavior or failure . I once knew someone that left a serious path of destruction in her wake as she always justified her actions with the saying , " Be true to yourself . " The solution is not in finding a justifiable saying , its to stop doing those destructive behaviors and to have some successes ! <h> Behaviors and Feelings That Can Hold Us Back <p> Always staying within our comfort zone is a behavior that will often keep us from finding our way , and really , that has never kept anyone that comfortable . If we ever want to be successful , we must run , walk or crawl from that form of safety . Why do you think your mother had to push ? If it was left up to us , I suspect most of us would have stayed in the womb . Its too late to get back in , so I suggest you get out of that self-constructed comfort womb you have made , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and it is suffocating the person your mom wanted you to be . Remember , she did the pushing . <p> Pretending that we want to be different when we really do n't  is another road to nowhere . Perhaps its those secondary gains such as getting sympathy from others , or maybe we enjoy being a martyr . Believe me , some people like the ease of failure more than the exhilaration of success . They are experts in finding ways to fail . Of course , those reasons are never because of their actions . <p> Another dead-end trail is never being open to hearing the truth about the mistakes we have been making . Digging in and being determined to prove everyone wrong , then suddenly becoming a success , rarely if ever happens . Trust me , if that type of success happens , it will be to someone else . Probably , a friend of your second cousin read about them on the Internet . <p> Some people get caught in the falsely satisfying way of thinking that they are always trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are two main types of trying . If we are trying to climb a mountain , for example , and we get halfway up to the summit , that 's trying .

Its important to know the difference . <h> Behaviors and Feelings That Will Move Us Forward <p> Focus on what you can do and not on what you cant . Focus on what you do have , not what you do n't  have . There were plenty of things that I have loved to do in life , but I knew I did not have the talent nor makeup to turn them into something that would sustain me . I still do many of them , just not as my primary activity . <p> Like that old song refrain , if you cant do what you love , perhaps you can learn to love what you do . There is a lot of truth in this .

Not at all ! <p> I was also thinking of the Stones when I read this : You cant always get what you want , . you just might get what you need . I 'll admit it though , thanks in part to Oprah , I 'd love to find something that 's my " passion . " <p> Karens Stones reference is interesting , because I was reminded of the Crosby , Stills &amp; Nash lyric , " If you ca n't be with the one you love , love the one you 're with . " Perhaps a good dieters version would be , " If you cant eat whatever you enjoy , try to enjoy whatever you can eat . " <p> Like Karen , I thought of the Stones song , too ! Sometimes you just have to go with what you need , but I still believe you should go after your dreams , as long as they are realistic . Its a healthy balance . <p> I 'm not a big one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " What will be will be . " Well , sometimes yes , and sometimes no . If you take no action to change things , then " what will be will be , " but there are times when you can change what would have been . <p> A very thought provoking post &amp; yes , lots of truth to it . I think the key is finding the balance &amp; also not giving up too soon . With the many negative voices in many peoples heads , sometimes a person could really do something if they tried &amp; worked hard enough at it . The voices may stop them too early so the balance is what is important IMHO . <p> As for sayings I like them . They do n't  necessarily make me go one way or another they just make me think &amp; that is a good thing to me <p> Hi Dr. J , So much to think about here ! I agree with everything you say in this post actually . One reason why I do n't  read Oprah magazine anymore is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current life is not good enough , and you should always be striving to be your best self , find your " true " calling , etc . I like my life the way it is now ! I do have my area that needs to be worked on ( and I think we know what it is ! ) and in that area I will keep striving to improve . It is definitely a comfort to come home and sit down and eat a ton of chocolate . That is the cocoon of comfort that I want to get away from , but it keeps calling me back . <p> What a nice refreshing change from all the magical thinking that permeates the personal growth literature ! <p> Pursuing impossible dreams against huge odds and finding success is such a prevalent cultural staple in books , movies etc that people have come to believe its a birthright . Many of these dreams are at their core , narcissistic fantasies , and not worth giving up a productive happy life to chase after . <p> Which does n't  mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-selling novel someday ! But real life is right here and waiting to be savored and it took me a ridiculously long time to figure that out . <p> Regarding stepping out of comfort zones : I have always found that I initially began without being motivated , but just willing to take a chance on myself . <p> Most of our " risk-taking " really is n't at the level of being dangerous to our health . If we properly categorize it as " little chances " on ourselves instead of " risk " taking , it does n't  seem like a very big deal . <p> Though , oftentimes that " little chance " on ourselves makes all the difference . And one " little chance " on ourselves leads to another , that leads to another .

@@97602919 @1802919/ <h> Junk food advertising to kids a voluntary response ? <p> Parke Wilde is an assistant professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University in Boston . On his blog he writes about food policy and nutrition economics issues from a public interest perspective . <p> A leading national scientific panel this month concluded that junk food advertising to children harms their health and contributes to the childhood obesity epidemic . The new report from the Institute of Medicine ( IOM ) at the National Academies , the scientific advisor to the federal government , vindicated what consumer groups have been saying for years . The food industrys response to the report sounds good at first hearing , but falls short . <p> A press release from the Grocery Manufacturers of America ( GMA ) proposed exceedingly modest improvements to the Childrens Advertising Review Unit ( CARU ) , the industrys nearly toothless effort at self-regulation . Believe it or not , even this weak response represents a reversal from the GMAs position two years earlier , when the trade association criticized consumer groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . <p> Some food companies have sought to make more serious voluntary changes . Kraft , for example , earned praise earlier this year for proposing curbs on childrens advertising for Chips Ahoy and Oreos . But , as we saw with McDonalds and Hardees this year , voluntary progress by leading companies merely opens up marketing room for still worse promotions by the wannabes . It makes me surprised that the companies with the best reputations , who have most to lose from parents continuing fear and distress about junk food , have continued to insist that voluntary responses will suffice . In many ways , stronger public policy changes serve the interests of these companies better . <p> The IOM report has an excellent restrained policy proposal in its recommendations . It suggests that Congress should mandate a change in childrens advertising away from junk food and toward healthful alternatives , unless the food industry makes this change on its own . I doubt the latter will happen unless we close our eyes and pretend that progress from just a couple companies suffices so the IOM report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , I would always be happy to be surprised . <h> One Response to " Junk food advertising to kids a voluntary response ? " <p> BACKGROUND : A chemist has created a protein solution that can be used to coat fish . When the fish is then deep-fried , it contains 50-percent less fat than if it had been deep-fried without the coating . <p> HOW IT WORKS : Fish is bathed in a liquid of water and protein molecules that have been taken from a slurry of chicken or fish tissue . This forms a thin shield around the meat . When it is submerged in oil , the coating keeps fat from being absorbed from the fryer .

@@97602924 @1802924/ <h> BMI and Its Alternatives : Dr. J Reviews the Obesity Indices <p> ( CC BY-ND 2.0 ) Helga Weber/Flickr <p> A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) seems to favor the use of waist circumference to alert us to the probably obvious fact that we are fat and therefore unhealthy . Too much fat around the waist is associated with a significantly increased risk for heart disease , type 2 diabetes , and death . <p> However , before discussing that study , I though we should look at the current king of fat indices , the BMI , and the various other obesity index contenders . <h> Body Mass Index : BMI <p> The BMI , or body mass index , is the gold standard measurement to identify individuals who are overweight and obese . A version of it was devised as early as 1830 . Its currently defined as ones weight in kilograms divided by the square of ones height in meters . If you are not a mathematical and metric savant you can consult tables or charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health risks , there are some weaknesses to the measurement . But it tends to underestimate fatness for some elderly people , and can classify some fit and well-muscled athletes as overweight . It may also fail to take into account small differences in body composition between ethnic groups . And it does not consider where your excess fat is located : Specifically that abdominal obesity carries increased risk . Because of this two people with the same BMI may have different risks . <p> However , research has generally correlated a high BMI with health risks such as heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes , and some cancers . <h> Waist-to-Height Ratio : WHtR <p> The waist-to-height ration is ones waist circumference divided by ones height ( both measured in the same units ) . If this quotient is equal to or less than 0.5 you are considered to be in the safe and healthy range . Higher values of WHtR indicate a higher risk of obesity-related cardiovascular diseases . Because the waist is directly measured , WHtR is well correlated with abdominal obesity . Studies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heart attack , stroke , or death than the BMI . In addition WHtR is relatively accurate for both men and women and for different ethnic groups . <p> ( Why is the waist-to-height ratio abbreviated WHtR rather than WtHR ? Because the " t " does not abbreviate " to " ; rather , " Ht " abbreviates " height , " to distinguish it from " H " for " hip " see below . ) <h> Waist-to-Hip Ratio : WHR <p> The waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) is ones waist measurement divided by ones hip measurement . Ideally we want the former to be smaller than the latter , if only to allow our belt to hold our trousers up ( but suspenders are always an option ) . But not only that , research has shown that people with more weight around the waist versus their hips have a higher health risk . The WHR can not only indicate obesity but also the risk of several other serious health conditions ( including pregnancy , although we have more accurate diagnostic tools for pregnancy these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for WHR results , a waist-hip ratio above 0.90 to 1.00 for males and above 0.80 to 0.85 for females indicates abdominal obesity or increased health risk . The WHR has been found to be a more efficient predictor of mortality in older people than waist circumference or BMI . And the WHR has been shown to be a better predictor of ischemic cardiovascular disease ( coronary artery disease ) , and mortality than waist circumference and BMI . <h> Body Fat Percentage <p> Body fat percentage is very specific to our actual body fat content . The problem with body fat percentage as a health index is that the only accurate way to measure it is to undergo an autopsy . All other methods of measurement have high error ranges . The two most commonly available methods are skin-fold measurement , which must be done very carefully , and bioelectrical impedence analysis , which is used by many fat percentage scales , but which can have an error as high as plus or minus 8 percent . For these reasons the other obesity measurement systems are used more frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Men <p> Women <p> Essential fat <p> 25% <p> 1013% <p> Atheletes <p> 613% <p> 1420% <p> Fitness <p> 1417% <p> 2124% <p> Average <p> 1824% <p> 2531% <p> Obese <p> 25%+ <p> 32%+ <h> Waist Circumference <p> At first glace , waist circumference would seem to be the simplest measurement of all obesity indices to determine : A medical professional measures ones waist . But the patient ca n't be holding his breath or breathing deeply ( tailors are better trained than nurses to distract their customers in such a way as to get an accurate measurement ) . However , the patient needs to have a waist to begin with . If the patients WHR is 1 or more , he doest . So as a proxy he can be measured one inch above his navel . But if his navel is sagging down in a panniculus , that does n't  work either . So as a last resort he can be measured one inch below his elbows when his arms are hanging down straight . But if he is so fat that he cant hang his arms down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you can get an accurate waist measurement , it is the best predictor of metabolic syndrome . In women 35 inches or more and 40 inches or more in men is associated with an increased risk for type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , heart disease , and death regardless of the persons BMI . However , Using the waist circumference alone to predict health risks has proved unreliable in short people and in certain ethnic groups . <h> We finally come to the JAMA study <p> Although our population-wide BMI has remained almost constant over the past decade , this is not the case with abdominal obesity . A recent study has found that average waist circumference has increased by approximately one inch from 1999 to 2012 , and may be growing . Its one thing to party like its 1999 and another to keep it up for the next 13 years . <p> The researchers analyzed data on nutrition and health in the United States from more than 32,000 men and women over the age of 20 from 19992000 to 201112 and found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38.8 inches <p> The average waist circumference for men is now 40 inches <p> The average waist circumference for women in now 38 inches <p> The average increase in men was 0.8 inches and in women 1.5 inches <p> Abdominal obesity increased from 46.4 percent of the population in 19992000 to 54.2 percent in 20112012 <p> Several factors , including sleep deprivation , endocrine disruptors , and certain medications , have been proposed as potential explanations . I feel that our distorted food supply and lack of activity also plays a role . The problem is that the metabolically active fat in the area of the stomach is a greater risk factor for heart disease than excess fat in any other area of the body . The best measurement for abdominal obesity is the waist circumference . <p> Obviously all of these ways of measuring obesity have validity , and using more than one of them will add to the accuracy of your personal health assessment . <p> Really though , no matter how we slice it , a tomato still tastes like a toe-matto , and if we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than how we successfully get rid of it ! <p> A new study of 93,000 women just published online in the BMJ Open online journal found a correlation between postmenopausal breast cancer and increasing waist circumference , which was inferred from reported skirt size . If a womans skirt size after age 25 has increased one size per decade , her risk of postmenopausal breast cancer increases 33 percent ; if two sizes per decade , 77 percent . For breast cancer risk waist circumference may be a better predictor than BMI , and many women know and remember their skirt size history better than they know and remember their weight . 3780 @qwx863780 <h> 19 Responses to " BMI and Its Alternatives : Dr. J Reviews the Obesity Indices " <p> Okay , about to go wildly off-topic here , sorry . this was just something I noticed recently while watching , of all things , a BBC series about the history of the English language on YouTube that was amazingly cool . <p> Anyhow , one of the things they were looking at was the effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New World .

Be respectful of the author and do n't  immediately try and hijack his work . <p> That said , I really enjoyed the article . There are so many measurements out there its difficult to figure out which ones matter . Pointing out the flaws and variances in each scale helps to put things in perspective . <p> All of these measurements , as you said , do have some validity , but this really is not a ONE SIZE FITS ALL thing .. If someone is over weight , they need to get their body fat measured , and there they can be determined as over weight/obese , etc These measurements are a good start but if you want the TRUE FACTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just really hit me between the eyes when I thought about it . Yes , r efined sugar is an addictive substance . <p> Regarding the various indices for fitness , I still tend to think the BMI is fine , if only because there is an " earn your way off of the chart " mentality to it , at least to me . If you do n't  want the BMI to apply to you , then sweat enough to move out of its domain of applicability . Otherwise , it applies . <p> Although I still do wonder about whether a heart and lungs need to work any less hard to move blood and oxygen through an extra 20 lbs of muscle as opposed to an extra 20 lbs of fat . Metabolically , muscle is certainly healthier than fat , though . <p> Hey Dr. J Interesting overview of ways to evaluate fitness . I had a buddy when in the army always failed the BMI test so he had to do the tape test , measuring various body parts such as arms , legs , hips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a former football player and had a lot of muscle and weight for his average stature . <p> So for me BMI is fine so long as I do n't  get into serious bodybuilding I guess . <p> I am concerned with the problems of too much bulk also , regardless of its composition . There just is not much data about it at this time as the focus has mostly been on fat , but observations seem to bear it out . <p> This is not exactly a damning takedown of BMI . Why did someone have to tell you ? BMI is based on two objective measurments and a calculation ( or reference to a chart ) , and then reference to a table of ranges . You either were or werent obese according to that , or the someone did n't  have reliable information about your measurements or how to compute BMI . <p> And if your BMI at the time was in fact something like 29 , and you did n't  believe that you were borderline obese , you may have been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all probability were were actually borderline obese . <p> If everyones personal perception of their weight was accurate , then we would n't need objective measures like BMI to begin with . <p> The CDC collects national BMI data annually via the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System project , and one of the things they have to do , since data is mostly self-reported , is to figure out how much to adjust it . People underreport their weight and overreport their height , always , without fail . So for a segment of respondents , they get permission to show up at their doors the next day with a scale and a tape measure to figure out by how much they misreported . <p> So much said already here &amp; yes , the stats on increases YIKES ! I also saw that breast cancer study very interesting &amp; lucky for me I have not gone up ! <p> There are so many ways to measure this stuff &amp; I think people are going to pick &amp; choose what they like best sometimes : ) For me lifting since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not obese via BMI &amp; some other measures , closer than my real number BUT I KNOW the whole muscle thing &amp; BMI . <p> My waist has never been small either even as fit as I am now due to my body type . I know these things but many do use excuses &amp; we have to get real with ourselves . <p> People overestimate how many calories they burn &amp; underestimate how much they eat a majority of the time so well : ) <p> I think sometimes these sorts of measurements also get distorted and with the noblest of motivations by the medical profession . Not being a doctor who has to deal day-to-day with people coming in with general health issues , I think you are not used to " spinning it " as they are . What I mean is that I read an awful lot of posts and comments by people in the midst of trying to get down to a healthier weight who are supposedly " told by their doctor " that their current **28;273;TOOLONG weight is actually perfectly fine . Ex. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 275lbs , but I 'm down to 170 , and the BMI still says I 'm obese , even though my doctor said that I 'd have to starve myself to get down to 140lbs ! The BMI is all wrong ! " <p> In reality , the doctor respects the impressive loss the patient has already made , and will say anything at all to get them to maintain some loss , even one that 's less than what it really should be . I 've read so many remarks by women who have been informed by their GP that they would have to be " anorexic " or " starve themselves " to be the exact height and weight that I am without any angst at all . <p> Its a shame doctors are fighting with everything they have to just get people to be merely less obese than they otherwise might be , and it confuses all of these measurement standards in the end . Really , if you are morbidly obese , the doctor will tell you to your face that black is white if it will get to to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , my interactions with patients have always been very straightforward and direct . Just one thing , a persons report of a conversation can range from accurate to very inaccurate . When I have a patient that tells me what some other doctor told them , and it sounds unlikely , I consider that possibility . <p> Yeah , I imagine most of those conversations are more like the patient saying , " I 'd have to starve myself to get down to 199 , " and the doctor making a noncommittal noise and saying , " Well , your current loss is already pretty impressive " and the patient walking out saying that the doctor agreed that they would have to starve themselves to get below 200. : - ( <p> Its just got to be so hard to have to care for people who are surrounded by addictive crap that 's killing them all the time . And if someone has lost some seriously impressive amount of weight , you definitely do n't  want to say anything that might be taken as downplaying it . <p> I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I would have loved to have read this when I was working in a gym and everyone was obsessed with their body stats . We had a body fat tester that I was heavily skeptical of but was loved by the body builders selling training packages to thin women . They would always get them to sign up based on body fat . Your autopsy line was gold !

I joked with him about writing a book titled " The Complete Book of Weight Loss . " Written on the first page would be the sentence " You have to really want to .

You keep looking for another way to lose weight when you already know the only way to do it is to create a calorie deficit between calorie availability and calorie usage . <p> 7 . You rationalize , using excuses for not losing weight such as water retention , building muscle when your workouts are not very difficult or intense , or having the dreaded delayed-onset muscle swelling and soreness . <p> 6 . You keep delaying doing what you know you need to do in order to lose weight . <p> 5 . You make weight loss plans or lists then do n't  follow them . <p> 4 .

Your posts provide a great opportunity for introspection and the much-needed reality check . Honestly facing the facts about what I 'm doing , and working to develop a method for achieving results is the ONLY way I can ever hope to get where I want to go . <p> I wish I knew at twenty what I know now . It gets harder every year to move in ways that challenge the flab without killing me , but I am determined to see the work doneone teeny , tiny goal at a time ! <p> My sincere observation .

I think its truly something you have to decide for yourself and then just do . I know there was a real shift in my actions when I decided to lose weight years ago . Also , as the previous commenters noted , the quick-fix mentality that is so prevalent in our culture certainly does n't  help . Most people did not become overweight overnight , yet they expect to get rid of the weight practically overnight . <p> You need to be convinced that losing weight will bring benefits in better health and a more enjoyable life . Many will make tentative starts and fall by the way side . There are now apps that provide real edvice and feed back which seem to help as does joining activities akin to Wrght Watchers . Remember not only to start but to continue and In no circumstances allow your weight to exceed that at which you started your efforts to lose those extra pounds . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get fat . Losing the extra pounds gets harder and harder as the numbers go up . STAY TRIM ALL YOUR LIFE <p> I have a few people I would really like to send this too ! What makes me even more sad about this is that it is so common for people who lose the weight to just gain it all right back and more . People have to just commit to making consistent lifestyle changes and they actually are n't  hard once you adjust ! Moving and eating well actually feels great ! <p> I think its human nature to engage in wishful thinking rather than action , whether were talking weight loss , or financial prudence , or career advancement , or relationships or whatever . So much easier to think " tomorrow " than to act today !

I am not talking here about the regular grocery store chicken or the happy free ranging bird that you prepare yourself . I am addressing fast food chicken . <p> For the first time in a century , Americans are eating more chicken than beef , and much of this is in the form of fast food chicken , with purveyors of the All-American burger adding chicken items like crazy to their menus . <p> I imagine chickens are crossing the road in record numbers in an attempt to escape this carnage , but to no avail because chicken eaters want their chicken , and they want it now . <h> So what 's the problem ? <p> You are getting ripped-off by the fast food industry because what they are calling chicken is not all that you think . <p> It started in the early 1950s when Col. Harland Sanders , who had been selling his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kentucky , decided to sell his secrets to Pete Harman of South Salt Lake , Utah , who then opened the first Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in 1952 . <p> If any of you have had the KFC Original Recipe you may remember a somewhat greasy piece of recognizable chicken with a thin fried coating . From here , because of competition from other franchises , KFC introduced Extra Crispy chicken in 1972 . We still got the same piece of chicken only with a lot more unhealthy fried batter surrounding it . <h> Enter the fried chicken sandwich <p> With the brilliant capitalistic introduction of the fried chicken sandwich , fast food chicken was never the same again . Chicken is relatively expensive , while fat and batter are not . The less chicken and the more fried batter in the product the more profits for the company . <p> It did n't  stop there , because like a fried snowball rolling downhill to the bank ( Did I really write that ? ) , the fast food industry , with some help from Tyson Foods , created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had even a larger ratio of fried batter to chicken . Now we have chicken strips , tenders , fingers , and most recently chicken fries , all the while with an increasing ratio of fried batter to chicken in the product that you are buying and eating . <p> So now that you know all this , you can just stop eating these products . Good luck with that . <p> You see , the fast food industry has found through years of covert research that by surrounding your chicken with layers of fat , sugar , and salt they can keep you coming back for more , because , although no one has ever been addicted to a chicken except perhaps a lovelorn rooster , plenty of people become addicted to the salt , sugar , and fat combination . The industry calls it " palatability , " which refers to food that has the capacity to stimulate the appetite and drive us to eat more . These high sugar-salt-fat coatings produce rewarding opioids in our brain and drive us to want to have it . And if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside the coatings is infused with sugar , salt , and fat solutions beforehand at the factory . <p> The end result of this culinary subterfuge is a concoction that is over 50 percent fat , sugar , and salt by volume , and even getting higher with the newer products . This does n't  even include the fat , sugar , and salt topping that we add to it . <h> Can we reverse this behavior ? <p> The key is to decrease your exposure to the substances that you are addicted to , in this case , salt , sugar , and fat , and decrease all of them at once , as they seem to have a synergistic effect when consumed together . What will happen , if you do this , is that you will eventually come to appreciate food that contains a much lower dose of these substances . <p> Additionally , I do not support cheat days , or letting it go for the holiday season , or any other way of eating that does not decrease your addictive exposure all of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you continue to intermittently reinforce the addictive behavior , it will never be controlled . <p> Dealing with an addiction is not an easy matter , especially when the addictive substance is necessary for life , but we can modify the addiction , and we can manage it by retraining ourselves , and developing healthier habits . Habits can be stronger than addiction . 3780 @qwx863780 <h> 17 Responses to " Escaping the Bonds of Fast Food Chicken Addiction " <p> My general rule is that if I do n't  recognize it as legit chicken , I wont order or eat it . Still , the ( most ) chickens in our food system are overwhelming , and ultimately less than healthy . They are though , quite often , our best option . <p> I just finished The Intimate Bond ; a book chronicling our ( mans ) relationship with all animals since the advent of civilization . The authors does spend time on animals in the modern as well as the ancient food systems . Its not a pretty sight at period in our history , but far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least of our concerns though I still try t avoid them , and I 'll have you know the chicken on BBQd pizza I am enjoying over coffee this morning is range chicken . True story : - ) <p> Extra crispy fried chicken was around well before KFC introduced it . There was a chicken restaurant in Pasadena in the early 1950s that served up its " world famous Chicken in the Rough , " which was intoxicatingly crunchy and tasty . ( The logo was a chicken in golf attire holding a golf club . ) But you had to go to Pasadena to get it . What KFC really introduced was ubiquity , via franchising , which put the addictively crunchy version within a mile or so of most of America . And let 's not overlook the various fastfood fish franchises , with their beer battered fish filets offering a batter-to-fish ratio every bit as evil as KFCs chicken . <p> Researching Chicken in the Rough , it seems to have been nearly ubiquitous in its day , with nearly 300 franchisees . Apparently it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe that already established restaurants added to their menu . There were three or four in the greater Pasadena area . <p> As a late teen I ate a lot of KFC after I got a job . Back then even when I was poor I could afford it . I loved the original recipe with mash potatoes , gravy , biscuits and real Coca Cola and of course plenty of wet naps ! <p> I 'm guessing KFC got about a third of my fast food fare along with Burger King and Jack in the Box . <p> I remember my High School health class teaching us that a Jumbo Jack with Cheese was a balanced meal in itself ( all four food groups , meat , dairy , veggies , and grains ) . <p> Ahh so things change now the fast food of the 1970s is the junk food of the 2000s . <p> Getting off of memory lane I do n't  eat much fast food now ( too expensive and tasteless ) but when the wife and I splurge we go for Mexican food . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is already after dinner . <p> Love , LOVE this ! As you know , I 'm addressing habitual behaviors in my own life with my blogging of late . As a confirmed food addict , I see the pull certain foods have on my brain and I 'm working to loosen their grip . Soooo hard ! Thank you , Dr. J ! <p> Amazingly I know some people who think of chicken as a " health " food even when it is barely recognizable ! They see it as a better option and feel less guilty about eating fast food . Also in Australia we call what you guys call a chicken sandwich a chicken burger . Sandwich definitely has a healthier ringto it . Just amazes me how hard it is to get food in its natural state v highly processed . <p> I totally get disgusted when thinking of what I use to eat . I have n't touched fast food in such a long time the smell disgusts me and so does the thought of eating it . <p> I remember I 'd eat " chicken " thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the hamburger . LOL . Oh boy , I am so thankful to have turned my life around and started eating healthy . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Hey Dr J ! I came over to visit at the right time . I needed this . I cut out my beloved Dr Pepper last year this time . This year for my birthday , I 'm changing my eating habits ( the bad ones ) this article is an extreme push in the right direction . I will eat any piece of chicken placed in front of me. 
@@97602927 @1802927/ <h> How to Teach Young Children About Their Food Allergies <p> ( CC ) Vince Alongi/Flickr <p> Last week , our Food Allergy Friday interview series focused on methods to teach others about your childs food allergies ; this weeks edition zeroes in on how to teach young children about their food allergies . This age range is particularly prone to food allergies , but you 'll need to use different strategies than you might with older children to properly arm them with the tools they need to avoid food allergens . Last weeks Food Allergy Friday experts Linda Coss , Elizabeth Goldenberg and Lynda Mitchell return to offer their insights in todays post ; well also hear from food allergy musician Kyle Dine and author Nicole Smith , who 's written three childrens books on food allergy . <h> Topics to Cover <p> When teaching young children about their food allergies , you cant just tell them to avoid their allergen . Kids in this age range must understand far more than avoidance they must learn how to navigate social situations and safely interact with friends , classmates and caretakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while teaching a younger child about his or her own food allergies . <p> Tell the child about his or her allergy , using age-appropriate verbiage . Food allergy author Linda Coss recommends using simple language , such as , " You have food allergies , and if you eat something you 're allergic to you can get very sick and feel very icky . " <p> Lynda Mitchell of Kids With Food Allergies agrees : " Any kind of teaching would need to be age-appropriate for the child . I know when my son was a toddler , I 'd just point to foods and say , This will make you sick , or , I need to check the ingredients to see if it is safe for you. I started simple , and then broadened the explanations as he got older . " <p> Show the child the tools that will help protect him . After laying this foundation , you can dive deeper into your childs specific allergens and introduce him to the tools hell need to stay safe throughout his life . here 's how Elizabeth Goldenberg of Onespot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergies : <p> When Jacob was diagnosed as a toddler , I told him that he s allergic to peanuts and all other nuts . That 's a fact he should know about himself and be able to repeat to others . I bought him a very simple and comfortable MedicAlert bracelet that he wore constantly instead of taking it off at night that 's much easier than getting a child to cooperate every day when you put it on , and there 's also no chance you 'll forget it. - I told Jacob what it said , which is " Allergic to peanuts &amp; tree nuts . Needs EpiPen , " so he understood why wearing it was important. - The bracelet fell off and was lost at daycare when Jacob was three years old , and he reported that to me as soon as I picked him up . By knowing its importance , he wanted to be sure I knew to replace it right away . <p> Only eat approved food . " Make sure your child understands that not all adults understand what is safe for them to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell . The friendly mother at the park or birthday party does n't  know about his food allergies , either , " says Coss . Goldenberg agrees : " I also taught Jacob only to eat food that his father or I had checked first , even if its a relative or someone else he trusts offering the food , and even if they say its nut free . " <p> Mitchell reinforced this message in her family by showing her son the approved foods shed brought along : " I also showed and explained to my son to rely on the safe foods I usually brought with me if we went anywhere , and that his emergency medicines always needed to be with him wherever he went . " <p> Common and not-so-common names for allergens . " Teach your child the names of the foods he can not eat , and show him pictures or use trips to the grocery store as teaching moments to teach him what these foods look like , " says Coss . <p> Proper hygiene . " Wash your hands before you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible , " says Coss . Frequent hand-washing is essential throughout the day , especially if the childs allergy is severe . " Since peanut residue is hard to clean off surfaces and a person can react even from invisible trace amounts , I taught Jacob to wash his hands every time he eats , " says Goldenberg . " He could easily have traces of his allergen on his hands from using shared craft materials and running his hands along countless other surfaces he encounters . Proper hand washing before every meal is a great idea generally for good hygiene , but its extremely important for people with food allergies . We carry compact hand wipes to do this when were away from home . " <p> Elizabeth Goldenbergs Tips <p> on Living Safely with Allergies <p> Embrace the mantra " Think before you drink . " " I also wanted Jacob to think before he put anything to his mouth , - like a sippy cup that looks like his and is sitting around. - I wanted him to ask himself , Is this mine ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , so I used labels to mark his cup , bowl and plate , or his leftovers in the fridge . People with food allergies should n't be drinking from someone elses cup , and if their snack containers look the same , they need to be able to identify which one contains their safe food , " says Goldenberg . Opt for food-grade labels instead of office-supply labels ; Goldenberg warns that the latter product can contain lead and solvents . <p> Say no to snacks . " I taught my son to say , Did my mom check the ingredients ? or I can only eat foods when my mom has checked the ingredients , ' " says Mitchell . Goldenberg adds , " I also taught Jacob how to say no if someone offers him something , which can be difficult for a child to say , especially when its to an adult . - Jacob was once offered peanut butter toast by a grandparent who temporarily forgot he s allergic , and he calmly said No thank you , I have a peanut allergy.- I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was ready to speak up for himself . " <p> Coss echoes the need for children to become disciplined about the food they accept from others . " While other parents focus on teaching their child not to talk to strangers , a very important message for us to communicate is to not take food from strangers . In fact , a child should be taught not to eat or touch any food unless you ( or whatever adults you have authorized to make that decision ) have checked the ingredients and determined that the food is safe , " she warns . <p> Linda Coss : How a Child Might Describe an Allergic Reaction <p> Kids may express that they 're having an allergic reaction in several ways . Here are a few Linda Coss has heard from other parents . For more phrases , see this article from FAAN . <p> " I do n't  feel good . " <p> " My tongue feels funny . " <p> " I cant breathe . " <p> " I feel funny . " <p> " With Morgan , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to him from well-meaning friends and adults . Then , when the situation arose , he was prepared . Basically , we wanted Morgan to feel power over his food allergies by having the means to keep himself from getting into confusing situations around food , " says childrens book author Nicole Smith . <p> Tell an adult if something feels wrong . " Tell the child , Speak up if you do n't  feel right. If she ever feels sick , wrong , strange or funny after or while she 's eating something , she should immediately tell you or the adult in charge about what she 's feeling , " says Coss . <p> When in doubt , spit it out . " This might be one of the most important things to teach , " says Coss . " If your child accidentally takes a bite or sip of the wrong thing , he should spit it out . Right there . No matter what the social situation might be . " <h> Methods <p> Play to your childs interests . Whether your child likes to play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a connection to the information and enhance retention . <p> Read a food-allergy book together . Although there are several food-allergy books for children today , this wasnt always the case . " My son , Morgan , enjoyed books tremendously at a young age . In 1999 , when I was searching for childrens books about food allergies , there werent any available , so I decided to write one . Allie the Allergic Elephant : A Childrens Story of Peanut Allergies came out of my desire to teacher Morgans preschool classmates about his food allergies . Morgan enjoyed learning how to read and we began to read labels together . Learning how to spell peanut or nuts was a thrill , " says Smith . <p> " There are some good books out there to help teach children about their food allergies . One of them is Everyday Cool with Food Allergies by Dr. Mike Pistiner , " says Mitchell . " It teaches kids simple ways to stay safe , and also helps teach family and caregivers , with more detailed explanations just for them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my home had no traces of nuts , I believe that its a training ground for teaching Jacob how to function outside the home . I gave Jacob his own allergy placemat and taught him that he eats just what 's set out on his placemat. - This helped him learn not to reach over to a classmates lunch and grab something for himself , " says Goldenberg . <p> Role play . " Role playing is an effective strategy at any age . For example , practice saying , No thank you , I have food allergies , or I have food allergies . Please ask my Mommy if that is safe for me , ' " says Coss . <p> Use playtime to familiarize your child with epinephrine auto-injectors . " Buy your child a toy doctors kit , and put an EpiPen or TwinJect trainer into it . Have your child practice using the EpiPen on his or her teddy bears , dolls or other toys . This will help her get comfortable with the device , and make her think of it as just another doctor thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Coss . <p> Kyle Dines Music Makes Food Allergies Fun <p> Make it fun . Food allergy musician Kyle Dine used his own food allergies as a springboard to teach children about theirs . " I first started performing allergy awareness assemblies at schools as I thought it would be an effective delivery method to combine important messages about food allergies , with fun activities , games and zany puppets , " he says . " Children have been very receptive to this format , as it puts a positive spin on allergy awareness with empowering results . " <p> Keep it simple . Use repetition and simple , familiar graphics that kids understand to reinforce your message . here 's how Dine does it at his shows : <p> I start with my main key messages and brainstorm how I can convey them in fun or creative ways . For instance , I have my EpiMan and EpiMan Jr . puppets explain epinephrine and why it must be carried at all times . To memorize symptoms of a reaction , I have volunteers stick different stickers on a poster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To emphasize " no sharing food " rules at schools , I perform a song titled " Stop ! Please Do n't  Feed Me ! " where I hand out stop signs to students . <p> Knowledge retention occurs through several fundamental tools such as audience involvement , visuals and- repetition . Its always a great sign to see dozens of hands raised at the end of my shows because not only have students retained information , they seek more information on how to keep their friends safe . <h> Strategies <p> Proper preparation increases your childs chances of reacting properly when you 're not around . " Because of the way my husband and I taught Jacob , I think he felt prepared . He knew what to watch out for , he had his medication within reach , and he was ready to enjoy each day , " says Goldenberg . Telling your child that you 've worked out strategies to keep her safe and that she plays a vital role in these strategies will help build a sense of responsibility . " Always stress that there 's a plan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the child has a reaction , you or the adult in charge will give her the appropriate medicine and take care of her , " says Coss . " But for this to happen , you need the childs help : you need them to speak up right away if they think something is wrong . " <p> Try not to create unnecessary anxiety . " The one thing you do n't  want to do is to transfer your anxiety or fear on to the child , " advises Mitchell . Dine agrees : " Keep a balance of letting children know that allergies must be taken seriously while not creating- unnecessary- anxiety . " <p> Doing so entails fostering an environment that does n't  assign negativity to reporting a reaction . " Teach your child that he or she will never get in trouble for having a reaction , no matter what caused the reaction in the first place , " says Coss . " Sometimes a child can sneak a food that he or she knows Mommy did n't  say was okay to eat . Then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thought of incurring Mommys wrath to speak up . <p> Filter your messages . " Remove your own fear and anxiety , and just stick to the facts , in an age-appropriate way , " advises Mitchell . " I kept the dialogue simple and said something like , If you ate that , youd get very sick and have to go to the hospital. I reinforced that a lot , whenever I had an opportunity .

This can open up a door for children to share their feelings about their experiences with allergies , as well as for parents to reiterate key strategies to stay safe .

@@97602929 @1802929/ <h> The Big 9 Foodborne Illnesses and What They Do to You <h> Food Poisoning on the Rise <p> It seems like reports of foodborne illness are becoming more common these days . In 2014 we saw several major multistate outbreaks , including salmonella from bean sprouts , nut butters , chicken , and cheese ; listeria from caramel apples , cheese , and other dairy products ; and E. coli from ground beef . But what exactly happens if you catch a foodborne illness ? <h> What are the most common foodborne illnesses ? <h> Botulism <p> While many cases of botulism are from causes other than food , about 15 percent of the around 145 cases reported each year come from a food outbreak . <p> Recent food outbreaks of botulism include a recall of products from Castleberrys Food Company in July 2007 and a green bean contamination in August 2007 . <p> Botulism is caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum , a family of bacteria that lives in the soil and in low-oxygen conditions . The bacteria form spores that are dormant until exposed to conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreaks of botulism are linked to home canning gone awry , but other canned foods can be tainted with the bacteria , which causes paralytic problems in humans . <p> Symptoms of botulism include doubled or blurred vision , droopy eyelids , slurred speech , dry mouth , trouble swallowing and muscle weakness . Symptoms of foodborne botulism usually turn up 18 to 36 hours after eating tainted food , but it can take up to 10 days for symptoms to occur . <p> Left untreated , botulism can lead to paralysis of the arms , legs and respiratory muscles . If it comes to that , a mechanical ventilator will be required for treatment . About 3 to 5 percent of people who get any kind of botulism will die from it , and this is due to respiratory failure . <p> When caught earlier , an anti-toxin derived from horses can be used to stop the spread of the bacteria , and vomiting may be induced to rid the body of tainted food particles . <p> If you can your own foods , take special care with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 minutes before eating should kill any bacteria . Botulism is also the reason honey is n't given to infants . <h> Campylobacter <p> Campylobacter is an illness caused by bacteria of the same name ( its also sometimes called campylobateriosis ) . The bacteria is found in most of the poultry we eat , as it exists in birds and does n't  make them sick . <p> It does n't  make us sick , either , if the chicken we eat is cooked properly and has n't  been contaminated with raw chicken juices . When you hear people talk about how important it is to wash everything when you work with raw chicken , this is the bug they 're warning you against . It can also be killed by oxygen , and freezing seems to lower the number of bacteria found on the chicken . <p> Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhea in the world , and the illness can be diagnosed from a stool culture . Most people get over the bacteria without medication , just letting the diarrhea run its course , so to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Campylobacter is almost always isolated to an individual or small group that ate undercooked poultry , but more widespread outbreaks are possible , usually associated with unpasturized milk or tainted drinking water . <p> According to the CDC , there are over 800,000 cases of campylobacter annually , and in 2011 over 8,000 were hospitalized and 76 died from this foodborne illness . <h> E. coli <p> E. coli , or , more scientifically , Esherichia coli is actually a large group of bacteria , most of which are n't  harmful . The ones that are bad are known as Shiga toxin-producing E. coli , or STEC . And the most common of these is E. coli O157:H7 , which is the one reporters are talking about when they 're talking about E. coli outbreaks . <p> These bacteria live in the guts of ruminant animals , most notably cattle , but also deer , elk , goats and sheep . In the slaughtering process the intestines can be cut , allowing the bacteria onto the meat . E. coli usually does n't  make the host animal sick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can be bloody , stomach cramps , vomiting and sometimes a low fever . <p> Food science nerd Harold McGee reports that about a third of all people who develop E. coli illness need to be hospitalized , and about 5 percent of those die . However , according to the latest CDC data , for 2011 , although there were 2,138 E. coli hospitalizations , it did n't  break into the top five fatal foodborne pathogens , so it caused fewer than the 76 deaths attributed to the fifth deadly pathogen , campylobacter . Nevertheless , its most dangerous in children . About 5 to 10 percent of those who get infected with E. coli will develop a more serious illness , hemolytic uremic syndrome , which can lead to kidney failure . <p> The most common culprit for E. coli contamination is ground beef , as grinding meat from many different cows together spreads the bacteria across a wider range of packages . It can also be found in unpasturized milk or apple cider , or cheeses made from raw milk . <p> Vegetables that come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. coli , as with the spinach outbreak in 2006 . People have also been known to get E. coli from swallowing contaminated water ( when swimming in a farm pond , for example ) or at petting zoos . <h> Listeria <p> If you 've ever been pregnant you 've probably heard about the dangers of listeriosis , or infection with the bacteria Listeria monocytogenes . <p> That 's because pregnant women are about 20 times more likely than other healthy adults to get listeriosis , and about a third of all cases of listeria infection strike pregnant women . ( Newborns , the elderly , people with weakened immune systems and diseases like cancer , diabetes and kidney disease get most of the other infections . ) Listeria killed 255 Americans in 2011 , the latest year for which CDC data is available . <p> Listeria is found in soil and water and especially in places that have been fertilized with manure . The bacteria is carried by animals it does n't  harm , and it can contaminate animal products including meat , milk and cheese , as well as vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be caused by uncooked meats , raw-milk cheeses , vegetables and cold cuts or soft cheeses that may be contaminated at the deli counter after processing . Pasteurization and cooking kill listeria , but products can be contaminated after cooking and before packaging or through cross-contamination at the deli . <p> Fever , muscle aches , nausea or diarrhea are the most common symptoms , but the infection can spread to the nervous system , causing headaches , a stiff neck and convulsions . About 2,500 people become seriously i 'll in the United States each year from listeria and about 500 die . <p> Pregnant women who get listeriosis may only exhibit flu-like symptoms , but the illness can cause miscarriage , stillbirth , premature delivery and infection of the newborn . You 'll need a blood test to be sure you have the infection , and both adults and babies can be treated with antibiotics . <p> Listeria infection can be prevented by thoroughly cooking all meats ( even lunchmeat , especially if you 're pregnant ) , avoiding raw or unpasturized milk , cheese or juice , washing vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dealing with raw meat . <h> " Mad cow " disease <p> Mad cow , properly known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy , is a chronic , degenerative disease affecting the nervous systems of cattle . Consumption of infected cattle has been linked to a disease known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in humans , which is always fatal . <p> While its not completely clear how BSE in cattle is connected to vCJD in humans , its thought that the disease is passed by eating meat that contains brain tissue . The parts of the cow considered to be most infectious for humans are the brain , spinal cord , retina , optic nerve , and dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia . McGee reports it may also be found in muscles , which means many different cuts of meat may be potentially dangerous . <p> The disease was spread among cattle when they were given feed containing these parts from sick cows , a practice that has since been stopped . <p> The illness has killed more than 160 people in Britain and nearly 40 elsewhere in the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year or more , its likely there are more cases that have yet to surface . <p> The infectious agent is known as a prion , a kind of protein that carries the disease between cows or from cow to human . If meat you eat has these prions , there 's nothing you can do about it ; cooking will not affect it . Symptoms of vCJD include dementia , memory loss , hallucinations and personality changes paired with physical changes such as jerky movements , slurred speech , difficulty walking or changes in posture or gait and seizures . <p> Death from this disease can happen in a matter of weeks or months , but some people manage to live for years with the disease . <h> Norovirus <p> Noroviruses , commonly called Norwalk-like viruses , are a special kind of foodborne illness caused entirely by humans . According to the CDC , there are over 5 million cases of norovirus illness annually , with over 14,000 hospitalizations and 149 deaths in 2011 . <p> When your food preparer is sick with one of these viruses and goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , the illness can be transmitted to you . ( You can also get it from touching surfaces with norovirus germs on them , then putting your hands in your mouth , or from direct contact with a person with the illness . ) <p> Symptoms can begin as early as 12 hours or as many as 48 hours after exposure and usually include vomiting and diarrhea , abdominal pain , stomach and headaches , low fever and tiredness . Sometimes people who think they have the flu really have a Norwalk-type virus . Some estimates say that as many as 60 percent of the American population has been exposed to one of these viruses by the age of 50 , and about 180,000 are sickened every year . <p> There is no treatment for the illness , but it usually runs its course quickly . You can be contagious up to two weeks after recovery , so if you know you have had a norovirus , be diligent with the handwashing and do n't  cook for other people for a few days , just to be safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term you will still sometimes hear people use when referring to food poisoning , but its an inaccurate term . <p> The term comes from an early theory about food poisoning coming from ptoamines , or alkaloids found in animal and vegetable matter when they decay , although the nature of these supposed alkaloids was never clearly defined . The discovery of bacteria and other microorganisms put the pthomaine theory to rest , although it was still in occasional use thorugh the middle of the 20th century in the lazy general sense of food poisoning whose specific cause had not yet been determined . <h> Salmonella <p> One of the most famous and common of the foodborne illnesses , salmonella is a bacteria that lives in the intestinal tracts of animals . When feces comes in contact with food that is n't cooked , the bacteria can be transmitted to humans . <p> During 2011 , the most recent year for which the CDC has detailed statistics , salmonella accounted for over 1 million cases , over 19,000 hospitalizations , and 378 deaths . Although there are five times as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the number 1 cause of foodborne illness hospitalizations and deaths . <p> Salmonella does n't  make the animals that carry it sick , and food that 's tainted with the bacteria does n't  look or smell any differently than safe food . Salmonella is a problem when it gets onto foods that are n't  normally cooked ( as was the problem with the 2008 tomato outbreak ) or when meat that 's been tainted is n't cooked properly . <p> Salmonella infection usually causes diarrhea , fever or abdominal cramps within 12 to 72 hours after infection . The illness generally resolves itself on its own within four to seven days , but its important for people with salmonella to get plenty of fluids to make up for the diarreha . <p> Antibiotics may also be used to treat salmonella , but its usually not necessary unless the bacteria spread to the intestines . People with compromised immune systems , the very young and the very old may have more trouble fighting the infection themselves and may need more medical intervention . <p> Salmonella sometimes leads to Reiters syndrome , a condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can last for months or years and may in turn lead to chronic arthritis , but this is pretty rare . <p> The best way to prevent salmonella infection is to always cook meat and eggs to the suggested temperatures and be careful not to contaminate other foods with the juices from uncooked meat , poultry or eggs . <h> Staph <p> Staphylococcus aureus , more commonly known as staph , is a common cause of food poisoning . Staph can linger in foods such as meat , poultry , eggs , dairy products , meat , egg , pasta and potato salads , sandwich fillings and filled baked goods like eclairs and cream pies . <p> Staph can grow even in the refrigerator , and infested food wont have an off odor to let you know you should n't eat it . <p> People who eat food that has staph in it usually get sick very quickly and will usually have nausea , vomiting and abdominal cramping . In more severe cases people may have headaches , muscle cramps and changes in blood pressure . <p> The illness usually resolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poisoning can be made by examining suspect food , since about half of all healthy people have staph on and in their bodies all the time . Animals and humans are the main transmitters of staph , but it also can exist in the air and in water , milk , dust and sewage , as well as in food and on food equipment . <p> The number of people who typically get staph in a year is unknown because the symptoms are so similar to other food-borne illnesses and it is often misdiagnosed . Many people who are sickened in this way never go to the doctor . The treatment for a staph food poisoning is simply to endure as comfortably as possible until symptoms pass , being careful to prevent dehydration . <p> The best way to avoid staph food poisoning is to practice basic food safety : do n't  let different kinds of meats touch each other , cook meat to recommended safe temperatures , do n't  let food sit out for more than two hours , and keep cold foods under 40 degrees and warm foods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also called trichinellosis , is an infection caused by eating animals infected with the larvae of a worm called trichinella . It can be contracted by eating wild carnivorous animals or domesticated pigs . <p> This infection is pretty gross to describe . When you eat tainted meat , the larvae or cysts of the worms are ingested , and your stomach acid dissolves the cyst , releasing the worm , which matures in a couple of days in your small intestine . <p> The worms mate in there and the females lay eggs , which then develop into immature worms , travel through the arteries into the muscles and there form cysts again . <p> You might get a stomachache , nausea , diarrhea , vomiting , fatigue or fever in one or two days after eating tainted meat , and two to eight weeks later you may have further symptoms such as headaches , fever and chills , coughing , eye swelling , muscle or joint pain , itchy skin , constipation or diarrhea . Many mild cases go undiagnosed and go away on their own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated with drugs . <p> Trichinosis is very rare , with only about a dozen cases reported each year in the United States , about twice that many in Canada where undercooked game is eaten more frequently . Prevent it by cooking pork and wild game animals thoroughly . In 2011 the USDA lowered the recommended cooking temperature for pork to 145 degrees ( although it remains at 160 degrees for ground pork ) . You can also freeze pork for 20 days to kill worms , but that does n't  always work with game animals . <p> At any rate , just wanted to let you know your pictures are a bit off . Your E. coli picture apears to be a nematode , C. elegans , which is commonly fed E. coli in the lab when being cultured . E. coli looks very similar to your Salmonella picture ( they 're close cousins ) . <p> My brother and I both ate burritos from a taqueria and came down with very bizarre symptoms.Very bad muscle pain in our arms , legs and necks for 5 days.Shaky almost like having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our muscle enzyme count was high.Everthing else was normal.Doctors not sure but suspect botulism or another food borne illness.I wish I knew what it was.I felt very foggy and out of it but the pain in my muscles was so bad that I could n't even pick up my two yr old.Any suggestions ? <p> Its interesting to see how many different bacteria there are that are even in canned or bagged foods . I was unaware that 15% of around 145 cases reported each year come from a food outbreak . And I though that if you are uncooked food then you would get salmonella but I guess Salmonella does n't make the animals that carry it sick . It does n't  really make sense that most cases of staph are unknown because people do n't  report to their doctor to try to get treated and that staph looks like many other food illnesses . <p> Yup and it is only going to get worst , President Obama just sign a bill that limits food regulationsso that means all your favorite Mexican foods will actually be coming from mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on it !

I do n't  know how long she kept it up , but I 'm guessing its still happening as I type this column ! <p> On the way home from town today , driving a different route , I saw a young man with a sign " We Buy Gold , " and he was doing what I now know is called " sign spinning , " and he was quite entertaining at it ! <p> Thinking back , Ive seen people dressed up as the Statue of Liberty , clowns and nearly every brand mascot you can think of to advertise their product on a street corner . <p> One other thing that stood out to me about these people , along with their advertising creativity , is that except for those that just stood there leaning on the sign or waving unenthusiastically , every single individual that was actively advertising their product was very fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about working in our modern world is that being active and having a job rarely happened at the same time .

These entrepreneurial sign spinners were definitely getting a 9-to-5 workout ! <p> Yes , I wondered about the long-term legality of it all and how distracting it might be for drivers who are supposed to be paying full attention to driving . I suppose if an accident or two was linked to these sign spinners , perhaps something may be done to limit it , but for now , its full spin ahead . <p> Sure , I realize that your job might not be at the extreme fitness level of a sign spinner , and I 'm certainly not recommending that you tell the company what they can do with that sedentary job of yours , but what I am suggesting is that you find ways to put some needed activity into your day job . <p> I 've had a few jobs that supplied some amounts of activity . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my heart rate up a little . When I worked part-time as a karate instructor while going to medical school , that job also included a serious workout .

Sure , surgery can be physically taxing , but nowhere to the point of fulfilling the " daily calories utilized " component of diet math . <p> So I 've basically made it a habit to usually either work out before or after work , but because of the varied hours or responsibilities of my profession , I have also , by necessity , found ways to get some additional activity into my day . Sometimes I would just walk around the hospital . Climbing stairs is another way I have found to get it done . Our hospital has an outside set of stairs , which doubles as a fire escape , and the views of the campus are really quite nice . When time permitted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a quick workout at my fitness center , which is just beyond the university grounds . <p> If you are looking for some ways to put more activity into your day job without having to stand on a corner and go the sign-spinning route , here are some suggestions on how to do so . <p> If feasible , walk or bike to work , or get off the public transport a few stops early or park a little farther away and walk from there . In addition , always take stairs when you can . <p> Standing burns more calories than sitting . Look for times when you can work standing . There are surgeons that sit in the operating room , but I have always worked standing . <p> Use your breaks to do some fast walking or other exercises .

Walking with your coworkers can be a fun break during the day . Do try not to take too much of your work with you . Enjoy the time if you can . <p> If its practical , schedule walking meetings or walking brainstorming sessions . This may be able to be done inside or outside the building .

Of course , walking or running just requires little more than the right shoes . I 've really enjoyed running in new and interesting locations while traveling . <p> Consider office fitness equipment that has been specifically designed for the office , such as a treadmill or pedal-equipped desk , to use at a laptop station or other workspace . <p> Being active will pay many dividends for our health and wellness . In our sedentary world , finding ways to increase our daily activity level at work is a realistic goal . It really all comes down to making smart exercise choices . If you really want to make that important health , fitness and wellness change in your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> I am self-employed , meaning that I 'm also the janitor of my office . I take out garbage , clean the bathrooms , wipe down desks , vacuum , etc during breaks . I know this is n't a lot of physical activity , so I plan other physical activity during off hours . <p> I do n't  have time to seek the study this morning , but several years ago I came across one from Minnesota . A group of call center employees working 40 hours per week volunteered to stand on the job for 1 year WITHOUT MAKING ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THEIR DIET OR EXERCISE PROGRAM ( IF THEY HAD ONE ) . Their desks were raised , and all ergonomic considerations were applied to support their upright posture . <p> The average weight loss for the group was , I think , about 20 pounds . Concerns for low-back and foot stress notwithstanding , that is an optimistic number if only week could get people to stand up on the job lord knows I do <p> as you probably know I 'm retired so exercise durin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to gym four times a week . The problem is and your blog has brought this to the fore at night when I watch TV or read a book I 'm sedentary . I do n't  quite know the answer to this . Maybe stand for a while , walk around during breaks . I got ta give more thought to this one <p> I do a lot of driving during my day . As much as I like driving , I cant possibly imagine how cab or truck drivers can do it without going totally nuts . I survive because none of my trips are very long and I can incorporate some activity in between the trips . <p> Love it Dr. J ! We actually have had those sign people here in southern CA for a few years . I love watching the ones that really get into it dancing &amp; twirling the sign &amp; even throwing it up in the air &amp; catching it . You can tell some are just embracing it . In fact most are here . <p> BUT the point you make about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! At home , I am up &amp; down the stairs many times on top of my regular workout . All the suggestions you laid out there I know people can find at least a couple they can do the choice is theirs ! ; - ) <p> I always read your column , Dr. J , but I never comment , this time , though , I could n't resist myself ! . One day , I was looking at a picture of two men in Indonesia and an elefant they took care of ; these guys were lean and muscular , you know , the wiry kind , it made me think that daily working with elefants is good for you ! and you do n't  even need to go to the gym to get those muscles , which led me to think that back in the day , people that led very active lives as part of their job or lifestyle , like say , a farmer , did n't  do it for 30 minutesand then spent the day sitting down ; myself , when I lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of my life ) , spent half my day walking somewhere . So I got up and started walking back and forth ( one step foward one step backwards ) while watching TV , while navigating Internet ; I 'm holding the keyboard with one arm and typing the other right now , it takes practice ! , I step side to side when I brush my teeth or wash the dishes , all in all , I try to get a couple of hours , at least , of walking " activity . When people ask me why oh why do I do that , I tell them what I just told here , about being active most of your day , etc. , but I 'm met with looks that say that I 'm a bit odd . The best thing I found after I started doing this is that I started sleeping like a baby , which led me to the theory that when we are tired from working at the office , dealing with the kids and dinner , commuting from work , etc. , we are mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bad , but your body thinks it has tons of energy to spend ! and that 's another thing that makes people look at me funny when I tell them how to cure their mild imsomnia . Anyway , I feel so much better since I started staying on my feet when I could be sitting , I do n't  think I could ever go back to sitting for long periods of time . <p> OMG they are so talented , those sign spinners . They do n't  do that around here . : ) I do worry about the distracted driving this might cause as you mentioned Smart on their part to not just stand around ! ! <p> And I 'm sure getting lots of activity these days , as we move a lot of my husbands car parts and such to a new and improved location . Feels great lifting with the legs , I forgot about those aductors ! I think they 're aductors . Which ones are the abductors , again ? I used to know all that stuff by heart when I Jazzercized . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walk around the house . Might take me a little longer to get to where I 'm going , but fitter . <p> There is a young man who is an awesome sign spinner in front of one of the chain restaurants around here ( I cant remember which one ) and I always think , " How long does he keep that up ? " <p> I never really thought about it Dr. J , but you are right . In many cases , the farther up the food chain workers get the more they tend to sit . You have great ideas for staying active while working a desk job ! <p> Hip Adductors and Abductors : These are the muscles of the inner and outer thigh . The inner thighs are called adductors , because they being the leg towards ( think add ) the midline of the body . The abductors are the outer thigh muscles that bring the leg away from the midline of the body . <p> Such a good post ! ! ! ! When I was a workin girl I had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one way ) to work ! ! ! I walked during lunch , and I still got my weighted home vids in . Sadly I let it all go when I came home to be a mamaI especially miss the wind in my hair on my bike ! Its not a sob story , I just need to find a new stride . It would benefit all of us ! <p> Out of all the blogs that I have participated in this seems to be the one topic that is over looked every time . Not only sign spinning an effective way to market but the amount of energy and fitness level required to be successful at the craft is actually quite high . Like Dr. J said some people just stand there and wave , but those who actually take the job seriously or choose to have fun with it , either use it as exercise and perform with their sign or use it as an opportunity to draw attention to the company they are advertising for which is what it is meant to do . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also what Dr. J commented on the legality of the advertising method , because often times it can be quite distracting . 
@@97602932 @1802932/ <h> Insanity Workout Review : Is the Pain Worth It ? <p> I 've completed my 60-day Insanity workout review and took a couple of weeks to reflect on the , well , insanity I 've put my body through over the last two months . Are the time , pain , expense and effort worth it to have a rock-hard body and improve your overall fitness ? <p> Yes , absolutely , if this workout style appeals to you . <p> As I alluded to in previous posts during my Insanity journey , I 'm a competitive person by nature . Ive been an athlete for most of my life , and although I 've been away for sports for about seven years , that competitive spirit is still within me . The sports drills and general intensity in the Insanity workout were certainly reminiscent of my training days , but since all workouts were done at home , I could focus on performing the moves and pushing myself without fear of embarrassment . <p> The Insanity DVD series will probably not appeal to those who prefer more low-key , passive forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensity of sports . I 've noted as much several times . But for the right personality fit , there 's no better way to get in shape , see results and build a strong foundation of fitness . <h> Final Results and Recommendations <p> As of my last day on the Insanity workout , I 'd lost 7 pounds and decreased my chest , waist and hip measurements by 2 inches each . A week after finishing Insanity ( and starting a new round , with a day off between workouts ) , I 'd lost another 4 pounds . Two weeks after finishing Insanity , I am stabilizing at a 12-to-14-pound total weight loss . My obliques are cut , and my overall physique is noticeably slimmed down . Ive been told that my weight loss looks more like 20 pounds . <p> I do have a few words of warning for those who might want to embark on the Insanity workout . Ill be following these on my new round . <p> Commit to doing the workout as scheduled , without fail . Earlier this summer , I was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go ; the difficulties I encountered upon restarting the workouts showed my conditioning losses and challenged my spirit . <p> Do your workouts with a buddy ( together or apart ) . My Insanity cycle inspired a friend who already owned the DVDs to start up a new cycle . We bonded over the challenging DVD of the day and kept each other accountable . <p> Catalog your journey with the public . Share your workouts with your blog readers , Twitter followers or Facebook friends . Having this column as an accountability tool made sure I kept on task , as I knew I had to report on how my week went . <p> Follow the diet that comes with the plan . I did n't  do this until the end . Its tempting to eat whatever you want after working so hard I did n't  gain weight when I did so , which seemed to reinforce the behavior but shortly after eating a clean , healthy diet , you 'll start to crave fish , or chicken or homemade guacamole after workouts . ( And you 'll see faster results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Insanity Workout , go here . To catch up on my Insanity journey , check out the following posts : <p> As an overweight person , I wanted to provide in my input . I am 28 years old , 50 ? and 197lbs , which I do realize is very overweight for my height and frame . I used to be 123lbs about 6 years ago ; however , being a single mom of two , working full time and going to school started to really take its toll . Yesterday , I just finished Week 3 of Insanity and so far I absolutely love it ! ! ! Although I do n't move like the people in the workout , I modify it in a way that my moves are similar but focusing on maintaining safety when it comes to form . For example , the Global Jumps , until I can get more strength in my knees , instead of being close to the ground , I just bend my knees and go down into a squat then jump while still moving both my arms as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure my form is still intact . It 's still hard but I am having a blast ! I made the mistake of not taking measurements before I started but I did take before pics and I recently took my Week 2 pics and let me just say , so far the results are short of amazing ! I 'm actually looking forward to the fit test to see how I 've improved . I ca n't wait to see the end results and most likely , I will be doing another round or two of Insanity . As far as the nutrition , I do n't follow the nutrition guide provided , but I am definitely watching what I eat and making sure I get enough protein and veggies and so far so good ! Due to my busy schedule the only time I can fit in my workouts are first thing in the morning , which during my work days , means my workouts start at 3am because I start at 5am . It was hard at first but it 's becoming easier and I definitely prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to motivate anyone in a similar situation . When I started I was at 210lbs and now at 197lbs ! I 'm happy with it and look forward to changes to come ! ? ? <p> This is my story . Started Insanity around the 10 July with my partner . He is in the army and has been active all his life . Me .. well that 's another story . Most of my life I was a couch-potato . Always a chubby kid , always a chubby teenager . At my heaviest I weighed 98kg . I am 162cm tall . So my ideal weight would be around 52-54 kg . In the last two years I 've managed to lose most of my weight and dropped down to 60kg . I discovered a new love for running and cycling . Unfortunately sometimes this is not enough and you need more intense workouts like , bootcamp , cross-fit etc . This is where Insanity comes in play . First of all let me say , I HATE these type of exercises and was always discouraged by them in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to try it with him for two months . There were days when I cried constantly , before , during and after workouts . I had my hissy fit episodes where I refused to do it and would try anything to get out of it . Its very interesting how strong is that mental block in your brain that stops you from doing things that are good for you . But if you can put your mind to it , have a supportive partner/friend and really try and push for 2 months , its incredible what a mind can do and how strong it gets . I 've managed to push through that barrier and I cant turned into I can .. just do it like other people say here is really what works .. do n't  think .. JUST DO IT .. yes its incredibly hard , yes you will feel Exhausted every day for about few weeks but if you can get passed this , you will lose weight , gain muscle , get stronger and have more energy .. as someone else said earlier .. PUSH , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insanity . I 'm 57 162lbs I was never really into cardio or working out hard.I would do treadmill and walk with toning videos . I find its a great workout for sure . I have bad knees so I wrap them and modify certain movements which is great . I still feel a great workout without hurting or killing myself . Just remember you can modify any of the moves just as long as you keep moving . You can take a break when you need too and start again . That 's the best thing I like about it . I would recommend to anyone who wants a great workout and is dedicated to getting in shape . If you are n't  serious then do n't  do this program . : ) It is worth it ( I think anyway ) <p> I started a year ago a hard workout of Zumba Zaragoza , very hard , 60 minutes is based fitness using Latin dance steps , wonderful , forgiving each session 1.5 liters of water , obviously the water is recovered , but in a year my physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitness Zaragoza <p> This is my 5th week and I feel greatI had tried so much workout and never saw the results but Insanity is another thing Ive already see and feel the difference in my body so my recommendation for all of you is to start digging deeper its worth it God bless you all ! ! ! <p> I received the insanity program from my father-in-law 3 weeks after having my 3rd baby , she is now 2 months old and I have n't started the program yet . I really want to use the program , I want to surprise my husband by loosing weight while he is deployed over the next 12 months . I do n't  know anyone else who is using the program . Is there a Facebook group that is formed for people like me ? Kind of a support group ? I just graduated after 5 years of college , a divorce , 3 pregnancies and a new marriage . I could definitely loose some of my extra weight . <p> I am doing Insanity now . its my second time around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ join the message boards . We have a group that just started 10/14/13 . Larry M. Is the coach and we are supporting each other thru the process . We would be glad to have you . No , I am not a Beachbody Coach , but the support of others will help you . Good luck . <p> I made it through 7 of the 9 weeks before I got hit with the flu . The flu knocked me out for about a week and I just could n't get started on Insanity again . Decided to pick up T25 , love it and once I 'm done with it , I plan on giving Insanity another go . Insanity is awesome , T25 is too , Shawn T you are the man ! <p> I just finished workout #3 and the one thing I would recommend is doing a 5 minute warm-up and cool-down ( before and after the workout ) . You dive into the heavy jumping and other intensive exercises pretty quickly , and so the risk of injury ( especially for someone middle aged like me 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am doing modified versions of several of the exercises ; I still am getting a great workout ; I just do n't  want to find myself having to stop for a torn hamstring or some other ailment . I also would say that you have to be prepared for some aches and pains the first couple weeks . I ached all over for two days after the 1st workout and am still dealing with muscle spasms here and there . So , I occasionally grab the Ibuprofen to manage the inflammation . So far , the aches are temporary and I just chalk it up to your muscles processing the extra work they are doing . Overall , I would say I feel really great after the workout ( even when I am tired going into it ) . <p> A very low calorie diet can produce quick weight loss , but what happens once the diet ends ? Most people go back to the same old way of eating that caused them to be overweight in the first place and end up gaining back any lost weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best option for producing substantial , long-term results for the exact reason you pointed out . A much better option is focusing on eating " clean " rather than focusing excessively on the quantity of food . Do n't  get me wrong , quantity is important . However , it is not nearly as important as the quality of the food you are putting into your body . <p> As an active veteran in the United States Army , you would think that I 've gone through some pretty tough , and challenging training . There 's not a whole lot of training programs that can get you better results , or get you in better shape that being an dedicated active duty Soldier This is one of the few . Soldiers love programs like this one . <p> I 'm wanting to get the DVDs and start this but am concerned about the food side of it . I 'm on a very very tight budget and without knowing which foods are recommended , am worried I wont be able to afford it . Have saved for the DVDs , has taken me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me know if it caters for small budgets ? Thanks . <p> On day #3 tommorow i just want to fast forward time to the new exercise , i am fairly slim , i just have a bit of a belly but really skinny arms ( not a good luck for a man ) i just want to get ripped and lean , the diet is harder than the exercise i find . But like i say its only day 3 ! <p> Today is day 3 for me . Im 201lbs but Im suppose to be about 170lbs , so I 'm really looking forward to seeing changes . I do n't  follow the meal program because I love been doing my own meal prep/clean eating program that I think suits me best . This is my third time attempting the insanity workout program , but its also the firat time I 've passed the first three minutes ! ! ! ! is there a support group etc ? ? My goal is to be in a two piece swimsuit or even a fitted dress without the bulge that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program about 4 years ago , I did n't  finish because my workout buddy gave out on me and I got extremely depressed . But now I 'm motivated to complete it and loose 20 pounds . I 'm 24 , 220 pounds and I got pretty wide build already so I 'm sure 20 pounds will do the trick . 
@@97602933 @1802933/ <p> This past Saturday , I took on the Ridiculous Obstacle Challenge , affectionately known as the ROC Race . This 5K event took place at the Del Mar Fairgrounds we even began the race by running through the same starting gates used during horse races . While the ROC Race was n't as challenging as , say , the Gladiator RockN Run , it was easily the most fun event Ive done since beginning my one-race-a-month personal challenge in March . <p> The 2012 ROC Race took place on May 19 and May 20 . Read on for my experience at the race , how it differed from the mud runs Ive done , and what 's in store for June . <h> What is the ROC Race ? <p> The ROC Race is a Southern California race event put on by VAVI that blends military-style obstacles seen at mud races with " fun " obstacles inspired by shows like " Wipeout , " " Ninja Warrior " and " American Gladiator . " <p> This race was packed with 18 to 20 obstacles ranging in difficulty from super-simple to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrant ( edible ) chalk , hopped over orange traffic barriers , navigated horizontally across a rock-climbing wall , slid down multiple water slides ( including the largest one in the world ) , and crossed a pool of water on a rope , Tarzan-style . Each obstacle was suitably staffed for the best experience ; that meant dressed-up " gorillas " atop the monkey bars batting at our hands and well-muscled men shaking and jumping on hand and foot ropes as we tightroped across a water trap . My favorite obstacle by far was the Mammoth , the aforementioned super-sized water slide towards the end of the race . <p> ROC Race participants got a commemorative shirt and a beer voucher . The best part of this race was the afterparty : DJs spinning all day long , around 50 vendor booths with swag , lots of food trucks , several beer stations and a full bar , and even a makeshift shower station sponsored by an organic soap brand . ( We elected to stay dirty , which is probably why I ca n't think of the brand offhand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenged Athletes Foundations Operation Rebound program for disabled military veterans and military personnel . I was especially inspired after running in the same 8 a.m. heat as several athletes with prosthetic limbs what an embodiment of the phrase " no excuses " ! <h> ROC Race Training <p> As I alluded to before , the ROC Race was more about fun than physical exertion , but I 've been building up my workout regimen in preparation for the June Camp Pendleton Mud Race and the October Tough Mudder . To mix things up , I made Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays my " heavy " workout days and took it easy the other days to recover . here 's the day-by-day breakdown : <p> Saturday : 30 to 60 minutes of low-effort activity , like an easy hike or a long walk , and 60 minutes of yoga <p> Sunday : Off <p> My " extra " Monday workout was any activity I felt like doing that wasnt in my typical repertoire .

Diana and I ran at 8:00 a.m. with two friends , Dora and Dana . I stayed with Dora after the race to partake in the food , beer and festivities . Although we did n't  dress up ( save for matching tank tops and coordinating bandanas ) , the costumes at the ROC Race were legendary . We saw huge teams with well-planned-out costumes , every superhero under the sun , tons of body paint and even some womens shaping underwear ( on men and women ) . Ridiculous , indeed . <p> One thing I noticed , based on my day-after muscle soreness ? I could use some practice on the monkey bars . Any ideas on how a childless adult can swing that ? 
@@97602934 @1802934/ <h> The Hardest Conversation : Talking to Your Partner About Losing Weight 3782 @qwx863782 <p> No one likes to stir up trouble in their close relationships ; like it or not , there are conversations about areas that , for everyones best interests , need to be addressed , however delicately . One such area not surprising , considering the current statistics of two-thirds of us being either overweight or obese is that of the need to make healthy lifestyle changes and lose weight . <p> " Suggesting to someone that they should consider losing a few pounds may not be a comfortable conversation to have , but if someone close to you has a large waistline , then as long as you do it in a sensitive manner , discussing it with them now could help them avoid critical health risks later down the line and could even save their life , " says professor David Haslam , the chair of the National Obesity Forum . This approach is reminiscent of poet Alexander Popes 18th-century line , " Fools rush in where angels fear to tread . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a second brave voice on the subject Dr. Jean-Pierre Despres , the scientific director of the International Chair on Cardiometabolic Risk also spoke up : " This is about health , not vanity . Start by encouraging someone close to you ( who would benefit ) to make simple lifestyle changes such as becoming more active , making small alterations to their eating habits , and replacing sugary drinks with water . " <p> The motivation behind these men suggesting that spouses stir up a hornets nest is the result of a poll of more than 2,000 people commissioned by the International Chair on Cardiometabolic Risk ( ICCR ) . The study demonstrated the risks of being overweight and in particular , overweight around the waist , as excess abdominal fat has been proven to increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes , coronary heart disease and stroke . <p> The poll , supported by the National Obesity Forum , found that 59 percent of people were concerned that a loved one would develop serious health problems due to his or her large waistline . <p> This seems simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this issue . <p> It is apparent , according to this research , that men are three times more likely than women to struggle with telling their partner that they need to lose weight . The usual reasons these men gave for this hesitancy was the fear of hurting their partners feelings or provoking a significant emotional reaction from them when this subject was broached . <p> Well , yeah ! I mean , men know that she looks fine in those jeans at least , men had better say so ! <p> As for doing it in a kind , sensitive way , I think a woman might be more successful in doing that , but in my opinion , a man telling a woman that she needs to lose weight and kindness are a societal oxymoron . <p> The poll found that almost one-third of men ( 31 percent ) do not want to confront their partner about losing weight , compared with only 10 percent of women who would not want to tell their man to do so . Not surprisingly , 23 percent of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a close female friend to go on a diet compared with 8 percent of the men . That 's because women are smart ! <p> Do n't  criticize , says Amy Gorin , a University of Connecticut behavioral psychologist specializing in weight loss and weight control . She recommends using praise for any exercising or healthy eating your partner does . She adds , " Most important , shape up yourself . If you 're living healthily , itll be easier for your partner to do the same . " <p> Do n't  nag . Continual berating only causes conflict and resentment , says Maye Musk , a New York nutritionist and couples counselor . <p> Do n't  judge . Sugary , fatty foods are very tempting , and it does n't  help to be critical when somebody gives in , says Gorin . <p> Do n't  sabotage . Bringing junk food into the house only fuels a partners weight problem , says Musk . <p> Do n't  play cop . Most people do n't  like being told what they should and shouldnt eat , says Gorin . " Nobody likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you push something on them , theyll rebel . " <p> Be helpful by problem-solving with your partner . Offer strategies to resist temptation . Look for ways to do it differently the next time . <p> Be careful about what you eat in front of your partner , and do not use food as a reward . <p> Be a role model . If one partner starts exercising and eating better , the other partner also tends to lose weight , says Gorin . <p> Be a team and do it together . Suggest joint healthy lifestyle changes such as taking walks , trying new low-calorie recipes and going grocery-shopping together , adds Gorin . <p> Although we do n't  want to stir up trouble communicating in our close relationships , we always do , so we might as well say something that might actually be helpful this time , and nothing says " helpful " like living a healthier life ! Acquiring a medical condition that could have been prevented by preemptive lifestyle changes is not what we want to happen . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for a more objective opinion , suggest that they ask their doctor or another knowledgeable health care provider about whether they would benefit from making healthy , life-saving changes . Then they can have the emotional outburst at their office . <p> We do n't  want to be like the myth about ostriches and bury our heads in the sand . It is so much better to risk having our heads taken off when we are only trying to be helpful . <p> Thankfully I 've never had to have this conversation with my husband ! He weighs the same as when we got married . BUT he has had to have it with me in the past ! ! ! He would see that I was eating a lot and he wanted to help me but I took it in a very bad way . That was a difficult time . <p> The conversation in question is a slippery slope , but just being a one-man support system is much more realistic in my opinion . Much more like a knight in shining armor kinda stuff . Flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've had boyfriends say things to me , and not at all in a tactful way . Of course , its a touchy and sensitive subject , and I resented all reference to the fact that I was fat , as though I could be in denial if nobody said it out loud . Anyway , I have a slightly different problem now , been starting to hang out with an ex again , and though his weight is mostly stable , I can not deal with his lifestyle . He is lazy and I am restless and kinda hyper , can not do sedentary well . Hates hiking , walks from his apartment to bicycle , was really sore when I made him walk up a foothill with me for only two hours . He ran into a problem when he wanted to make me dinner , trying to figure out something yummy that did n't  involve fried pork .

Unfortunately I see the same pattern in other family members and feel totally powerless to make any impact on how they live their lives . I am not giving up but I am very , very discouraged . <p> Great advice Dr. J !

He always says he is a " Fit to the Finish " failure . I tell him that only he can make the decision to just get it done . I can cook , model good behavior , etc. , but I cant do it for him . There is no way I would have responded positively to him had he told me to lose weight when I was obese . He was always supportive and unfortunately was also my eating partner . <p> This is a very tough situation !

So far 2 people at work have and that is very encouraging . <p> I appreciate what you are saying , still sometimes I wonder if good advice can stand alone regardless of the poor example of the giver . I read several blogs where the message is good , but the blogger ca n't do it themselves . <p> Sheri ! <p> I think its great that you have been able to help others with your knowledge and example ! <p> A tough call . But someone has to do the telling and someone has to be told . It is easier if the person doing the teller are themselves not overweight . I struggle with this weight issue . I do watch my diet but three or four times a week I release my vigilance and this adds on the calories . <p> It just depends on whether or not the message coming from " you , " whoever " you " may be , would help . If Its not going to accomplish anything , and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivation is in bringing it up .

I think the motivation has to come from the overweight person , not the partner . Which does n't  mean one ca n't be as helpful as possible in encouraging baby steps , but I think they have to start with a true desire to change from within . But these are great ideas for assisting in the process !

@@97602938 @1802938/ <h> Losing weight with Diet-to-Go Meal Delivery <p> When looking for a diet plan , many busy people just want to be told exactly what to eat and when . That 's a big part of the appeal of programs like Jenny Craig , but what if you do n't  want to go to meetings and talk about your weight struggles you just want food to help you she 'd pounds ? <p> Enter Diet-to-Go , a one-stop diet food delivery service that just sends you the food you want seven breakfasts , lunches and dinners a week without having to be involved in a weight-loss community at all if you do n't  want to be . <h> About Diet-to-Go <p> Diet-to-Go has been helping people lose weight through food delivery since 1991 . The company is based in Virginia and offers local pickup in the DC Metro , Virginia , Baltimore , Philadelphia and San Francisco areas . The rest of the United States is served by mail order , with clients east of the Mississippi receiving food from Virginia and those in the west getting deliveries from California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler , with non-perishable items in a cardboard box and the whole thing shrink-wrapped together . A weeks delivery of food weighs about 34 pounds with packaging . Make sure you have lots of space in your freezer before you start there 's more food than can comfortably fit in a standard refrigerator freezer if you have much else in it . <h> The Food <p> Diet-to-Go provides breakfast , lunch and dinner , along with extras like fruit juice and condiments , all individually packaged by meal and with all perishable items other than whole fruit frozen . <p> The company offers three different diet plans and two levels of calories : <p> Low-fat traditional <p> Low-fat vegetarian <p> Low-carb <p> The low-fat plans are available in 1,200- or 1,600-calorie variations , while the low-carb diet " averages 1,200 calories a day . " The menus are published on the website , which also indicates which week is being served when you place your order . The website says food should ship on the Monday or Tuesday after you place your order and you should receive it within three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something being served that they do n't  like . There is a 50 cent charge for any meal substitutions . <h> Nutrition <p> The low-fat diet plans are designed with the USDA Food Pyramid in mind , and also meet the guidelines of the American Heart Association and American Cancer Society , Diet-to-Go says . The low-carb diet is described as similar to the Atkins Diet . <p> All the website says about the plans health credentials is that the meals " meet the nutritional guidelines " of various health groups . It does n't  explain exactly what those guidelines are or who analyzed the menus to determine it met the standards . <p> In fact , Diet-to-Gos website is pretty lean on medical credibility , which is something you expect to see on a diet website these days . There 's no statement of endorsement from a doctor or even a picture of a doctor to imply that the diet has been vetted by some kind of health authority . <p> The only information from a medical authority I could find on the website was an article about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered dietician , Rebecca Mohning . The article says that the low-fat plans all meet the guidelines that Americans should consume less than 2,400 milligrams of sodium daily , and the 1,200 calorie plans provide less than 2,000 milligrams daily . <p> As an aside , that might be true as an average , but looking at the nutritional information you 'll see some days offer more sodium than the guidelines suggest , and a true low-sodium diet would provide more like 1,500 milligrams of sodium daily , but that may not be of concern to all dieters . <p> You can see the nutritional information for the different diet plans and individual meals online , but with no information there about what a healthy diet should consist of , dieters kind of have to take it on faith that , for example , a vegetarian sandwich with 25 grams of fat and 13 grams of saturated fat is considered low fat ( by comparison , a Whopper without mayonnaise has 10 fewer calories and 22 grams of fat ) . <h> What 's the Diet Like ? <p> When food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be consumed on which day or even what is supposed to be breakfast , lunch or dinner ( consult the online menus for what to eat when ) . <p> On the day the food arrives , the dieter is just to consume dinner . If you 're only eating the plan for a week , as I did to test it out , you 'll only have breakfast and lunch on day seven ( five-day plans are also available ) . <p> I tested the 1,200 calorie low-fat vegetarian diet for a week , though I 'm pretty certain I ordered the 1,600 calorie plan . I happened to get week two . I also got week three , because Diet-to-Go automatically continues to ship food unless you tell it not to , so if you just want to give it a test run keep that in mind . <p> The meals are small , as you would expect from diet foods , but its clear an effort has been made to make them nutritional and provide a variety of foods . The vegetarian diet plan does rely heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week I consumed , and Brussels sprouts and asparagus were the go-to green vegetables . <p> My diet box did not come with snacks , but it is possible to order snacks including protein shakes , fruit bars , Rice Krispies treats , Baked Lays potato chips , even " homemade " brownies . <p> Of course the site says that snacking is not recommended because it adds calories , but who are they to judge or miss an opportunity to get some more cash ? <h> Cost of Diet-to-Go <p> Speaking of cash , getting a full weeks meals shipped to your house is not cheap . On average the plan costs $17.85 a day , plus an average of $16.95 shipping . If you do n't  count the shipping cost , that 's about $6 a meal , which is n't really that bad as diet food services go , though you could certainly eat for cheaper if you cooked your own food . <p> As a means of comparison , Diet-to-Go has calculated that NutriSystem costs about $3 a meal or $11.85 a day , which adds up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works out to $6.65 a meal , $19.95 a day and $139.65 a week , with $19.95 shipping . BistroMD is $7.61 per meal , or $22.85 a day or $159.95 a week , with $24.95 in shipping costs . <p> Of those other options , Diet-to-Go says only NutriSystem offers choices in terms of meal plans , and only eDiets also boasts no freeze-dried food . Diet-to-Go alone among the plans has local delivery options , freshly prepared foods made in-house and complete meals that include fresh fruit and condiments . <h> Diet Review <p> If you find yourself on the 1,200 calorie version of this diet , odds are good you 're going to be hungry a lot . That would be the case for most people on any 1,200 calorie diet , because that 's a pretty big difference from what most people are eating . <p> I found the food to mostly be pretty bland , though occasionally use of jalapenos made the food taste like jalapenos . <p> The one desert that was offered was so awful I could n't even eat it , and the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right temperature . For example , I melted a cheese slice trying to defrost it , and it was extremely difficult to warm a fruit cup so that it was n't frozen but also was n't cooked ( why they could n't use shelf-stable fruit cups is beyond me ) . <p> Things that gave me pause were the incredibly long ingredient lists on some of the foods ( the black bean chili , for example , had MSG , egg , soy and milk products ) and the immense amount of packaging involved in the meals . Each component of the meal is in an individual container or wrapped in its own bit of plastic , and the whole meal is wrapped to a foam tray in plastic . <p> ( I read somewhere , though not on the Diet-to-Go site , that the trays were recyclable , but I saw no indication of such a thing on the packaging itself . This diet makes a huge amount of trash ! ) <p> I made up a rating system of the foods as I tried them and most rated 3 or 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . They 're not things I 'd choose to eat on purpose , but if were trying to lose a few pounds there are worse things to eat . That said there are also some bad things to eat in these meals ( like the mushy beyond recognition asparagus ) . <p> But for convenience and not having to think at all about what you 're going to eat on any given day , Diet-to-Go really ca n't be beat . The food is decent if you 're used to eating diet food , it is n't outrageously expensive ( though you may have to buy a freezer to accommodate it ) and the diet provides absolutely everything you need to eat so you do n't  have to go grocery shopping at all . <p> Have you tried Diet-to-Go ? We 'd love to hear about your experience ! <p> ( By Sarah E. White for CalorieLab ) <p> Diet-to-Go offers low-fat , low-carb , and vegetarian options , with two calorie levels of 1,200 or 1,600 calories per day . <h> Diet-to-Go Food Critiques <p> When I was sampling the Diet-to-Go 1,200 calorie a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scale of 1 to 5 . <p> Inedible , I cant imagine putting another bite in my mouth <p> Pretty awful , but I can eat it <p> Tolerable , but I would n't eat it again <p> Good , I 'd eat it again <p> So good I 'd eat it if I werent trying to diet <p> I found that most of the foods ended up in the three and four range . For more specifics on each individual meal , read on . <h> Day One <p> The first day on Diet-to-Go the food comes in the afternoon so you only eat the meals at dinner . My first meal was black bean chili with sour cream , jalapeno corn bread and herb dip . <p> " Black bean soup " might have been a more apt description , since my paper towel covering the meal as it reheated soaked up a bunch of liquid and the chili was still quite soupy . It looks good , with a lot of vegetables , but it tastes soupy , but for a bit of crunch , which I think comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the dip was nicely flavored and probably my favorite part of the meal . It did n't  register as that spicy when I was eating it but it did make my nose run . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <h> Day Two <p> My cat Louis got into my darkroom and ate the negative while it was drying , so no photo for this one If anyone doing this program sends in a photo , I 'll include it here . <p> Breakfast is what they call omelet pomodoro and Sicilian asparagus . This meal taught me the horrible lesson that sometimes it takes so long to get the entree warm that the side dishes are annihilated . The omelet itself was fine , with eggs , spinach , tomato and cheese . <p> The asparagus , on the other hand , which was cut in little pieces , was shriveled and hard to eat ( I know , I tried . ) <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <p> Lunch was the Mirkin burger with American cheese and barbeque sauce and a melon mix . Calling this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a pile of lentils , rice and carrots you top with a slice of American cheese and a ketchup-packet sized serving of barbecue sauce . <p> This is my first introduction to the frozen fruit cup , which comes out of the microwave with a strange texture , as you might imagine . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <p> Dinner was mushroom ravioli with ratatouille mix and Brussels sprouts . The ratatouille is actually pretty good , and the ravioli was n't bad , if a little dry by the time it was reheated . As is common with these meals , you 'd be shocked at how little flavor there is . <p> The Brussels sprouts are not as bad as I feared , though I 'm not a big fan of this vegetable I see over and over during my sample week . <p> Rating : 4 of 5 , without the Brussels sprouts <h> Day Three <p> The plain bagel for breakfast today looks like a bagel from the 1970s , before serving sizes went crazy . Unfortunately , I toasted it like it was a modern-day bagel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of low-fat cream cheese comes in the package and that makes it a little more palatable . <p> I almost finished it with the help of the cream cheese , but some parts were just too burned to eat . <p> Rating : 4 of 5 if not burned <h> Day Three <p> Lunch is the Southwest sandwich : a black bean burger with salsa and the fresh apple I got in my package . The menu says there 's supposed to be a tomato slice , but I 'm not too sad about not getting to eat previously frozen tomato . <p> The salsa is the only condiment , and though its jalapeno heavy ( I 'm beginning to sense a theme ) its not all that flavorful once you spread it on the sandwich . <p> Parts of the bread are hard and parts soggy once you reheat the meal . In all , there 's not a lot of flavor but its not horrible . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <p> The Tuscan soy nuggets that are the main part of dinner today are one of the few meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served with vegetable couscous and asparagus , actually tastes better than it looks . The soy nuggets are somewhat reminiscent of chicken , and the couscous is n't too soggy . <p> The asparagus is horrid . I ate a couple of spears covered in cheese , then scraped off the cheese and ate it with the rest of the meal . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 without the asparagus <h> Day Four <p> I never would have thought to eat a blueberry muffin with raspberry preserves , but that 's breakfast today , along with organic yogurt ( also blueberry ; do n't  know if everyone gets blueberry with blueberry or if its random ) and orange juice . <p> The muffin has lots of berries , which is good , but it is really dense , and the jelly , with both sugar and corn syrup , is super sweet . The organic yogurt is a nice touch . <p> Rating : 4 of 5 <p> Lunch today is a Greek pasta salad with apple juice . This one required a bit of planning because its meant to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the first meal that smells good right out of the freezer . It actually tastes pretty good too , like Italian dressing . <p> But freezing , as we 've covered before , does very bad things to asparagus , and that I could n't stomach . The rest of the pasts is watery and does n't  have a lot of vegetables ( black olives and red peppers are obvious ; the menu says there are cucumbers and onions , too , but I do n't  notice them until I find a giant piece of onion ) . <p> Rating : Without the asparagus , 4 of 5 <p> Dinner for day four is the best of the lot by far : a Mexican burrito with beans , rice , veggies and salsa . This is spicier than it seemed when I started eating . It provides a nice variety with beans , rice , the burrito with whole beans and vegetables , salsa and grilled peppers and onions . <p> It actually feels like a meal and tastes pretty fresh , which is rare for these meals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breakfast today is a Greek stuffed mushroom , and there 's supposed to be V-8 but I did n't  get any . The mushroom came out tough but still edible . Given the big pile of spinach on top , youd think this would at least taste like spinach , but it does n't  really taste like anything . <p> My meal comes with a mix of oranges and raisins , and I wonder if this is a substitute for the juice . I 'd have rather had the juice , frankly . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <p> I do n't  know what the Diet-to-Go people were thinking when they made the predominant vegetables in breakfast and lunch today spinach and mushroom , but that 's what they did . Lunch is a spinach and red pepper " meltover " with mushroom and artichoke salad and cranberry juice . <p> The meltover is basically a piece of pita with spinach , bell peppers and cheese .

Its not bad as vegetable side dishes go . <p> Rating : 4 of 5 <p> Dinner is called tomato veggie pie , and though it bears no resemblance to actual pie , it is a pretty tasty collection of veggies and cheese . There 's no real spice , as usual , and the side dish of zucchini and yellow bell peppers is a watery , soggy mess by the time the main dish is warm a common complaint of mine . <p> Rating : Without the side dish , 5 of 5 <h> Day Six <p> Breakfast today an oat and raisin scone with orange marmalade and orange juice is so dry , tasteless and boring I cant even bring myself to finish it . This food is really starting to depress me . I cant imagine eating it long-term . <p> I know that diet food is n't necessarily exciting , but this stuff is n't even that appealing . I 'm bored , I want to snack all the time and I 'm counting the meals until this is over . <p> Rating : 1 of 5 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Tuscan bean salad is as unimpressive as it looks . Soggy spinach , cold pasta , not good flavor . <p> The breadstick is probably the best part of the meal ( and I could cook it properly because it was n't frozen to the rest of the meal ) . <p> Rating : 2 of 5 <p> Dinner almost makes up for my day of bad food with vegetable ravioli that 's actually really good . The veggies are decent tasting and the cheese ravioli is good . The watery sauce is the only thing that keeps this part of the meal from being my favorite . <p> Unfortunately , this is the one meal that came with dessert : chocolate mousse . Even with reheating it by itself , the mousse exploded in my microwave . It smells really good but tastes like melted bittersweet chocolate with an oily overtone . I can only take two bites . <p> Rating : 5 of 5 for the ravioli , 1 for the mousse <h> Day Seven <p> Breakfast is scrambled eggs rancheros , and I assume its supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soy sausage and a tortilla . But the tortilla heats together , making it impossible to unwrap . <p> The eggs are really soft but have pretty good flavor with the salsa . The sausage tastes like soy sausage . The tortilla somehow came out both crunchy and chewy . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <p> Lunch is hummus , a pita and a fruit cup . I love hummus , but I 've never considered it a meal in itself . The hummus is fine , but the pitas are a lot fluffier than anything I 've ever before called a pita . <p> Even if you 're the most liberal spreader in the world , there 's a lot more hummus than there is pita . It seems more like a snack than a meal , but the nutritional information tells me this is the second-biggest meal in terms of calories of the whole week . <p> Rating : 4 of 5 for taste , 3 of 5 for being unsatisfying for the number of calories in it <p> This dinner , a white bean and vegetable casserole with wild rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked the most appetizing in its frozen state . And it actually is pretty good . It has lots of veggies and beans , and the wild rice has a good flavor , which is good , because as usual there 's not a lot of seasoning . <p> Whatever the sauce was ( the package actually called this a stew , while the menu calls it a casserole ) mostly leaked out all over my microwave , because a lot of it had frozen to the outside of the package . That does n't  bother me , because this meal is n't as watery as usual . <p> This one actually feels healthy but also tastes good . I 'd probably eat this even if it werent diet food . <p> Rating : 5 of 5 <h> Day Eight <p> The final breakfast is a tomato and mushroom omelet with Brussels sprouts . Its not a good last impression , as this meal is downright soggy . The Brussels sprouts are n't  bad , but I do n't  know why they 're a breakfast item . <p> One taste makes the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good morning flavor . <p> Rating : 3 of 5 <p> The last meal of all is a sandwich known as the Jamie , a blue cheese and pesto sandwich , along with black bean soup . This one kind of exploded in the microwave , but its tasty , if soggy ( again ! Maybe I just stink at reheating items in the microwave ) . Finally there 's some flavor , thanks to the pesto , but it does n't  taste like much else , except for a couple of bites where I get some blue cheese . <p> The soup is hugely chunky , making it somewhat impractical to eat , and it has no real flavor or spice . <h> 9 Responses to " Losing weight with Diet-to-Go Meal Delivery " <p> I 'm currently in my second week of Diet to Go , their menu week 1/5 . I 'm happy with the food so far for the most part , and I 'm fairly picky about quality food . I selected the 1200 calorie traditional low-fat . There was one lame item that I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each menu item individually , i.e. , not all foods do well in the microwave , some call for the toaster oven . Their directions are not helpful , but its easy to figure it out yourself . You do have to make space in the freezer , but you absolutely do n't  have to buy a new freezer . I add fresh fruit for a snack , frozen blended bananas for dessert and a dinner out once a week , averaging about 1500 calories a day . I 'm on day eight and I 'm down 5 lbs : ) I know weight goes down quickly at the beginning , but I 'm looking forward to continuing on this program ! <p> I got the low carb and the ingredients they use are aproblem for me . I had a fish meal tonite and it has sugar and hi fructose corn syrup in it . totally unessesary for that recipe and evryone eating low carb knows you do n't  eat that stuff . there are other ingredients they use I wont eat either cause they are used in processed foods which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would post such a rude review . I am quite pleased with the quality and price of diettogo . And the cost to substitute is reasonable . Today , I enjoyed a yummy peach muffin for breakfast , a tasty turkey cheese sandwich and dinner is flatiron steak . <p> Today I picked up my first 9 , I mean 7 meals . ( I was supposed to receive 9 , but 2 got lost ? ? ? ) . Also one was partially opened . Not off to a good start , eh ? Welli called customer service and was told that they cant ship me my missingeals , but they would credit me the cost plus another $10 . While that 's fine and dandy , I still lose a breakfast and a dinner that I now need to find a suitable calorie friendly replacement for . Anyway , I decided to eat my first meal for dinner . It was veggie pizza with broccoli and a small container of chocolate pudding . I cooked the pizza in the toaster oven just enough to get it warm ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or chewy crust ) . I did put the broccoli in the microwave for about 45 seconds . Aside from the few olives I found buried under the cheese , the pizza was surprisingly good .

I asked about the listing and was told they did n't  have one , other than going through the meal tracker , meal by meal .

There is even a website devoted to finding fun ways to get people to do the things that they do not naturally seem to want to do . Of course , that can be like telling most kids that they only have to eat the vegetables that are fun to eat . ( Can we say ketchup ? ) One of my readers was kind enough to tell me about that site . Certainly as children , playing games and sports can be fun , but in my opinion , even if the whole world was a piano keyboard , eventually the fun would deteriorate into the drudgery of practice time . <p> Sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less than 10 percent who really like to exercise , or are lucky enough to find an activity that you really do like , but what about the great sweatless masses that never exercise because they do n't  like to do so ? <p> If you find that you are having trouble " just doing it " with your diet and especially with your exercise , I think the theory of cognitive dissonance may explain much of the problem and give you some clues on how to help yourself . <h> Cognitive Dissonance : A Primer <p> The theory of cognitive dissonance was conceived by Leon Festinger in 1957 . A cognition is the mental process of knowing something a thought , value , fact or emotion . Most cognitions have nothing to do with one another . The few that do are either harmonious with one another , which feels good , or not harmonious , and therefore they create dissonance for us . <p> The following scenario is an example of cognitive dissonance : I like pizza , but I am also trying to lose weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I may gain weight , and if I really want to lose weight , then I can not eat pizza . <p> Cognitive dissonance theory states that people do not like to have dissonant cognitions , especially about eating a pizza . Because of this powerful conflict , most people will attempt to eliminate the dissonance , and that 's where the problem arises . <h> Common Coping Mechanisms <p> ( CC ) Robert Duncan1/Flickr <p> People attempt to do away with cognitive dissonance in several ways . One way is by ignoring it . They may pretend that pizza is not a problem , and just eat it in spite of the affects it has on their weight loss intentions . <p> A second way is to alter the thoughts importance . They can either decide that they cant do without pizza or that losing weight is n't really that important . By lessening the importance of one of the thoughts , they will have less difficulty with it , eat the pizza and not feel bad about it . <p> A third way to deal with it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as , " I do plenty of exercise , " or " Tomatoes are a healthy food , " and so on . This will not only lessen the dissonance , but overwhelm the one thought that says " I should n't have the pizza . " <p> The most common way people seem to deal with cognitive dissonance , however , is to prevent it in the first place . They do this by ignoring the cognition , refusing to accept it or just avoiding the information . By not reading about how to eat healthier , or about the benefits of exercise , they just prevent any dissonance ( although I suppose their waist measurement continues to accumulate data ) . <h> Confronting the Dissonance <p> Knowledge is power . Understanding the challenges of cognitive dissonance , in my opinion , is the key to mastering its power over us . Of course , I was presented with this useful information at an early age when spending a summer with my Aunt Isabelle . I was protesting her instructions at the time with my ( hopefully ) convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Liking it has nothing to do with doing it , and doing it has nothing to do with liking it ! " she sternly said , adding , " Its just a matter of you wanting to do it ! You do want to do it , do n't  you J ? " <p> Taking my aunts advice list firmly under my arm , I quickly got out of there before I was hit with a second list of chores for that day . <p> When you are looking for an activity that you like , realize that for most successfully fit people , enjoying exercise may have nothing to do with " just doing it . " Because of this , concentrate on finding an activity that you can do in the beginning . Who knows , maybe over time you will like it . <p> Concentrate on results , if that helps . Being healthy , disease-free , looking your best , wearing the clothes you want , feeling mentally sharp and having functional fitness are all very likable results . <p> Some activities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider are aerobic classes , Zumba , salsa dancing or Spinning classes with video . The only drawback with these options is that they usually require a structured class situation , which can lead to avoidance if for some reason you cant make it to the class . The long-distance runner may be lonely , but he is still a runner . <p> Sometimes being able to say , " Just did it , " is the best you are going to get . I promise that it will feel very agreeable . <p> ( CC ) Simon Schoeters/Flickr <p> Ed. note : If you love Dr. Js columns , visit the CalorieLab Facebook Page and click the " Like " button next to each post . <p> I believe my own dissonance comes about by saying something like " Go ahead , you deserve to treat yourself " when in fact , a real treat would be to feel better , look better and live longer .

When I suggest we take bikes to a friends house , 7 miles away , mildly uphill , she says she does n't  have biking legs for that . I suggest getting out on her bike more , since the weather is nice and she is unemployed , but she is waiting to get in shape until she has a job . Bad idea , in my book , but not my business . Besides , none of my gym gets me in biking uphill condition , only biking uphill helps that . The only exercise she likes is the hot yoga , and she cant afford it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets a job shell get home late , itll be dark and cold , and she wo n't feel like it . There 's always an excuse not to do something , but does n't  mean its a valid one . Theres reasons not to eat pizza , too , but I do it anyway , just not frequently . My compromise is that I only eat it at work , when that 's what 's for the free lunch , I never buy it anymore . Meanwhile , I keep exercising , and she keeps looking at me funny and making snide remarks , meanwhile complaining about her back hurting , bad pms , other things that used to happen to me before I became a gym rat . <p> This is excellent info ! ! ! And I can not thank you enough for your last encouragement to be goal oriented rather than problem oriented . To be such a positive person in most other areas of life and believing that what you practice you become , youd think I wouldve gotten that ! LOL ! <p> For me as vain as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outward physical appearances of exercise look like . That there 's a healthy , internally good aspect although very meaningful this has less of an effect at least initially when I 'm starting something new . <p> . okay , so maybe that means I should really think about what I 'm going to look like in the end ! ( how vain am I , anyway ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ) <p> I love this ! The concept of cognitive dissonance is so interesting !

Answer : they are as phony as a campaign promise , meaning that they have no scientific credibility , are not recognized by actual authorities and scholars , and exist solely to publish " research " articles submitted by anyone willing to pay to see them in print . <p> The general going rate is about $500 . That 's what they wanted Mark Shrime to fork over to publish his paper concerning , according to its subtitle , " The surgical and neoplastic role of cacao extract in breakfast cereals . " The paper , mind you , was even phonier than the various open-access medical journals who routinely contact him offering their services for a price . In this case , read " open-access " to mean " we do n't  care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check clears , " while " medical " means virtually nothing . <h> Hey , wait a minute : Isnt Orson Welles dead ? <p> Dr. Shrime , who is an M.D. and medical researcher at Harvard , says he gets at least one emailed come-on from these outfits pretty much every day . He knows that they 're bogus , but became curious as to just how thoroughly and brazenly unprincipled they might be . So he created a paper to be submitted . He titled it " Cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs ? " He submitted it as having been written by Pinkerton A. LeBrain and Orson Welles . To make things particularly amusing , he composed his article using a random text generator . Here is the papers actual verbatim introduction : <p> Shrime submitted his article , composed of this gibberish , to 37 of the journals that contacted him over a two-week period . At this writing , no fewer than 17 have accepted it for prompt publication contingent on the $500 " processing fee . " Note that processing is what the body does to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shrime reports that some of the journals have already set his babble in type and have even given it positive reviews . One of them , apparently with a straight face , called it " novel and innovative , " which is hard to argue with in the context of scientific literature . Another one , he later discovered , was located in a strip club , a truly novel and innovative resume entry . <h> Do n't  believe all you read , and neither should medical jouralists <p> The reason that all of this matters to you is that these junk journals constitute an open door for the publication and dissemination of " medical research " that is not only unreliable and unvetted but potentially dangerous . They are the medium of choice for cranks and outliers whose " research " was rejected by every accredited journal , and they are where the next " vaccines cause autism " is most likely to spring from . All it takes is for someone working for a legitimate source of health news your Newsweek* or CBS Evening News or Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay-to-play journals which invariably have names that fairly ooze validity for actual clinical fact , and include it as such in a report . And then , as someone famous once said , " A lie can circle the earth in the time it takes for the truth to get its pants on . " <p> Fortunately for you and for the average medical/health writer , such as the one in my mirror , there are PubMed and Google Scholar , which offer lists of bona fide medical journals . Unfortunately , their lists are often incomplete , given the rate at which genuine new journals are created , and one never knows whether a source is unlisted there because it is too recent or because its a fake . But happily , there is Jeffrey Beall , a truth-seeking academic librarian who specializes in scholarly open-access publishing , and who began compiling an annual List of Predatory Open Access Journals in 2013 . <p> Beall was rightly motivated by his concern that there were more of them out there than a typical health professional or medical researcher had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of lay writers such as myself , whose reportage is often grounded on material published in such reputable sources as the Washington Post or WebMD . We hope their far greater resources in the form of staff and budget ensure that they 've been able to adequately verify whatever sources they draw on . But the sheer number of bogus journals on Bealls list alone is flat-out daunting , having soared from 126 two years ago to a stunning current figure of 509 that he s aware of . <p> ( If you 're a researcher looking for a handy red flag , my scan of the list reveals that some 350 of them begin with the word International . But even that caveat is unreliable ; there are countless perfectly righteous international journals out there . Shrime noted that he himself has been published in the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology , which is absolutely legit , as opposed to the Global Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology , which is utterly bogus . ) <p> It all comes down to one of the fundamental rules of medical and health information , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source .

They are devoting their time and energy to making sure the person you are concerned about is receiving the best appropriate care that can be provided . <h> Rumored changes to medical condition definitions <p> I have heard rumors , however , that with upcoming changes to our health care system , the definitions for the standard list of conditions may be changing : <p> Undetermined : We have yet to determine if the patient has a medical insurance program that will pay for the numerous unnecessary but expensive tests that will tell us what to tell you about the patients condition . <p> Good : The patient has excellent medical insurance that will easily pay for a new wing for the hospital or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The patient is on a government medical care program that will not pay anywhere close to what we want to bill the patient , but we took an oath in medical school to take this paltry sum in exchange for that large perma-sealed diploma on our office wall . <p> Serious : The patient has no medical insurance that we can discover , but we have all available secretaries , interns , and residents looking for assistance programs that may yield some financial remuneration . <p> Critical : There is no way in hell that we are going to get one red cent out of this . <p> Doctor : How is the horse trainer who got trampled in the barn ? Nurse : His condition is stable . <p> Doctor : How is the little boy who swallowed all the dollar bills ? Nurse : No change . <p> Doctor : How is the forest ranger that had the tree fall on him ?

It may be obvious to some , but trying to get the point across to language learners was challenging ! <p> Here in Canada , health care is free , yes , entirely free .

The amount of resveratrol in grapes depends much more on growing conditions than on the color or type of grape . <p> Much of the resveratrol is in the grapes skin . Red wine contains much more resveratrol than white because red wine is made by fermenting grapes with skins ; for white wine , the grape skins are removed before fermenting . <p> Alcohol " including red wine " increases risk for several common cancers , so it 's best to avoid or limit alcohol to no more than one standard drink ( 5 ounces of wine ) per day for women , two for men . <h> Resveratrol in wine is not all its cracked up to be <p> In laboratory studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evidence comes from cell studies using concentrations of resveratrol much higher than a person is likely to reach .

@@97602946 @1802946/ <h> 12 Tips for Eating a Balanced Diet With Food Allergies <p> ( CC ) Alan Cleaver/Flickr <p> Thus far in our Food Allergy Friday interview series , we 've covered ways for food-allergic individuals to minimize allergen exposure in a variety of settings ; this weeks edition focuses on eating a balanced diet with food allergies . We 've asked three esteemed members of the food allergy community Linda Coss , Kristi Winkels and Sloane Miller for their stories , suggestions and tips on how to ensure a well-balanced diet . Whether you 're a parent trying to make the best nutritional choices for your child or a food-allergic individual looking to add spice to your culinary routine , these pointers will get you headed in the right direction . <p> 1 . Consult a professional who specializes in food allergies . All three of our experts recommended seeing a dietitian . " If you have any confusion about what you should and should not be eating , never risk it . Talk with a board-certified allergist or registered dietitian well versed in food allergies , " says Sloane Miller . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with a registered dietitian to discuss your concerns and challenges can be very helpful , especially when dealing with food allergies . Many dietitians , like me , specialize in food allergies , " adds Kristi Winkels . See our Resources section below for recommended sites to find a dietitian near you . <p> 2 . Resist the urge to severely limit your diet ( or that of your child ) . " Just because you have a restricted diet does n't  mean your life should be restricted , " says Miller . Kristi Winkels touched on the parental instinct to avoid any foods that could potentially cause harm : <p> Food allergies can have a big impact on a childs diet , especially if he or she is allergic to multiple foods . When this is the case , parents sometimes err on the side of caution and avoid other common food allergens to prevent potential allergic reactions . I can certainly identify with parents who choose to do this , as this was my initial reaction when my son was diagnosed with multiple food allergies when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already restricted due to food allergies , it is important to avoid limiting it further out of fear . Parents should work closely with their childs allergist to determine what foods are unsafe and try not to limit foods beyond those recommendations . <p> Instead of unnecessarily limiting your diet or your childs diet , work with a registered dietitian to find nutritious food groups you can safely enjoy . <p> 3 . Focus on the positive . " My first piece of menu planning advice to parents of children with multiple food allergies is always to focus on what your child can eat rather than lamenting the loss of what they can not eat , " says Linda Coss . " Doing so can be very empowering , and can get you thinking in new , creative ways . For example , if your child is allergic to dairy , eggs and nuts , stop focusing on the mac-and-cheese and peanut-butter sandwiches and all the other family favorites that are now off the menu . Instead , take a step back and realize that your child is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poultry , fish , beans or grains . To create a balanced diet , offer a full range of choices from all of the healthy foods available to you . " <p> ( CC ) D. Sharon Pruitt/Flickr <p> 4 . Do n't  be afraid to experiment within reason . " I know my allergies what 's safe and what 's not . I trust myself , " says Miller . " I experiment , within safe guidelines . I am allergic to tree nuts , salmon and a few other foods , but I do n't  feel that my diet is limited . I love food , and the world of food is large ! To ensure that I explore every corner of that world , I add a new thing to my diet a week . Its a technique I created to ensure that my diet and my clients diets are varied , fun and never restricted. I focus on whole foods : lean proteins , fresh fruits , vegetables , grains , organic dairy and healthy fats , which are all by nature free of gluten . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new one a week ) , I make discoveries weekly of new and fun treats . " Consider purchasing a food journal and recording meals , foods or ingredients that were a hit to track them for future culinary adventures . <p> 5 . Channel your inner chef . Linda Coss told us that her preference for safe , nutritious at-home cooking is to prepare as much as possible " from scratch . " While this may require picking up a few cookbooks ( see our Resources section for suggestions to get you started ) , the fulfillment and peace of mind you 'll gain is well worth the effort . <h> Eating a Balanced Diet : Tackling Picky Palates <p> 6 . Remain open-minded . " Try not to jump to conclusions about what your child will or will not like . Just give them a small portion and ask that they try it , " says Winkels . " In our house , we try to follow the two-bite rule , which means that all picky eaters must try at least two bites of everything on their plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times those two bites lead to requests for seconds . " <p> 7 . Be persistent . " Kids are often picky eaters , which can pose a challenge when it comes to providing a balanced diet . I have two sons , and the one with multiple food allergies is also the pickiest eater in the household . Its important to continue to offer a variety of foods , " says Winkels . Coss agrees : " Many children are very picky eaters , whether they have food allergies or not . Treat the food-allergic child the same way you would treat any other picky child : Offer a wide variety of foods , and offer each food multiple times before you give up on it . " <p> 8 . Get creative with food presentation . " Try cutting the food into interesting shapes or present it in a fun way , such as in the shape of a happy face , " suggests Coss . " If your child does n't  like to have different foods touch each other , respect that and serve the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauces . Others will eat just about anything if it is dipped in their favorite condiment , such as ketchup or salad dressing . My own children went through a phase where lots of foods that they usually refused to eat suddenly became more palatable if I served them with colorful sprinkles ( e.g. the type you usually put on cupcakes ) . " <p> 9 . Integrate favorite healthy foods . " If there are a handful of healthy foods that your child is happy to eat , do n't  fight it . Just because you 're tired of serving the item does n't  mean that your child is tired of eating it , " says Coss . This fare may serve as a " gateway food " to other healthy items as your child ages . <h> Eating a Balanced Diet : During the Teen Years <p> ( CC ) Carissa Rogers/Flickr <p> 10 . Revisit old food foes . " As children age , their tastes often mature . I think that the teen and adolescent years are a perfect time to try reintroducing some of those healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was younger , " advises Coss . " My own son , for example , now enjoys sweet potatoes a food that he would n't even taste four years ago ! " <p> 11 . Amp up caloric intake wisely . " Depending on the specifics of your childs diet , trying to fill him up during those teenage growth spurts can be a challenge , " says Coss . " Many non-allergic children , for example , consume a lot of dairy products during this time . If your child is allergic to dairy , you may want to try adding more potatoes , pasta or whole grain bread to his diet in addition , of course , to fruits , vegetables , proteins and other elements of a well-balanced diet . " <p> 12 . Get your child involved in the kitchen . If you have n't already integrated your child into your daily meal-preparation routine , the teen years are an excellent opportunity to start . " These years are the optimal time to teach your child to cook , " says Coss . " More so than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly is a vital life skill . Your child will be on his or her own before you know it . Chances are the drive-through or prepared foods from the grocery store wont be safe options , so knowing how to cook easy and healthy meals is a must . " To further prepare your teen for adulthood , involve him or her in your grocery trips and use these times to share your favorite shopping strategies . <h> 2 Responses to " 12 Tips for Eating a Balanced Diet With Food Allergies " <p> A modern rule of thumb is that the healthiest family diet comes from shopping only around the periphery of the supermarket , where you find fresh produce , meat , and dairy . The internal aisles are where the processed foods lurk , with their ambiguous labels and hidden ingredients . This is a good rule for families with food allergies to follow . One silver lining in the cloud of food allergy is that it may actu- ally encourage families to rely more heavily on fresh ingredients and home cooking . After all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go back to basics to control your child 's diet . It may be time-consuming but it 's a safer bet than relying on canned goods , junk food , or takeout . Besides , cooking can be fun . Cooking together and eating together are good ways to further cement the cooperative spirit of food allergy families . Even the youngest children can do their part safely , like mixing ingredients and tossing salads . Older kids can chop and cook . 
@@97602947 @1802947/ <p> Obesity causes many health problems , so physicians in clinical practice often recommend weight loss to their patients , often a modest initial goal of a 5 percent loss . Unfortunately , however modest it may seem , patients have a hard time reaching and maintaining even that goal . <p> Researchers recently looked into the intractability of weight loss by data mining the confidential medical records of a large subset of the U.K. population . ( The data was provided to the researchers by the GCHQ , the NSA , Peoples Liberation Army Unit 61398 , Anonymous , and Wikileaks . ) <p> They found that the annualized chance that a fat person has to reach a normal body weight ( BMI below 25 ) ranged from 1 percent to 0.1 percent , depending on the starting weight and the patients sex ( being heavier and male makes it harder ) . The upshot : Once you get fat , you stay fat . So the goal is to not get fat in the first place . <p> Believing in the separation of science and state , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes . And , to be honest , I cant think of any realistic policies that the public would endorse either . But I can think of some bizarre and unrealistic ideas to toss out there . My hope is that they might motivate my smart and creative readers to chime in with some more practical ideas in the comments below . <h> Dr. Js Draconian Edicts <p> Here are my ideas . Yes , they are original , and I did n't  plagiarize anything from a Donald Trump speech : <p> Require that automobile drivers seats be equipped with weight sensors and ignition cutoffs to limit the distance that the obese can drive . <p> Outlaw the sale of clothing over size L ( and outlaw vanity sizing ) . <p> Reinstate President Kennedys mandatory " Chicken Fat " exercise program for all citizens . <p> Pass the OdontaCare Act to provide free jaw wiring for the obese ( and require that MacDonalds sell their shakes with spoons , not straws ) . <p> Pass the No Child with a Hefty Behind Act to ensure that every kid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and provided the education needed to prepare for a fulfilling life . <p> Your turn . 3780 @qwx863780 <p> I still like the idea I posted some years back , that all food and beverage items simply be priced according to calories contained , at a penny each . To allow for inflation , I 'd make that ten cents per calorie today . ( Should such a requirement ever be established , I will immediately go into the celery farming business . ) <p> OMG I just went to the Wendys website you linked to and was playing around with menu items GAHHHH ! ! ! ! ! The calorie load is scarier than a serial killer ! I guess essentially fast food could be compared to one ! <p> I think my first trip to McDonalds was in 1972 . Before that , we did n't  have fast food in a town near us , nor did we get transported to a restaurant of that type , but my mom still found ways to make fattening concoctions at home . Oh , and there was always the ice cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat in any of her recipes , but living on a dairy farm , yeah , there was a whole lot of milk fat in the recipes she baked . <p> Dr. J , your ideas are very good and I agree with them . However , they would penalize innocent individuals that can maintain their weight regardless of what they eat . We would be needlessly criminalizing a segment of the population . <p> Furthermore , these laws would create a black market for junk food with its nefarious consequences . There would be black market price gouging , more muggins , assaults and robberies for junk food . It would create criminal enterprises dealing in junk food such as the potato chips cartel , the pizza gang etc . <p> Current law enforcement resources would not be sufficient to enforce these laws . Adding additional LE personnel may bankrupt the nation . And if the government cracks down too hard , we will have junk food riots and maybe another French revolution where heads will roll . I see dark clouds in the horizon . ; ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is n't really a person like this . People who maintain a fit weight without deliberate effort generally just do n't  eat a lot of garbage in the first place , often because we simply are n't  that wild about it . A tax on junk food would very nearly go right over my head . <p> I completely agree with the black market concern , though . Although it would go a long way to convincing people that this stuff is indeed 100% addictive if we saw an upsurge in petty crime because the perpetrator needed a bag of doritos or some obscenity from their local Starbucks . <p> Overall people generally look like what they do . If you are a fit weight , its because your behaviors allow you to be that way . Yeah , it would probably bring back the days of Prohibition with Eliot Ness and Al Capone : - ) <p> Saw that study too and thought it was really depressing news for the folks who are already obese . But yeah , it really brings home the importance of not letting things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially with children . <p> I note a great deal of topiary clinching of the public political persuasion . I find it interesting ( I stumbled upon the discussion from another search ) that the dietary habits of other people are even discussed . Is it anyones business to concern themselves with others larder or purchasing habits ? I truly hoped it was all tongue in cheek however I thought the Rules for Obesity were humorous if taken as such . <p> All were except I would like to see " that every child is raised in a caring environment , fed healthy food , and provided the education needed to prepare for a fulfilling life , " because I really believe that would make a substantial difference in the world . <p> Or you could just try working out instead of watching tv on the couch . If you are good about working out no matter who you are , you wo n't get fat from a fast food meal every now and then . Hello ? ? ? ? ? lolololololol <p> Those are great thoughts ! The earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the scope of a comment reply . Please search the Calorielab database and keep reading our site . All of this has been and is continually addressed in articles here . <p> Prevention must begin at the time weight gain is noted and monitoring and intensive advice to parents or person continued until normal weight is reached and maintained . Education must be continuous through school and college . <p> I would like to see the gradual introduction of higher charges for health insurance and air transport based on the BMI naturally tall people can not be penalized . <p> The current tendency on TV to include more overweight people as true to life should be reversed with emphasis on healthy people . Treatment for complications of diabetes and glucose control on TV rightly show overweight people as subjects but without major emphasis of the role of obesity as an underlying problem are counter productive . <p> Dietary advice which recommends storing snacks in a less obvious place should be amended to not buying them in the first place with major restrictions on sugar laden beverages . Corn subsidies should stop . 
@@97602948 @1802948/ <h> Parents Tend to Feel Their Child is About The Right Weight <p> All parents care about their children . But there is a disconnect with parental caring when a child is overweight or obese . In spite of data to the contrary , the majority of parents feel that their child is " about the right weight . " according to a new study led by the New York University Langone Medical Center . These results are important because parents with accurate perceptions of their childrens weight are more likely to implement behavior changes , in themselves and the child , that could lead to weight reduction . <p> Published online in the journal Childhood Obesity using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , the study looked at NHANES data covering nearly 8,000 children , 2 to 5 years old during two periods between 1988 through 2012 . About 19 in 20 parents of boys thought their kids were " about the right weight , " while about 9 in ten parents thought their girls were about the right weight . <h> Rose-tinted glasses <p> Dustin Duncan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The results are consistent with past studies in which a considerably high number of parents incorrectly perceived their overweight/obese preschool child as being just about the right weight. " <p> Like most things in life , getting off to a good start can really help . Many overweight and obese children have not had that good start , and overweight kids tend to grow up to be overweight or obese adults . The best way to address this is with the childs parents or caretakers , as well as with the education of the child . <p> One of the disappointing results of the study was that even thought the children in the second study group were significantly more overweight than the children in the first study group , the parents perception of their children remained unchanged . Perhaps this is due to two factors : Parents typically compare their own child to other kids in deciding if their child is overweight , and in addition , parents rising weight seems to parallel the rising body weight of children for the same time period . <p> Unfortunately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors office . Now many schools have decided not only to educate kids about health but also to spread this news home to the parents by sending them a report based on the childs BMI . <h> Kiddy BMI <p> The BMI classifications for children is not the same as for adults and this probably adds to the confusion . In addition to the height and weight numbers used for adult BMI the childs sex is taken into consideration . The word " obese " is not used . And the classifications are " graded on the curve , " using percentile rankings comparing all children of the particular age , based on collected national data . <p> The four BMI categories for kids are : <p> Underweight : BMI less than the 5th percentile <p> Healthy Weight : BMI 5th percentile up to the 85th percentile <p> At Risk of Overweight : BMI 85th to less than 95th percentile <p> Overweight : BMI greater than or equal to the 95th percentile <p> In addition , if that is n't bad enough , there is a chart compiled by the Centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up in adulthood . <p> Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <p> I question whether schools should be involved with this . <p> Teaching about health is very important , and it should be in the curriculum . But concern about weight needs to be addressed by health care personnel , preferably doctors . <p> To add to the problem , obesity is a societal problem that goes far beyond the walls of the classroom . We live in a society that creates obesity and does little to stop it . When the village really wants to raise the child and involve itself with useful ways to help , great , but until then , educate the child about the recognition , causes , and ramifications of obesity . Then with these roots of knowledge and their acquired wings to fly , let them go live , take responsibility , and make their own decisions about being the right weight for better or ill. 3780 @qwx863780 <p> I 'm not overly qualified to comment , but I do see a lot of children whose health does not seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise ( apart from their fingers on the video games ) , and they eat mostly junk .

Better training , and better tactical approach should be a part of a school support system that serves the student . My own opinion as that parents , on the larger scale , seem to be putting it off on the schools .

I see it often when overweight parents come up &amp; let the kids eat multiple samples &amp; I mean MULTIPLE &amp; the kids are already overweight <p> I know that Hunter was probably a little overweight when he was younger but I also knew he was active and that we ate pretty well most of the time . When he hit his growth spurt he shot up and lost the pudge .

After age 62 , eating lunch at a senior lunch program , I would repeatedly tell the cooks not to give me so much ; but they always did . Finally one said that since it was a government program , I had to get the government-mandated amount . Most of us have been trained to clean our plates , or else we eat mindlessly when in the company of others as we visit , and end up cleaning our plates . Until the government stops forcing set amounts of food on people whether they want it or not we can not make inroads into this issue . <p> I completely agree with you about cleaning our plates unless its in the sink after dinner !

It took me back to the first week of the program , in which completing set after full set alongside Shaun T seemed a far-fetched dream ; this time , however , it was my shoulders rather than my core , lungs or legs that tired first .

@@97602950 @1802950/ <h> Green Coffee Bean Extract : Weight-Loss Miracle or Waste of Time ? <p> ( CC ) ASGW/Flickr <h> And Will It Be Available Both Full-Strength and Decaf ? <p> Whether the extract of green ( meaning unroasted ) coffee beans is a possible breakthrough weapon in the fight against obesity or just another risky and momentary example of scientific jumping the gun remains to be seen , but right now the notion is generating plenty of interest and ink based on one extremely promising but extremely limited study . <p> The basics : Sixteen overweight young adults were given a 1,050 milligram dose of green coffee bean extract for six weeks , then a two-week break , then a daily 700 milligram dose for six weeks , then another break , and then a placebo . For some of them , the order was different . The results bowled the researchers over . <p> Without altering their calorie intake , over the full 22 weeks , the volunteers lost an average of 17.5 pounds , reducing their total body weight by 10.5 percent and their average body fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they consumed increased , so did the amount of fat and weight they shed . Six of the initially overweight 16 test subjects , almost 40 percent of the group , actually wound up with BMIs in the " healthy " category . <p> To put this feat in perspective , if green coffee bean extract were a pharmaceutical drug , merely trimming 5 percent of the body weight from 35 percent of the subjects would qualify it for FDA approval as a bona fide weight loss medication . Of course , it would probably be available only by prescription , and be only slightly less pricey than designer jewelry . <p> Fortunately , green coffee bean extract is neither , being in fact a common dietary supplement available for a modest ( as of now ) $20 per month or so , at most health food or natural food stores , which sell it as a naturopathic antioxidant . Given that its already on the market and no i 'll effects have been reported , the extract would also seem fairly safe . Safe , cheap , and effective : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small a sample to be meaningful . How representative can one vanload of test subjects be ? Consider that the flip side of the safety element , noted above , is that if the extract were such a wondrous weight-reducer , would n't that have been noticed and raved about before now ? A 60-person test is in the planning stages ; until and unless it replicates this study , let skepticism be your guide . <p> We do n't  know how it works . It may reduce our guts ability to absorb sugars and/or fats , or boost our metabolism by lowering our insulin levels . Or it may work through the process of malabsorption , in which food simply passes through us unutilized , the result being not only weight loss but also malnutrition and a serious deficiency in vital minerals and vitamins . There are well over 200 chemicals in coffee beans , not all of them our friends , and we do n't  know the effects of most of them when consumed in these concentrations over time . <p> The trial was conducted in India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool or lifestyle that makes people there receptive to the extracts chemical effect in ways that do n't  apply universally . <p> The trial was paid for by a company in Texas which manufactures green coffee bean extract . That does n't  automatically impeach the studys findings , but it does raise some unsettling questions . For example : " Why did n't  they do the research right at home , using Texans ? " <p> There are a number of reasons to suspect that green coffee bean extract is n't the weight-loss wonder substance that the study results imply . But there are even more reasons to hope that it might be . Cross your fingers and stay tuned . <p> I would like to thank you for this imformative article . I 'm pretty fit but would like ot lose more weight arought the gut . However , I research everything before I start taking it . Those " caveats " helped me in waiting for more answers regarding this . I searched more on this and found some youtube videos in which one girl was giving it praise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dr. Oz show , and that anything on the Dr. Oz show must be safe . Wowso far from the truth . There are scientists and Dr.s who know a lot more than Dr. Oz and there have been mistakes in the past with something that seemed to be " the miracle drug " <p> I tried 800 mg a day for 4 weeks and i have actually gained weight . I am not overweight but wanted to see if it works . Now I 'm over weight in my stomach which I have never been . It did something to my intestines I think . They did give me energy for sure but i was exhausted each evening so I 'm not sure about this from personal experience I do n't  trust it . I have a new bottle that 's in the trash ! <p> Wow you guy are such liars . I lost 7 lbs in 1 week . I does work your are a sad pharmacutical company that 's going to go out of business that 's to this new finding . You drugs cause more health and no weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about diet pills but last year my friends mum bought diet tea with the hope to lose some pounds . This type of tea was advertised in popular magazines and TV channels . She ended up having diarrhea . So I 'm scared of something called " diet " pills , " diet tea " , etc . <p> I was skeptical when my wife wanted to try it , But did not stop her from doing it . Out of Curiosity I tried it for couple of weeks till now and I have lost almost 5 lbs and my wife who had been using for almost 3 weeks has lost 9 lbs . What was interestin was I eat a lot of pasta or noodles if placed before me . We were eating Thai Drunken noodles which I would gobble up two plates and still eat of my wife plate and my kids , actually did say I am full after 1/4 th of the plate . So my guess is makes you full . But the key is to take before meals atleast 3o mins ahead of your meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have been using the extract for 5 days now and have lost LITERALLY one pound a day . I use a pure extract I purchased from Whole Foods ( so I could get my money back if it did n't  work " for me " ) . I have no side effects . Highly sensitive to caffeine , my heart rate is unaffected , nor is my sleep ; in fact , I took two pills before bed and slept through the night . It seems act more as a food than a cup of coffee . I 've noticed it also curbs my appetite AND inspires me to eat better and exercise . I will say I took two pills 30 minutes before eating pancakes and other naughty things and I was surprised that I still lost another pound by the next morining . I have tried everything under the sun . This works " for me . " Maybe some of you have hyper or hypo or other hormonal issues that might prohibit this product from working . I have hyperglycemia and it is working great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken a 5 year plateau in my weight . Do n't  live in the world if skepticism , buy a bottle from Whole Foods , risk free , and see if it jives with your body chemistry . I am glad I did . <p> Two things : Enjoy being hungry and simply cut out 90% of your sugar intake . Its too simple to make anybody any money , but you know in your gut that its the answer . Good luck/discipline/eating habits : ) <p> Green Coffee bean states you do not have to do a thing to lose weight but what kind of results do you get if you do excersie and watch what you eat and still have trouble getting weight off I eat only whold foods nothing processed Just strated the Green Coffee Bean and would like a little help <p> Ive been taking this product for a week today and I 've lost 6lbs .. Im impressed . I only wan na drop 15 however I can see inches melt away . I purchased the Genesis Brand .. bout 30 bucks .. I take two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1600 mil a day .. As far as the caffiene I have no jitters .. But its before roasted so the caffeine is natural and low .. A med cup of coffee at Tim Hortons has 3 times as much .. Now about energy .. Yes it has increased . Ive notices several trip to the restroom .. Frequent urinatinan especially at night can be annoying if your sleepy lol Will check back next sun . Good luck and This product really works . <p> Here is the deal . The extract must not have any additives or fillers . It makes a big differene . I bought what was advertised as pure but when I received and was able to read the label , had additives . I did not lose any weight with that product . Since then I have purchased pure coffee bean extract and in one week have lost 3 lbs . I have not lost 3 lbs . in a week since I was a teenager . No side affect and I have a tendencey to be sensative . I did go up a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss ) but continued taking the product and lost those two pounds plus three . Im thrilled . <p> Good article Robert and yes there are many variables to consider with green coffee bean extract and the individual reaction thereto . I for one did very well week one only ( 800 mgs daily ) to be constipated week 2 and 3 and suffer severe stomach distension . <p> Stopped taking for 2-days and bowels back to normal so the cause was very clear . At least for me the green coffee bean seems to be a not so good catalyst with my body . <p> My experience is that boasting and smoke and mirrors with Indian studies has some major hurdles ahead . <p> I have been taking this product for 6 days along with raspberry ketone and african mango and have not seen any results so far whatsoever . So I 'm starting to take more pills and I 'm going to see if this makes a difference . Will be in touch . Also , does anyone know if you take the pill , do you have to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green coffee diet pill . I took it for 30 days and I seen no results.What I weighed when I started the pills is exactly what I weighed when I finished the pills . How can a company guarantee weight loss with their product and it DOES-NOT work ? ? ? ? ? <p> on second bottle of green coffee bean pills and havent lost a single pound . pants feel tighter so i think i am gaining weight . not sure why ? not what i expected at all . not going to buy anymore . guess it only works for some . very disappointed customer . <p> Ive been on it daily since the end of January , along with modest core exercise at the gym 3x a week ( 30 minutes each ) with a trainer . Diet modified to include a lot more veggies . I am type-2 diabetic , and before starting , my daily fasting blood sugar was between 170 and 210 . <p> If you watch Dr. Ozs show ( see YouTube ) , he recommends products only with Svetol and/or GCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit the bill , with no binders or fillers . <p> I 've lost 24 pounds in 3 months , and my fasting blood glucose is consistently between 90 and 110 now each morning . Partner ( with similar diet and body type but weighing 20 lbs less ) is doing the same workout but not taking the product , and has lost about 15 lbs . This seems consistent with the Dr. Oz research . <p> I think the combination of everything is working very well , and that the NatureWise product is aiding in the additional weight loss . You will have to judge things over a 30 day period or more . The first few lbs ( first week ) is just water weight . <p> I fell for the web advertisement for a " free " bottle , no risk , no automatic order refill .. and weight loss . Well , after 60 capsules , I have not lost a lb . I was pleased to get the free bottle so I could try it and felt comfortable that , unless I reordered it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card . Wrong on that one too ! I have just discovered a $62.00 charge by My Green Bean Extract ! Now am I no only still fat but I have to fight to get this charge refunded and stopped ! Geez ! I see it seems to work for some folks and I am happy for you guys . But it does n't  do it for many of us . <p> Took one 425 mg pill every morning for 8 weeks . Huge loss in appetitie after one week . Lost 21 pounds despite unrestricted diet and lack of exercise , just fewer calories per day due to low apetite . Frequent bowel movements with loose stool was an annoyance . The label on the bottle said take only for 8 weeks . Huge head-eache ( caffenie withdrawl ) and exteremely sleepy the first day ( not a cofffe drinker ) Stool back to regular right away . It took only one day to get back the old appetite . Already gained 5 pounds in 4 days . I cant find anything on the internet that tells me how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks I 'm afraid at this rate I 'll gain all of the 21 pounds back . What happens if I go longer than 8 weeks at a time or take it forever ? What 's the downside ? Side effect ? <p> here 's the thing everyone Green Coffee Extract has been shown to aid in weight loss . HOWEVER , if you sit on your butt , do not change your lifestyle , take in high amounts of sodium , drink diet sodas , and eat the same foods that made you gain weight in the first place , you can not expect it to help you . THERE IS NO MIRACLE CURE FOR BEING OVERWEIGHT ! Hard work , movement , and being conscious of your diet there 's the miracle . Will something like this help move things along ? Absolutely ! I 'll attest to that , using it to help in fat loss when I am currently in a " healthy weight range " and fat is harder to shift but it wont work if you do n't  make other changes in your life . Also , do n't  be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am 51 ? tall , wear a size 4 , and am 140lbs . When I was a size 4 as a teenager but did absolutely no weight training , I weighed 115 . Thats 25lbs of pure muscle right there ! Go by how you feel and how your clothes feel judging progress by something that can fluctuate depending on the time of the month , the temperature outside , and whether or not you 've had a big bowel movement today will only be discouraging ! <p> I am 56 , and have lost 9lbs in about a month and a half . I use to be an emotional eater , but heard about this , and altered my eating habits , the weight is definately come off . You have to move and not sit on your butt all day . I have started eating healthier , do n't  get me wrong , I love my sweets , but I limit them now . It does work , I take 800mgs at lunch , and 800 mg at dinner . I 'm in Canada , and I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles off 400mg capsules , with 60 in the bottle , cheaper than ordering online , or health food stores . I thoroughly believe in the green coffee bean supplement . <p> Ive been taking the pills along with a lemon cleanse . Drink the neck of a bottle of water then add a table spoon of 100% maple syrup , 1/3 of a lemon squeezed ( the juice ) and a pinch of cayenne pepper . Also i have been eating loads of vegetables and lean meats such as chicken an fish . Working out for 9 days after work then taking a couple days off . So far Ive seen huge improvements . I was 230 pounds and proud to say now i am 198 . Its only been a couple of months . The combination of all these things really pay off it took me so long to find something that actually works . I feel 100% better than ever and hope my advice helps people in need . Ps . When your in the gym u got ta really push yourself if you wan na see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bean extract in the very near future . For those who claim it does n't  work : Are you taking the pure brand or are you taking the green coffee beans extract with other known weight loss products , such as raspberry ketones In order to work , it has to be 800 mg 1/2 hour before breakfast and 1/2 hour before lunch . Nothing else is needed . Read the bottle carefully . 1,600 mg a day . As for caffeine , there is a negligible amount in each bean . Caffeine should not be a problem . Follow the directions and you 'll get some results . <p> I am glad that their alternative means of losing weight other than exercise . I think that proper food intake and exercise is the best way to lose weight and maintain it . I am also a realistic person and I know that this is not an option for everyone . Lots of things get in the way such as health problems , work schedules as well as family . Too much weight can cause a lot of medical problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other methods of losing weight . <p> I 'm totally sold on GCA . Ive been taking 2 800mg caps a day for almost 2 weeks . So far Ive lost 13 lbs . What it does for me is , it kills my appetite . I 'm eating a fraction of what I normally eat without suffering late at night . Surprisingly I 'm not getting any heartburn . Usually when I try to lose weight it starts killing me . I started out about 40 or 50 lbs overweight ( 235 ) . Also my energy level stays about the same all day long . <p> I guess it does n't  work for everyone , because I 've seen where some people say it did n't  do anything for them . It killed my appetite after the first 30 minutes . If your appetite is n't suppressed right away , either the stuff you bought is n't any good , or it just flat does n't  work for you . <p> Hi there one And all .

" I talk about it , but I really believe it and its huge once you get the momentum on your side , I think its a huge advantage . No matter who you are , I think its much tougher to be stopped when you 've got that mo going for you . " <p> Tebow made that statement in a postgame interview shortly after his team won their third game of the season under his fledgling leadership . <h> Momentum in Physics <p> Momentum is an essential concept in physics . The total momentum of a closed system is conserved and does not change value . This allows one to consistently predict an outcome . <p> When an object is moving , it has a certain amount of momentum . If an object is standing still , it has no momentum . To calculate the momentum of a moving object , multiply the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vector . That means that momentum is a quantity that has a size and a direction ; that direction can be either positive or negative . <h> Momentum in Life <p> Momentum is one of the most underrated components of success . The reason is simple : With momentum , it is difficult to stop . <p> I run every day , mostly because I run every day . Its just the way it is ; I have built my momentum . It would n't feel right for me to suddenly stop that behavior . If I did n't  run with consistency or even worse , if I did n't  run or exercise at all I would have built up negative momentum that would make it even harder to get started . <p> In life , unlike physics , there are other factors , however , that can help us .

Thinking , planning , wishing , hoping , dreaming , wanting and so forth will not build momentum . Momentum requires movement . <p> Take small steps at first , if necessary . Have short-term goals , because then you will get earlier rewards from earlier successes . An orthodontist friend of mine once told me that if he did n't  focus on small , short-term goals , such as moving the teeth a millimeter or two between appointments , with the average total treatment time approaching two years , he would never have been able to do his work . <p> Consider increasing difficulty slowly and steadily , but do not stop moving forward . <p> A frequent mistake is to set unrealistically large goals in the beginning .

" <p> Once you start to experience the benefits of momentum , like oxygen for the shark , motivation is less of a problem .

If you missed that post , check it out here . Following this mornings peanut allergy feature , we 're now taking a closer look at tree nut allergy , with a list of tips , alternatives , resources , research and book recommendations for young readers . <h> Research and News <p> Despite being listed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a tree nut protein , shea butter may be safe for individuals with tree nut allergies to use , say researchers at New York Citys Mount Sinai School of Medicine . The team discovered that the immune system does n't  identify shea butter as a nut protein ; immunoglobin E antibodies taken from blood samples of patients with tree allergies did n't  bind to shea butter proteins during lab tests . This discovery does n't  mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allergy , however ; before using shea butter , speak with your allergist or doctor to be sure its safe for you . <p> The Silk brand of soy milk now has a nut allergy warning on its packaging ; last year , the company introduced almond milk to its product lineup . <p> Air Canada passengers with peanut or nut allergies can place an advance- request for a nut-free " buffer zone " during their flight . Flight attendants wo n't offer passengers in their row snacks that contain nuts as well as the rows directly in front and behind them and theyll also ask passengers in that zone to avoid eating nut or peanut products . <p> WestJet flight attendants have also updated their food-allergy policy. - Upon request , theyll make a cabin-wide announcement asking that passengers avoid eating nut and peanut products during the flight if a passenger on that flight has a food allergy . <p> Cashews may be the most high-risk trigger food for those with allergies , according to a recent- European study .

Even baked items that do n't  contain tree nuts , however , may have been contaminated during the preparation and cooking process . <p> Avoiding cross-contamination and exposure : <p> Since many people with a tree nut allergy also have a peanut allergy , be sure to check out our peanut allergy post for more cross-contamination tips . <p> Scan labels thoroughly for indicators of cross-contamination .

Flavored coffees such as hazelnut coffee could leave behind traces of tree nut protein in the grinder . <p> Airplane travel comes with its own pitfalls for those with a nut allergy .

Its a perfect addition to a classroom library , as it discusses why classmates might treat someone with a food allergy differently . Since we know that food-allergic children are often the targets of bullies , this book may teach prospective tormentors empathy and show them how dangerous trigger foods can be.The No Biggie Bunch Trade-or-Treat Halloween by Heather Mehra and Kerry McManama focuses on Halloween and how the No Biggie Bunch has creatively mastered this potentially perilous holiday . By trading foods that they 're allergic to , this pack of friends avoids eating a trigger food and still manages to enjoy the best part of trick-or-treating the treats ! <p> Have a favorite kids book that focuses on peanut allergy ?

@@97602953 @1802953/ 3782 @qwx863782 <p> ( CC ) srqpix/Flickr <p> Of all the physical activities that I have done , it would be hard to think of one that is more mentally and physically intense than having to do CPR on someone . With all my time in hospitals and a six-month stint as an anesthesia resident during my surgical training , I 've had plenty of experience in that arena , where someones life or death hangs in such a precarious balance . Perhaps one day , robots or the like will take it out of our human hands , but until then , you and CPR are often all that stand between an unconscious person and the grave . <p> The first time I ever saw CPR performed on a person was during my introduction to the emergency room . It appeared to me as controlled chaos : people rapidly moving about a horizontal unconscious patient , numbers being counted , orders given , orders followed . In time , as I grew to understand the procedure , it became a serious dance with characteristic steps and rhythmic actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the team doing that dance , but there have been many . <p> I was visiting a recovering friend in his hospital room one evening after work when a Code Blue was called in the room next door . Excusing myself , within moments I was the first doctor on the scene doing CPR in my cowboy boots . <p> One incident that stands out from all the others occurred while I was in a departmental meeting . The boss pager went off announcing that his patient , a 65-year-old woman in the hospital , was in cardiac arrest . He looked at me , and I said , " I 'll take it ! " ( I 'd do anything to get out of a departmental meeting . ) <p> " OK , Dr. J , " he responded . " I 'll get there as soon as I can ! " <p> In a couple of minutes , I arrived at her room , assessed the situation and told the nurse who was doing the chest compressions that I would take over . I remember it feeling like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythmic cadence and kept at it . I only stopped for the occasional injection of epinephrine directly into her heart , followed by " Clear ! " as the paddles were applied and her heart was shocked into a rhythm that was not sustainable ; I followed this by resuming the compressions . <p> This pattern went on for close to 45 minutes , at which point the on-call cardiologist came into the room . After watching it all for several minutes , he suggested we add an additional drug to the regimen we were following . It worked , and her heart returned to a stable , regular rhythm . Later , the cardiologist humbled me when he quietly said , " I was watching you work , and I have never seen anyone do CPR that effectively before . " <p> I visited the patient later that evening to see how she was doing . She told me that she was really angry that we did n't  let her die . I never told her that I was the one who stood between her and her wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had died . I am guessing she got over her anger before that happened . <h> Learning CPR <p> Everyone would benefit from learning to do CPR . The American Heart Association , among other organizations , offers training in this procedure all over the country . Over the years , the guidelines for doing CPR have been modified for simplicity and efficacy to make the procedure easier for all of us to do . The AHA currently recommends that when treating adults , instead of 15 compressions for every two breaths , the practitioner should now give at least 30 chest compressions for every two breaths . In addition , for those with little or no training or those who feel uncomfortable with performing rescue breathing , CPR can be done using only chest compressions . <p> Speaking with Time about the new CPR rules , Dr. Michael Sayre , a co-author of the new guidelines and a professor of emergency medicine , outlines the reasons behind the change : <p> We know that the number of chest compressions given in the first few minutes after cardiac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take breaks . So someboy needs to be pushing the chest as close to continuously as possible in order to really try to get the maximum amount of oxygen to the heart and brain . <h> Obesity and CPR <p> As with many other examples in medicine , obesity has now affected our ability to perform CPR . <p> Recently , in New Zealand , a morbidly obese man died after having a heart attack in the hospital . The problem was that when he collapsed from the cardiac arrest , he fell forward ; even though he was surrounded by trained hospital personnel , because of his weight , he could not be turned onto his back for them to perform the CPR . He weighed over 440 pounds , and was in his early 20s . <p> " Staff said the incident was an example of the growing worldwide obesity problem , forcing hospitals to alter their technology . Its a worldwide issue and everyones dealing with it . Even for smaller patients , nursing can be heavy work and we want to look after our staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have watched the mechanics of CPR evolve over the years to be a procedure that can be learned by most of us and counted on to have a high success rate for saving people in the most extreme conditions . I never imagined how our growing obesity would affect even this activity . <p> I know CPR , both adult and pediatric . I 'm pretty good about re-upping every year too . I consider it a life skill and have already told my kids that they will learn it as well when they become proficient enough swimmers to take the Junior Lifeguarding course ( swimming is also a non-negotiable at your house ) . I 'm sorry to hear though that your patient did n't  thank you for the 45 minutes of lifesaving CPR you did for her although my fave thing about this post is that I learned you wear cowboy boots ; ) <p> Just curious : Does an extra layer of fat on the torso over the heart complicate CPR or make heart compressions more difficult or less effective ? Logic would indicate so , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post as usual . <p> Good for you on both the CPR and the swimming ! Well , I am a cowboy and I have the horse to prove it : - ) <p> Vered ! <p> Its an important skill we never want to have to use ! <p> Westwood ! <p> I understand and support the importance of a barrier for rescue breathing as you suggest ! Thank you ! That must have been some day at the lake ! <p> Bob ! <p> Thank you ! Increased bulk certainly adds to the difficulty in doing standard CPR . I was only discussing basic CPR here , but with Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) there are compression techniques that use two people , and in addition , the impedance due to fat on the chest wall is increased that needs to be accounted for when using defibrillation . <p> I must say though that this brought up hard memories of my dads death . They tried to revive him for 40 minutes which left him in a coma that they decided was little brain activity after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks hoping for the best &amp; then had to make the most difficult decision of our lives . <p> DR . J , not saying anything cause you saved that ladies life but for us , it was not a good outcome <p> But the point is to learn CPR &amp; the new rules &amp; that is a good thing ! THX ! <p> I need to get CPR trained and would love to take a first aid course as well , because I am a basket case over my children when they are sick ! Thank you for the book recI have ordered it from the library and cant wait to devour it ! ! ! Please tell me your thoughts on distance running enlarging the heart ? <p> Scary about obesity and CPR . I took AHA and ARC CPR and at the time they were really similar and if you could do this for a long time did your martial arts training help with the discipline to keep it going that long ? Anyway Bravo ! <p> Firstly , how you describe CPR , is awesome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , understand completely what you did and when . I am proud to announce that I did a CPR course a few years back and I do know how to perform it I too did not realise the effect that obesity can have on performing CPR . <p> I 'm so sorry your family had to have that happen to your Dad ! If I had been there , I would have done my best , but unfortunately , the outcome may have been the same . <p> Pauline ! <p> I hope you find that book helpful ! I may write more on this , but it takes a serious amount of running to cause negative effects on the heart . For the average runner , the benefits greatly outweigh the problems . <p> Tony ! <p> Thank you ! I appreciate your commenting ! <p> Hey John ! <p> Astute as always ! I still use one pre-cordial thump with a martial arts focus ! ( It does n't  take any time , and Ive seen it work . ) My long distance running gave me the endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight into what is a very physically intense technique if done for long periods of time . I too recommend that all people become certified in basic First Aid and CPR because of its ability to save so many lives . I also never put much thought into medical personnel having to deal with obese patients falling forward and requiring CPR . I think that America as a whole could use some help when it comes to our health and losing weight would definitely be one of the major goals .

If I relied on myself and a stop watch to ensure I ran for one minute before walking for 1:30 , I would blow it off quick as you please . <p> But if someone , even a digital someone , could tell me when to start and stop , I figured I 'd try harder . <p> Of course there 's an app for that . Active.com the " official provider of the Couch to 5K training app , " charges $1.99 for its C25K app . <p> The program helps participants track their workouts , including telling them when to jog and when to walk . It keeps track of time and distance and , with GPS enabled , can show you a map of your route when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , and you can post your summary to Facebook or to the Active Trainer online community automatically . <p> There are three training avatars you can choose from : cheerful Constance , the girl next door ; no-nonsense but motivating Bilile ; and take-no-prisoners Sergeant Block . I just want the basics , and certainly do n't want my phone yelling at me , so I stick with the default Constance . <p> The app also allows you to access your playlists within the app , where you can also shuffle or repeat songs . The audio cues will play over your music . You can also choose to have the app tell you when you 're halfway through your workout , which is a nice thing . <p> Another feature of the app is the ability to search for local 5K and other running events , which was n't working the first time I tried it but now tells me of a variety of events near me from now until August . That 's a nice feature if you 're looking to motivate yourself by actually running a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that part for me ) . <h> Getting Off the Couch <p> I should note before I tell you how my first workout went that I was completely unprepared to start this process . My " running shoes " are actually more like aerobics shoes that Everlast sent me years ago to review ( I never did , and I 'm not sure they make them anymore , but should you ever find yourself in possession of Everlast Fighter shoes , know that they 're great for indoor exercise and walking but do not make great running shoes ) . <p> My workout clothes consist of mostly yoga pants bought before ( or maybe while ! ) I was pregnant , one pair of nylon pants from long before I was pregnant and a single pair of " running shorts . " For shirts I have a collection of years-old Race for the Cure shirts . I do not own a sports bra . <p> But here I am , with my husband taking our daughter to see his mom on a Sunday morning , so it 's time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do this today but did n't tell anyone . For the first time in a long time , I 'm excited about working out . I can almost feel my muscles working before I 'm even out the door , so jazzed are they to be used . <p> I set out on a route around my neighborhood in my nylon pants and an old T-shirt with my iPhone in my pocket ( I do n't have a holster or headphones , either ) and set out on my first C25K adventure . <h> It 's Not Really Going to Kill You , It Only Feels Like it Is <p> I have heard a lot of people in worse shape than me complain about how hard Couch to 5K is , especially in the beginning when you 're much closer to couch than 5K . But I figured I was in pretty good shape , had been working out not too long ago and was pretty close to a healthy weight , so it could n't possibly be that hard to run for a minute at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , much harder than I thought it would be . I was fine for the first two circuits or so ( week one is 1 minute jogging followed by 1:30 walking , with 5 minutes each for warm up and cool down at the ends ) and feeling pretty cocky , but then my muscles started protesting . <p> And then my ankles started to hurt . And then I started letting myself slow down before Constance said " now walk . " And once I missed a cue to jog entirely . ( This was , actually , an accident . There was a car driving by at the key time , and with the phone in my pocket I really could n't hear it . But I did n't mind . ) <p> By the time I got home I was worn out . My sciatic nerve was screaming for mercy . I was sweaty and stinky and glad my family was n't home to see me . <p> When I got to the log at the end of the workout , it told me I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than 15 minutes per mile ( 1.95 miles at 15:22 per mile , to be precise ) . I figured I 'd be under 15 easy . But then again , it was harder than I thought . <p> The log let 's you rate how you felt on a scale of big smile to tears . I chose a frowny face . <h> Ready to Try Again <p> Even though I 'm sore , and going up and down the stairs in my house is a major chore , I 'm glad to have started and I 'm actually looking forward to getting out there and trying again . <p> In the meantime , have any of you started running or jogging recently ? Or do you remember what those beginning days were like ? I 'd love to hear about it ( and be reassured that it does get better ! ) . <h> One Response to " Test Driving Couch to 5K , Day 1 : There 's an App for That " <p> Good shoes and a good sports bra is a must ! Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move away from cotton , it gets too heavy with sweat and will rub and chafe . Not fun . Listen to your body . If something feels off or its too difficult , slow down or stop . Do n't  fall for the whole , if you are n't  puking keep going . 
@@97602955 @1802955/ <h> Wii Sports fitness and weight loss claims put to the test <p> Makiko Itoh ( Maki ) is a web and PDF developer who lives in Switzerland . Originally from Japan , she 's lived in the UK and the U.S. She indulges her passion for food , cooking and cultures at Just Hungry and Just Bento . <p> For Christmas , I finally got a Wii . Yes I 'm quite behind the times , but I 'm not really one who likes to jump on new stuff as soon as it comes out . I prefer to get the version 2s . <p> This is the first gaming console Ive ever gotten . I 've never been tempted by other consoles , ever . I do play the occasional PC game , but a dedicated machine for gaming ? Nah . <p> What lured me to the Wii was the promise that somehow , it would help me to exercise . There have been reports on the interweb of people who have lost weight and stuff by playing Wii Sports . These have gotten a lot of attention from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It sounded too good to be true . <h> Wii fitness claims too good to be true <p> Well , after having owned a Wii for a few days , I can say that it is indeed too good to be true . In fact , unless you are severely out of shape to start with , its fairly rubbish as a real fitness device ( see below about new accessories coming up which may change this , and what can be done to make it a bit more active ) . <p> I am not by any means in fighting shape , but I do some moderate exercise so am not totally hopeless . I usually prefer to walk and jog and such , or when the weather is uncooperative I do exercise videos . Sometimes the videos get a bit boring , so I was really hoping for the Wii to give me a fun alternative . <h> Heart rate monitor tells the real story <p> I wore my Polar heart rate monitor to see if I could get my heart rate up to a decent level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only two games that do anything to my HR are boxing and tennis . As for the rest , well , my heart rate rises more by stretching up to the top shelf of my kitchen cabinet where I " hide " the chocolate stash . <p> Even with tennis and boxing , the heart rate does n't  really stay up at a decent level at all , since they are ( a bit like the real sports they emulate ) more anerobic sports requiring short spurts of movement than something steady and aerobic . But unlike real boxing and tennis , in the Wii versions there really is n't as much real foot movement to keep up the intensity . My heartrate goes up a bit , then sinks right down . <p> The really bad part is that since there 's so much frantic arm movement during the boxing rounds or tennis sets , specific muscles get quickly over-fatigued . The day after the first time I played Wii Tennis , my arm and shoulder were so sore that I could barely raise them . Now I switch hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one arm . Fit little kids may not experience this , but I 'm an old fart with creaky bones and tender muscles and tendons . <h> Wii Fit highly anticipated <p> I am looking forward to the releases of the Wii version of DanceDance Revolution and the Wii Fit in Europe later this year , both of which sound more promising . ( DDR for Wii is out already in the U.S. ) In the meantime , Wii Sports is fun in short spurts , especially if I 'm playing with other people , but for real exercise I 'm sticking to my exercise videos and good old walking or jogging . <p> ( Super Mario Galaxy is an awesome game though . I guess you could get some minimal exercise if you stood up to play it . ) <h> Stop the presses ! Game play refinements can up the workout <p> Update : I had a couple of conversations with Wii fans who disagreed with my assumptions above . Taking their suggestions into account , I modified my Wii Sports session today a bit . <p> First , I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I usually do . This allowed me to move around properly . <p> I also made an effort to move around and stretch a lot more during tennis , pressing the A button to skip the replays , and really trying to turn my body properly for the shots . <p> For boxing , I remembered my Tae Bo sessions and moved my feet in boxing fashion ( hmm , a Wii Tae Bo would be fun ) and danced around or jogged in place a bit between rounds or during countdowns if I knocked down my opponent . <p> The extra body movement does help to keep the heartrate up you just have to do it consciously . I played two 5-set games of tennis , followed by two rounds for boxing ; that came out to about 30 minutes . My heartrate went up to about the midpoint of my aerobic range for about a third of that time , and stayed more or less at the low end for the rest . <p> Nevertheless , I still think its misleading to say that Wii Sports is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly so that you do get some exercise benefits , you need to have a certain level of fitness to begin with . And my heartrate still did not get up or stay up as well as it does with exercise videos or walking around the hilly terrain in my neighborhood . <p> I cant imagine a very out of shape person , who is anti-movement anyway , getting much out of Wii Sports fitness wise and the arm and joint strain problem would be exascerbated . If you are really out of shape , I believe ( keeping in mind that I 'm not a physician or trainer ) you 'd do far better by just walking ( if you do n't  want to go outside there 's always the treadmill option , or a walking video . ) <p> But heck , it is fun , especially if you play with a friend . And if you want something to get your sedentary kids off the couch , its perfect . <p> I believe you are coming from a vantage point of already being fit and wanting to increase your level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are posting discouraging information for people with weight issues . I came across your article as I was looking to purchase my first Wii Fitness game to see the benefits for not only my self but for others who have weight issues . <p> I have worked directly with people wanting to lose weight for over 20 years ( via a major weight loss company ) and I am very excited about the Wii fitness prospects . If there is anything out there that just gets some people off their duffs even just for a bout of bowlingbelieve me it is much more than they are already doing ! I agree that it is not going to be a god-send for anyone that is already walking/jogging ( you already have a different mindset ) but for those who HATE to do any exercise I believe that if exercise can be even slightly incorporated into a game and the whole family can join in GREAT ! ( I tell people to just move more than they did the week before . ) Have you looked around at our youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are morbidly obese and they do n't  know that it is not normal or healthy . Obese adolecent girls are walking around in very tight shirts , not even trying to cover up the jiggly bellies , they appear proud of it if not unaware of how unhealthy they are . <p> Sorry for the rant but this is something that is very important to me and if there is ANYTHING that gets people movingI am all for it ! <p> Have you tried the training area ? There are less stops and the boxing training has you dodging from one side to the next . I also will spend 15 minutes to 30 minutes on my gazelle then box for 15 or so and that really makes me feel good . I have n't checked my heart rate specifically but I am sweating and tired . I ride bike and hike so I do n't  get the upper body exercise I need without it . I was thinking they need to do a remote for your legs so you can do a tae bo type exercise . The next gen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can agree to a certain extent with the " heart rate " issues , I 'm a forty eight year old woman who has n't  excersized in a lonnnng time ( I never really had to but menopause is a DRAG ) . I 've had bouts with physical ailments as well as injuries in the last four years , necessitating a rather slug-abed lifestyle . <p> However three weeks ago I started on the WII fit and lazy me , who hates to run , hates to do anything outside ( Florida in the summer ugh ) is now up at em at five ready to spend an hour stretching with my yoga , burning a few calories with my aerobics , having a little fun with my balance games and then working on strength exersizes . And while I have n't dropped much weight ( the fault of my diet ) I sure am starting to LOOK better . My stamina is improving daily , my posture and mostly ( and very importantly ) my sense of self pride shows in my walk , my talk and my attitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yeah I could probably get more out of working out at the gym . The question is am I going to get up every day , put on the cutie little gym outfit , drive to the gym and hang out with women twenty ( thirty ? ) years younger than me ? Probably not . Besides , I get a chart every morning to see how I 'm doing , weight wise , BMI wise and how long Ive been working out so I cant lie to myself . <p> Its not the be-all , end-all , Charles Atlas approved method to the perfect body but I work on it an hour a day at least and ENJOY myself , and love beating my former personal best scores . And I have FUN . Its not work at all . Lots of my very fit exercise freak friends say they do n't  get their daily dose ( endorphins ) from it , but you can make yourself sore on the strength training . <p> Does anyone know any cheats to skip the little pep talk afterward and the ratings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do find the male trainer ( who I call the eunich ) to be smarmy and annoying and I 'd like to hear less of him . Much . <p> I am a forty year old male in pretty good condition but carrying about 20 lbs that I have been unable or unwilling to to loose . I bought a Wii and Wii Fit about two months ago and had fun playing on and off for a few weeks . Mostly the fun balance games and the occasional yoga pose and the hula . I saw no real results except that I could do the 10 min hula without being dying . I then challenged myself to dedicate 3 weeks at 1 hour per day to see if results were possible . My routine is 10 min hula , 90 sec Plank , 10 Boxing , 30 jackknifes , 10 Advanced Step , 10 push ups with side planks , 10 min Island lap jogging , 3 yoga poses and 3 additional strength exercises to finish up my 50 60 min workout . I have been impressed with the results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can even see my abs ! I am still using the Wii fit every day and still enjoy every workout , but the most amazing thing is that now I feel motivated to watch what I eat which should compound the results . I turn 41 in about a month and my current goal is to be under 200 lbs by then . I have n't been under 200 lbs in 15 years ! <p> I just bought a Wii Sport and Wii Fit a couple days ago . Im considered obese at 220 and I 'm severely out of shape . For someone like me , the Wii Fit is fantastic ! ! I 'm enjoying exercising and being active . i do n't  have to feel embarrassed by going out to a gym and working out with the pretty spandex-clad women . <p> This is great for me . I work up a sweat and actually get my heart rate up without killing myself ! Now once I 'm actually fit I 'll probably go to a gym . But until then , this is fantastic ! Thank you Wii ! ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . They play the " sports " part but not the training and then are dumbfounded when they do n't  have the results they want . <p> Play " Working The Bag " for 30 mins straight and then talk . Youll be punching for half an hour straight . I do n't  care what shape you 're in , many people get a good work out from this . More so than , like you said , trying to punch the opponent and then waiting . The " training " part of the game is the athletic part ( except maybe tennis ) . Play the sports with friends . <p> Following on regarding your trials with Wii Sport . I have a Wii Fit too but more of that later . Wii Sport is VERY effective for fitness/weight loss if you know how to use it properly . I rarely actually touch the " game " portion and stick completely to the " training " area . In that I totally agree with the previous user . For me , in particular the tennis " returning balls " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error I have discovered exactly what combination of movement and swing power results in what rough band of heart rate ( for me ) . I have even developed different ways of swinging in order to focus on different groups of muscles . <p> During an exercise using the tennis training I push my heart rate ( and keep it there ) to these bands for different kinds of exercise/fitness levels . I can even manage to sustain 160+ for some minutes using the " swing control " portion . Combined with Wii Fit I have reached a pretty good fitness level , built some muscle and shed some fat . I used to HATE going to gym and the Wii has given me a way out . <p> A note on Wii Fit . As a case in point I 'll use " Advanced Step " ( AS ) as an example . If I do the normal AS from a resting heart rate my HR barely hits 90 . By making a minor adjustment in how I do the steps , i.e. taking big strides backwards and sideways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to over 120 . <p> Besides Wii being fun , it is one of the best things I have ever bought and ten times over worth it . <p> I LOVE Wii ! ! ! ! ! I bought it for Fitness . Wii Personal trainer gives you a private fitness class using weights a stability ball , let 's you focus on the core or upper body or cardio . EA sports Active is another great program and the new Wii fit is fantastic . I do n't  disagree with the bloggers view of Wii , but i believe that the blogger is simply not even tapping what the wii has to offer . I do n't  know how you can run in place for ten minutes or high step , grapvine , skip , do step touches and not get a real cardio workout . I have an in house gym including a commercial elliptical trainer , and consider myself a fitness enthusiast . I also hop on my bike once or twice a week . But it was the different Wii Fitness programs that jumpstarted my fitness program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -its like anything , nothing will work unless you do . <p> But if you work it , making Wii part of your fitness program is fun and rewarding ! <p> I agree with others , if you 're going to use the Wii Sports game for weight loss , you 've got to use the training portion , not the game portion . The games are fun to play with others , but its the training in the tennis and boxing games that really give you a good workout . Ive lost 10lbs since I got my Wii , and I have n't gotten tired of it yet ! <p> I understand this is a pretty old blog about the Wii , however , when I was 16 years old , I lacked severe motivation ( due to depression ) when it came to keeping fit . Because I had nothing to do , I played on my brothers Wii , doing the boxing , and the results were astounding ! I managed to lose 37.4 lbs in just 3 weeks . I would use the Boxing part of Wii sports which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 1-2 hours in a row , and only stopped for a tall glass of water . I gained the weight back due to medication , however , now I am 22 years of age I bought a Wii for myself , this year I have decided to start out with an hour of boxing per day . I only just began , however , my arms are killing me from the muscles being worked , and my whole body was drenched in sweat . Right now I am feeling amazing , and of course , I will keep this up , and continue to use other methods to exercise outside of my home : ) It really depends on the person how useful they find the Wii.

Let 's begin with some background . Emoji are little graphic faces that were introduced in Japan in the late 1990s as a cross between the happy face and the emoticon , designed to punctuate online text by indicating or implying various emotions on the part of the sender . They provide texters with a handy form of shorthand , the premise being that if a picture is worth a thousand words , an appropriate emoji can easily substitute for several tweets worth . <p> This element of convenience has made them enormously popular , which is why Facebook offers a broad array of them to enhance users messaging . In fact , an array that is considered a bit too broad by some . For example , when Facebook added " faces of color " for texters of various hues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more yellow than anyones actual face . But the biggest backlash came in response to an emoji of a rosy-cheeked , extra-chinned face labeled " feeling fat . " <h> If Facebook uproar , then Change.org petition <p> There are literally scores of " feeling " emojis , such as " feeling blue " ( blue-tinged face ) , " feeling sleepy " ( heavy-lidded face ) , " feeling stupid " ( blank expression face ) , and so on . But to my knowledge , none of them has riled people up like " feeling fat . " So much so , in fact , that a Change.org petition was created to demand that Facebook expunge the " feeling fat " face . The petitions rallying slogan was Fat Is Not a Feeling . As one signer noted , " Fat is a hormone producing organ and not a feeling . " <p> The petition stated that the " feeling fat " emoji reinforced negative body images , fueled an unhealthy obsession with body size , and fostered feelings of shame and eating disorders ; that it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate your body . " That sounds like an almost breathtaking amount of power and scope for one little emoticon , but before you could say " Who are you calling chubby ? , " more than 16,000 people had signed the petition , and Facebook responded by removing it from its " status update options . " <h> Wherein I open the can of worms <p> You can classify this as a lesson learned , or corporate responsiveness , or a victory for self-acceptance . Or , if you 're a writer , you can classify it as arbitrary censorship . That 's how I view it , and why I 'm asking for trouble by disputing it . I know I 'm not going to change the mind of anyone who actually has an opinion on this subject , and that 's probably a good thing , but let me make a few points . <p> Point one : Catherine Weingarten , one of the petitions authors , wrote that , " When Facebook users set their status to feeling fat , they are making fun of people who consider themselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is not O.K. " If I may make an observation to those who share her view : When someone in Colorado , or India , or Germany , or anywhere else expresses , whether by word or by symbol , the notion " I feel fat , " that sentiment is about them . It is not about you . Your reaction to the use of the feel-fat emoji that they are making fun of fat people , or telling their friends " how much you hate your body " may be perfectly sincere , and quite understandable , but it is your reaction , and does not have any necessary connection to the users intent or meaning . <p> Point two : " Feeling fat " is no more inherently disparaging to the overweight than " feeling old " or " feeling blue " are disparaging to the elderly or the depression-prone . " Feeling old " and " feeling blue " simply express temporary emotions that people routinely experience about themselves . For others to regard such phrases as somehow demeaning to them is fairly lofty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who says , or graphically indicates , that they " feel fat " is thereby reinforcing a negative stereotype applied to others . <p> Point three : Fat is not a feeling ? So what ? Are you " feeling stupid " ? Hey , stupidity is a lack of information or intelligence , not a feeling . " Feeling sleepy " ? Sleepiness is a neurological response to fatigue or extended consciousness , not a feeling . " Feeling lucky " ? Luck is a word describing the random nature of success or failure in an endeavor involving chance , not a feeling . " Feeling horny " ? O.K. , we wont go there . But the fact is , you can play the " not literally a feeling " game for hours on end , if that 's your idea of fun . In the end , though , you are really just playing semantics gotcha , not presenting an argument . Everyone knows what those phrases mean , and that they describe real and nearly universal occasional emotional states . <p> Point four : What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat " icon , its the very term " fat " itself , which they view as inherently negative , even insulting . But for one thing , that 's just their opinion ; there are legions of people who not only routinely feel fat , but in fact are fat , as we measure fatness , and yet they are perfectly fine with their physical stature . In this case , the negativity , like beauty , lies in the eye of the beholder . For another thing , if you can censor a symbol which means " feeling fat , " you can conceivably gin up another petition to censor the very words " feeling fat , " and why stop there ? <h> Fat as an epithet <p> At what point does the mere word " fat " become defined as an epithet ? Are we going to wind up being pressured to replace " fat " with " the f-word " ? Well , no ; we already have one of those . But you see what I 'm getting at . Or , if you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms. Engeln is a psychology professor at Northwestern and an ardent and vocal supporter of the petition . She has authored studies on body-shame and body-dissatisfaction , and recently wrote an article for the New York Times on the true evil here , " fat talk , " which she describes as the routine " conversational shaming of the body " that women engage in when they talk with one another about their own weight or body shape and how unhappy they are with either or both . <p> I quote her closing paragraph : " It does n't  really matter , in the end , that Facebook banned the double-chinned emoticon . What matters is that , for our own good and the good of others , we women stop talking this way , one way or another . Emoticon or no emoticon , we must change the conversation . " In other words , the fault , to rip off Shakespeare , lies not in our emojis but in ourselves . 3781 @qwx863781

AIDS was n't born in a lab , and it wont be extinguished in one . Truvada needed to be tested on a real-world basis. - And thanks to the HMO kingpin Kaiser , it now has been . <p> Kaiser provided Truvada to a sample group of 657 high-risk individuals who were given no instructions to alter their lifestyle behavior in any other way .

Some denounce it as a gay party drug , which will increase the amount of unsafe sex practiced in that community , and thus the number of STD infections not prevented by Truvada , and that may well be the case . <p> But those other infections are not taking 1,000 American lives each month , and the trade-off seems eminently defensible . <p> And Big Pharma companies that currently market painfully expensive drugs to treat persons with AIDS are also not delighted by the prospect of a simple daily pill , currently available from Kaiser for around $50 a month , that could reduce HIV transmission by 90 percent . <p> If Truvada sounds too good to be true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly gotten on board , and now recommends Truvada for high-risk individuals , such as those with numerous sexual partners , or with HIV-positive partners , or who engage in intravenous drug use . <p> If Truvada in fact becomes a staple prophylactic used by all those who should be using it , it could mean that we have gone from the widespread panic of the early 1980s , when we feared AIDS might end sex as we know it , to a readily available pill that promises to end AIDS as we know it. - That 's something to celebrate . 3781 @qwx863781

Sami is Finnish , and co-founded the online real estate site Trulia , which enabled him to retire quite comfortably to pursue his favorite activities , all of which are exhausting , and to become one of the top-ranked amateur triathletes in the country . Meredith , who is married to him , was a competitive gymnast before she became a Silicon Valley software product manager . <p> Along with a fondness for grueling tests of endurance , they share a serious antipathy toward unhealthy foods and beverages , particularly sugar , caffeine , and processed foods .

You can probably guess some of the things that interfered with their plan , such as heavy squalls , headwinds , antagonistic currents and your occasional 20-foot wave .

Smart phones , smart water , smart boards , smart keys , and smart TVs . Now we have what its creator calls the smart diet pill . <p> Researchers at Gelesis in Boston , have tested a pill called Gelesis100 , formerly Attiva , for use as a weight loss aid . Attiva is a hydrogel-polymer that expands in water to a much greater volume . The theory is that it will fill the stomach and fool users into thinking that they are full . <p> I had a frugal friend once tell me that he did the same thing with Rice Krispies . <p> Additionally , the company claims that when the material eventually shrinks and leaves the stomach it passes into the small intestine where it swells again , trapping unabsorbed sugar and fatty acids . Eventually Gelesis100 breaks down , slowly releasing the trapped sugar and fatty acids before it is passed out of the body . <h> Gelesis100 clinical study <p> A proof-of-concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 128 people . <p> Over 12 weeks 43 people to received 2.25 grams of Gelesis100 before lunch and dinner , 42 people received 3.75 grams , and 43 people served as a control group receiving a placebo of cellulose , a bulking agent . All subjects were asked to drink 1 to 2 glasses of water before meals and eat 600 fewer calories per day . The 2.25 gram group lost 6.1 percent of their body weight , the 3.75 grams group 4.5 percent , and the placebo group 4.1 percent . <p> Gelesis speculates that the greater loss by the group with the smaller dose can be attributed to more hard-to-tolerate side effects caused by the larger dose . <p> In the group receiving the smaller dose , the subjects with high fasting blood sugar as measured prior to the study , lost 8.2 percent . The most weight was lost by individuals who were prediabetic , averaging 10.9 percent of their body weight . <p> But there were several reported side effects , including bloating , flatulence , and abdominal pain and diarrhea . These occurred less often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hassan Heshmati , the chief medical officer for Gelesis and the studys co-investigator commented that the study showed the pill to be safe and potentially of great value to " prediabetic subjects for whom weight loss is particularly important because they are at increased risk for diabetes .

And Gelesis100 involves no surgery , with its obvious risks . <p> On the other hand , there 's the problem of patient compliance : Will they take the pill regularly , drink water before meals , and eat 600 calories less per day just because you ask them to ? And any weight loss treatment must confront all the factors which play into overeating , such as emotions , environmental pressures , hormones , and unrelated medications . <p> I sent some questions off to Gelesis asking them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart pill , " but they sent me a robo-response saying theyd get back to me on that ! <h> Gelesis100s expand-in-your-stomach predecessors <p> This is not the first time the diet industry had tried to sell us on the theory that filling the stomach will get us to lose weight .

And he also has a web page whereon he airs a number of those convictions below the following headline ( and we quote ) : <p> " A VERY Unusual Weight Loss Approach ! ( based on Physics ! ) " <p> Mr. ( or possibly Dr. ) Johnson throws a lot of science onto the page below this headline , beginning with the fact that a sedentary , desk-job type of person " emits about 390 to 450 Btu/hr of heat , " terminology that probably motivates a lot of page viewers to skip quickly over to MySpace . Johnson cites something called the ASHRAE Handbook to support these figures , but does n't  explain the meaning of ASHRAE , which sounds suspiciously like a kind of pricey Buddhist retreat . But lest we grow skeptical , remember : it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Johnson then reminds us that , as everyone knows , one calorie equals 3.968 Btu , which means that the body loses about 100 calories per hour just being awake , and , because skin temperature drops slightly during slumber , about 80 calories per hour while sleeping , or about 640 calories during a full nights sleep . <p> And here 's where it gets interesting . <p> Cold-blooded weight loss proposal . According to Johnson , if a person sleeps with an electric blanket or a number of heavy quilts , ordinary blankets or other bedcovers , the body will compensate for this added warmth by burning fewer calories during sleep . By " fewer , " Johnson means a mere 20 per hour , for a total of 160 calories per night instead of the full 640 . <p> " By being really cozy in bed , " Johnson concludes , " he has eliminated 480 calories of food energy that would have been used up ! What happens to that 480 calories that he did not use ? You know the answer ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fat every day really can add up !

Johnson then notes that one pound of human body fat equals 3500 calories of stored energy , divides that figure by the magical 480 calories per night , and comes up with the killer result : " By simply throwing off that heavy cover or that electric blanket it seems reasonable that roughly one pound of body weight loss is realistic each week .

@@97602962 @1802962/ <h> Junk food vegetarians : Living on cheese and carbs <p> Working as a guide for American high school students in Paris this summer has induced frequent flashbacks to my own high school trip to France . Watching the students quizzical looks as they shuffle through the cafeteria line reminds me of how my unadventurous adolescent taste buds were highly unimpressed by French cuisine . <p> Perhaps French gastronomy is a series of acquired tastes ; or perhaps this was an unfortunate result of the fact that my short experiment with vegetarianism coincided with my first voyage abroad . <h> Vegetarian food not always healthy <p> I was thinking that the seemingly light and fluffy dish was mostly made of butter and was thus probably two-thirds fat , with a nominal amount of protein , and that calling it the " veggie " option was a misnomer seeing as there was little to nothing vegetable used in the pastry except for the wheat flour . I wanted to tell her that if she wanted a more balanced meal she should take some of the steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since my job is to help her find her way around Paris , not lecture her on nutrition . <p> Health is one of the main reasons that people become vegetarian , but if they 're not already in the habit of consuming a vegetable-based diet , cutting meat out is not necessarily going to do much to improve their nutrition . Frequently people become what I call cheese and carb vegetarians . Everyone knows one a vegetarian who does n't  really like vegetables and somehow sustains life on cheese pizza , grilled cheese , and mac n cheese . <p> Since eliminating meat cuts out one of the most common sources of protein , discussions of healthy vegetarian diets often focus on getting enough of this nutrient . Cheese does contain protein , along with quite a bit of fat much of it saturated . <p> In fact , cheese tends to be even more calorie-dense than meat . One hundred grams of Brie contain 334 calories and 75 grams of fat 17 of which are saturated . The same quantity of chicken breast only has 171 calories and 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , a complete substitution of meat for cheese is likely to result in weight gain . <h> Getting protein from non-dairy sources <p> Vegetarians can get protein from a lot of different sources , and the more variety , the healthier the diet . Dairy products like yogurt and cottage cheese give protein minus the high fat content of cheese . Also beans , nuts , grains , and vegetables can provide plenty of amino acids . <p> In our protein fixation , we seem to forget that it can be obtained from tons of different plant sources . The fish and meat group and the veggie group appear far from one another on the food pyramid , but protein is a macronutrient , not a food group . So do n't  let the distance between them fool you especially when combined with whole grains and legumes , the amino acids in veggies can give you plenty of protein . <p> Plus vegetables provide you with vitamins , minerals , and fiber that you just cant find in meals that involve mainly cheese and wheat flour . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid the pitiful nutritional state of the cheese and carb vegetarians , my best recommendation is to base your meals on , wait for it , vegetables . It seems so obvious , but there 's a reason that nutritionists around the world have yet to stop preaching " five a day " : most vegetarians and meat eaters alike do n't  get anywhere enough fruits and veggies ! <p> So , when choosing what to eat , try to fill the bulk of your plate with vegetables . Add in a grain preferably a whole grain like quinoa , which is filled with protein and omega 3 ' and a legume or some soy ( or meat if you so choose ) , and you are bound to have created a pretty balanced meal . <p> Though my student did n't  associate the potatoes and vegetables with protein , eating a serving of each would have upped her amino acid count significantly . <h> 8 Responses to " Junk food vegetarians : Living on cheese and carbs " <p> You seem to be seduced by the anti-saturated fat dogma that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat is unhealthy , or that fat in general is unhealthy . In fact the more they try to prove that theory , the less it holds up . <p> In fact there is much evidence that a moderate protein , high ( good ) fat diet is not only healthy , but the healthiest for many people . Many traditional cultures ate diets higher in fat than even the SAD , and they were not only healthy , but healthier than people who try to avoid fat , and substitute high carbohydrates for the lost calories . <p> One of the largest epidemiological studies , Framingham , I think , found that increased saturated fat was actually protective for women over 40 . <p> You know , I never really thought about vegetarians ( like myself ) not eating vegetables . I guess I just never thought of a vegetarian living off just the carbs and cheese , but its true and I can defiantly see more misinformed people doing this . <p> Just because a dish is " vegetarian " or someone is vegetarian does n't  deem them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly talking about the fat content in cheese to indicate that although its vegetarian , its by no means a " diet " food . I do n't  think we should shun fatand find modern lipophobia pretty ridiculous . But it does bring 9 calories with each gram compared to protein and carbohydrates 4 . And does n't  tend to be as filling per calorie as high fiber foods . <p> So , high fat foods should be consumed in moderation ( unless you 're burning a ton of calories , say participating in the Tour de France ) to maintain a healthy weight . <p> The Framingham stuff is interesting , I 've never heard a pro-saturated fat argument before . <p> People have often assumed a vegetarian diet is more healthy but I have found when eating out that if you are avoiding meat and many dishes and salads have meat in them then you can easily end up eating far too many chips and cakes ! Personally I think most of us could benefit from more vegetable based vegetarian choices when eating out . <p> By the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on actual evidence or just because you think this is the case ? <p> I said that health is " one of the main " reasons for going vegetarian . I think that along with animal rights and environmental reasons , health is one of the big motivators for people to cut meat out of their diet . I say this based on personal experience and what Ive seen on vegetarian sites , forums , and blogs . <p> wow , i was shocked to read this article because it is about ME ! ! ! as a child i never really cared for meat and did n't  eat much of it . then in 7th grade i discovered vegetarianism and decided i 'd go for it . Ive been a vegetarian ever since . Only problem is that i do n't  care for vegetables either ! ever since ive lived off of cheese , bread and junk food . i 'm sure it will end up killing me , but i just havent found a way to enjoy/like vegetables . <p> I was surprised to find this article because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any vegetables ( except for canned green beans ) . I have been a vegetarian for about two years now and it is really hard to find healty food I will eat . This reminds me so much of myself especially since I am going to Europe this summer and will probably be living on croque-madammes while in France . I have found alternatives to meat such as tofu , boca burgers , tofurky and protien shakes . I have tried salads and other vegetables and cant stand the texture .

Really ? <p> ( CC ) ralph and jenny/Flickr <h> If it sounds to good to be true , well , you know the rest . <p> I ran across two items the other day that , taken together , fairly cried out for a CalorieLab post . The first was an article on the AARP website titled , " 7 Reasons You May Be Packing On the Pounds . " Along with such reasons as not getting enough sleep and eating junk food was " Your tiny breakfast . " The article cited a recent Israeli study in which overweight dieting women who consumed most of their calories early in the day lost more than twice as much weight as those who consumed the same amount but later in the day . <p> This seems to be one more bit of support for the premise that skipping breakfast leaves us hungry and leads us to consume more calories the rest of the day and thus to gain weight , so in order to lose weight , we should eat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gospel ; I even included it in my e-book , " 115 Reasons Why Its Not Your Fault If Youre Fat . " That 's why I was so intrigued by the second item , a posting on the New York Times website by Anahad OConnor which made a pretty strong case that the big-breakfast rule is mostly poppycock . <p> OConnor actually plowed through scores of articles and published studies on the subject and found out that the vast majority of them were based on statistical associations between eating breakfast and losing weight rather than controlled trials to establish causality . More than 70 research articles on the subject referred to one single , well-publicized analysis of people who had lost weight and kept it off for one or more years which found that some 80 percent of them regularly ate breakfast . <p> The problem is that nothing in that study indicated that eating breakfast was the cause or even one of the causes , of their successful weight loss . Nonetheless , by OConnors count , half the follow-up articles that cited the study played up the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them suggested that skipping breakfast in fact contributed to obesity . And only a few of them noted that the breakfast eaters also engaged in more physical activity than breakfast skippers . <p> One study that did undertake to test this association for causality was conducted at Vanderbilt , and it found that while regular breakfast skippers in a weight-loss program lost about 17 pounds on average after switching to big breakfasts , regular breakfast eaters in the program lost almost 20 pounds by switching to breakfast-skipping . Their conclusion : whatever your current breakfast routine , your best weight-loss results will come from suddenly doing the opposite . <p> If this is news to you , perhaps its because , as OConnor notes , over 60 percent of subsequent published reports that referred to the Vanderbilt study got it all wrong , and cited it as actually supporting the big breakfast concept . Only a few other tightly controlled studies of breakfast and weight loss have been published , but they come up with basically the same results as the Vanderbilt researchers . Which should probably not be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat more , weigh less . <p> And indeed , research seems to indicate that while breakfast skippers do take in additional calories over the remainder of the day , its generally fewer than they would have consumed at breakfast . But then what are we to make of the eat-breakfast-lose-more results of the Israeli study ? For that matter , how valid are those results for Americans , whose breakfasts routinely include bacon , ham or sausage ? <p> Obviously , some final , conclusive and definitive large-scale controlled study is needed here . And I suspect that the premise that big morning meals help us lose weight wont survive such serious research . I think the notion became popular because we have a weakness for the unlikely , the unexpected , the ironic . That 's what keeps all those Believe It Or Not museums in business .

Food combining basically entails only eating certain types of food together .

Within the span of a year or so I went from around 50 kilograms to about 70 kilograms . ( I 'm not actually sure what my starting weight was , since weight was not even an issue for me until I started to not fit in my clothes anymore ! ) I did lose a lot of it , but have since gained it back and more , hence my current efforts to get rid of the excess weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily ? It comes down to fairly simple reasons : lack of unplanned exercise , lack of peer pressure , and the huge portions . Whenever my new school stressed me out ( I hated that high school to be honest ) I 'd comfort myself with a bag of potato chips the family size . We usually ate out as a family at local diners , where the club sandwiches could be stacked up about 15 inches high , and we started expecting home meal portions to be as big . <h> Living Large Around the World <p> I think it is just tremendously hard to stay slim in the U.S. compared to other places Ive lived , which is why the obesity rate is so high there . Public transportation is not that available except in a few cities , and people just do n't  walk much anymore in the suburbs . So one has to make a special effort and set aside a specific time to get any exercise . Busy people are n't  always willing or able to do that . Portion sizes at restaurants and such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complain if they were drastically reduced . <p> And , despite the attention paid to " size zero " celebrities and such , I just do n't  believe there is that much peer or societal pressure to keep yourself slim . When the people around you are mostly neither slim nor fit , why bother ? <p> I have n't lived in the U.K. since I was a child , but whenever I 've visited there in recent years I gotten the feeling that it was becoming more and more Americanized in lifestyle more reliance on cars , bigger portions and so on . Add that to the fact that traditional British food can be quite high calorie ( pies , fish and chips , and well , curries ) its not too surprising to see obesity rates there soar . <p> As for France , where I now live , and Switzerland , where I previously lived , there are various factors that help keep people slim , such as great public transportation , a natural tendency for people to get a little exercise , and reasonably sized portions . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rely on takeaways/takeout and readymade meals . <p> The bottom line is that home cooking is really better for you all around , health and taste wise . And its the best way to take control of your own , and your familys health . ( And all the better if at some of that home cooking is Japanese a reason to visit my Japanese food blog , Just Hungry . ) <h> Yet More Reasons Why Japanese are So Skinny <p> Update : Were adding the text of commenter Marks observations here below Makis post , because they spell out a lot of specific differences between American and Japanese society that may contribute to the difference in obesity rates . <p> Continuing from what Maki wrote , here are some other factors that may explain the relative lack of obesity in Japan : <h> Meal and Eating Habits <p> The habit of three meals a day and one or two defined snacks has not yet given way to 24/7 grazing as it has in the United States . <p> Japanese meals look bigger than they are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowls , taking up every square inch of the table . This serves to make less food seem more satisfying . <p> Most Japanese fill up on white rice during a meal . You can certainly get fat eating a lot of rice , but it seems that rice may contribute to eating less of more fattening items , like fried foods . <p> Mayonnaise- , cream- , and cheese-based sauces and dressings are rarer and used in smaller quantities . Mos Burger , an indiginous fast food restaurant , supplies the soy sauce flavored dressing for its salads in little packets the size of classic ketchup packets in the United States , which hold about two teaspoons of dressing . <p> Beverages are not consumed in large volumes with meals . This includes non-caloric beverages , which are used to " wash down " more food by Americans . And unsweetened tea is the most commonly drunk beverage . <p> Desserts are not always eaten . Sweets are eaten less often . Many Japanese are genuinely grossed out by foods that are too sweet , and Japanese confections like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Americans . Fruit in Japan is not grown for shippability or long-term storage and is better tasting than in the United States , so its more credible as a dessert or sweet treat than it would be in the United States <h> Food Availability <p> Although Maki mentioned the many vending machines , these are overwhelmingly for beverages ( much of it noncaloric teas ) , and you see very few vending machines selling food or snacks , whether in offices or on the street . If you want to buy a snack , you need to go into a convenience store and face a human being at a register . <h> Environmental Factors : Work , Transportation , Housing <p> Japans population is very concentrated in cities , and Japanese commute to work by train and subways in many cases , which means they walk or bicycle to the station and back . <p> Japanese are self-conscious about and avoid eating while walking or on public transportation , although eating on buses , trains , and subways is not prohibited . <p> Work hours are long , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the work day at the office . <p> The kitchen and the the living room ( television room ) are more likely to be separated in Japan . Refrigerators and cupboards are small and do n't  hold a lot of food . Japanese are less likely to have food in the house , and more likely to go out walking to the market for their daily food needs . Shopping daily in turn encourages the purchase of fresh foods rather than frozen or canned , which make more appealing , lower calorie meals <h> Environment and Movement in Daily Life <p> Food packaging encourages less consumption . Cookies are wrapped individually or in packs of two . Americans often think this is environmentally wasteful , but when you think of it from the point of view of the amount of packaging material discarded per person per day its no different than in the United States , since most Japanese really will just eat the one or two cookies and stop . <p> As Maki said , there is more opportunity to move . This is partly because Japan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in number , but they are still less common than in the United States . Elevators are often hidden away and slow . To put it bluntly , Japan is less " accessible " as the United States . <p> At first glance this seems like a problem to visiting Americans when they see an 80-year-old woman struggling up the stairs to get over the train tracks to the other side of the station to do her shopping . But what those Americans might not be considering is that the same 80-year-old woman in the United States would likely be institutionalized and incapable of walking , because she was n't forced to walk each and every day throughout her life . From a 30,000-foot public health policy perspective , its not really clear to me that a high degree of " accessibility " ends up benefiting the overall public welfare more than it harms it . <h> Lack of Political Correctness and Fat-Blind Politeness <p> The " WTF , I 'm fat ! " alarm sounds sooner in Japan than in the United States , so Japanese tend to take action before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat people as fat : the self-delusionary attitudes of the United States havent taken hold . People will mention it if you gain weight , and society does n't  judge that as being rude . <p> Japanese have a really hard time buying clothes if they gain too much weight . For instance , T-Shirt sizes stocked at many Uniqlo retail outlets do n't  go above an " L , " which is similar to a tight Large in the United States ( although some outlets will have LLs , and the website will sell up to 4X ) . And the Kevin Smith-style hip-hop elephant-trunk shorts and oversized shooters look has not taken hold in Japan and is not considered appropriate dress for most contexts , so fat people have to dress in less stylish fat versions of normal clothing . <p> Much sooner than in the United States the overweight will find that they do n't  fit on bus seats and in baseball stadium seats . Bench seats for public transportation like buses , trains and subways are often molded in 1-person widths or have grab posts aligned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you take up more than your allotted space , everyone around you knows it , and they know you are preventing someone else from sitting down . You cant just drift along and gain weight without having it be constantly brought to your attention by people around you and the environment . <p> In this post Japanese expat ( living in France , former New York City and Switzerland resident ) Makiko Itoh answers the questions , " " How do Japanese people stay thin ? , " and " Why are Japanese women so skinny ? . " <h> 72 Responses to " Why Japanese people are slim , or at least do n't  get that fat " <p> Very good article ! There are a few things I believe contribute to US obesity. 1 . Cities are too spread out ; business and residential areas are vastly seperated in some places . 2 . Todays working industry revolves around office environment , call centers , etc. 3 . Vending machines offer too many junk food items , and working long shifts , many people buy junk food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work . <p> " Peer pressure . Japanese society is largely based on how one fits comfortably and unabrasively into society , way more so than most Western societies . There is a huge amount of peer pressure to conform , and the pressure on women in particular to stay slim is tremendous . " <p> We do n't  have the same culture . Some people want to go ahead an be rude and make fun of fat people here , but did you read the post ? Japanese people often travel and gain weight themselves . It makes more sense that in their culture , fatness be ridiculed or " observed , " because it should be more difficult to gain weight when walking around , buying fresher foods daily , and having to use public transport that requires smaller figures . <p> Here , almost 1 in 4 Americans are obese , and even Asian people are gaining weight here . That is n't because people are lazy or need to be ridiculed , but I would submit that if we were to " catch " it before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight of others ) before the person was obese , there might be something to it . I 'm not saying we should be as rude as some folks are , but I am saying that I 've noticed a trend in small overeating slowly becoming big overeating , as people slowly gain weight toward obesity . <p> Once a person has gained 50 lbs , its nearly impossible to counter appetite enough to slim down to a healthy , slim weight . Adding exercises does little for weight , because an hour of exercise only burns about 200 calories ( unless you 're more dedicated to the intensity of the workout ) . <p> Most Americans are caught up in commutes and work days with very little time to take care of their over-sized homes and yards to take much time off for something they consider selfish ( exercising ) , especially women who work and even stay-at-home moms . <p> While I think poking fun at fat people is fruitless , there may be something to the mentioning it before it gets out of hand thing . If your young adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him or her about obesity ! ! <p> High calorie junk food promoted by food companies through saturation advertising is much cheaper than fresh foods that are naturally healthier than refined foods that are loaded with sugar and fat . In addition , modern living allows people to commute in cars and watch TV when they get home after work , drastically reducing any physical activity . Any society or individuals succumbing to advertised foods , which tend to have higher calories , and reduced physical movement will get fat over time regardless of genetics . The Western societies are already experiencing this overweight phenomenon , and those that are developing and getting more prosperous are exhibiting the same pattern whether they are from Africa , Europe , South America , China or Japan . <p> And , the vicious cycle sets in . As you gain weight , you tend to move even less , and you tend to eat more and hunger hormones that make the body seek sugary and fatty foods further kick in making matters worse . <p> People in the US put high calorie dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep fried foods , and yummy carb-rich junk like doughnuts . That 's the US office culture . The US has more grazing land for cows , so we have more dairy products like ice cream and cheese available . <p> Japanese have more s e x too , and that burns a lot of calories off . <p> Also Japan is a man-centric culture , and so if a man wants his woman thin , he will just tell her to trim down and she will comply . In the US if a man tells his wife to trim down , she gets mad and tells him to go marry a skinny woman , and divorces him and takes half his stuff and the kids , and he is financially broken . Because US is a woman-centric culture , women can do this . <p> My surprise since using a handy calorie counting APP on my smartphone has been how many calories are in things I took for granted were low in calories and how quickly they can stack up ( i.e. that half-and-half creamer in your six cups of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( no sauces ) I thought was so healthy turned out to be a whopping 1080 calories ! That 's a THIRD of the 3,000 calories recommended for my build and exercise level . Nuts ! And if you 're in to skipping lunch with a chai tea latte or coffee mocha , watch out ! You will be surprised at the calories there . <p> I live in Japan . Many of these assumptions from the past are changing . <p> First , Japanese ARE getting fat from American fast foods . You 'll see it in future statistical surveys . They area totally infatuated with mayonnaise . Its even on pizzas here . Large portion sizes are available , called " viking " ( all you can eat ) . There 's also plenty of fried food here . Many teens here are totally obese . <p> Those that avoid pizzas , burgers , donuts , cheese and ice cream stay slim . Japanese also benefit from the lack of a doggy bag mentality ( you cant ask to take home what you do n't  eat ) , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grocery store . No supersizing of portions in the average restaurant ( other than viking meals ) . <p> Its a shame that Japanese idolize American habits . Japanese will surely get fat like Americans following their diet . It just may take a few more years to show up in the statistics . <p> Yes , of course there is junk food and there are fat people in Japan and Japan , like everywhere is trending upward . But there are considerably fewer fat people . If you 're American , give this test a try : When you are back in the U.S. , in a supermarket or the like , stand by the registers and do a 360-degree spin and count the number of fat people . You should be able to see about 100 people from that vantage point . Do the same thing in Japan . When I do it , I usually see no fat people in Japan , using very strict standards for fat . When I see more than one , they are obviously members of the same family . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its a completely different mix . This works in Tokyo and in rural Chiba . ( Now , if you visit Manhattan , you may end up with Japan-like results , but in most of the U.S. you 'll see many fat people . ) <p> Let me just add that traditional Japanese food is VERY unfattening , and I do n't  mean karage ( deep-fried chicken ) or ramen ( noodle soup ) traditional . Traditionally they did n't  eat a lot of meat at all , except fish , and used vinegar-based sauces , soups and dressings not oil/animal fat . They really did n't  eat much heavy food at all . <p> And while in conbinis and restaurants there is n't much of this food , most Japanese still like it , and when at home cook/eat like that a lot ( especially families it seems ) . <p> One other thing : Theres also a perception in Japan of sweet stuff being childish . Colas are for kids/teens . McDonalds is for kids/teens . Adults drink unsweetened tea or coffee , and do n't  eat much candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might bring back from a business trip . <p> I 've worked in a Japanese office for ten years now , and could probably count on one hand the number of cola bottles Ive seen on peoples desks . <p> Very , very good article , as well as Marks augmentation . However , having studied nutrition for the last 15 years , the issue of the different world diets came frequently into the study equation . <p> On this issue several studies , one of which was on a massive scale identified the Japanese of having very high levels of omega 3 fatty acid content in their skin and by appropriate testing a higher incident in their blood than the recognized Western world . This was unquestionably down to their extremely high consumption of sea foods , from prawns to sea fish and from octopus to lobsters or algae . The result is the correct ratio of high omega 3 and correspondingly lower but essential omega 6 . <p> In the west the ratio is the wrong way round in a big big way , creating chronic inflammatory ailments the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese barely ever get and they are renowned for their longevity , but more importantly , their very good health through old age . Eating so much sea food offers high protein and low carb pretty much by default which of course I feel is very very much how the great majority have ratios of body fat between 4 and 12 percent This article certainly identifies the other complimenting aspects which has guaranteed the Japanese enjoying being among the healthiest nations in the world . <p> A mere footnote for mention , I suspect that the Japanese fast food outlets probably cater partly with some more seafood as compared with western outlets , but I do n't  know this for sure . <p> Portion sizes matter too . In developed countries , meals are getting larger . Most people do n't  want to waste food and would rather stuff themselves to the brim than leave any on their plates . <p> My parents used to be like this and it took years to convince them that once their stomachs are comfortable , food is n't wasted . If we stuff ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than on the plates any way . <p> Eating enough to sustain ourselves AND enjoying each bite is sufficient . Most of us are n't  hired in labour-intensive jobs so why would we need that much sustenance ? <p> In Japan snacks are eaten in small amounts and savored . And , many foods Americans consume as snacks , such as ice cream , are not considered snacks in Japan . they are only eaten on special occasions . Many Americans frequently binge on snack foods , starting from when they are young . Snacks account for more than half their calories . <p> Most importantly , Japanese eat and drink fewer calories than Americans . Many fewer calories . Calorie consumption for women has actually decreased over the last few years . <p> By the way , their diets are not low carb , and they have as much fast food advertising as America does . They eat much less , and they snack differently . <p> I have never been overweight until I injured my knee athletically . I 've gained 15- lbs and I 'm very upset from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  recognize my body ! I am older and that is said to make loosing weight harder . I am researching how people eat is other countries and I have concluded that we eat larger portion sizes in America and most of the people are FAT ! Thank you so much for your information about Japanese eating habits . I am changing my eating habits , but it is very HARD . <p> Hey , I am from South Africa and visited a town in Japan . I lost about 10 kg during my stay . The food was amazing and i ate quite alot , but the differance was that it was low fat and less meat dishes with cabbage on the side of most meals . I did n't  eat bread at all , there were a fruity or vegetable alternative for bread . As in S.A i ate everything with bread . And i did n't  usd a car , i walked or cycled everywhere . When i returned , i turned Japanese . Got a bike and is still living like a Japanese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure Great stuff . I agree that its a shame that japanese strive to a american way of life , while their own culture is so amazing . <p> How do they account for the mercury levels in seafood ? We are told that we should watch how much fish because of mercury . However I see that many people who live around coastal areas eat plenty of fish so why cant Americans eat lots of seafood ? I struggle with my weight now since I 'm older I try to stay very active . It is true if people walk more instead of jumping into a car our society can reduce a fat country . <p> I lived acrossed the street at one point from a shopping plaza and I walked everyday and I loss a lot of weight instead of calling a cab because I 'm blind . Walmart was even further around another 2 miles but I did it and it helped me maintain my weight . Since then I moved and gained the fat back and now its ever so hard now . I do n't  know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weights but its not helping . <p> Food in Japan is treated with a reverence . The whole country says " itadakemasu " , thanks for the meal . There are rice gods , that 's how much rice is respected . Japanese eat slowly and use chopsticks . You cant gobble down food with chopsticks . Americans do n't  eat food they swallow it . Watch some food shows how piglike Americans are when they eat . Watch how animal like they eatlook how many fat people are in the backgrounds on those shows . We Americans are simply overindulged fat pigs . We think nothing of eating a 3000 calories dinner . I have been to Japan several times and have had Japanese people stay at my home . They eat with dignity and class . They chew their food . They do not stuff food into their mouths like the American pigs do . The put it inchewswallow , then put in another piece and do the same I saw a post here that must have mentioned some form of food shaming and rudeness 10 times . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatsos , which I am one . There is smoker shaming is n't there ? Why cant there be eating like a pig shaming . Because we are so sensitive we have safe words for being a fatsofluffy , big boned , full figuredgive me a breakfat is fatFat is unhealthy.fat is ugly .

@@97602977 @1802977/ <h> The Problem With the Dean Ornish Diet <p> ( CC ) Joi/Flickr <h> It May Be Too Good For Its Own Good <p> Dean Ornish is a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and a noted wholesome lifestyle advocate and entrepreneur whose Dean Ornish Diet has helped elevate him to the level of either guru or celebrity , depending on how seriously you take him . Studies in the 1980s and 90s established that if you did take him seriously , in the sense that you followed his healthy lifestyle regimen religiously and permanently , many health benefits would accrue unto you , the most striking being not just the halting but the actual reversal of the symptoms of coronary artery disease , which kills off an imposingly large number of us . <p> I bring up Dr. Ornish because of an opinion piece he wrote recently in the Sunday New York Times . The starting point of the article was that while losing weight is a good idea for most of us , there are better ways and worse ways to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remotely familiar with such eating disorders as anorexia and bulimia , but it is a handy set-up for the rest of the piece , which largely functions as a press release on behalf of his program . <p> Along with reversing even severe coronary artery disease , he notes , it also improves blood flow , reduces chronic inflammation ( " an underlying cause of heart disease and many forms of cancer " ) , may reverse the progression of Type 2 diabetes and prostate cancer , " turns off " genes that promote breast and prostate cancer , and by increasing our telomere length may extend our life span . And , oh yes , if you 're average and follow the program to the letter , you 'll lose about 24 pounds in the first year . Unfortunately , those are two very sizable ifs . <p> Most dieters embrace one of two schools of thought : fats are verboten but carbs are fine , or carbs are verboten but fats are fine . Ornishs diet rigidly minimizes both , especially refined carbohydrates , your sugars , and your processed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and veggies , whole grains and legumes , and your occasional fish . It is a diet devoid of processed foods and red meats and nearly devoid of fats ( especially saturated and trans ) . It is a terrific diet if you are willing and able to actually stick to it over the very long term . That is its problem ; and one of our two big ifs . <p> Ornishs idea of a typical dinner is vegetarian bean chili , whole wheat penne pasta and roasted vegetables . It is basically a vegetarian diet , and most people can be expected not to stick with it , based on the fact that vegetarianism is an option for almost anyone who wants to choose at any time , and yet the vast majority of us do n't  . You can blame this on anything you want , from social pressure to product marketing to junk food addiction , but its a reality in any case . <p> And that 's just the nutritional part of the lifestyle . The clinical results obtained by the Ornish Program were based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet but physical exercise , stress management techniques including meditation and yoga , and psychological encouragement from regular support group sessions . <p> If this begins to strike you as one of those wag-the-dog concepts , where you are the dog and the Program is doing the wagging , you 're not alone . The Program is one of those total commitments , such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Scientology , that can become the primary focus of your energies and allegiances and essentially take over your life in the name of your own best interests . How many of us are ready for that , even those of us who could seriously benefit ? Realistically , not many . That takes care of our first if , the sticking-with-it if . <p> The second if is , " if you 're average . " And that 's the other problem : none of us are . We are each of us a unique constellation of biological variables . The Program will not work for all of us in the same way , or for the same reasons , or with the same results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exercise , stress reduction and emotional support . What if you remove the support element ? Does it still work ? Because some of us are no good in or with groups . Others of us fail to get much stress relief from yoga or meditation . How will they fare under the Program ? <p> I suspect that some Program devotees will lose the specified 24 pounds in the first year , but that others will lose just 5 pounds and still others will lose 36 and there will be no adequate explanation for the variance , other than that different human bodies respond to stimuli in different ways and to different degrees . Do n't  get me wrong : I think that the Ornish Program will benefit anybody who can embrace it and maintain a long-term enthusiasm for it . For the rest of us , the most effective weight-loss diet is whichever diet we can and will actually adhere to . <p> And one more thing : even the healthiest diet imaginable wont solve your weight problem if it is the result of factors other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such contributing factors when it comes to obesity , as demonstrated by SHAMELESS PLUG ALERT ! my e-book " 115 Reasons Why Its Not Your Fault If Youre Fat . " My semi-educated guess is that health-threatening gross overweight will turn out to be like cancer : each case is unique , idiosyncratic , and specific to the individual . The Ornish Program , as commendable as it is , wo n't work for everybody . Because nothing does . <h> 39 Responses to " The Problem With the Dean Ornish Diet " <p> My cousin by marriage had two heart attacks many years ago in his early 60s , and he was left unable to cross a street without being short of breath ! By the luck of fate living in San Francisco , he found Dean Ornish and went on his full program .

My reasoning is this , if the Program can reverse heart disease , it can prevent heart disease . <p> This " strict " diet is for people who have decided they would rather eat to live than live to eat . It is for those who have decided that feeling good is worth the " sacrifice " so as not experience chest pain anymore . It is for those who prefer not to be in a wheel chair at 70 years of age because they 've had a stroke or heart attack . Each of us has to decide what it is worth personally to have optimal health , both physically and financially . My 64 year old sister is living with a bucketful of health problems and expense brought on by decades of smoking and alcohol abuse its not a pretty pictureI do not want to be her . <p> Its odd to say that its not possible for people to follow the diet when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of this authors e-book , is it surprising ? Look at the average person , who eats loads of processed crap and does no exercise . Is it really true that its not their fault then if they 're overweight ? So what is the explanation genes ? Given that genetic shifts in a population take on the order of hundreds of generations , not two or three , how would the author explain the explosion in obesity since the 1980s in this country ? <p> Maybe what we need , as a culture , is a little emphasis on personal responsibility . It may be comforting to think that obesity and heart disease are things which being inflicted upon us , but the truth is that were inflicting those conditions upon ourselves with our daily choices . <p> Also , Caldwell Esselstyns research included the same dietary modification as the Ornish regime but did not include the social support or relaxation techniques , and he still saw similar regression of heart disease . Its the diet , apparently , which produces the effect . <p> Just like any diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guidelines ; therefore , yes , that absolutely is necessary , but to call it " the problem with the Ornish diet " is misleading as there 's not a single diet out there that you cant say the exact same thing about . I would never try this diet , but my vegetarian sister thinks its perfect . <p> Let your program / e-book be noticed on its own merit by RESULTS , not by bashing someone elses successful program ; because , if your product truly is valuable , you will not need to bash anyone elses product . Not only are you not helping your own product out , you are actually doing it a disservice . Do n't  tell us what is WRONG with someone elses product , tell us what is RIGHT with yours !

" THAT is definitely an opinion not truth . The main thrust of this article bashing the plant-based diet is that many people do not have the self-discipline to do so . Howeverthere are MANY people who have children , spouses , friends and parents who would love to live longer . <p> If you already have high cholesterol , high glucose and other unhealthy markers , then the plant-based diet is NOT a diet to have for " fun , " it is to stay alive and to , hopefully , extend your life .

Those who understand the mechanism of how and why these diets ( which , to me , are basically Third World diets ) they just eat the fruits , veggies , grains , and legumes they have on hand will be surprised how simplicity is healthy . ( Its also cheaper than a normal Western diet unless you eat total cheap junk food . ) <p> NO ONE HAS TO FOLLOW THIS DIET . It is a recommendation with research behind it .

Thanks . : ) <p> Its very hard to stay on any diet . I know a lot of people who have tried to eat on the well known low cal diets and everyone has failed in the short term or long term . I had a TIA ( mini stroke ) and so far I 'm totally committed to the Ornish approach . <p> After 5 weeks its like they say ; I 'm starting to really enjoy eating this way . My taste buds have changed . People think it is harder to do than it really is , give it three weeks and see how you feel then . <p> My appetite has just naturally gone down and I 'm losing weight without thinking about it . <p> As long as I do n't  go back and get hooked on the high fat high sugar junk I used to eat I 'll be successful . <p> One of the hardest things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to stay healthy . A few years ago I embraced a fat free plant only diet . Was it a journey , yes , but a very pleasant one . Once I realised I was addicted to salt , sugar and fat , I did the same that I did to stop smoking . I went cold turkey . Then I started to realise how bad processed foods , and animal fats made me feel . Now I realise how little compassion I had when I used to believe that we have to kill animals for nutrition . And , if you care about such things , my carbon footprint has been dramatically reduced . By products of taking the simple step of just eating plants . If you can give up smoking , you can give up animal products , and reap the benefits . <p> Having recently been a 2 week guest at the Pritikin clinic in Miami , I was able to stop 4 antihypertensive drugs , one antidepressant , and one anti-cholesterol drug , a total of 6 in all . Their program predates Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very LOW SALT . Interested parties should Google " Nathan Pritikin " and learn about his WW2 experience . What is not generally known is that Mr Pritikin , who was not a doctor but should have won the Nobel Prize in Medicine , got his inspiration from studying the medical histories of Dutch prisoners in Nazi prison camps . Contrary to the expected adverse health effects that the Nuremberg Lawyers sent him to get , he found a subgroup of obese , hypertensive , and cardiac patients who recovered on the " starvation " diet of potato peelings , beet tops , carrot tops , fish head soup , low salt , and other discarded vegetable " scraps " . All the " good " food ; meat , sugar , butter , wheat , and fat was saved for the troops . No one paid him the attention he deserved because he was n't in the " club " but he reversed his own coronary disease , thus providing the late comers like Dr Ornish with original proof . Not to take away anything from Dr Ornishs excellent program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean Ornishs website , there are several options . One of these is the heart disease reversal regimen which is essentially vegan . To suggest that this is the only option asserted by Dr. Ornish is incorrect . What is offered is better food choices and education on the importance of diet . We know that genes are turned on and off by lifestyle changes ; epigenetics is the name of this emerging field of science . <p> My sister recently reversed her Type 2 diabetes through diet alone and no longer requires insulin . Given that diabetes sufferers are 4 x more likely to develop heart disease and will likely suffer kidney failure , bringing ones blood sugar under control represents a major health improvement in health outcomes for her . <p> My husband has recently started on the heart reversal diet and no longer requires blood pressure medication or chlosterol lowering drugs . One of the side effects of statin drugs is chronic skin irritation and itching . He feels better and does not have drug side effects to contend with . For him , a lifestyle change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality of life . <p> My family suffers from heart disease , stroke and diabetes . My husband and I have eaten a lower chlosterol heart smart diet for years so Dr. Ornish is not so radical . I still intend to eat the occasional hamburger but that is not what I eat every day . My husband &amp; I both look and feel great . <p> It all comes down to choice and education . One can as easily choose a tomato sauce over a cream sauce , poached over deep fried , prime rib or a leaner NY striploin . <p> DrGourmet.com also offers many excellent heart smart and GERDS recipes . I recall seeing him interviewed . He said that most families have about 12 favorite recipes that they use . If he could give a family , 12 recipes that were easy to prepare , tasted good and that everyone in the family liked , he could materially improve the health of that family . <p> His main focus started off with trying to help his patients reverse heart disease . Many researchers , main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating a clean diet , unrefined , and nutritionally dense is having wonderful results with diseases the basis of which is inflammation in many many cases . The majority of diseases that we see now are a result of poor lifestyle choices . If you are eating for health your weight will probably eventually normalize . If you live in SF or are going there eat at Millenium Restaurant ( high end vegan w/recipe books available or Greens down by the bay ( vegetarian and recipe book available ) One does well to be informed and not render opinions . There are some opinions in this piece . Other options for expanding your knowledge base would be Joel Fuhrman , The China Study , Forks Over Knives , Neal Bernard , and JJ Virgin for starts . <p> We all make choices ; my cholesterol went from 365 to e 265 in 30 days on the Ornish vegan diet- I can either eat Kentucky Fried-all the skin- all the time andrjs and Croissants dipped in butter as ai used to and die of a heat attack- or clean pu my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now used to the Ornish I simply must eat this way to live . Period and I am quite used to it . <p> I started the Ornish diet fairly recently . My cholesterol was through the roof , I was starting to get chest pains , and I had to do something . I asked my primary and a few other doctors and nutritionists I know . They all said Atkins and paleo/keto were gimmicky , and not solid from a medical or scientific viewpoint . They said Ornish was medically fine , but almost impossible to stick to so they never recommended it . <p> Ive been on Ornish for a few months , and its insanely DIFFICULT . You have to cook almost all of your own food its amazing the first time you go shopping for something that 's low fat and low sugar , and cant find any processed items in a 100,000 sq ft supermarket . Eating out at restaurants is almost impossible . <p> That said , I 'm down 40 pounds in 3 months , and my cholesterol is dropping like a rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do yoga and meditation so my stress level is almost zero and I sleep like a baby for the first time since I was in my twenties . So if you have the discipline , go for it ! <p> I find it really sad that the person who wrote the article about dr ornish is quiet narrow minded , I have been going to Na and aa for almost 10 years , and am studying to be a naturopathic nutritionist it is about healthy choices , weather I choose to live or die , everyone with an ounce of common knows that eating a balanced healthy diet reduces health problems , and restores health so pat on the back to anyone who has made even the smallest changes in there life from little steps <p> The author is misunderstanding how " average " is used in this context . The Ornish diet works for just about anyone who is medically average , that is , no special diet restrictions . If you have multiple allergies , or specific medical guidelines such as super high protein , then this diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however that this is difficult . I only went on the Ornish diet because my doctor wanted to put me on Lipitor since my cholesterol was so high . He did n't  think lifestyle changes would work , but I did n't  want to be on the hook to the pharmaceutical companies for the rest of my life , because once you start Lipitor , you never stop . My cholesterol dropped like a stone and has stayed low the last 6 years , but its difficult staying on the diet especially if you eat out . <p> The Ornish Diet for Reducing Heart Disease is pretty strict , but worth it if you want to live , not die . However , the Ornish Spectrum is much more mainstream and is for anyone wanting to improve their health and prevent disease , not necesarily recover from a heart attack . In the Spectrum , you see where you are on the various spectrums and try to make small improvements . It is very easy and very rewarding . The author of the article should actually try it , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately , physically and psychologically . <p> I had a heart attack two years ago . Had two stents put in , which did away with chest pains until I went back to work a month later . Then chest pains began again . Very discouraging , to put it mildly . A friend gave me Dean Ornishs book , and I immediately began eating a low fat vegan diet and exercising every day . The chest pains went away , and over time my cholesterol level dropped to 77 ( with a very low LDL count of 29 ) , blood pressure dropped dramatically , weight dropped by 30 pounds , and now , two years down the road , I feel the best I 've felt in years . <p> The Ornish diet was VERY easy for me to adopt , in part because the alternative would have meant ongoing discomfort with chest pains . Once I got used to eating a veggie diet , it became very easy to sustain I enjoy eating now more than ever I eat as much as I want of whatever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Easy as pie ! It is NOT hard once one commits to it . I only wish I 'd done it sooner . The criticisms in the article here are not well directed or supported . Eat a plant based diet you 'll feel better , and the cows will thank you ! <p> It seems strict but I have been doing it for 12 days and I have lost 5 pounds . You can lose more than 24 pounds easily on this program by also keeping track of your calories and keeping them at whatever 2 lb/week calorie intake works for your height/weight. ( note : I am just following the eating guidelines- not all the stress reduction stuff . I have " exercised " a total of 60 minutes in the 12 days- which was light walking ) <p> The best part , though , has been that I feel amazing . I feel- after just these 12 days- more energetic , calmer , etc . <p> What someone said about finding 12 or so meals that your family likes is right . I am just making meals that everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little tweaking . My family did n't  even notice the switch from white bread , pasta , rice to whole wheat ! <p> AND I have not had a single craving . I keep a bowl of candy in my office and usually grab a few pieces here and there throughout the day . Havent touched it . My dh has had donuts and chocolate chip cookies and chips , etc in the house and I have n't even been tempted . I have an orange and a small piece of dark chocolate in the evening and I happy with it . <p> All the people I know who criticize healthy diets like the one Dean Ornish promotes are just trying to justify their love for fries and cheeseburgers . That stuff will kill you for sure . A lot like climate denial . Lots of whining about not being practical because people wo n't or cant stick to that kind of diet blah blah . Its really not that hard . Stop whining and eat good food . <p> Mike Striff hm , no . I am 119 pounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables , fish , nuts , and yes meat . There are many in-between of Ornish and fries and cheeseburgers . <p> I lost weight from 134 pounds by simply cutting calories a little and increasing exercise . It works very well too and I can actually enjoy my food . There is zero evidence that Ornish is healthier than say Mideterranean or really any diet in which you eat varied food with plenty of fruit and vegetables , limit desserts , avoid partially hydrogenated oils and exercise . <p> The Mediterranean diet originated in the Lyons Study , which had participants eat either a typical western diet ( more meat and saturated fats ) or a " Mediterranean Diet " Emphasizing fruits , vegetables , lean meats , lower salt , etc . So the folks eating the Mediterranean diet had better health outcomes than those eating a standard western diet , HOWEVER , ONE QUARTER of those eating a Mediterranean diet had a cardiac event of some kind during the two year duration of the study . <p> A diet giving a 25% failure rate can hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diet like the Ornish one , where people literally REVERSE heart disease ( as I can testify , see my earlier post ) . A low fat vegan ( plant based ) diet is the ONLY thing which has been shown to reverse cardiovascular disease . Nothing else does it . Sticking to such a diet can make you " heart attack proof " , as it lowers blood pressure , blood cholesterol , lipid counts , and dietary fats generally . That 's why I eat that way along with the fact that I enjoy it ! <p> The facts on this are clear . Not everyone will want to eat an Ornish diet , and that 's their business . But it ca n't reasonably be claimed that it is no better than other diets . For anyone with heart ( or many other ) issues , nothing beats a low fat plant based diet . Simple as that . <p> 10 years ago , I was suffering from high blood pressure . My marker ( cholesterol , sugar ) were on the right side of the border , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I spotted the Dean Ornish book , and tried it out . I can say that I quickly lost 10 pounds , all of my blood work became perfect . My blood pressure dropped noticably , but not enough . After a year or so on the diet , which I found to be quite easy to stick to , given how well I felt on it , a major life event caused me to drop the diet . I should have been more resolute as I recently developed low level angina . Back on the diet ( who wants those drugs ? ) , this time in its strictest form , after just a month , I can not induce my angina . I have n't been to the doctor for tests yet , but I am feeling better than I have in a long time . I guess each of us has a different personality and eating style , but I can say that I find eating like this easy . The difficulty is in social situations , such as eating out or at peoples homes . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop strategies to keep myself on track . Occasionally , it just ca n't be done , when I will just do the best I can in the situation . As long as it is n't too often , it is probably healthier to bend a bit than to beat yourself up about a slip ! Going by the angina symptoms , it is working as it says on the box ! I think most critics of this idea are theorists floating their own particular boat . Try it and see how it works for you . Then decide . <p> Thinking that your diet can affect heart disease is as naive as thinking your diet can affect male pattern baldness . My brother was vegan for his entire adult life until he dropped dead of a heart attack at age 53 due to 90% blockage in three arteries . His total cholesterol was 145 . Ancel Keys asserted his diet-heart hypothesis in the 1950s without ANY evidence , and ever since everyone has just assumed that what they put in their mouth has an effect on their heart health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , but I doubt it . <p> In the same way that Eades and Taubes shamelessly crib Atkins , Ornish shamelessly cribs Keys . <p> They 're all dietary soldiers marching in the war on obesity . Now were watching the second lieutenants lead the parades instead of the generals . If you choose to march in their parades you will probably improve your healthbut be prepared to move to Italy and live there for 50 years if that 's what it takes . <p> Which brings me to Keys Eat Well and Stay Well . If people still read this they would have no need for Ornish . He brings nothing new to the party , other than trying to move it from Naples to Sausalito . <p> OK , the Ornish program is demanding , including as it does a pretty strict near-vegan diet and a number of lifestyle changes . But its received sizeable scientific study &amp; very prestigious scientific publication . Comparing it to Scientology is an injustice . <p> This Robert Wieder lad is obviously a complete imbecile . But most anyone can create a website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's what this imbecile has done . Plus , he has n't  even once answered back here to defend his absurd assertions ! ! ! Wait . . . . OMG , he must have died of a heart attack ! ! ! <p> People citing Ancel Keys as a way of dismissing Dean Ornish demonstrate that they do n't  know a lot about either one . Keys writings had some part in the development of the " Mediterranean Diet " but as I mentioned earlier , the Mediterranean Diet is a VERY different thing from the Ornish heart disease reversal diet . In the Lyons study ONE QUARTER of the people on the Mediterranean Diet had a cardiac event during the course of the study . Healthier than the Standard American Diet ( SAD ) , but hardly optimal . In contrast , Ornish has demonstrated that people following his program literally REVERSE their cardiovascular disease . <p> Again , I know this also from my own experience 3 years ago I could n't run 200 yards , and had recurring chest pains , even after stent surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) diet during these intervening 3 years , my blood pressure has normalized , disease symptoms have disappeared . No more chest pains , no more high blood pressure , cholesterol at strikingly low levels and able to exercise vigorously . Last month I ran a half marathon ! So people can go into denial , or make ill conceived comparisons to Ancel Keys , but the fact is the Ornish diet works . People trying to claim otherwise just do n't  know what they 're talking about . Ornishs studies do not exist in a vacuum , there are others such as Caldwell Esselstyn , Neil Barnard , and Michael Greger who cite similar results . A SAD diet will make you ill. a HCLF whole foods diet ( like the Ornish diet ) will not , and often leads to dramatic improvements in health . Try it and see . Its easy ! <p> Yeah , I looked at the website of " Dr. Mapipa " , and it looks somewhat less than credible . The " testimonials " all resemble the one above from Tom Miller , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Canada , the U.S. , etc. , as well as claims to cure everything from herpes to emphysema to Parkinsons to cancer , all within a matter of weeks . All this without any lifestyle or diet changes , just taking the magic herbal pills which he sells . Mmmhmm . <p> The difference between the " Dr. Mapipa " " cures " and the results seen with the Ornish program is the difference between unsupported internet claims with Mapipa versus peer reviewed , replicated studies by Ornish and others , with very clear physiological mechanisms identified which lead to the results seen ( specifically the lowering of saturated fats and cholesterol through eating a plant based diet ) . <p> It would be nice if there were a simple herbal cure for the various illnesses mentioned , working in a matter of weeks , but I 'm afraid this falls in the category of " good news about your bad habits " asserting that no actual changes are needed to address those illnesses beyond taking a magic , unspecified , herbal supplement . Unfortunately the real world does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ludicrous to compare the Ornish program to Scientology , but I have to say that when someone who is " in the program " has decided that it is their mission to " convert " you to the Ornish program to the point where they simply will not back off.we have tried it , we do n't  like it . Yes , we have made poor food choices in the past that have caused problems ( primarily eating out way too often ) and are now cooking much healthier at home . But yes , we eat meat . Yes , we have that egg yolk with our eggs . And yes , we eat bread sometimes ( gasp ) white rolls . But we now eat in moderation and count portions . I am ever so tired of those who keep trying to push the Ornish program on us a diet we tried and did not like as if it is a religious conversion , and who then tell us we are killing ourselves because we will not convert . So yep , I 'm likening it to a cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article . I really love the concept . Not everybody is fortunate enough to be born with lips like Angelina Jolie .

After days or weeks of disciplined eating even the thought of so-called bad foods makes you ravenous . And when you finally taste your forbidden fruit ( be it ice cream or chocolate or pizza ) , one bite can quickly turn into frenzied overeating . But does this deprive-and-indulge cycle have long-term consequences when it comes to your weight ? Emerging research suggests it may . <h> Teen dieters more likely to binge <p> According to research conducted at the University of Minnesota , adolescent dieters are more likely to gain weight and to report binge eating than non-dieters . This raises important questions and concerns about the implications of dieting as overweight becomes increasingly common in adolescents and adults . <p> The Minnesota study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students over a five-year period , revealed that subjects who self-reported dieting behavior in the past year gained more weight than those who initially said they had not dieted . <p> The greatest predictor of weight gain was reporting binge eating at the five-year follow-up ( binge eating involves eating a large amount of food in a short time accompanied by a feeling of loss of control ) . In the study , dieters were two to three times more likely than non-dieters to report binge eating . <p> Similar links were seen in a Harvard study that followed almost 15,000 young adolescents for three years . Compared to subjects who initially said they did not diet to control their weight , those who reported dieting up to once a week were three to five times more likely to report at least monthly binge eating .

In other words , do we see the same binge patterns among dieters who employ less radical weight control measures , for example , getting regular exercise , increasing fruit and vegetable intake or eating breakfast ? <p> In the end , experts suggest that properly run researched-based interventions are most successful in reducing weight among overweight individuals without inducing unhealthful behaviors like binge eating . <p> People who are not severely overweight should be encouraged to adopt a moderate weight-control strategy that includes physical activity and does not require severe restriction . <p> ( This article was provided by the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dietician is available to respond to questions about diet , nutrition , and cancer at the free AICR Hotline at 1 ( 800 ) 843-8114 during business hours . ) <h> One Response to " Does dieting lead to binge eating ?

If you prefer to eat a lighter lunch , get proactive and plan a small but nutrient-rich snack for a half-hour or so before your slump usually comes . Prepare this snack yourself and take it with you so you do n't  have an excuse to eat whatever junk food is available . Keep the snack to 100 or 200 calories of foods that slowly release energy , such as foods with protein , fat , or fiber . For example , pair some fruit with yogurt , nuts or whole grains .

@@97602984 @1802984/ <h> General Mills Wants No Restrictions on Advertising to Kids <p> ( CC ) navets/Flickr <h> Especially any crazy requirements that the food be nutritious <p> A shout-out to Mr. Patrick Mustain , who in a recent article for Scientific American online has provided us with a snapshot of Big Cereal with its pants down . Specifically , its a glimpse of the kind of dietary logic embraced by the likes of General Mills . That logic , if you can genuinely call it such , boils down to : " Eating mostly healthy and nutritious foods is a terrible idea that would bankrupt the country and you could n't really do it anyway . " <p> here 's the background , as provided by brother Mustain . Four years ago , Congress ordained that a task force be organized to develop advertising standards for foods marketed to children . Called the Inter-agency Working Group ( IWG ) , it was composed of heavy hitters in the field of childhood nutrition from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , the Food and Drug Administration , the Department of Agriculture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were specifically chosen for their expertise in child nutrition and general health , as well as psychology , education and marketing . <p> This being a government project , it took two years for the group to issue a definitive report . The report included a basic set of guidelines for food items advertised to children . One of the guidelines was refreshingly specific . It said that any food item marketed to kids should " contain at least 50 percent by weight one or more of the following : fruit ; vegetable ; whole grains ; fat-free or low-fat milk or yogurt ; fish ; extra lean meat or poultry ; eggs ; nuts and seeds ; or beans . " <p> When the suits at General Mills saw this list , and noted that it did not include , say , " empty , calorie-rich processed carbohydrates , " or almost anything else they sold , were aghast . They went so far as to express their dismay in a letter and extended commentary which they posted on the FTCs website , and which Mustain kindly provided a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , it declares that " 88 of the 100 most commonly consumed foods and beverages in America would fail the IWGs proposed standards . " <p> To some people , i.e. those without a bag over their head , this would indicate that 88 percent of the foods Americans are currently being provided by the industry ca n't meet basic nutritional standards . To GM , however , it indicated that the problem here lay not with the food industry but with the guidelines , whose " focus on food advertising is misplaced , and distracts badly needed attention from the declines in physical activity and other societal factors that actually are fostering the obesity crisis . " In other words , the root of our childhood obesity epidemic is anything and everything other than successfully cajoling children to eat processed food . <p> As expected , GM is particularly offended by the notion that cereal is in any way involved . Just the opposite , in fact . According to GM , packaged cereal is just about the greatest boon to our health since penicillin . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Proposals nutrition standards are such that they would ban the advertising of numerous foods that are extremely beneficial to public health and key weapons in the war against obesity " including virtually all cereals . Literally all cereals marketed by General Mills would be barred from advertising " <p> The letter refers the reader to , " the undisputed science that children who eat cereal ( including sweetened cereals ) are far less likely to be overweight ( and have far better nutrient intakes ) than children who do not eat cereal . " But this will not impress the reader who is a regular visitor to CalorieLab , and who knows that children who eat anything for breakfast experience less subsequent hunger and thus eat less the rest of the day than breakfast-skippers . They also know that the No. 1 breakfast item by far among American kids is cereal , and that " children who do not eat cereal " in most cases do not eat breakfast at all . <p> GM also reminds us why cereal is Americas most consumed breakfast item : " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . " GM considers the potentially dramatic effect of a ban on cereal ads to be a potent argument against the guidelines . Ironically , nutritionists consider it just the opposite . <p> But GMs ace in the hole argument is the one almost always trotted out by any industry to oppose reform or regulation : it would cost too much . In this case , shudders GM , " a shift by the average American to the IWG diet would conservatively increase the individuals annual food spending by $1,632 . " <p> Firstly , estimates of hypothetical financial impact are among the most easily manipulated , and you can bet this one has been . Secondly , we are not talking about the average Americans total diet , we are talking about the foods specifically advertised to kids . Count Chocula would still be on the shelves ; it just would n't be in your childrens faces when they watched cartoons on TV . Thirdly , it would be singularly easy for the cereal industry to meet the guidelines simply by increasing the whole grain content of their cereals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nutritional upgrade in the case of those cereals , and there are plenty of them , that are currently more than 50 percent sugar and other sweeteners . And finally , as noted by Mustain , $1,650 is n't so imposing a sum when you stack it up against the annual costs to the obese individual , given the associated heart , joint , diabetes and other problems , which can easily run to five times that figure . Alas , Mustain did not include in his article what for me was the most amusing line in the GM letter . Here it is . " We would respectfully urge the IWG to withdraw the Proposal immediately and return to the more narrowly defined task actually given the IWG by Congress namely , the task of studying the issue and reporting the results of such study to Congress . " <p> Youd better believe GM would prefer that the IWG quit making concrete proposals to federal government agencies , and just deliver a report to Congress . Because GM knows , as does any observant American , that leaving it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as simply burning the report . The food industrys lobbyists , a group that could fill most NBA arenas , would quickly turn the IWG report into birdcage liner . The goal would be to so bury the report in congressional " study " groups that the general public would never even hear of it . <p> Unfortunately , if all the above is news to you , theyve basically already succeeded . 
@@97602985 @1802985/ <h> " Smart " Supplements : DMAE Benefits , Side Effects and Considerations <p> Dr. Nicholas Perricone appeared on the Dr. Oz show to tout the benefits of DMAE , or dimethylaminoethanol . As a supplement , the chemical is used to treat a variety of symptoms ; DMAE also appears in skincare and anti-aging products . Dr. Perricone is a vocal proponent of DMAE , and sells several DMAE products under the Perricone MD Cosmeceuticals label . In the video below , Dr. Perricone extols the benefits of DMAE : <p> We researched the DMAE benefits , side effects and considerations to evaluate whether this " smart " supplement will help or harm consumers . <h> What is DMAE ? <p> DMAE is a liquid organic compound that 's naturally produced in the brain ; its also found in sardines , anchovies , squid and salmon . It is sold in health-food stores as a supplement that enhances brain function and mood . <p> DMAE has several industrial and commercial applications . As of 2002 , half of the DMAE producted in the United States was used to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wastewater treatment plants . Other industrial products that contain DMAE include polyurethane lacquers and foams , water-based paint and surface coating , and corrosion inhibitor formulas . <p> In pharmaceuticals , DMAE is used to treat central nervous system and brain conditions . Proponents claim that DMAE increases the brains production of acetylcholine , which affects functions such as short-term memory , learning , REM sleep and attention . However , research has n't  established an ironclad link between DMAE and acetylcholine production . DMAE study findings are often contradictory , so the supposed benefits of DMAE are quite controversial . <h> DMAE Benefits <p> The most common DMAE claim is that it improves memory , concentration and intellectual function . According to the NYU Langone Medical Center , however , there are n't  any clinical studies that support this claim . DMAE has been used successfully to treat patients with ADHD , but was deemed unsuccessful in treating patients with Alzheimers disease or Huntingtons chorea . A 1995 study found , however , that rats that were given DMAE showed improvements in working memory performance . <p> Dr. Perricone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improves energy . He also touts DMAE as a wrinkle-fighting agent that can tighten and tone skin and reduce the appearance of fine lines . A 2005 study found that consumer skincare products containing DMAE may have anti-inflammatory effects that improve skin firmness and muscle tone , but the studys authors expressed a need for further studies that compare DMAE products to antioxidant creams and alpha-hydroxy acids . <h> DMAE Side Effects and Contraindications <p> Taking too much DMAE may lead to insomnia , headaches and muscle tension , according to Dr. Perricone . Dr. Perricone states that the recommended DMAE dosage range is between 100 mg and 300 mg per day . <p> The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences warns that those who are pregnant , lactating , or have schizophrenia and clonic-tonic seizure disorders should not take DMAE supplements . <h> DMAE Considerations <p> In a blog post , Andrew Weil , M.D. was phlegmatic on the benefits of DMAE , writing , " DMAE may be safe , but I currently see no evidence that taking it will do anyone any good . " <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laval University in Quebec , who discovered that skin cells exposed to DMAE swelled up , which may explain DMAEs ability to firm skin . " This is not necessarily very dangerous , but has not been properly analyzed scientifically , " said Marceau of his findings . " I would like to see DMAE follow formal FDA rules for drug development . <p> Simon Yoo , M.D. , an assistant professor of dermatology at Northwestern University , was similarly unimpressed . " Go ahead and try DMAE products , but it wo n't do much more than a moisturizer that is a lot less expensive , " he told the Calgary Herald . " It wont be any better than Neutrogena or Cetaphil for less than a 10th of the price or a 100th of the price . " <p> I think it works wonders for my brain . No , I 'm sorry , I know it works wonders ! I just started taking 250 mg once daily a few days ago and loved it . Than , I upped it today to 2 of the 250 mg tabs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vit . B 6 and 12 along with my 36 mg of Concerta that I 've taken since high school . The only thing is that I also took a V8 energy shot that I had from a previous time because I did not want to waste it ( it does taste good ) and it gave me the jitters and a headache . Before the shot everything was fine . I do not plan on taking anymore shots and plan to continue the rest : ) It works for me ! <p> Ive taken DMAE for over a year and although it seemed to be somewhat helpful for memory and mood at the beginning , I do n't  notice that now . The real problem is that when I 've missed a dose , I 've had severe mood swings to the negative . When I was taking 200 mgs. and missed a dose , the result was like road rage . My sleep is also affected Because of this , I 'm gradually quitting . I wish research would be done on dependence and the withdrawal symptoms of DMAE <p> Thos product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beta-alanine . Gives a great focus and seems to shake up and prime the central nervous system , which is optimal for weightlifting . Not to take everyday , as a tolerance may build up . Then again , I have no background tosupport my sayings . <p> to all those saying it will decrease your lifespan , in mice it was shown to actually increase lifespans. mice are very similar to humans birds such as quail are more like reptiles. there is a reason why we do n't  test drugs for humans on birds but use mice because the effects are generally the same in both species . <p> I took DMAE in a combination with amino acids and vitamins for 8 years . It reversed all symptoms of severe fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue . I was superwoman on this stuff . The product I was taking was deleted over 6 years ago and my health ( due to mercury toxicity ) has declined so much so I had to go onto disability payments . For years I 've been trying to duplicate how I felt in that 8 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have just discovered that DMAE is also used to make adrenal hormone , along with Vitamin C and B5 which I 'm taking . I 've only been back on the DMAE for a week and the lines around my eyes are firming , my muscle tone almost immediately tightened up to form more muscle , my fibro symptoms have reduced and I 'm not reacting so intensely towards electromagnetic frequencies ( which were crippling me ) . I love DMAE . I only take 100mg a day . <p> Best research for most supplements is Ray Sahelian , M.D. He always offers his personal opinion combined with published latest research citations &amp; Q&amp;A from readers . I would also recommend 2-books by Julia Ross from her direct clinical experiences : " The Mood Cure " &amp; " The Diet Cure " . Both can be checked out from your local library . This is free info from my 50yr experience w/o sales gimmicks , spam site links , etc . All that 's required is to do your own research &amp; do n't  take anybodys word or opinion . <p> Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on dependence and the withdrawal symptoms of DMAE " . I say , I wish people would do their own research &amp; not rely on anyone doing it for them.DMAE is not a vitamin to be taken daily . DMAE is available in varying dosages . It is best to start with a low dose , such as 50 to 150 mg of actual DMAE to avoid side effects . High doses can cause anxiety , restlessness , and muscle tenseness or stiffness in the neck , jaw , and shoulders . When taken late in the day it may cause insomnia or shallow sleep . Other adverse effects on high dosages include irritability , headache , and overstimulation . Read more on sahelian-dmae . No , he s not a relative &amp; no sales . Do your own research , see a licensed naturopath , emphasis on LICENSED . <p> I 'm sorry Debra , but I 'm afraid you have another condition : Hypochondria . <p> How on earth did you get mercury poisoning , I mean did you eat a shark or swordfish daily for years and years ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided that the symptoms fit yours , or it was diagnosed by some natural healer . <p> Electromagnetic frequencies ? ? ? Boy oh boy <p> Sorry for being this rude , but I want you to help yourself . Stop thinking there is something or everything wrong with you . Start exercising , slowly but surely . Make it your mission . Join an outdoor boot camp group . Get fitter week by week and after a year you will be younger than you are now and after 2 years you will be 10 years younger . Stop worrying about little stuff . Eat organic fresh fruit and vegetables , grass fed real food if you can afford it . <p> Otherwise just eat real food- that means no wheat or pasta . Let your carbs come from rice , yams , pumpkins ( without sugar ) etc . Eat as little sugar as you can , but do n't  make life too complicated . If you feel you need a chocolate from time to time , go for it . But exercise is key , in which ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> @Jakkie : How dare you make assumptions about Debra and her health ! ! ! ! Who do you think you are ? You have no idea what her life is like ! ! ! Just because she has multiple health problems does NOT make her a hypochondriac ! ! ! You need to deal with your own life and stop judging others because someday , you could walk in their shoes ! ! Good for you that you can afford to eat organic but not everyone can . Nice of you to give her advice , but keep your judgments to yourself ! ! <p> What a shame , Jakkie , that you would judge another person so harshly ! ! My sister , who has lived a healthy , vegan lifestyle most of her 65 years , raising most of her own organic food plus maintaining a slender body mass &amp; getting proper exercising regularly , was tested for mercury poisoning several years ago , due to serious health issues . The concentration in her body was so high , the doctor was surprised that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vaccinations , as well as other sources . Its very common for an individual to suffer from multiple conditions , as one condition causes the others . The mercury poisoning , possibly , caused the crippling FM and other problems . As for the sensitivity to electromagnetic frequencies being an issue , there are 1000s of people with the same condition . Truly.you should not post such negative things on here . I hope that Debra is able to recognize your post for what it is .. pure nastiness ! <p> I 'm currently taking DMAE along with carnitine , tyrosine , and choline . I think I am getting a slightly enhanced cognitive effect from all of them and that it does help me , but overall like taking other non-stimulant nootropics the effects are not extremely powerful for me . Its interesting to read such varying effects from this supplement , the researchs conflicting opinions looks to be because people can have far different effects from taking it . Seems like it is just one of those things you need to try for yourself and see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from puritan pride a month ago when I became to the point of having memory loss and cognition problems . I am 45 years old and already was having symptoms of alzhemiers . I would cry that I could n't understand the movie plots or how I could n't understand my husband . I started asking repeated questions that annoyed all my friends . So my husband despartly researched this supplement . <p> So I have taken it for three weeks total during the past two months on and off . My memory came back so good that it was like I was back at that specific memory . When I would read I could understand and kept the information I learned . I could organize my life and I started to regain my life I have n't had since I was 23 . So much of my past I had forgotten like amnesia . Slices of times and events came back do clearly that I felt by closing my eyes I was there again at age 5 or 12 or 32it was amazing . I had to take anti depressant with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life so to cope with the blockages in my brain that had occurred I could handle it . I did n't  just remember my vivid traumas but I feel released finally by them as the memory came back then I dealt with it by talking it out and with the antidepressant could go through it . <p> The DMAE has given me a chance to Get better grades . In the past four years I have been studying and I was barely passing . I could n't understand the instructors directions nor could I pass the tests . I had to retake classes and I was on the same antidepressant as I am now . So that was n't a factor . I just felt so slow in thinking and that I could n't concentrate . After taking the DMAE for the past two months I finally could think . I have gotten As in all my projects . Its really God sent . <p> Anyone out there who feels that they need a cognition or concentration boost this is the cure . I take it every day and then stop for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it everyday as the flood of memories is too much for me so I give myself a break in between . <p> Ive been using dmae for about one month . Yes I have seen the difference in my skin . I 'm a 57 year old woman and i was having loose skin and now is a little firmer than before . I have not notice the brain enhancement part because my brain always sharp as well as my memory . I combined this with q10 , lcarnitine and n acetyl . <p> why do some of you ask questions on this you should be asking your doctor . DMAE does n't  do anything at all . I 've taken it and I have not taken it along with a slew of other trials . When testing something do n't  EXPECT anything to happen Bc then it will . psychosomatic responses on the heavy here . if you wan na focus take amphetamine salts . <p> @Jackie , if you have had appallingly careless removal of dental fillings , and then become very i 'll , in numerous ways , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercury poisoning , as it is well documented as a phenomenon It is also not hard to find ways of dealing with it The hard part is the years that follow as you do deal with it , struggling with illness after illness while working and living . I 'm sure you will be glad to know that I am over 75% recovered now and still improving . Now , stop judging what you have not experienced , and go and get youself better informed . You will doubtless be shocked at how corporations and institutions play fast and loose with our health. , for their own profit . <p> I started taking dmae after chemo for 6 months , wrecked Harvick on my memory and cognitive , I started remembering everything , then talked to my cancer doctor and he said something to do with breast cancer it would not be good to continue so I stopped . I do n't  remember what he said been so many years does anyone know anything about cause now having old age short term memory loss and confusion help <p> I agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment , is not a good idea . Why not just eat more salmon , tuna and shellfish . Also , these foods are rich in Omegas which is the carrier oil for DMAE . I cant see this supplement going anywhere without Omega . So why waste your money . However I do use DMAE in my own skincare recipes . And while I do n't  believe the molecular structure of DMAE is small enough to penetrate the dermis thus reaching the muscle , mixed in with omega , I do find that it does tighten the area around my eyes and has strengthened my eyelashes . Of course without scientific evidence , this ca n't be proved to work and the changes are subtle . I 'll give anything a go . But for the body , I would only take minute doses along with omega oil . Then you might really notice the benefits . <p> HI , ALL ! Just found this site and comment thread , which I find very interesting ! Thanks to everyone who put " Jakkie " in her place . I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molars exposing much more mercury filling than just the top part . Horrors ! Thank God I finally got them fixed . Hg poisoning is very real under the right ( i.e. , wrong ) circumstances . <p> ALSO , electromagnetic frequencies in the air ( EMF ) are very real , though I laughed at the idea at first . Finally started looking into the topic . EMF can really hurt your heart and brain , decreasing your functioning in subtle , sneaky ways . Get a " gauss " meter and put it in front of , say , your microwave when its on . you 'll be shocked at how the needle zooms skyward ! <p> Anyway , I 've been looking into DMAE tonight as Dr. Sullivan , a well-known heart MD , included it on his list of highly-recommended heart supplements . Still do n't  know if I will try it , but its looking more likely than not at this point . Cheers from Seattle . <p> I 'm not an MD but I 've really looked into the mechanics of this class of compounds . <p> DMAE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes in the body and the brain . Do n't  toy with this stuff and probably should not be taken except as a purge for the body and brain and mind . I do n't  think it helps you focus , just pushes the cloudiness away similar to indole ring alkaloids and other neurotransmitter enhancers . It is probably the acetylene vapors created in the body and brain similar to the shamanic experience from hallucinogens . <p> So my take on that angle is do n't  play with it because it is not a toy or for daily or long term use . Note the similar side effects or seems related to migraine and or bloat causing headaches , body aches , and other expelling from the body . Just like ephedrine or the effect you get from smoking the turpines in cannabis the effects wo n't wear of until it is exhaled , sweat , or excreted from the body somehow . A very unpleasant experience in large doses however . very effective also as an emetic . <p> But think about it , just like your hair do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or even regularly for that matter . Just what else are we putting in our bodies that we feel we need something like this to purify our brains . I know that fog will dissipate WIFI signals so do we thin it is any different with brain waves . <p> You have no right to call someone a hypochondriac . I was called that for years and finally a doctor at KU hospital did a genetic test and put me on proper medicine for my condition and it cleared up ALL my issues . 17 years I sought help and because of people with your mentality you made me feel crazy and made my life miserable . Regardless I knew something was wrong and never have up hope and now I 'm probably living a better life than you , suck it lol . <p> You have no right to call someone a hypochondriac .

You managed to say next-to-nothing about DMAE in your four-paragraph discourse ; and you said it so ineloquently too : - ( Can I remind you that the object of any review is to provide the inquiring sapient individual with relevant and pertinent information ; helpful/insightful information at the very least so that they can formulate a true verdict with their own God-endowed intellect ! ! ! : -/ <p> Okay Glenn , so what is your recommendation then ? From the collective presentation of wisdom here it seems that a dosage of 100 mg per day is not harmful , and that there are certain benefits to be gained both cosmetically and cognitively +/- 25-50 mg per day dependent on ones bodys/brains specific needs at any given time It is also notable among the reviews that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to increase its benefits But seriously , as previously asserted by other reviewers , please begin to exercise your own amazing intellect through self-researching more astutely <p> I had chronic fatigue and severe fibromyalgia combined with a severe form of arthritis that acted more like rheumatoid arthritis but was classified as osteo arthritis . My family physician kept screaming at me to quit taking so dayum many vitamins . She was seriously wrong . I was deficient in several vitamins . A low thiamine level which if it had been corrected soon enough could have kept me from two episodes in the cardiac cath lab . I had wet beriberi . Because my thiamine levels were 1/10th of a percent in the " normal range " they said nothing to me . I should have demanded my lab results . <p> I was also so severely deficient in vitamin D that my beautiful teeth simply crumbled in my head I asked my doctor why did I have these rings at the base of my teeth and why were they were turning translucent ? She though calculus buildup and recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I knew I did n't  because I always took care of my teeth . The dentist asked me if I was on chemo . Only then did they catch that it was a serious D deficiency . Literally such a D deficiency has been linked to bone cancer ! The doctors know to prescribe D3 but the pharmacists wind up dispensing D2 in those little green oil caps which is very poorly absorbed and only mask the deficiency for a short time period . Many pharmacists do n't  know to check if they are dispensing D2 or D3 . The big pharma companies send them D2 even if they are requesting D3 . <p> Finally I got someone to listen after I lost my teeth . M mercury levels were soaring . Not sure if it was the lousy water we used to have in Saint Paul . I also had soaring lead and arsenic levels . I lived near the National Guard Armory . Shortly after 9/11 I could literally feel exactly where the defense radar patterns were located . The pain was excruciating because of the fibromyalgia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on for every long term severe pain sufferer looked at me like I was nuts when I told him I could feel strong electro magnetic fields which were making me feel increased pain . He finally found others who also were complaining of the same thing and laid off on his nutso concerns . <p> I have the fibromyalgia under control with proper nutrition and exercise . Chronic Fatigue recovery occurs slowly after 5 years and I have to make sure I sleep well each night even if it means I take melatonin to get to sleep . I get migraines really bad but I also have repeat whiplash injuries and stiff head and neck muscle problems for which I still have to get treatment for today . I am off the narcotics for pain . Nutrition is the best answer combined with proper sleep and rest . <p> I want to take DMAE for nicer skin and better mental focus but have concerns about increased muscle spasms and migraines . Is anyone taking this supplement ( 350 mg or less ) that has issues with increased ( severity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our health concern except our own selves . I worked in various disciplines of medicine from the time I was a teen until my retirement . <p> I have never seen a more incompetent bunch of new grads as new physicians placed in positions of authority that are doing more harm than good as I have in the past decade and a half . People know what they are experiencing irregardless of what a physician might say . If it is not in a doctors repertoire of experience the person must be nuts . My dear friend was diagnosed with Munchausens and also labeled as a hypochondriac . She suffered horribly as the inflammation in her body ravaged her health and doctors tried to ignore her pleas for pain relief . She needed to be on disability and the doctors made it extremely hard for her . If it was n't for her parents she would have lost everything . Finally they did some biopsies . She has congenital liver and lung disease and needs a liver transplant . She has about 2 years to live if all goes well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are doing for her liver to keep her alive may very well destroy her kidneys . <p> NEVER call anyone a hypochondriac ! ! ! NEVER EVER ! So many Morgellons sufferers are being called hypochondriac but their suffering is very real . The vast number of people with Morgellons around the globe unrelated and unknowing of one another did n't  all decided to have the same psychiatric symptoms at the same time . Just because a disease process has not been researched and verified does n't  mean it does n't  exist . It is the same as how drugs affect different people in different manners . Much of how a drug affects a person depends upon the shape of the cell receptor sites , some people have different shaped receptors . This is why alcohol affects a few people in different ways . They may not be a majority of the populace but they do exist and it is more common than most folks want to believe .

I had this image in my teenage mind of a very muscular man with 24-inch arms taking the Olympic gold in the vertical press . <p> Such is the silliness of our teenage brains , and yet a study done by Dayton University professor of exercise physiology Paul Vanderburgh has proved that size indeed does matter with strength exercises , and its not what you think ! <p> " Were a combination of levers ; that 's how we move , " Vanderburgh said . " Generally speaking , the longer the limb , the more of a disadvantage in being able to do a pull-up . " <p> You see , if you compare a smaller athlete to a larger one who has the same build but is 30 percent bigger , the bigger athlete will be only about 20 percent stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smaller is better ! <p> This iconoclastic conclusion came to be because Professor Vanderburgh decided to determine the effect of a combined strength and aerobic conditioning program on the ability of college-age women to perform the pull-up exercise and to identify the characteristics of women who were successful in performing this exercise . <p> The pull-up has traditionally been a standard tool for measuring the strength and endurance of the arm and shoulder girdle in men ; however , whether this caries over to women was in question . <p> To determine how accurate a pull-up is in demonstrating fitness , researchers from the University of Dayton recruited 17 normal-weight-by-BMI women who were unable to perform a pull-up . Over three months , the women performed exercises that would strengthen the muscles that are needed to do this exercise .

By " negatively , " we mean refusing to buy the healthy items , or throwing them away uneaten . Since the U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to institute a set of healthy school meal regulations similar to Chicagos nationwide , finding ways to make the student response more positive would seem to be of a high priority . Fortunately , people are at work on this challenge.For example , the Tribune article took note of Brian Wansinks Smarter Lunchrooms project at Cornell , and a number of ploys that he has found can be used to make healthy food choices more attractive to the kids .

@@97602991 @1802991/ <p> Convincing the typical American consumer to buy healthier food , specifically fruits and vegetables , has become one of the prime challenges of our time . Federal and other governmental programs to educate or persuade the public in that direction have not had any significant success , partly because the American consumer is skeptical about obvious attempts to educate or persuade him or her . Perhaps its time to be more cagey and low-key . Perhaps its time to try some consumer psychology , and to do so in the very belly of the beast : the American supermarket . <p> Psychology is a huge element in the interior layout of any major supermarket . Our habits , tendencies and reveals as shoppers have been exhaustively studied and catalogued by the industry , and have produced certain bits of consumer gospel . For example , we tend to circuit through the market in a counterclockwise direction , and buy more items from shelves on our left than on our right , and are most drawn to items placed in the middle of the aisle at eye level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There 's no reason that some of our time- and study-tested characteristics as supermarket shoppers couldnt be engaged to encourage the purchasing of fruits and veggies . Here are a few possibilities . <p> Do n't  confine produce to the produce section . The marketing principle of " repetitive exposure " holds that if you place a given product in more than one location in the store , more people will buy it . This is n't practical with your more perishable produce items or those requiring refrigeration , but that still leaves plenty of possibilities . A free standing bin of cantaloupes or other melons in the cereal aisle or adjacent to the bacon or pancake mixes could trigger the well-rounded-breakfast reflex in people who would not ordinarily gravitate to the produce section when buying morning meal items . Bear in mind that the power of suggestion is considerable in the supermarket , where some 60 percent of purchases are of the unplanned , impulse variety . <p> Take advantage of the sweet spots . Two of the hottest locations in the store in terms of churning out revenue are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter could be a good place to put a cooler chest stocked with assorted berries or tropical fruits , as a play to the same sweet tooth that all those gums and candy bars go after . Also , items displayed near the entrance to the store are invariably strong sellers . <p> Locate the produce section to the right of the entrance . That 's because most of us begin our supermarket shopping by heading in that direction . However , if that is too impractical or laborious an undertaking , just put large mats on the floor at the store entrance with big , conspicuous arrows pointing toward the produce section . They tried this in El Paso and found that 90 percent of the shoppers started off in that direction , even when the arrows pointed to the left . <p> Trick out the shopping carts . Various researchers have run experiments with supermarket carts and layouts to see which ploys seem to result in increased produce purchases , and some of their findings have been quite intriguing . Situating a mirror in the front inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself in it seems to increase his or her inclination to buy healthier fare , perhaps by breaking the " supermarket spell " of relentless product placement and promotion . In another study , shoppers were handed fliers requesting that they place all fruits and vegetables in the front half of the cart ; simply putting that focus on produce more than doubled the average produce expenditure per customer . <p> Take advantage of the herd instinct . We tend to buy products which are best sellers or the most popular , fruit , and veggies included . The El Paso researchers found that just hanging placards in the carts noting how many produce items shoppers were buying on average , and which items were the most popular , boosted overall produce sales by ten percent . <p> But do n't  be heavy-handed about it . The idea is to gently and subtly nudge the shopper toward the produce section , not to hector or ride herd . When researchers combined both the directional floor arrows and the hanging placards , produce sales actually slackened off . Shoppers can instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( annoying ) . <p> Of course , all of these lovely ideas are worthless unless someone puts them into operation in the brick-and-mortar supermarket world . And why would the people in charge bother to go to that much trouble ? Well , for the same reason that the people in charge do most things : increased profits . The fact is that the produce section is one of the most lucrative areas in the store , thanks to the significant margin between wholesale cost and retail pricing . Your grocer gets to keep considerably more of 5 bucks spent on beets or corn or lettuce than he or she gets to keep from $5 spent on frozen entrees or canned goods , which is why grocers warmly welcome vegetarians . <p> Feel free to print this out and pass it on to the manager of your favorite food emporium. 3781 @qwx863781

But is it true ? I see it as a vastly oversimplified response to an incredibly complex issue . <p> In all fairness to the health professionals who advocate this approach to weight loss , it is the easiest and quickest way to provide a response to the question of how to lose weight .

You can choose to reduce your calorie intake to be lower than your total energy needs without exercise or create an energy deficit with exercise and calorie reduction . <h> 2 . Is it better to lose weight with exercise ? <p> Exercise in combination with calorie reduction is always the better choice whenever possible . The benefits of exercise for improved health and wellness go far beyond the potential benefit of faster weight loss . <h> 3 . Is it possible to exercise and not lose weight ? <p> Yes , absolutely .

There are many other reasons why exercise may not result in any weight loss . <h> 4 . Can you eat less and not lose weight ? <p> Yes ! It comes back to the question of calories . It is possible to eat less food in terms of volume but still be eating too many calories . This is easy to do if you choose calorie-dense foods ( high-calorie foods ) such as those that are rich in sweets and/or fats . On the other hand , it is possible to reduce your calorie intake too far . If you neglect to eat enough calories to meet basic energy needs , you could slow down your metabolism . You may be eating fewer total calories but your body needs less to survive . This is something to avoid ! <h> 5 .

The general guide for men is a minimum intake of 1,500 to 1,600 calories a day . However , what you may not realize is that these values are based in part on basal metabolic needs . If you weigh significantly more than the recommended weight for your age and sex , your minimal caloric needs will likely be higher .

It seems that as few as 31percent of Americans understand this concept ( International Food Information Council , 2007 ) . <p> In addition , the idea of losing weight simply by choosing certain foods over other foods and keeping calorie intake constant is tempting . Certain food components actually do cause a small increase in metabolic rate in the same manner as the ingredients of some weight-loss supplements . An increase in metabolic rate will burn more calories . However , having said that , the degree to which metabolism can be increased and the safety of doing this go beyond the scope of this article .

Simply cutting calories to cut weight is not enough to maintain a good , healthy way of life . What does it matter if your BMI is optimal but your blood pressure is 130/90 and your resting pulse is 85 ? <p> And as for veggie recipes in my experience the most satisfying ones are those which do n't  try to use meat substitutes to emulate animal flesh . Stew and tofu do n't  mix well . Its akin to using carob to " replace " chocolate , which simply does n't  work . To make a really good vegetarian meal , the best plan is to abandon trying to make it meatish in the first place and let the flavors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more successful , and easier than you might think , too . <p> Yeah , I was thinking more of chili . And there are fake burger " crumbles " made of TVP that are rubbery and , well , not good . I ended up abandoning meat substitutes entirely for my chili and wound up with something that works extremely well . <p> I recently happened across udon with slices of baked , stir-fried tofu . Surprisingly good . <p> I do n't  see anything terribly wrong with eating like that for a day ( I 'd substitute soy milk for the cows milk ) , but readers do need more resources on how to do this for a week , a month , or even six months to get real results . Get some great recipe books ( check Amazon for the ones that are most highly rated stick the simplest ones at first ) . <p> Then again , if one sticks to a whole foods vegan diet , eats smaller amounts more often ( smaller meals , bigger snacks , grazing ) , it will be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My wife lost ten pounds after going vegan , without changing her level of activity . <p> Certainly exercise is a good thing , but if were just looking at this from the dietary aspect , then leave out all the animal products and incorporate lots of vegetables , then whole grains and fruits , with some nuts and seeds for good measure . I 'd also like to add that vegans should pay attention to B-12 intake and Omega 3s . Nothing to stress out about , but certainly nutrients that one should be conscientious about consuming . <p> I make chili with just a can of tomatoes , a can of kidney beans , and a chopped onion , with spices . Mark Bittman in his cook book calls this " chili non carne . " It tastes fine . I make it as an emergency lunch out of staples I have laying around , when there 's no other food in the house . <p> I do n't  appreciate such ( false ) statements about vegetarian diets as this : " because they are n't  nutritionally balanced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about eating vegetarian . You 're basically saying that it does n't  work for most people because its " restrictive , " but if you 're going to do it anyway , here are some things you could eat . And then you give a nutrient and calorie deficient meal plan . <p> I agree with the first poster ( Warren ) this is n't a fair representation of a healthy and satisfying vegetarian diet ( which I know personally to have many health benefits ) . Why do n't  you try being vegetarian for a few years before you write an article about it ? <p> Hey , I always use carob to replace chocolate , and I find it usually works well . I just ate some carob-mint ice cream in soy ice cream , and it was nummy ! <p> Why not suggest a healthy alternative vegetarian diet plan ?

It does n't  look bad at all to me now . I think the recipe has been edited <p> anyway , I thought I 'd mention that in the past year I tried a raw food ( vegan ) diet for awhile , and I lost weight without trying It took a couple weeks for my digestion to get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much everything that I could , but simply could n't maintain weight . One thing I 'd recommend if you go that route , well-read up on it in general , but also do n't  forget to eat some salt . Its an essential nutrient afterall. especially if you have low blood pressure . <p> I 'm not even close to eating 100% raw anymore , mostly because I 'm too lazy . it is pretty fun preparing raw food , but be careful and read up on what you need to do to stay healthy if you 're going to try it for the long term . eating a healthy vegan diet is pretty easy to do , but a raw diet is on a whole other level . <p> whether you are raw or simply vegan , you need to make sure you have a vitamin B12 supplement . Its also a good idea to take a DHA supplement if you do n't  eat fish ( wikipedia it and youll see that 's it an essential fatty acid ) . <p> i 'm a recent vegetarian , and ive been looking around for meal ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little variation could easily be turned into a daily routine . i eat the same breakfast anyways , and for a snack i usually have yogurt or a peanut butter sandwich . <p> I need meal plans for many days running , written be a vegetarian registered dietician . This seems to be written be a non-vrgetarian . What does she know ? She does n't  seem to be concerned with nutrition , just weight loss . And we cant stick to this iet every day , for goodness sakes ! We love and need to eat a variety of yummy , healthy food , and we need to get proper nutrients , daily . <p> Ok , this whole vegetarian life style choice massive waste of life is strange and annoying to me . Human beings are omnivorous , for those who did n't  pay attention in school ( presumably the majority ) we require meat and plant matter to properly survive . so it occurs to me , why bother thinking up a complex dietary plan jumping through hoops to avoid meat entirely , why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbs. , calories , ect. and their is no erfect diet because people metabolisms/daily lives are different , so throughout the day try to cover all you basic food groups , which are MEATS , grains , vegies , fruits , OILS , and dairy . as for weight loss , its already been said , " # Alice Says : September 25th , 2008 at 10:16 am <p> I have an amazing diet plan that actually works !

Signed , A perfectly healthy 110lbs omnivore about to go eat a burger . <p> Karbon , I really do n't  understand why you are on this site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are many health benefits to a healthy , balanced vegetarian diet . First , soy products contain isoflavones , which lower cholesterol , decrease the risk of blood clots , and diminish bone loss . That means it helps protect against heart disease , stroke , and osteoporosis . Secondly , regular fruit and vegetable consumption reduces the risk of ischemic heart disease . This is because of the many flavonoids contained in fruits and vegetables . It helps reduce the amount of lipids in the blood , and basically helps with anti-inflammatory . Flavanoids also help the LDL cholesterol from oxidizing . LDL cholesterol is the bad type of cholesterol that is most likely clog blood vessels and increase your risk of heart disease . Also , studies show that legumes lower blood cholesterol levels , improve blood sugar control , and lower triglyceride levels . Basically , if a vegetarian eats a well balanced and nutritional diet with a lot of variety , then they will have more health benefits than if they were eating a " omnivorous diet " . Vegetarianism provides protection against many chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who cares if some vegetarians take a vitamin to back up nutrients they may miss , they still get them . Even though some say that people should n't be taking specialized vitamins because that means their diet is lacking , think about the vitamins on the market now . There are tons of them targeted toward different groups , i.e. womens health , mens health , people on diets , athletes , and children vitamins . About an omnivorous diet making you feel better , I must say that I have never felt this energetic until I became a vegetarian . I have an overall better mood , more energy , clearer skin , and just feel amazing . Yes , this may come with more healthy and planned out meals , but I think that not eating meat has a ton to do with it . So please , if you decide to bash vegetarianism again , have some facts to back up your beliefs . <p> Remember to be careful about yogurt . A lot of yogurts contain gelatin , which is definitely not vegetarian ! Always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought were vegetarian that rally are n't  . <p> I came across this post while looking for low-calorie vegetarian meal plans . Low-cal it is , but two things I noticed : <p> 1 ) Some low-fat yogurts , if flavored , can contain 30 grams of sugar per little carton . Better to specify low-fat plain yogurt and add your own fruit or sweetener , etc . <p> 2 ) That lunch suggestion is tough for me . I 'd eat the salad , wishing for even a teaspoon of olive oil to go with the vinegar " dressing , " and be starving an hour later ( the yogurt might help me to hold out another hour , but I do n't  want the concept of " holding out " to be a component of my lifetime eating habits ) . I think Eleshebahs lunch sounds way more reasonable . <p> I 'd like Karbon to watch a recent episode of Oprah . Dr. Oz visits the blue zones around the world .

Watch it and then do your homework ! <p> Karbon Its funny that people think the majority of vegetarians choose to be so to lose weight because they are " fat " . I became vegetarian in high school simply because I did n't  want to eat something that had flesh like me , brains like me , eyes like me etc. very much a personal choice . If a doctor told me tomorrow I needed to meat or else , I do n't  know if I could ! Being vegetarian is just part of me , not a diet to lose weight . I did n't  really lose weight until I hit the gym and got a personal trainer . You do n't  have to accept it , just tolerate it ! haha <p> Omnivores ( from Latin : omne all , everything ; vorare to devour ) are species that eat both plants and animals as their primary food source . They are opportunistic , general feeders not specifically adapted to eat and digest either meat or plant material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals . It does NOT mean they NEED both . <p> Just want to make an addition to all of your comments . If you study the dental structure of man verses the dental structure of animals , you will find that humans have the same dental structure as that of herbivores , not omnivores . Check it out . Very interesting ! Makes you wonder if we were designed to eat meat . <p> Dee : I 'm a biologist , so I have some information for you . You 're incorrect about humans having the same dental structure as herbivores . We have what are called " bunodont teeth " , which means we are omnivores . Herbivore mammals have much taller " hyposdont " teeth that can last longer when worn down by a plant-dominant diet ( source : LONG ... ) . <p> here 's an excellent article discussing the EVIDENCE relating chimpanzee diet and behavior , anthropological studies , and human fossils : LONG ... A relevant quotation from it : " The presence of primitive stone tools in the fossil record tells us that 2.5 million years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh off the bones of large animals that they had either hunted or whose carcasses they had scavenged . " <p> The bottom line is that , historically and biologically speaking , we are designed to eat both meat and plants . HOWEVER , if you 'll permit me a moment on my soapbox , because the farming of animals results in both suffering for the animals and wasteful use of dwindling natural resources , I think a thoughtful semi-vegetarian and LOW-DAIRY diet is a moral imperative for everyone on the planet . The point is to get away from the trend of specialized and large farms for either meat or dairy , because they have a significant environmental impact . If we went back to keeping chickens and a cow on family farms , the animals would be happier and the environmental impacts would be lower ( because we would live with them in a very immediate way ) . <p> here 's a very long study on the environmental impacts of dairy in the UK . The summary is that intensive farms overwhelm the local ecosystems to damage habitat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medications and hormones , and pollute groundwater .

So ovo-lacto vegetarians have something to think about as well . <p> I hope that you and many others on this message board continue to educate yourselves about this issue .

In the meantime , support your small , local farmersthey have the right idea . <p> Read The China Study best long-term study on the effects of adding any animal products at all to a human diet . Shows that the " diseases of excess " heart disease , diabetes , high blood pressure , etc , all begin to show up when ANY animal products are added to the diet the science has documented it and it is objective . So decide how you want to eat based on the facts . <p> its your choice if u would want to be a vegetarian or not and as Erika Lenz spoke about farmers hampering ecosystem using intensive farms overwhelm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage soil , increase use of fertilizers , medications and hormones , and pollute groundwater . <p> i do n't  understand her opinion , due to the research she may be true but here 's a solution for you live without electricity , close down industry , live in forest or jungle provided by nature its self , every where you go walk of run do n't  use any man made products , not even bicycles , hunt and eat animals raw .. oho nooo still you do ham pare ecosystem . <p> you talk about fertilizers , have you have ever heard about the term known as soil testing , and do you even know the growth rate of food products by using necessary amount of fertilizers after soil testing . As for your opinion growth and rapid increase in population is to be blamed . less people less pollution you think about it your self . <p> and killing animals for meat , skin what ever . most of the animals are extinct due to killing and some of will be extinct such as whale , tiger , pandas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad thing always was and will be every one suffer from killing , i understand tiger killing deer for food but i do n't  understand human beings intelligent enough killing animals for food . <p> go visit some asian countries like India and Nepal in there festival time and see how many animals do they cut down alive in the name of religion and food , and see a buffalo shedding tears as it sees his fellow kind been murdered and knows the it would have the same faith now that is the reason for me to be a vegetarian but its your choice got nothing against meat eaters. its my human compassion and my human side <p> I recently became vegetarian for the 2nd time . I did it because I am studying buddhism and one of the five precepts is No Killing . I think its strange that people like " Karbon " would even be on this web-site .

This is the concept and innovation behind the company Larks new wristband offering , Larklife . <p> Sure , there are competing products on the market , but one key thing that CEO and founder Julia Hu believes to be an important difference boils down to social pressure . As Hu explained , " The problem is that that type of motivation is actually incredibly demotivating to the 95 percent of us who are not hyper athletes . " She continued , " For us , we believe that the power of wearable health is not in its ability to just track everything about you , but rather motivate and empower you to feel great and be happier , healthier and more productive . Were taking the worlds best experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and putting them in the palm of your hand to give you personalized real-time advice .

That 's right , Lark looked to health experts in the field to share their tips and feedback to users throughout the day to provide a state-of-the-art referral system that can help people to make healthier choices and stay motivated . <p> Do you think you would follow through with the wristbands and wear them regularly to track your progress and/or patterns ?

@@97602998 @1802998/ <h> " People who are fat who do n't  overeat " <p> The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance ( NAAFA ) has been holding its annual convention in the San Francisco Bay Area . Normally , we would n't write about the NAAFA , because , frankly , its not our market . The NAAFA believes that loosing weight is inevitably a yo-yo process , and that yo-yo dieting is more damaging to your health than obesity . As a company devoted to supplying tools , information , and support to people trying to slim down , we have nothing to offer people who have given up on ever losing weight . <p> But we did want to comment on the following statement attributed by the San Francisco Chronicle to 48-year-old convention attendee Ruth Ann Thomas on the relationship of obesity and genetics : " There are a number of people who are fat who do n't  overeat . You would be amazed about how much I do n't  eat . " <p> Is it really possible that there are people who , due to genetics , are obese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  think so . Our definition of " to overeat " is to eat more fuel/energy/food , as measured in calories , than your body expends , as measured in calories . We think that Ms. Thomas is obese because , in the past , she overate in this sense . ( If her body weight is currently stable , she is still overeating in the extended sense of eating more than her body would expend at her healthy weight . ) <p> How might genetics play a role in obesity ? Genetics might create a compulsion to overeating . Genetics might make you more prone to depression , which is associated with overeating and a sedentary lifestyle . And finally , genetics might make your bodys metabolism somewhat more efficient , using fewer calories to get through the day , lowering the number of calories you can eat before you " overeat . " <p> The latter possibility above is what people like Ms. Thomas seem to latch onto : the idea that their genetic makeup makes their bodies super-efficient , able to subsist on barely any food intake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pounds . Individual metabolisms vary , and there are rare diseases that affect metabolism , but the variance is not as much as some claim . A typical woman uses 11 calories per pound per day just to lay around watching TV ; a man uses about 12 . But this can vary , and the rare woman may only require 10 calories per pound . But we do n't  know of any reports of women who can get by on only 5 calories or 1 calorie per pound ; this would be like a claim to have invented a perpetual motion machine ( pictured ) . At some point the basic laws of thermodynamics come into play . <p> Take a woman who is 5-foot , 4-inches tall and weighs 132 pounds ( BMI 23 , within healthy range ) . We can figure out how many calories she needs just to sit around ( her resting metabolism ) by multiplying her weight by 11 calories , resulting in 1,452 calories . Then we need to add additional calories expended by her additional daily activities . Using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , six hours of office work , one hour of walking in the office , one hour of cooking , and a half hour of walking the dog , we come up with 576 extra calories . So this woman needs a total of 2,028 calories per day . <p> But what if her genetics made her body extremely efficient , only requiring 10 calories per pound ? This would lower her daily calorie needs to 1,844 , a difference of 184 calories . Is this woman genetically doomed to be obese ? Well , if she continues to eat 2,028 calories a day , she will consume an extra 67,000 calories a year , gaining 19 pounds within a year , and continuing to gain weight thereafter . But she has the choice , as she notices the number on the scale rise and her clothes tighten , to not eat those 184 calories or alternatively , to get 184 extra calories of exercise . So although genetics can make it incrementally harder to maintain weight , the single factor of metabolic efficiency does not in any way condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and ended up at 220 pounds ( BMI 38 ) ? Redoing the same calorie computation and assuming the same activity level , we find she would expend 3,315 calories per day , or 3,014 calories per day if her metabolism only used 10 calories per pound . By eating this amound of food , she would maintain her weight of 220 pounds . What should this woman be eating ? On the one hand , 3,014 calories is her " maintenance " food intake , but we think that the proper amount of food should be closer to the 1,844 calories that her healthy-weight self would eat . Eating this amount of food would bring her eventually down to her healthy weight , starting at a weight loss rate of about 2 pounds per week and slowing down gradually until she hit 132 pounds . <p> For this woman , 1,844 calories per day would not be a " diet " it would be the normal amount of food she should be eating . Obviously , coming off of eating 3,014 calories a day , it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with genetics even if her genetic metabolic efficiency were normal , 3,014 is nearly 1,000 calories over what she should be eating . <p> So in the end , although there may be many contributing causes of obesity , by our definition of " overeat " all obese people overeat . Genetic influences on metabolism play a part in making it more likely someone will overeat , but the extremely limited contribution of the genetic influence should be acknowledged and genetics should not be used as an excuse to just give up . <h> 18 Responses to " " People who are fat who do n't  overeat " " <p> I 'm a little concerned that all the calculators available on the Web can be misleading . First , they can vary widely based on the assumptions of the website , and second , I 've found many that prescribe 30-40% more calories than I could possibly need . Also , it does n't  seem reasonable to treat all calories as equal when most folks feel better when they eat " enough " calories of fresh , healthy food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relief to the system . <p> I think you 're right to view caloric needs calculators with healthy suspicion they can only estimate . There is one way to figure out your calorie needs with a certain amount of precision : count calories and weigh yourself over an extended period of time . We explain it here . However , it requires too much detailed work and discipline for the average person , and is n't really necessary . <p> Whatever amount of food you eat that keeps your weight stable is the right amount ( assuming your weight is in the heathy range to begin with ) , so the bathroom scale is the best " calculator " you can use . <p> I can only guess , but I think the woman mentioned in this article meant she only eats when she is hungry . However , depending on what she 's eating its possible she wo n't feel very full and will end up eating more calories than she needs . <p> She might also be referring to the stereotype in the media that a fat person must always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fat Bastard " in " Austin Powers : The Spy Who Shagged Me " is always choking down something . Or " Fat Monica " on " Friends " was always talking about Ho-Hos or things she wanted to eat . Its supposed to be funny , but it also plays into the idea that a fat person ca n't go two minutes without stuffing something down their throat . In that sense , I think most fat people defy that stereotype and only eat when they are hungry or maybe when they 're depressed . <p> I am a NAAFA member , and the best way I can think of to answer this contention is that we generally feel that the definition of overeating laid out here is so rigid as to promote what agricultural activists condemn as " monocropping " the practice of choosing one breed of one species and cultivating this to exclusion . Americans only often have access to supersweet breeds of corn for instance , when Native Americans from the top to the bottom of the hemisphere have cultivated breeds with radically different characteristics ( one reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their current diabetes wave ) . <p> I have looked up the definition of obese in the dictionary . The etymological roots seem to read " runaway eater . " To my mind this is just about the opposite of anoxeria , a hunger signal which never is turned off . If that is the proper casting of the definition , there are people who fit this definition , but they are very rare even among the highly adipose . <p> The core contention of NAAFA , as a contributor to the Health At Every Size paradigm , is that more important than setting a unified calorie consumption level for the entire species is to encourage a combination of healthy food choices , exercises chosen with an eye toward the mechanics of the fat body , and a determination to embrace ones own body in totality and advocate others to keep an open mind to their abilities . In engineering terms , the idea is that seemingly for many fat people , it is more effective , by the above combination , to empower the body to add strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lessen the load upon it . <p> I wieght 262lbs . I count my calories which go about 1,000 to 1,500 per day . Why is it that little by little I can gain , but i never loose with calories so little ? Do i need to eat raw vegies for all meals ? This has been a problem that my family doctor can see and even he does n't  know what to do since diet pills usually rely on supressing the appetite . A thing i do n't  have . I never eat snacks . <p> It is true that you might only eat a few calories but still gain weight . This can be caused by MANY problems . The largest culprit is the thyroid . If your thyroid is n't behaving like it should , then your bodys metabolism slows down . You actually eat less and less hungry ( Due to lack of hunger or desire to eat ) but gain more and more weight ! I suggest trying this first . Have your doctor order you some blood tests and hopefully it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of metabolic tests to rule out pituitary function and hormone regulation . Are you stressed ? Check your cortisol levels , are your periods regular ? Try your estrogen levels Do n't  get discouraged there are many women out there just like you . Some people even have sensitivities or allergies to certain foods , try reducing your wheat products , or removing enrighed flour and " Simple Carbs " along with high fructose corn syrup ( its in everything ) . Do a colon cleanse . Get tested for candida yeast does n't  just grow down there ladies Another thing , if you are routinely working out and have a set regime , try rotating your exercises every 4 weeks so that your body does n't  get used to the same thing every day . ( Example : Speed walk for 4 weeks , do spin classes for another 4 , then try jogging or swimming or high impact aerobics . ) I hope some of this helps . Good luck ! <p> What it seems to me is again no answer to why do I put on weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food then I do and never have to worry about calculators and calorie counting . I have never " stuffed my face " and make healthy choices and unhealthy choices . I consume 4-5 litres of water a day have a chloestrol level of 3.7 and have no other illnesses . I am 48yrs of age and 120kgs . I do n't  want to live a life consistently checking everything I eat and feeling guilty for going out to dinner . I want to know why I cant eat the same as everyone else . That 's all I have ever wanted to know . <p> I do n't  know about these figures . I had testing done and at 210 lbs my body avearaged burning 1400 cals per day resting . That 's between 6-7 cals per pound for me . Yet U say a normal woman burns 11 cals per pound . That would be 2310 to watch tv . I easily eat under that but still gain weight . I 'm lately on a yo-yo . Got exhausted from excersising so much that I stopped and went right back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose 20 lbs , but can put it right back on within 3 months . <p> A few years ago I went from 280 to 160 in a year . Hunger has never been the problem . But I had to walk all day , everyday ! I did n't  have a job that year so I walked , walked , even walked all over the house when I was indoors . Some lean cuisines and CONSTANT movement finally paid off but how much can I continue to walk ? ! Once I had a job , it creeped right on up to 230 . <p> I 'm not sure what I can do to lose and maintain my weight except not eat at all and work out all day ? ! Lol <p> Staying under 1400 cals has done nothing unless I work out a few hours as well . Its exhausting . I wish I could do what you say . Currently you say I must eat 2,530 a day to maintain my weight . Or at the very least 2,300 a day because anything less is unheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be able to lose one pound a week by consuming 1,800 calories a day for a deficit of 3,500 cals for the week . So you 're saying I can actually eat and lose weight . Why havent I tried this 1,800 cal diet before ? ! It must be the answer . I wish ! I 'd lose more since I 'm not just sitting home , right ? <p> But ur right . I must overeatcause eating anything is overeating . There are prob lots of people like me out there who do n't  eat like pigs but still get the bad rap . One thing I like about me is that I 'm not sloppy fat . No big belly or belly rolls . Just thick all over . Just hate the chubby face . I have to lose a load of weight before my face loses weight . Drives me crazy . Thyroid checked out fine . I 'm healthy otherwise . <p> I do n't  agree with those numbers . You cant say every person who is overweight eats too much . There are some metabolic illnesses that causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be energy . Obe of those diseases is PCOS , a very common endocrine disorder that is notorious for packing pounds on women who eat healthy and exercise daily . It can cause rapid weight gain in persons who eat very healthy . Their metabolism does not operate the same as everyone else ; its impaired . Only a person who never lived with a endocrine disorder would say something so small minded . <p> For just over 6 months I have been keeping a food and fitness log . I am 5 ' 7.5 ? and I weigh 190.8 . I average 400-800 calories a day . Twice a month I have larger calories days , they never exceed 1250 ( and they rise because they are extreme work days where I am on my feet 12 hours or more , non-stop and I consume nuts which are high in calories ) . <p> I exercise daily and am always on my feet every day . I also walk for at least one hour a day . I have been living like this for years . My thyroid was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sick of hearing this nonsense . I have always eaten very little my entire life and I kept the food log to have a record of it . Everyone around me eats so much more . I also eat very healthy ; avoid processed foods , NEVER drink soda or alcohol , rarely eat any junk , stick to organic , never have fast food , etc . I was thin my entire life until I had children . I have been overweight since and the only way I ever see my weight decrease is if I fast for days . I know I am not alone . <p> You CAN gain weight and NOT overeat . I am so sick of doctors telling me to eat less , and ASSUMING I am lying about my intake . Some days all I have is some cooked mushrooms and a bowl of veggie broth which is barely 200 calorieseat less . RIDICULOUS ! <p> First of all , are you a medical DR ? I had a friend Was obese and had normal thyroid tests results . After many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her question and a large tumor was found on her thyroid with normal results on her blood testing ! <p> I also am truly not an overheated . I have worked 12 hour shifts in an ER . I am never alone except for the short pee break . The staff in the Er always commented on how little I ate . Mostly fruit and salads , without all the junk . Staying with friends and family , they finally believed me . That was really hard to be considered a liar all my life ! Even my husband is convinced that there must be some kind of physical anomaly . I asked Drs if there were other tests of illnesses that could show if anything is going on . No , no , no stop eating and exercise ! One of the ER Ds gave me a pedometer for one month . Just at work I walked between 5-6 miles a shift ( 12 hours ) . When at home did normal stuff , not flopping on the couch . Gardening , hiking , swimming several times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond . In my late forties my knees quit , and I became anxious , chronically depressed and dread having to leave my house . Now at 300lbs ! ! If anyone checked further at least I would know if it was medically or some how inadvertently was injesting something I have no Idea what . <p> If you eat 1,200 calories a day and are still gaining weight , you 're either a marvel of medical science or you 're terrible at counting calories . Have you ever seen Secret Eaters ? In every single episode , the people featured swear up and down that they NEVER eat more than 1,300 calories , exercise four times a week , and still gain weight . And every single time , the truth is that they eat 1,300 calories in between-meal snacks and *think* about exercising four times a week . Losing weight is hard . Its even harder when you lie to yourself about how many calories eat each day . <p> If only weight loss were as simple as a mathematical equation for some of usthe ones you do n't  believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had my son , who will be 30 years old this year , I was at 155 lbs and I am 510 " .

High gestational weight gain with no explanation , then could n't lose it afterwards .

Before you shake your head in disbelief , consider thisI believe 100% this condition has genetic predisposition . I have a 2 first cousins , a sister , and a half sister who have all resorted to weight loss surgery because they could n't find alternative help with their weight problems . It makes me sad and angry . I know on my heart that if I were a walking skeleton Drs would do everything they could to figure it out and help me .

If you do n't  breath deeply your inner furnace stays on smolder . <p> Seeing the comments on this article actually made me feel conflicted . On the one hand , I 'm so sad to see that so many people work themselves so hard to do the right thing and still cant get results they want .

I simply cant reconcile that with the fact that the body does n't  create fat out of thin air the thyroid does n't  get damaged and then begin to create fat cells out of nothing at all .

The first day and she arrived at noon , so I do n't  know what she ate at breakfast she had " only a baked potato " for lunch , but smothered it in more sour cream , butter , and bacon bits then there was potato , and had a bread basket with butter pretty much to herself . Later in the day , when we stopped for coffee , she ordered the equivalent of a large milkshake . I watched her absentmindedly snack on chips , crackers , bread , yogurt and fruit between meals , and then declare at dinner she could n't stand to eat , but still consumed a full meal of salmon , broccoli ( she asked for ranch dressing to add , the only way she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her daily " 1,000 " ) . I did n't  say anything , but by my estimate she ate about 3,000 calories that afternoon . Personally , I 've carried an extra forty to sixty pounds my adult life , and when I religiously use a calorie-counting program to log everything I eat even that " just a taste " of peanut butter I 'm invariably dismayed by how much more I eat than I admit even to myself . If someone locked you in a room , and gave you plates of measured food , would you gain weight ? Really ? If you try that , and ask for a monitor and cameras , you will become famous , rich and help save the world by developing a new energy source , because truly , that is currently against every law of physics we understand . Energyand fat is stored energyis not created from nothing .

In 1970 , the number was reduced to almost one full baguette . Nowadays , the people of France are eating just half a baguette a day .

@@97603002 @1803002/ <h> How to Resist The Inner Voice That Keeps Saying " Eat ! " <h> Based on your waistline , tying to ignore it does n't  work all that well <p> I recently ran across an article about a new approach to treating certain elements of schizophrenia , which struck me as possibly having some application in dealing with obesity . What , you may of course ask , does schizophrenia have to do with obesity , other than the fact that obesity is often the result of individual people eating enough for two distinct personalities ? I think what the two conditions may have in common is what clinicians call " auditory phenomena , " and the rest of us call " voices in ones head . " <p> Not all schizophrenics hear these voices , but among those who do , noted the article , " Those voices feel real , spoken by an external , commanding authority . They are often mean and violent . " But the articles author , Stanford anthropology professor T.M. Luhrmann , points out that the " mean and violent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey other , less dark and dramatic messages than the kind that wind up making the evening news . <p> For example , there is an institution called the Schizophrenia Research Foundation located in Chennai , a major city in India . One of the things that the Foundation has discovered about schizophrenics in Chennai is that they often hear far more prosaic commands from the voices in their heads . The commands frequently involve cooking or eating , a common one being , specifically , " go to the kitchen and prepare food . " <p> This curious fact suggested , at least to me , that many overweight and obese people may have a kind of schizophrenia-like condition , that they may be driven to follow the urgings , or even commands , of voices that only they can hear . But instead of telling them to set fire to an orphanage or to jump off the third deck of Dodger Stadium , their voices tell them to go ahead and have that second helping of dumplings , or to go see what 's in the refrigerator , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've burned off enough calories to entitle them to the mocha grossa grande with sprinkles . <p> I have personally never heard such voices , but I have heard actual overweight persons say things like , " It was as if the doughnuts were calling out to me . " I do n't  know just how literally they were speaking , but if there are people who are irresistibly attracted to unhealthy foods who do seem to hear such cajoling voices in their head , help may be at hand to deal with them , according to Luhrmanns article . <p> Mental health professionals have heretofore encouraged schizophrenic patients to ignore the voices they hear , the theory being that taking them seriously merely empowers them and gives them a kind of legitimacy . But something called the Hearing Voices approach has recently gained traction in Europe and is just arriving on our shores . Essentially , it proposes that if the patient responds to the voice rationally and negotiates with it , the voice can be reasoned with , mollified , or in some cases even silenced . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices ploy has helped some hearers to win over or even send their voices packing . <p> The idea seems to be to get to know the voice , converse with it , and convince it to see things from your point of view . Precisely how this might play out with people whose voices are always prodding them to eat something is unclear , but the imagination can easily concoct possible bits of inner dialog . <p> Voice : Butter just makes everything better , do n't  you think ? Hearer : All I know is that I have to spread some on my thighs in order to get into my Speedos . Voice : Oh come on . You can just move up to the next largest size . Hearer : The next largest size in my case is " Walrus . " Voice : Good heavens . <p> The Hearing Voices concept may seem harebrained , but a lot of accepted scientific truth started out seeming harebrained .

" " <p> When I worked with people who had schizophrenia , which has the predominate problem of connecting to the common shared reality , I found that if I could communicate with them about a reality that they had , they felt much more comfortable and safe and exhibited very little if any aggressive behavior .

But that was then and this is now , and there is a growing recognition that a Big Mac and a Coke symbolize everything that is wrong with the classic American meal . The fast-food and soda industries have resisted the best efforts of health professionals , dietitians and even state legislatures to make them improve their products nutritionally , but the question now is , can they resist the laws of economics ? Because they are now confronting a force they simply ca n't shrug off : The buying public . Especially when it cuts back on its buying . <h> Not-so-golden arches <p> And that , in a nutshell , is the wall that the food and beverage biggies have run into . McDonalds , for example , has taken a fiscal shellacking lately . The company just reported dismal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and earnings , as well as a 3.3 percent plunge in sales worldwide compared to last year . Earnings alone were down a stunning 30 percent , and profits were off by $450 million . <p> Mickey Ds CEO Don Thompson made to pass this downdraft off as due to " a variety of factors , " but allowed that being hammered by falling U.S. sales as its bedrock customers drift off to alternative chains that stress healthier fare , from Quiznos to Chipotle , are key to McDonalds woes . Accordingly , he is promising " to fundamentally change the way we approach our business , " which means among other things , giving individual franchisees more latitude to customize their menu offerings to cater to the taste preferences that predominate in their market . <p> In simple terms , if and when the local customer demands more organic and less deep-fried , that 's what you give them .

The first quarter of this year saw the first decline in its soda sales since 1999 ; soda sales worldwide flattened out , and in the North American market slid by one percent , which may seem like chump change to you but which sets off fire alarms in corporate board rooms , especially when it is followed in the third quarter by a 14 percent drop in net income and $160 million less revenue than expected . <p> And its not just Coke ; the carbonated beverage industry across the board has been taking it in the ribs in nearly every global market for the past few years , and anyone with even a passing familiarity with that industry knows why .

This tide is especially strong among those in the 18-to34 demographic , which is only about as important to the industry as your heartbeat is to you . <p> Since sugar is the obvious bogeyman here , the solution seems crystal clear : change your formula to minimize or replace it . Yeah , well , Coca-Cola tried tinkering with its flagship beverage some years ago and the result was the Edsel of the beverage world , New Coke . The company has , along with Pepsi , begun tentatively introducing new beverage lines that are sweetened in part with a plant-based non-sugar called stevia , but these items would have to take off like the iPod to make up for the loss in revenue from their main labels . <p> Much like their customers who have become addicted to sugary drinks , the drink makers have become addicted to the gushers of money produced by selling fizzy sugar water for fifty cents a can .

@@97603004 @1803004/ <h> 10 Questions You Can Ask to Find Your Way in Life <p> ( CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 ) Lauren Rushing/Flickr <p> How is your life going ? Are you so busy that time goes by and you wonder where it went ? Have all the expectations , responsibilities , and pressures caused you to lose your way ? Do you feel you need to change to be the person you really are ? Perhaps looking honestly at yourself and asking the right questions can help you find your way in life . Here are 10 questions that I suggest you start with . <p> 1 . How do I look at myself ? Do you see yourself accurately and honestly , or do you have many misconceptions ? Have you convinced yourself that you deserve some things , yet do n't  deserve other things ? Make a conscious decision to stop having negative thoughts about yourself . You have the right to a unique , distinct , and happy fulfilling life without setting your own limits and restrictions on what is possible . Be positive and consciously affirm your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life what you believe , and what you give to others . Even if this is not true , you will still have a better life by behaving this way . <p> 2 . What do I want to be in the coming years ? Look at your relationships and your career . What can you do to make these stronger , more fulfilling , and more vital ? Think about where and how you live . What are the places you want to visit and the things you want to experience ? Of course many of these cant just happen . Think about what you can do in the present to reach these things in your future . Are there goals that you can take small steps now to reach in the future ? Perhaps formal education or learning new skills can help . This is not about having a destination , but rather finding your direction . <p> 3 . Where do I want to be emotionally , physically , and mentally ? Look at what is unhealthy in your life . If these things , people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then consider what you can do to change . This is not about forcing yourself to be different , but rather allowing things to come into your life , at a natural pace , while still maintaining your balance . <p> 4 . What good habits have I formed ? Recognize the good habits that you have . Take the time to feel good about the positive changes you have made . Be proud of what you have faced , confronted , and conquered . <p> 5 . What bad habits do I need to change ? Make a list of the bad habits that you have . Are there any that you think you can work on ? This is about taking small steps and changing them one by one over time . You may have to put some off for later if you find you cant face them now . Concentrate your energy on things you have the power to change . Each success will give you the motivation and the tools to handle the next one . <p> 6 . What mistakes have I made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for what happened and seeing events from others points of view . This is a chance to turn a negative into a positive . Look at why and how these things happen . Ask yourself , what would I do differently in the future ? What can I learn ? Is this a personal pattern or is it just a one time occurrence ? Learn to forgive others and especially yourself , as well as to commit yourself to do better if there is a next time . <p> 7 . What are the qualities of those I admire ? Are these qualities that you have or you lack ? Do these people inspire you to integrate these qualities into your life ? Consider learning more about these people , such as the challenges they faced , and how they overcame this to succeed . Are there similarities between these people and you ? Perhaps you can not achieve everything that others did , but you can work to reach as high a level as you are capable of , and you might surprise yourself by going even further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned this week ? Make a list of the important things that you have learned . This is not about facts , but life lessons . Facts are momentary things , but lessons last a lifetime . <p> 9 . Who do I love and who loves me ? Think about the people that you love and those who love you . Are you letting them know how you feel and what they mean to you ? Is spending more time with them an important thing to do ? Are you overlooking potential loving relationships ? Learn to forgive others and rebuild relationships . Often that other person wants that just as much as you do , but does n't  know what to do . You can be the initiator for healing with your actions . <p> 10 . Who would I be if no one was judging me ? Are you living the real life that you want or are your living others and societys expectations for you ? Do you realize how much of what you say and do every day is based on the standards that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast possibilities . The acceptance of those who truly love you is important . Think less of what other people think about you and more about what you think of yourself . Perhaps the first step is to stop judging yourself . Listen to your own inner voice and conscience . We are all different and therefore you will never be accepted by everyone . Stop trying to please everyone and instead work on becoming the person you want to be .

You may be surprised to find that you do n't  have to overhaul your lifestyle . <p> People make the mistake of thinking they have to make drastic changes to lose weight and get in shape , says Lyssie Lakatos , RD , LD , CDN , but the secret is to make small changes and incorporate them into their lives permanently . <p> " Dropping your caloric intake below 1,000 calories a day on a consistent basis will signal your body that you are in starvation mode , and will slow down your metabolism , " warns Lakatos , who with her twin sister , Tammy Lakatos Shames , RD , LD , CDN , is co-author of Fire Up Your Metabolism . When the metabolism slows , we store food as fat and gain weight . <p> Calories do count , but its also about how efficiently your body burns those calories . Your metabolism plays a big part in regulating your weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up calories from the food you eat and turns them into energy . Metabolic rate is the speed at which you use up those calories . The goal is to get your metabolism into peak operating condition so you will burn the most calories all day long even while you sleep . <p> If you follow these seven tips to speed up your metabolism , you might never again find yourself facing the dreaded " next bigger size " on the rack of cute jeans at your favorite store . <p> Determine your daily caloric needs : To rev up your fat-burning engine , do n't  overload your system with too much food , Shames says . Figure out how many calories you need to consume each day to lose weight and keep your metabolism humming . Caloric level is determined by taking into account your age , sex , height , weight , lean body mass and activity level . here 's a quick formula from Shames to give you an idea of your magic number : Multiply your body weight by 11 . For example , a 140-pound woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight . If you 're very active , you can multiply your weight by 12 . <p> Divvy up your meals : Kick-start your metabolism and curb your appetite by dividing your meals into five to six small , nutritious meals a day instead of three squares . Eat a 200-400 calorie mini-meal every three to four hours . Your body will expend more energy to digest the food and your metabolic rate will increase , Lakatos says . <p> Just move ! Physical activity accounts for 20 percent to 40 percent of calories burned each day . The American Academy of Family Physicians suggests a good goal for many people is to work up to exercising four to six times a week for 30 to 60 minutes at a time . If you cant do that much , do what you can , say the twins : Walk the dog , park the car at the far end of the lot , take the stairs instead of the elevator , clean the house , just do something . <p> Pump iron : Muscle is your best friend !

Lean muscle needs calories just to exist , so start lifting those weights . <p> Sleep tight : Sleep loss may increase hunger and affect the bodys metabolism , which may make it more difficult to lose weight , according to studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and the Lancet . People who lose sleep may continue to feel hungry despite adequate food intake because sleep loss has been shown to affect the secretion of cortisol , a hormone that regulates appetite .

@@97603007 @1803007/ <h> Evolution explains what a facial surgeon observes : Men are built to take punches <h> Evolutionary violence and the human face <p> As a facial surgeon and a black belt in karate , Ive seen my share of damage from punches to the face . I have experience with facial reconstruction for both men and women . And a new paper titled " Protective buttressing of the hominin face , " published in Biological Reviews by University of Utah biologist David Carrier and physician Michael H. Morgan , explains many of the facial differences between the sexes that I 've noticed in my practice with a new theory that the historical differentiation between our male and female faces evolved due to the aggressive nature of men . <p> The study looked at human-like primates , the australopiths , that roamed Africa a million years ago . <p> " The australopiths were characterized by traits that may have improved fighting ability , including hand proportions that allow formation of a fist turning the hand into a club effective for striking , " said Carrier . " If indeed the evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior you might expect the primary target , the face , to have undergone evolution to better protect it from injury when punched . " <p> I can attest to the consistent way that faces break due to the location and trauma of the incoming force . I always knew what to expect and where to look for breaks in facial bones that would need surgical repair before I ever entered the operating room . <p> Dr. Carrier further explains : " When modern humans fight hand-to-hand the face is usually the primary target . " Evolution saw to it that " male and female faces are different because the parts of the skull that break in fights are bigger in males . " <p> Basically , women were on the sidelines becoming more attractive while the males masculinized themselves while fighting over them or other things that were of value ! <h> The significant role of violence in our evolution . <p> " French philosopher Rousseau argued that before civilization humans were noble savages ; that civilization actually corrupted humans and made us more violent . Many other evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not peaceful , " said Carrier . <h> Vive la difference ! <p> If this hypothesis is correct , the primary differences in these faces of the male and female may be due more to differences in the selection of mates rather than differences in the selection of food as was previously believed . The protective buttressing hypothesis explains that while humans do not fight by biting we do have pronounced male and female differences in the strength and power of our jaws and neck musculature . <p> Dr. Morgan waxes a bit philosophical at the end of his paper : " Our research is about peace . We seek to explore , understand , and confront humankinds violent and aggressive tendencies . Through our research we hope to look ourselves in the mirror and begin the difficult work of changing ourselves for the better . " <p> Amen ! 3780 @qwx863780 <p> I 'm always suspicious of this sort of reasoning to me , it sounds like a " just so " story , like all evolutionary psychology .

To me as someone trained as a hard scientist , that 's a major red flag . <p> there has been quite a lot of attention given in Australia to young men who deilver a coward punch to another male and killing him with a single blow . There have been a spike in such deaths recently and so an aggressive campaign has been run against such punches , including heavy penalties to the assailant <p> One of the things I love most about physics its so esoteric that its hard to commit too strongly in an emotional sense to a pre-existing notion . We get surprised all the time . <p> I guess it 's that the closer medical research gets to basic body appetites ( food , sex ) the less trustworthy it becomes .

@@97603008 @1803008/ <h> Body Fat Percentage Shown on Scales Not to be Trusted <p> Washington Post staff writer John Deiner loved his cool new tricked-out Health-o-meter body fat scale from Target , but he was puzzled at why it showed his body fat percentage ranging from a low of 22.5% to a high of 26.8% sometimes within a single day . <p> When Deiner related this to exercise physiologist Cris Slentz of Duke University , Slentz responded " Did it ever occur to you that its highly unlikely you 'd have a 3 percent change in body fat in one day ? " Slentz went on to say , " I do n't  believe that bioelectric impedance works well at all . My guess is that somewhere down the line it has some promise , but it has n't  reached that point yet . " <h> How Body Fat Percentage Scales Work <p> Home bioelectric impedance analysis scales have become more affordable , but consumers should be aware that their estimates can differ widely from more sophisticated and expensive measurements like hydrostatic tank measurement and DEXA scanning . <p> Home devices from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally use only two electrodes , one for each foot , directly estimating the fat content in the legs and pelvic area only . The scale then guesses overall body fat by using sex , height , weight , and stored averages . Some consumer devices sold in Japan by instrument manufacturer Tanita add handheld electrodes to improve accuracy ( pictured ) . <p> For best results , dieters should be more concerned with the trend in their body fat figure rather than the absolute percentage , and should measure their body fat and weight under similar conditions every day , such as first thing in the morning before drinking liquids and after using the toilet . <p> I have lost 20 kilograms over a 2-year period since having my baby . When I was first tested with calipers I was 37.8 percent body fat and 94 kilograms ( 180 centimeters tall ) . <p> I have been going to a gym for a year and a half , and with exercise and lifestyle changes the body fat has slowly but surely dropped . My caliper test when I first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 83 kilograms ) . <p> Actually my scale seems pretty accurate . I fluctuate within two to four pounds throughout a day , and the scale seems to reflect it quite accurately in both its weight and body fat readings . I do n't  see the huge percentage swings several have mentioned . <p> I recently started working out a lot and have seen a corresponding reduction of body fat percentage and weight . I guess its all in how the fat is stored on us , is n't it ? <p> Body fat scales only measure the lower half of the body . I carry most of my weight in my thighs and butt , but my upper half is relatively small , except for my breasts . <p> My scale said that I have body fat of around 50 percent , at 238.4 pounds , after pregnancy . But all the way down to 210 pounds , before pregnancy , it still said around 50 percent . My BMI , according to charts , is around 37 right now . <p> These scales are best used to set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss or gain of fat % . While they might not be 100% accurate as to your true body fat % , they do provide a very accurate difference from the baseline . This way you can track that you 're losing fat , not muscle , during your weight loss . In fact , body builders also use them to figure out the muscle gain . <p> Bioelectrical impedance is a developing technology , there is no doubt . However , if you get the right device , they do work very well . Gyms across the country have been using these devices for quite some time now with consistent results . As with any scale , it is not going to be 100% accurate all of the time . Make sure that you rely on a good model . <p> I had my body fat percentage tested today at my gym at 9.8% ( for the 3rd time in a row with similar results ) , my home scale said 15.8% later that day , from my experience and viewing my own body I think i 'm at about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top 4 abs . So , in summary , I do n't  think either of these methods are really accurate within a few percent . <p> I have a Health-o-meter that supposedly measures your body fat percentage and it irritates me how the scale can say I 'm 33% body fat when I 'm a very fit , active person who works out 5 days a week . I have no faith in this method of measuring body fat due to the fact that a body fat percentage like that is considered obese yet i have a 30 inch waist ? Eh , its a rip off , at least I was n't the one who spent money on it : ) <p> Its actually a very simple engineering problem with these scales . The scale measures the electrical impedance of your body and uses correlative equations to tell you your body fat . The problem is not with the equations , its with the measurement of impedance . If your feet are just slightly damp the impedance will be less than if your feet are completely dry . To get the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are completely dry ( including any sweat ) every time you use it . Even if you do this the number it gives still might not be correct ( that just depends on the calibration ) you just have to rely on the trend of your fat percentage ( whether it goes up or down . ) <p> I just got one of these scales . Ive been working out actively for over a year . My waist has dropped from a 35 to 30 . I have lots of definition but I 'm not cut . You can see my abs but they arnt cut yet . I 've tried the hand-held body-fat testers at the gym and they seem insanely inaccurate , they would measure as low as 4.9% bodyfat for me . On average they said I have like 7.3-9% bodyfat . Mostly around 7 . I know that is n't accurate . <p> I got the cheapest scale from Walmart that measures bodyfat and it gives me a reading of 15% . I do get some fluctuation but overall it seems to go back to 14.8-16% bodyfat . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . My friend has a more expensive scale and I remember it giving me about the same reading . <p> My guess is that I am around 11-14% bodyfat . I only weigh 163 and I have a good bit of muscle and I 'm 6ft , so I cant imagine my bodyfat being that high . With my waist being a 30 . <p> I know for me I have very little fat on my upper body and I store most of my fat in my thighs and butt , even though I do work out legs I do not do them as often . If you workout your muscles it will lower your bodyfat reading significantly , I do not think it is dehydration related as I am always extremely hydrated , I think it is the increased bloodflow to your muscles and the " pump " . <p> I recently joined a gym , I would say I 'm a pretty fit guy anyways , but was so shocked by the weighing scales results of my body fat . Standing 58 weighing 69.5kgs , and being fairly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And that equated to 31.4kgs of my weight !

Since its sending a current through the shortest path , its going in one foot , through the pelvic area down the opposite leg and out the other foot . So its just measuring the Fat in those areas . It occurred to me , what if you put one foot on , kneeled down and touched the sensor with the opposites side hand . That would send the current from the foot through the abdomen down the opposite arm and out the opposite hand . Maybe a more accurate measurement . <p> these things do n't  work , i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working out for about 30-40 days and just bought one of these scales .. i 'm 60 250lbs male and it tells me im between 86-89% bodyfat <p> these scales have absolutely no value . i 'm 58 220. my body frame is massive . 37 in waist , but 48 in hips , absolutely minimal fat in my lower body . i played cfb , and can currently run a 4.6 40. yet this dumb scale says my body is made up of 60% fat . these really need to get taken off the shelves , but target and wal mart could certainly care less <p> I have an at-home bio electric impedance scale that fluctuates by a lot of percentage points once in a while . It typically measures me between 23 and 25% and when it jumped to 27% today I could n't believe it .

Some of the arguments against the standards are relatively easy to dismiss , the principal one being , " The kids do n't  like the healthier food and just throw it away , which wastes both food and money . " <h> Pleasing kids is not the goal <p> There are a number of things the kids probably do n't  like about school in addition to healthy lunches , such as the teachers , tests and homework , but their wishes are not our command . Please tell me I do n't  have to explain why letting children make their own food decisions is nuts . <p> USDA <p> As for the wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food has been filling cafeteria trash cans since day one . In fact , the early returns on the healthy food program indicate that kids grow to accept and even like the nutritional version . <p> As for the economics , if cutting food costs is all that important , do n't  feed the kids at all . The simple truth is that the federal lunch standards are not about pleasing the kids or saving money ; they are about providing the next generation with food healthy enough to fuel the learning process . <h> Bureaucrats impurifying our kids precious bodily fluids ? <p> Another complaint is somewhat more complicated : That it is the parents who should determine their childrens lunchtime fare and not some distant government bureaucrats . That certainly seems reasonable , but the fact is that parents are already quite free to send their kids to school packing lunches of their choosing . If every parent actually did so , those long cafeteria lines would shrivel and the cafeterias would shut down due to lack of traffic . But they have n't , and that 's probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tufts University and Tufts University School of Medicine researchers who compared cafeteria lunches to the lunches provided by parents . <p> They examined the lunchbox contents of more than 600 Massachusetts third- and fourth-graders in six school districts and here 's what they found . Whereas school lunches now emphasize fruits , vegetables , whole grains and low-fat dairy , the lunches brought from home were dominated by higher-calorie packaged convenience foods , snacks , and sugary drinks and desserts . Only 27 percent of the brought lunches met even three of the five nutritional standards set by the National School Lunch Program . And of all the snacks brought from home , just 4 percent met two of the four nutrition standards set by the Child and Adult Food Care Program . <h> Parent-packed lunches are vegetable-free <p> Nearly 25 percent of the brought lunches failed to include an entree item such as a sandwich or a serving of leftovers ; instead , the lunches were composed to packaged snack and dessert items .

The typical packed lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as chips or trail mix ; fruits and vegetables , standard school cafeteria fare , were all but absent . <p> USDA <p> By rights , we should be enormously grateful as a nation for the school lunch program , for the simple reason that in many cases it is the best meal that a grievous number of kids will get that day . One reason that almost 60 percent of U.S. school kids consume school lunches is that all too many parents simply cant afford to provide their lunch ; for millions of kids , the school lunches are free . One of our lesser-reported national embarrassments is what happens to those kids during summer vacation . A lot of them get no lunch , period . Some 3.5 million school kids received free lunches last year during the summer vacation months only thanks to Samaritans such as Feeding America , a national alliance of over 130 food banks , and that does n't  count the individual local summer lunch programs around the country .

Kids in this age group are more independent than younger children , and their social interactions are far more prominent ; accordingly , food-allergy discussions for older kids must take a different tack than the talks you might have with younger children . <p> The following strategies to teach older children about their food allergies take these emotional issues into account . Perennial Food Allergy Friday experts Linda Coss , Elizabeth Goldenberg and Lynda Mitchell offer their insights once more in todays post , and well also hear from food allergy musician Kyle Dine and food allergy author Nicole Smith . <h> Topics to Cover <p> Parents goals for teaching older children about their food allergies remain the same as with younger children : teach the child how to safely negotiate a world filled with harmful allergens . At this stage , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child build a sense of responsibility and empowerment . Here are some of the key topics to cover : <p> Build on food-allergy topics youve already taught your child . " The most important part of teaching older children about food allergies is to start teaching at an early age and continue to build on the foundation of self-management skills that the children start to learn as a younger child , " says Lynda Mitchell . " Teach them to read labels , advocate with adults , always carry their emergency medicines and know how to use them . Through reinforcement , it just becomes part of their routine , like brushing ones teeth or wearing eyeglasses . " <p> Cooking , food preparation and communication . " Now that my son Jacob is older , we talk more about how food is prepared , and what makes something safe , " says Elizabeth Goldenberg . " He s listened to me ask questions at restaurants , speak to parents and teachers he s with , read labels and call companies with inquiries . He now knows the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 've presented him with something unsafe . " <p> Discuss all the places on a nutritional label that might contain a potential allergen , and reintroduce the topic of cross-contamination . " If your child is allergic to something that 's not one of the Big 8 Allergens , he must also be able to recognize all of the myriad ways that a particular allergen , such as corn , might show up on ingredient statements , " says Linda Coss . " There is no law requiring companies to put may contain statements on food packages , so the absence of a may contain statement does not necessarily mean that something is safe . " <p> Emotional issues . Older children , food-allergic or not , have a need to feel " cool " and not stick out from the crowd ; unfortunately , food-allergic kids are often subject to bullying at school . Musician Kyle Dine uses his background as a food-allergic person to zero in on these topics in his shows . " I focus on heavier issues such as bullying , supporting allergic friends emotionally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I tell real-life stories that reinforce the severity of allergies , and the need for everyone to help keep people with allergies safe . " <p> The need to fit in may tempt some food-allergic kids to make unsafe choices . " Unfortunately , risk-taking is considered a developmentally normal behavior for teens , " says Coss . " To get their buy-in , you need to include them in the food-allergy management plans . " <p> The non-negotiables . Make sure your child always carries his epinephrine and speaks up about his food allergies . " Adolescents and young adults are a high-risk group because they do n't  carry their epinephrine and delay in using it , " says Mitchell . " And because of their maturity and sometimes embarassment to tell others , they may take unnecessary risks . " Coss suggests , " Create a system to ensure that the emergency meds are never left behind . " <p> Why Wear a Medication Belt ? <p> If you want your child to wear specific items at all times , such as a medication belt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goldenberg , for example , makes sure her son wears his medication belt wherever he goes . " Once a child reaches school age , in my opinion its time to let him wear his medication in a medication belt. - They spend time in different classrooms and are loosely supervised in the school yard , so it becomes even more important to have the medication move without fail with the child , and a medication belt accomplishes this , " she says . <p> Supervised class trip protocol . " I still stay at birthday parties that Jacob attends , and my husband still goes on all class field trips with him , " says Goldenberg. - " I can see a point in the not-too-distant future when Jacob will be attending those events on his own. - We would have to investigate any food issues in advance , inform him about them , make sure the adults with him are watching out for him , and then leave it up to him to make safe choices . " <p> Food allergy severity . " As children enter their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like determining whether the fries at their cafeteria or that their friends mother prepared are safe , " says Goldenberg . " Its our role to make sure that by then , they understand the seriousness of food allergy and do n't  make reckless choices . They should know the questions to ask to be sure a food is safe for them , or have enough impulse control to wait to try it until a parent has called to ask those questions for them . " Structure your discussions to instill a sense of urgency . " Most food allergy deaths occur during the teens to early 20s as children begin to assume responsibility for their food choices and also want to eat what others eat , " Goldenberg adds . " That 's why its incredibly important that they still wear their medication at all times . " <p> " Express that food allergies can be fatal , and that this is why your family has put so many systems into place to keep your child safe , " suggests Coss . " His cooperation with these plans and systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A teen is safer if his friends are also informed about food allergies , so they are on his side when choosing places to eat and can help recognize if someone is having an allergic reaction . I would make sure that my son could inject himself with an EpiPen if necessary , but I would also show his closest friends and their parents how to do so , and a web would be formed to help keep him safe , " says Goldenberg . <h> Special Considerations <p> Teaching older children about food allergies entails walking a fine line between conveying essential information to keep the child safe and empowering her to feel confident and independent . Keep the following considerations in mind when you discuss food allergies with an older child . <p> Prepare for less supervision . " I found when Jacob reached age 8 , play dates began to change . Rather than just play at his friends house with a parent watching all the time , the children would mingle with neighborhood children and play outside , at the school yard or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last summer , and I was caught unprepared : Jacob spent some time with his friend at another school friends home . I had to explain that his host did n't  know that he has food allergies or how to use his medication. - I realized that I need to teach Jacob to inform people that he is peanut and tree nut allergic , and that he needs to know how to recognize the signs of a reaction and to ask for help , " says Goldenberg . <p> Coss echoes the need for children to speak up if somethings wrong . " Many children are reluctant to call attention to themselves , especially in a public place or a social gathering . If your child is likely to be too embarrassed to speak up when he s in distress , create a special distress signal that he can use in social situations to alert you to the fact that he s having a reaction , " she suggests . <p> Build trust and independence . " I 'm not a parent , but I was once a cavalier teen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not want my allergies to be a big deal , and I especially did not want to stand out from my friends because of them . My parents did a great job at making me feel allergic and cool. They would reason with me and treat me like an adult as long as I stuck to the non-negotiables , like carrying my auto-injector at all times . I loved that my parents had more faith and trust in me , and I tried not to disappoint , as I liked it when they treated me like an adult . " <p> One way to help your child build independence is to let her suggest strategies for sticking to your familys food-allergy plan . " Often kids will come up with great coping strategies that you might not have thought of , " says Coss . " My own son , for example , seems to have perfected the technique of getting in and out of picnic table benches without ever touching any bench or table surface . While boys might be comfortable walking into a social event with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide their special food in an oversized purse . " <p> Encourage responsibility and accountability . " We 've taught Morgan that he has the food allergies , and that Mom and Dad are n't  always going to be with him to resolve situations , " says Smith . " As he has aged , he is more able to judge what is truly a concern ( eating a food baked by someone ) versus what is acceptable ( reading a food label himself to judge its safety ) . At age 15 , he no longer needs Mom or Dad to approve of the food with a label prior to eating it . He carries his own EpiPen and he s responsible for it always at school and at home . He s also responsible for telling his dates about his food allergies , his friends , his fellow Boy Scouts everyone ! As he teaches others , he learns more himself . " <p> Mitchell recommends a similar approach . " You have to give your child a chance to learn how to self-manage . Older children want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday parties or school social events when they get into their adolescent years , so you have to keep giving them the skills they need so they can do big things on their own , " she says . " It will still require you to do lots of planning , but its so worth it to see them succeed at things you may not think they could , like going on camping trips , mission trips , overnight sleepovers , trips to restaurants with friends or going off to college . My sons been able to do all of these things . It was a lot of work , but giving your child a way to navigate the world without you is something that will make you proud , as it has for me . " <p> To help encourage accountability in your child , exude confidence . " Your child will take his cues from you regarding food allergy management , " says Coss . " Its important that you give him the message that you know what you 're doing , everything is under control , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . " <p> Understand your childs emotional needs . " Many teens know the score when it comes to managing their allergies ; the key for parents is to start transitioning responsibilities while being mindful of their social needs , and need for independence . Make sure to give your kid lots of credit for doing so , " advises Dine . " I know that its easier said than done to let go and give them control of their own health , but both you and your child will be proud that you did . " <h> Methods <p> Two of the major themes in an older childs life , social interactions and independence , can help you devise clever ways to teach older children about food allergies . <p> Use a peer-based approach . At his shows , for example , Dine engages his audience to teach each other about food allergies . " Instead of involving them solely in the fun aspects , I tap their own knowledge for the educational elements , " he says . " I always ask older students if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced one themselves . I am always surprised to see the number of hands raised . Once you have older kids describing symptoms , the emergency procedure and lessons learned , their peers certainly listen and take note . " <p> Let your child be the teacher . " We wanted my son Morgan to have practice teaching others about his food allergy . We purchased a MedicAlert bracelet for him to wear when he was very young . As he aged , he was able to answer peoples questions about why he wore the bracelet . He would tell them about his food allergies , which taught him more and other people learned something new in the process , " says Smith . " Morgan always attended his 504 Plan meetings at school so that he would know who the safe adults were at school . He could also provide information to the adults about what was working and what needed to be changed . He learned more about his food allergies by attending allergist appointments and by my husband and I talking to him about food allergies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving food , not to scare him , but to give him power over situations that might arise when food is present where you least expect it .

Perhaps , you 're looking for something with a little kick . No problem try the Spicy Three Pepper flavor . Clearly , there is something to please every palate in the Athenos line of hummus dips . Despite such variety , all flavors share a common texture and general taste . Athenos hummus tends to get dry easily , so it can often feel a bit grainy on the tongue . The taste is always pleasantly salty and flavorful , however . <p> Nutritionally , Athenos hummus is adequate . Each 2 tablespoon serving provides 3 grams of fat and 50 calories ; there is a measly 1 gram of protein and less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stats considering other brands deliver more nutrition for fewer calories . Also important to note is that many of the Athenos flavors contain high fructose corn syrup not exactly a welcome ingredient to the health-conscious . <p> At about $3.00 per 7-ounce tub , this hummus is relatively affordable . If you 're eating the recommended serving size , it should take a while to finish the tub , and fortunately , there is a generous expiration date to facilitate sporadic dipping . <h> Wild Garden <p> This brand may be a little unfamiliar to you that 's because you wo n't find it in the deli section with all the other brands . Wild Garden hummus is a jarred hummus found where you might find bean dip , salsa , or other shelf stable condiments ; it requires no refrigeration until opened . There are eight varieties , including Red Hot Chili Pepper , Sun-Dried Tomato , Roasted Red Pepper , and Traditional . Yet again , this is a company aiming to please all taste buds and to prevent hummus boredom . <p> Wild Gardens taste and texture is top notch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the stickiness no dryness or icky coarse texture here . Some flavors are better than others , however . Traditional , Roasted Garlic , and Roasted Red Pepper are all tasty choices , but Sun-Dried Tomato lacks a distinct tomato flavor . The Red Hot Chili Pepper is hot enough to make you guzzle a Diet Coke in one gulp . <p> Perhaps the best part of this hummus is its nutrition . Each 2 tablespoon ( 32 grams ) serving has a mere 35 calories and 2 grams of fat , along with 2 grams of protein and 1 gram of fiber . I 'd say stats like those qualify this hummus as a nutrition all star ! <p> Wild Garden also takes convenience into account . Not only are their products safe for the pantry until opened , but they also come in individual " To Go " tubes . This makes them perfect for throwing in a backpack or lunch box , no chill pack required . <p> If you 'd like to sample some their chickpea deliciousness , Wild Garden hummus sells for around $3.00 for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each . Quite a deal for the same price as the Athenos tubs , you can get almost twice as much hummus . <h> Guiltless Gourmet <p> Guiltless Gourmet is perhaps best known for its line of baked chips and snacks , but did you know that they also produce a variety of dips ? In addition to salsa and black bean dip , their chip accompaniments include two varieties of hummus : Traditional and Roasted Garlic . These two varieties contain almost identical ingredients ; there is just a crucial difference in the amount of garlic flavor . <p> Unfortunately , neither the Traditional nor the Roasted Garlic is a standout . I first sampled the Roasted Garlic flavor , and its prominent garlic flavor made it almost unbearable I had to check that the expiration date to make sure that the flavor was not due to spoilage . After a few tries , I simply could n't torture myself with this dip anymore . In addition , a peculiar pink mold had begun to develop on the surface of the hummus , despite the fact that it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This hummus went into the trash can several months before the expiration date on the jar . I sampled the Original flavor , and its garlic flavor was more subtle . However , both varieties paled in comparison to the other brands I had tried , both in taste and shelf life . <p> For 2 tablespoons of hummus , you 'll get 35 calories , 1.5 grams of fat , along with 1 gram of fiber and a mere 1 gram of protein . Although its low in fat and calories , but this hummus is a little lacking in nutrition . <p> Each jar of Guiltless Gourmet hummus contains 10.5 servings and sells for about $3.75 . Compare this to Wild Garden , whose jars contain more than 12 servings and sell for $3.00 . <h> Cedars <p> here 's a fun fact : Cedars Hommus was the first to appear in American supermarkets . Its no surprise that this hummus is still around today Cedars makes a blend that boasts a smooth texture with a distinct Mediterranean flavor . Cedars makes several varieties ; they have both an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of my favorites are the Tomato-Basil and the Garden Vegetable . Cedars hummus is never dry it has a tuna salad-like texture . Perhaps the best part of this hummus is its chunkiness ; there are often large vegetable pieces mixed into the dip , making it hearty and flavorful . <p> Cedars Hommus is all natural , with no preservatives . While a natural hummus is good for your body , it also means that you have to eat it quickly before it spoils . However , Cedars Hommus is so tasty ( and addictive ) that it wont be too difficult to polish it off before the expiration date rolls around . <p> Each 2 tablespoon serving contains 45-50 calories and 2 grams of fat . Also in that small dollop are 3 grams of fiber and an impressive 3 grams of protein . Cedars clearly wins the award for most nutritious hummus . <p> All of Cedars varieties come in an 8-ounce tub that you can purchase for $2.99 .

Its very tasty and you can eat it with the Athenos pita chips ( whole wheat should be suggested ) . I 've even learned what to do when you run out of pita chips ( use tortilla chips its still yummy ) . <p> Athenos seems to have too much salt and sesame , which gives it a weird aftertaste , while Tribe is evenly seasoned and not overwhelming .

Otherwise , the packaging looks just like the kind that is all natural . I 'm pretty disgusted about this and will not purchase them in the future . Ill be learning to make my own . Maybe it makes a difference in where you buy it ? This was from Wal-Martmaybe they have a cheaper version and it has preservatives ? Not sure , just know I wont be buying them again .

So good ! <p> I really love Pita Pal . Much better nutritional label than the other hummus in the grocery stores . Also does n't  taste industrialized like other hummus I have purchased at grocery stores . Also I can buy it at most of the grocery stores here in Texas plus Costco or Sams.

We 've asked two active food allergy advocates Sloane Miller and Karen Harris for their suggestions on how to get involved in the food allergy community . Whether you 're looking to improve food allergy policies on a nationwide scale or just want to raise awareness within your neighborhood , these tips will galvanize you into action . <p> ( CC ) D. Sharon Pruitt/Flickr <p> Featured Food Allergy Experts <p> Karen Harris is the founder and a support group leader of Food Allergy Kids of Atlanta ; she is also- a council member of the FAAN Support Group Advisory Council . The FA Kids of Atlanta Twitter handle is @FAKidsATL.Sloane Miller is the author , coach and food allergy consultant behind Allergic Girl Resources ; she is also a vocal advocate in the food allergy community . Her Twitter handle is @AllergicGirl . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with local food allergy support groups . If you 're new to the food allergy community , check out last weeks post on finding a food allergy support network . " Connecting with the food-allergic community , outside of your friends , family and loved ones , is a great way to shore up your support network and advocate for your needs , " says Sloane Miller . To find a local support group online , see our Resources and Additional Reading section for links to get your search started . <p> Social networking services like Twitter and Facebook are invaluable resources for creating connections . Use the Twitter hashtag #foodallergy to connect with the online food allergy community . Interacting with Twitter users who are well-connected in local support groups may help you identify and address a demand for food allergy support in your area . <p> 2 . Start your own support group . If there is n't a food allergy support network in your area , consider starting your own . " A local support group is a great networking resource that will help your community come together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , day cares , restaurants and food-service establishments a safer place , while improving the quality of life for those living with food allergies , " says Karen Harris . <p> 3 . Orchestrate an event . " Organize a food allergy awareness event in your area , such as a fundraiser , local walk , bake sale or car wash , " advises Harris . " Free food allergy educational materials are available for download through the websites of local and national organizations , which you can then hand out during these events . " <p> ( CC ) ASU Provost Comm Group/Flickr <p> 4 . Participate in other local events . " Find a public event that will allow you to participate by setting up a food allergy awareness booth during the event , " says Harris , who recently organized an awareness booth during the North Georgia Arts &amp; Crafts Festival . " Our group participation in awareness events last year made me realize how important it is to not only advocate on the importance of food allergy and anaphylaxis , but to also let those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available who is also advocating to help keep them safe . " <p> 5 . Get involved at your childs school or day care . In a previous article on school safety tips for kids with food allergies , our experts suggested ways parents can get involved at school . " Not only does getting involved help advocate for your child , but also for other food-allergic children who are currently enrolled in the school , or will soon be entering the school , " said Harris . Another opportunity Harris recommends for positive interactions is reading a book on food allergies in your childs classroom . <h> Food Allergy Advocacy With Limited Resources <p> Many people want to become more active in the food allergy community , but do n't  have the time or resources to participate in support groups or attend local events . You do n't  need to quit your day job to help . " Raising awareness of food allergies does not have to be time-consuming or costly , " says Harris . " You can become an advocate today by just giving a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by simply speaking with individuals you meet throughout your day . " These tips zero in on fast , inexpensive ways to make a difference . <p> 6 . Study up on food allergies . " Educate yourself with appropriate and correct information , " advises Harris . " Use documented statistics , scientific facts or a personal experience when advocating on behalf of food allergies versus your personal opinion on a particular topic . Parents need to know how to communicate information convincingly , and it is also important to develop the confidence to do your own advocating . " <p> 8 . Contact your congresspersons . " Send a message to your U.S. senators and representatives asking them to increase food allergy research funding , " says Harris . <p> 9 . Increase awareness in your social sphere . " Post a food allergy awareness video on your social network , " advises Harris . " When making conversation in public , consider bringing up food allergies .

That 's a fairly lame pun that 's meant to be taken literally : put a mirror in the room where you take your meals and situate it so that you can see yourself while you 're dining . Experiments with this practice have found that people who do so tend to eat fewer high-fat foods .

One recent workplace study found that people who work in clean and orderly surroundings choose healthy snacks over fatty and sugary ones .

Drag out that dust rag and vacuum cleaner and get to work . <p> Rearrange your refrigerator . Diet guru Dr. Brian Wansink notes that you are three times more likely to take the first thing you see when you open the fridge door than to forage around . Thus he suggests the following : put the healthiest items , the fruit and veggies , on the topmost refrigerator shelves , prominently in view .

Numerous surveys have found that we tend to choose healthier items when paying by cash , and spend more on products heavy with sugar and fat when using credit cards . A recent Cornell study found that cafeteria cash customers purchase 20 percent more vegetables and over 30 percent fewer calories than those who use debit cards . This is probably just one manifestation of the larger pattern wherein consumers make more judicious purchasing decisions in general when " real money " is changing hands .

The folks over at Waitrose wanted to make this a bit easier by pointing out the 10 most common diet traps and how we can all avoid them in an easy-to-read infographic . Including diet blunders like skipping breakfast or rewarding yourself with food , the infographic teaches us how to avoid such mistakes and diet the right way . <p> " Feel like you 've done everything you can to lose weight , but its just not happening ? " the infographic reads . " Take a look at the most common diet errors and find out how to stop them from sabotaging your weight loss efforts . " <p> According to the infographic , it does n't  matter how healthy you are eating if you are still eating in large portions . You 'll only be able to start shedding pounds if you make your portions smaller . You should also pay close attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories are in your food ? How does that coincide with your daily intake ? Read labels and stay informed with what goes into your body . <p> One of the most important traps the infographic points out is the feeling of wanting to give up just because you ate more than you should have , or you indulged in more than one piece of chocolate cake . Sometimes we just cant help ourselves , but this makes it that much more important that you get yourself back on track and keep going . <p> Another diet trap we often fall into is exercising less because we 've started eating healthfully . No matter what or how much you are eating , your body needs to stay active . <p> " People tend to move less when they start dieting , " the infographic reads . " Research shows that peoples activity levels tend to drop by 40 percent when they try to lose weight .

When I restrict calories , I feel terrible lightheaded , weak and tired . I would n't exercise when I felt like that ! ( And no , that 's not a dramatic cutback , just 200-500 calories less than usual . ) <p> You most likely feel weak and tired because of what your eating . When we eat less than optimal energy creation foods with lots of empty carbs which lack a high nutritional content we often can feel more fatigue when trying to restrict our calorie intake since it requires so many additional calories to get the same amount of electrolytes and nutrients . Focus on limiting your ingestion of animal fat and refined carbs and instead shift your dietary intake to 80 to 90% vegetables , fruits and legumes . The amount of healthy micronutrients and phytochemicals you will flood your body with will give you loads of extra energy and not require you to restrict your calorie intake in a extreme manner to lose and maintain a healthy weight .

It 's been a week now and I feel uncomfortable <p> Yes , reportedly about one in six people who quit smoking may report constipation as part of what is sometimes called tobacco withdrawal syndrome . Nicotine is a stimulant , which means it also stimulates your bowels to move . Now , without nicotine , your digestive tract needs to get back to learning how to keep things moving on its own . Constipation can also be a side effect of some medications used for support as people quit smoking . Typically , problems with constipation peak at about two weeks and then decrease ; occasionally this can be a longer lasting problem . Most people experience constipation now and then , but lifestyle choices can decrease odds of ongoing problems . <p> Think fiber , fluid and movement . Adults need from 21 to 38 grams of fiber daily ; aiming for at least 30 grams may provide more help beating constipation and promoting health . You can meet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least 3-+ to 6 cups of vegetables and fruits , and at least one serving of beans , nuts , seeds or bran daily .

Daily physical activity is also important to help the muscles of the digestive system keep things moving . If you put these steps in place and constipation is still a problem after a few weeks , talk with your doctor about alternative steps . Do n't jump to stimulant-based laxatives , or your gut could become dependent on them .

But I have found a couple things that can be really helpful . For one thing , acetylcholine is a key neurotransmitter that is stimulated during nicotine addiction and it is also a a crucial neurotransmitter in the intestines . If acetylcholine levels were to drop during nicotine withdrawal it could reduce the amount available in the intestines to induce peristalsis ( intestinal contractions ) . To help with this take some vitamin B-5 , which is the pre-cursor to acetylcholine and can help build you back up to normal levels . <p> You can also try magnesium oxide for an osmotic laxative effect that usually provides pretty fast relief and its non-habit forming .

@@97603030 @1803030/ <p> Although the Master Cleanse is often referred to as a fast , its not really a complete fast , in that up to 1,300 calories are consumed each day in the form of sugars from the ingredients in the beverage that Master Cleansers prepare and drink . <h> Background <p> The Master Cleanse was originally developed in 1940 as a stomach ulcer cure by alternative health practitioner Stanley Burroughs ( 1903-1991 ) . In 1976 Burroughs presented his diet in a book , The Master Cleanser , by which time he was promoting the diet not only for ulcers , but for weight loss and " every kind of disease , " claiming it would lead to " the correction of all disorders . " The book is a disorganized , difficult-to-decipher jumble , and in 2004 a fan of the diet , Peter Glickman , published his more comprehensible version in the book Lose Weight , Have More Energy &amp; Be Happier in 10 Days , dubbing it the " Lemonade Diet . " Glickmans book revived the diets popularity . <p> Neither Burroughs nor Glickman was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of alternative practices beyond the Master Cleanse , including light therapy , deep massage , and reflexology , and he was a practicing nudist and vegetarian . He was convicted of practicing medicine without a license and imprisoned , and he was convicted of second degree murder , later overturned , for his role in the death of a desperate leukemia patient , whose cancer Burroughs tried to cure with the Master Cleanse and other practices . Glickman is a software engineer cum chiropractor who has promoted the medically rejected practice of chelation . <p> Among the celebrities who have been reported to have used the diet are Beyonce Knowles , who lost 20 pounds in two weeks for her role in the movie Dreamgirls , and Howard Stern sidekick Robin Quivers , who was quoted in People magazine that she heard about it from magician David Blaine and used it on three occasions while reducing her weight to 145 pounds from 218 pounds . Actor Jared Leto used the Master Cleanse to lose the 60 or so pounds that he had gained for his role as John Lennons killer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been connected with the diet . Moses and Jesus both reportedly underwent a pre-Burroughs 40-day version of the diet , not involving lemonade or laxatives . Not recommending the diet is rocker Eddie van Halen , who nearly died when his " intestines exploded " during the Master Cleanse , according to the National Enquirer ; and Gwyneth Paltrow , who wrote on her blog that " it did work , but is not pretty , " and might cause liver damage according to her " detox diet specialist . " <h> Does it Work ? <p> Does the diet work for weight loss ? If you follow the instructions , it most certainly will work . Any fast will cause you to lose weight , because you are n't  eating food . The Master Cleanse in the strict sense is not a fast because you drink a considerable amount of sugar-containing lemonade , about 650 to 1,300 calories worth per day , depending on the number of glasses you drink . Thus you will have a daily calorie deficit : Most non-overweight people need from 1,600 to 2,400 calories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lower end of that range ) . If you are overweight , you are probably consuming more than that to maintain your weight . <p> As an example , if you normally eat 2,150 calories , and you choose the extreme 650-calorie version of the Master Cleanse , you will have a 1,500-calorie deficit , losing three pounds of fat per week ( and perhaps some water weight also ) . ( There may be other factors that will affect this result . ) Many reputable diets prescribe a two-pound per week loss , so in this sense the Master Cleanse is actually not that radical : it just substitutes lemonade for real food and adds the shock effect of constant colon cleansing . <h> Is is Dangerous ? Master Cleanse Dangers <p> Most medical authorities do n't  believe that a few days of fasting will harm you ( and the Master Cleanse is more of a low-calorie , nutrient deficient diet than a fast ) . But longer periods will begin to deplete muscle , and your heart is among the muscles that will suffer not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kidneys and liver . Where is the safe cut-off point ? We cant really say . <p> Less is known about the long-term effects of 10 days or more of salt-water laxative use . <h> About This Detox Stuff <p> Most people today , deep down , are interested in the Master Cleanse primarily for its get-skinny-quick aspect , although they rarely admit it . But there is also a detox component . What about detox ? <p> There 's no evidence that our bodies contain excessive toxins of the sort Burroughs discusses , and there 's no evidence that detox diets flush out anything bad in your body . Many of our organs , including the liver , kidneys , lungs , and the intestines , are very efficient filters that expel toxins . There are toxins that may be trapped in fat cells or the lungs , but this sort of diet does not help with expelling those . <p> Weve included some quotes from Stanley Burroughs at the end of this article so you can read for yourself how naive and outdated his medical theories were . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Master Cleanse is this : <p> The diet takes at least 10 days ( up to 40 days , the period of time that Jesus fasted after his baptism , as Burroughs points out ) <p> The only nourishment that you take is a special lemonade concoction made from the Master Cleanse ingredients : lemon juice , maple syrup , cayenne pepper , and water , six to twelve glasses per day , each glass containing about 110 calories in sugar carbohydrates <p> An herbal laxative tea is drunk at night and a quart of salt water is drunk first thing in the morning , resulting in several liquid bowel movements every day you need to always be near a toilet when you do this diet , and you need to stock up on toilet paper <p> You come off the diet by transitioning to solid food over a few days , ideally becoming a raw food vegetarian in Stanley Burroughs version of the diet <h> The Master Cleanse Lemonade <p> The lemonade is prepared by mixing the ingredients in this free recipe : <p> 2 tablespoons freshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not bottled juice . Limes may be substituted . Lemon zest and pulp may be added , making sure that the lemons are organic and not artificially colored or treated with pesticides . <p> 2 tablespoons of maple syrup . This must be pure maple syrup , not pancake syrup . Burroughs recommends the darker Grade B , which has more color and nutrients than Grade A , which is also acceptable . He goes into aspects of maple syrup production that would be difficult for the average person to investigate , such as whether formaldehyde or plastic tubing is used ( not recommended by Burroughs ) . <p> 1/10 teaspoon cayenne pepper . Burroughs insists that cayenne chili pepper be used , but permits ramping up from a lesser amount if the taste needs getting used to . <p> Water . Burroughs recommends a 10-ounce glass of medium hot water , but also allows cold water to be used . Some have interpreted " 10-ounce glass " to mean 8 ounces of actual water . Since Burroughs also allows plain water to be drunk during the fast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An alternative to the lemonade endorsed by Burroughs substitutes 10 ounces of fresh sugarcane juice for the lemon juice and water . But few people are going to have access to fresh , organic sugar cane juice . Some people who can not stomach the maple syrup taste have substituted an equal number of calories of powdered sugarcane or organic cane sugar , available from some health food stores ( one user described it as tasting like pond scum , worse than the maple syrup ) . <h> Things to Avoid at All Costs <p> Burroughs strongly counsels against the use of honey in the lemonade or the consumption at any time of honey , which he describes as predigested bee vomit , popular only among " gullible health foodists . " <p> Burroughs also cautions against taking any kind of supplements or vitamin pills or using illicit drugs . Although Glickman wisely recommends against going off any prescription medications without your doctors approval , its unclear what Burroughs opinion was on this point . He reprints without comment an endorsement from a follower who relates how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of energy during his fast . And Burroughs was generally against traditional medicine in general , discouraging a leukemia patient from getting a bone marrow transplant . And an alternative version of the Master Cleanse for diabetics described in the book recommends that the diabetic phase out insulin during the diet . In another context in the book Burroughs rails against " the unnatural action of drugs and antibiotics , " saying they store " poisons in the body . " But were with Glickman on this one . <p> You should n't smoke or drink alcohol , coffee , tea , cola , but the good news is that your cravings for them will completely disappear , according to Burroughs . Burroughs allows the consumption of extra plain water and of mint tea . <p> No other food or drink should be consumed at all , say both Burroughs and Glickman . <h> The Colon Blaster <p> There are two preparations needed to induce colon cleansing . <p> Laxative herb tea . Although Burroughs is quite specific about types and amounts of lemons and maple syrup , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaboration that you should buy any good brand offered by your health food store . <p> Internal salt water bathing solution . Dissolve two teaspoons of uniodized sea salt in a quart of lukewarm water . <p> The laxative herb tea and the salt water are the one-two punch that will keep your colon in full-time Old Faithful mode during the diet , cleansing it clean as a whistle . <h> During the Diet <p> To begin the diet you need to choose the minimum number of days that you are going to attempt , steel yourself for what is to come , and follow the following daily routine . <p> Purchase a large supply of toilet paper and Tucks- brand witch hazel wipes . If you share your bathroom with others , agree on a unque emergency code phrase like " Its coming , " " Dr. Livingston , I presume , " or " Elvis is leaving the building " to alert other members of your household that you need them to vacate the bathroom quickly ; also , consider purchasing a supply of adult diapers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbal tea , and retire for the evening . <p> Days 1 through 10 ( and Beyond ) : <p> In the morning before drinking any lemonade , drink a quart of salt water ( remain near a toilet ) . <p> During the day drink 6 to 12 glasses of the Master Cleanse lemonade concoction . The lower number of 6 glasses is recommended for those seeking weight loss . The higher number is fine for those interested mostly in detoxification . <p> In the evening drink some herbal laxative tea . <p> You may experience dizziness , vomiting , joint pain , and weakness . You will also be really hungry . After several days many Master Cleanse dieters report entering a state of bliss that is either the result of the continuing elimination of toxins , or else a state similar to the tranquil experience that people who are starving to death have shortly before dying . <p> Note : Over the years since Stanley Burroughs death variations of the original Master Cleanse described here have developed , and attempts at clarifying ambiguous points have been made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Post Diet : Breaking the Fast <p> When are you through with the diet ? Either when you reach the number of days that you planned , or alternately , when your tongue goes from " coated and fuzzy " to a clear pink color . <p> Burroughs outlines a gentle approach for coming off the diet without upsetting your digestive system excessively . Although Burroughs recommends that you become a practicing raw foodist vegetarian after the diet to avoid recontamination with toxic dead animal flesh , he does provide an alternative transition plan for omnivores . <p> Vegetarian Transition Process <p> Days 1 and 2 : Drink several 8-ounce glasses of orange juice , sipping slowly , diluting it if there is digestive distress . <p> Day 4 and beyond : You may return to your normal diet , but Burroughs recommends continuing to drink the lemonade concoction at breakfast on a permanent basis . And he really wants you to go vegetarian , if at all possible . <p> Combine ingredients with 4 cups water , bring to a simmer , cook 20 minutes or until potatoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary . <h> Protein and the Master Cleanse <p> The Master Cleanse provides several hundred calories of carbohydrate per day in the form of lemon and maple sugar , and Burroughs recommended vegetarian diet excludes " toxic dead animal flesh . " What about protein ? In the case of protein , Burroughs says that there is no need to worry : protein is simply nitrogen , oxygen , hydrogen , and carbon . The air contains all these elements . Simple by breathing " we are able to assimilate and build the nitrogen also into our bodies as protein by natural bacteria action . " But just to be on the safe side , Burroughs also recommends eating nuts and seeds after the Master Cleanse . <h> Master Cleanse Alternatives <p> There are other cleanses out there , and many dieters spend time looking into the Master Cleanse vs. water fast , Master Cleanse vs. juice fast , and Master Cleanse vs . Colonix . <h> Beyond the Master Cleanse <p> In addition to promoting his lemonade concoction as being useful for detoxification , weight loss , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a baby formula . Mothers milk is best , but when not available Burroughs recommended feeding babies freshly prepared coconut milk , with the lemonade concoction given between coconut milk feedings , diluted a bit if the cayenne pepper upsets the baby . When the baby is weaned , it should be fed vegetarian foods like fruit , vegetables , berries , and seeds , sweetened with maple syrup . <p> Burroughs also writes of his 10- to 30-day treatment for dropsy ( edema ) , which involves going on the Master Cleanse , and then being buried in 100-pounds of coarse rock salt purchased from a feed store , followed by steam baths . <h> Quotations from Stanley Burroughs <p> On germs , viruses and epidemics : <p> " In recent times it has been believed that these many diseases are contagious and that germs have spread them . <p> " Disease , old age , and death are the result of accumulated poisons and congestion throughout the entire body .

But many of the guards , nurses and even doctors in prison came to me for help that no other system could offer . In prison I was not competing with their medical rackets , but on the outside I hurt their con games . If my system was made legal , the medical system would be of no further need .

In my opinion , earlier not later , intervention is the best course of action from both an economic and over all population health point of view . <p> The first is that I did not , nor have ever said that most people with weight to lose should lose weight . What I said in the talk was that the majority of people with weight to lose want to lose weight .

@@97603037 @1803037/ <h> Negotiating Your Hospital Bill : Offer 27% of the Chargemaster Total <p> There are two ways to change a system : working from the inside , or working from the outside . When it comes to lowering the costs of medical care , we need to do both . Heres what you can do . <p> First let 's look at the absurd cost of being a patient in a hospital . <p> If you think sticker shock only happens when you are buying a car , try being a hospital patient . Sure you are grateful that the care you got was first rate , but that should n't mean that you have to get a second mortgage on the house to pay for it . <p> Where do these charges come from anyway ? Guess what , the hospital makes them up ! They are meant to maximize the money the hospital makes . Ask any hospital administrator . Every hospital has a software billing system known as a chargemaster . <h> The secretive system that sucks you dry <p> The chargemaster includes thousands of hospital services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diagnostic evaluations . Each item in the chargemaster is assigned a unique identifier code and a set price that are used to generate patient bills . Many hospital systems maintains their own chargemaster . Like a small governmental bureaucracy , this leads to additional employees and an intricate internal structure from the chargemaster coordinator to the chargemaster team . Other hospitals outsource it to some smoke-filled room on the Vegas strip . There is little if any regulation of this industry and the . <p> " Those with good insurance or better access to means to afford quality healthcare pay the least for that care , whereas conversely uninsured , and others who pay out-of-pocket for healthcare pay the full chargemaster listed price for the same services . " <p> Only in California , which requires an online listing of costs for public view , and Maryland , which regulates hospital prices , has the chargemaster system been brought under some control , and even in California hospitals can " chargemaster " you anything they want . <p> The result of all this subterfuge is that not only ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an " infirmed " choice , but even if we could see the billing in advance , its nearly as obfuscated as output from an Enigma machine : Only an expert hospital cryptanalyst can crack it . <h> Knowledge is power <p> Prices vary from hospital to hospital like the price of gasoline from station to station . Because of this , these numbers are not as firm as they want you to believe . Think of the bill as a starting point for negotiation . You might have signed over the farm when you were first sick , but once released you have an advantage because you are out the door and feeling better , and the hospital knows this . So offer them less . How much less ? Now here 's where you really have them over a barrel of Ringers Lactate <p> Hospitals negotiated contracts with insurance companies charge much less than they want you to know . Luckily , a company called Nerdwallet is in your corner . They looked at the difference between patient charges and what hospitals contractually agreed to take from Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments , and found that Medicare only pays , on average , 27 percent of what the hospitals billed . <p> So take your phone-book-sized hospital bill , multiply it by 0.27 , and let the hospital know that the resulting figure is what you think is fair and will pay . <p> This technique also works for hospital outpatient services and with doctors in office private practice . <h> Negotiation in action <p> For example , I had an experience where I needed a less than one hour out-patient procedure and I was told the room charge alone would be $2,500 . I discussed the matter with them , and it was reduced to $400 ( Thats 16 percent , but I 'm an experienced pro ) . <p> Another tine I needed a small surgical procedure while I was between insurance carriers . I told this to the doctor , and he volunteered do the procedure for whatever Medicare paid . <p> One caveat : All this depends on your local market . In some cities its easy to negotiate , and in some cities it may be hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using Medicare . <p> I hope you wo n't ever need medical care , but the odds are that you will . I hope this information will make your medical bill less of a bitter pill to swallow ! 3780 @qwx863780 <p> Excellent . Being self-employed , I have been uninsured most of my adult life . Taking good care of myself has kept me from needing medical help most of the time . I have always find that telling doctors and urgent care clinics that I 'll be paying cash , in advance when I 'm going to see them , they have always worked with me , and I have paid a fraction of what insurance would have paid . <p> That 27% seems pretty close . One hospital ER visit I experienced , the result of a surfing accident , was billed at $3,300 for a concussion and some cuts and stitches . I paid $600 or so on my way out the door . <p> How do these discussions usually work ? In the past , whenever I 've tried any negotiating thing that anyone told me about , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to pay 27% of this bill , and that 's it , " and then how do they respond ? And how do YOU respond ? Is it just a matter of planting your heels and not backing down ? <p> Found the link to the California online chargemaster site very nice . Thanks for mentioning this ; I did n't  even know it existed : <p> I 've never done this , so take this with a grain of salt , but here 's a plan : <p> 1 . Do n't  pay anything on the bill at first . The idea is to get the hospital to think something is better than nothing . If you pay 27 percent or whatever , they have that money , and they can pressure you for the rest ( by threatening to put it into collection and on your credit record ) . Give them nothing until they agree to reissue the bill for a lower amount . <p> 2 . Decipher the bill . Research online , and most importantly , pester the hospital or doctors office with a million questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ( a ) to understand the bill and ( b ) to get the message across to the provider that you are not the type who is going to back down and go away . Figure out what each line item refers to , and research why the procedure was done , the drug was given to you , or the supplies used . <p> 3 . Once you understand the bill , start to question it and challenge it . Why did you give me that medicine ; I did n't  even have a headache ? Why did I get this dose ; the Mayo Clinic website says a smaller does is enough ? Why is this procedure charged this amount ; the California chargemaster website gives an amount half of that ? ( You can say this even if you do n't  live in California . ) Are n't  this line item and that line item different names for the same thing ? Why did you choose this thing that insurance does n't  cover rather that that thing that is covered ? This New York Times article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; why was is used ? On and on , a shotgun approach , relentless . Wear them down . As long as you 're talking with them they are not going to put it into collection . <p> 4 . This whole process should ideally start to give the provider vaguely uncomfortable thoughts . Is the patient going to make some sort of complaint to state authorities ? To medical accreditation authorities ? File a lawsuit ? Blog about it or start to hit Yelp ? Direct threats are a bad idea unless you really plan to do them in the immediate future . Do n't  threaten to sue unless you 've already spoken to a lawyer , know you have a case , have a cost estimate from the lawyer , and are O.K. with paying that . But your stick-to-it-iveness alone should make the provider want to get rid of you as soon as possible . Also , the process by this point is costing them money , eating into their profit , by all the staff time spent dealing with you . <p> 5 . Once they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think you realize that I 'm not satisfied with this bill . I 've heard your explanations , but I do n't  buy most of them . I think $x , xxx is a fair amount . Can you let me know by date if that would be acceptable , and reissue the bill in that amount ? " <p> Finally , you may end up wearing out your welcome with the provider . They do n't  have to continue to accept you as a patient . So keep that in mind . Its worth it going to the mat on a huge bill , especially if you know you can find another provide . But the bill is n't so big , you had a hard time finding a provider to accept you in the first place , and you 're already driving far away to get to the provider , maybe you should n't push quite as hard . <p> Those are useful sites . I think its easier dealing with the cost of a surgery as usually only the doctor sets this for each person . When it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more like no one individual has to accept the blame . <p> Kim ! <p> I can understand the uninsured paying a little more than the insured , but the current difference is criminal . Part of the problem is that the insured does n't  care about this . We all have to work together for change to happen . <p> Mark ! <p> Thank you for taking the time to wrote this ! Sounds like a very good , practical outline for success . One other thing that I have found helpful is appealing personally to the lowest person in the billing hierarchy . Its amazing how nice it can be knowing people in low places : - ) <p> Carla ! <p> I think insurance costs can be a nightmare for young couples just starting out ! <p> THANK YOU DR . J much need info that I did not have ! Like Carla I am really thinking abut going back to a job I am not thrilled with for health insurance . Yes , I have the CA care right now but it is still not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Costco or places like that <p> This was both incredibly helpful and infuriating ! What a valuable look behind the scenes . I had no idea how much was up for negotiation , and just hope I 'm never in the position of having to do that sort of bargaining cause I suck at it . Yikes ! <p> Hopefully most people are in much better condition when the leave the hospital and receive the bill than when they arrived . Also many tests are recommended for people to determine if they need elective procedures when time is not so critical . I understand that when time is of the essence its a different situation . <p> So grateful not to have to deal wjth this in Australia . Love the US but health system always concerned me when I was there , even when we had good insurance living there I always knew no insurance was a job loss away .

While the air filters remove viruses and bacteria , they do n't  remove engine fumes or vapors .

" <p> Professor Bagshaw notes that the acute symptoms passengers and aircrew report are " largely the same as those reported by participants in all phase 1 drug drials , being normal symptoms experienced by most people on frequent occasions . It is recognised that 70 percent of the population experience one or more of them on any given day .

Although this had been previously known , a new study has found that waist-to-hip ratio predicts heart attack risk more accurately than body mass index and is accurate for all ethnic groups . <p> A team of researchers led by Salim Yusuf of Canadas McMaster University concluded that women should have a waist-to-hip percentage of 85% or less , men , 90% or less . The waist measurement should be taken at or just above the navel when you are relaxed and not holding your breath . The hip measurement should be taken at the widest point around the buttocks . Converting fractional inches to decimal ( e.g. , 39-1/4 is 39.25 ) , divide your waist measurement by your hip measurement to determine your waist-to-hip ratio .

Self-reported waist measurements in particular tend not to be accurate . <p> Some of the shortcomings of BMI can be overcome by adding a skeletal frame measurement , such as the elbow span . <p> In addition , the new study only deals with heart attack risk .

" Okay , maybe its not quite as provocative or touchy as " Is Your Baby Racist ? " but its certainly attention-getting , which was the whole idea when it ran on Newsweeks website awhile back . The article , by Kate Dailey and Abby Ellin , endeavored to explain " Why our overweight nation hates overweight people . " <p> Its a question that I 've tossed out on this site several times in the past , although I 've avoided the word " hate , " which seems to be an awfully strong word for our national attitude toward overweight people . Then again , I do n't  see or experience things as an overweight person , being average in weight , and what may strike me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the person on the receiving end , look close enough to hate to qualify . <p> The authors of the article took a long academic look at the matter of obesity and our feelings about it , and came up with some unsurprising possible sources of antipathy to the very overweight . For openers , we as a society tend to highly value personal responsibility and discipline , and to many of us , gross overweight represents weakness , lassitude , a lack of willpower , self-indulgence or gluttony . There 's a widespread belief that fatness is always optional and avoidable . Studies have shown otherwise , but we do n't  see the studies , we just see the fat . <p> And some of us all but shriek in horror when we see it . The Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University conducted a survey of 4,000 peoples opinions regarding obesity in 2006 and turned up some quite extraordinary results . For example , that almost 50 percent of those polled said they would rather lose one entire year of their life than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather be clinically depressed , an alcoholic , or abandon their marriage than be fat , and 5 percent said they would rather lose an arm or leg . <p> Were nearing the point where heroin addiction elicits more sympathy and understanding than obesity . A lot of people are short on compassion in general these days , and frankly do n't  want to hear about , let 's say , the unavailability of healthy food or recreational opportunities in many neighborhoods . Theyll just respond with some variation on the words of David Noaz , an executive with the libertarian Cato Institution : " Most people are overweight not because there is n't a sidewalk in their neighborhood but because we like to eat and we do n't  like to exercise . " <p> For some people , the antipathy is financial . The obese have higher rates of chronic disease , and run up measurably higher medical bills than the fit and trim , and we all foot the bill for those added charges through taxes or our own health plan premiums . Fat acceptance advocates will note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and that there are overweight vegetarians , mountain climbers and distance swimmers , and that there are people who are shaped like snowmen who are nevertheless healthy as horses . True , but according to medical data those individuals are far from typical . <p> As to the question of how a national population two-thirds of which are overweight can maintain such a negative view of being overweight , Rudd Center director Marlene Schwartz offered a possible explanation . " A lot of people struggle themselves with their weight , and the same people that tend to get very angry at themselves for not being able to manage their weight are more likely to be biased against the obese . " In other words , some overweight people resent other overweight people for reminding them of themselves , like mirrors that you 're unable to avoid or cover up . <p> That 's possible , but its not my current favorite theory . My theory is that we have become an unusually frustrated , impatient and judgmental society . Things are not going as well as we would like for record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame . There 's always the government , of course , and the rightwing crazies or libtards , depending on your point of view . But fat makes an excellent whipping boy these days as well . If were not fat , hey , fat people run up medical bills and take up extra space in public transit and block the sidewalk when were in a hurry . If we are fat , well , that 's why we did n't  get that coveted job , or that relationship did n't  work out , or we can never really feel comfortable at the beach . <p> So , I think the " War on Overweight " terminology is inaccurate and overwrought . For one thing , I believe its safe to say that the American public is frankly sick and tired of war in any form these days . What 's actually going on is a kind of mass scapegoating of overweight , blaming it for our general foul mood . That 's far from being at war . Unfortunately , for the overweight , its far from being at peace as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " War on Religion , " say Hello to " War on Fat People " " <p> At the risk of being judgmental , that five percent who said theyd rather lose an arm or leg than be fatcan you say CRAZY obsessed with body image ? <p> No , really , that 's crazy . <p> " people that tend to get very angry at themselves for not being able to manage their weight are more likely to be biased against the obese . " I think we are extremely frustrated with our own inability to lose the weight we wish we could lose . I once knew someone who was obese , but did n't  see it in herself . She told me , " Thats why I do n't  have any full length mirrors in my house . If I can only see my head and shoulders , than I 'm not fat . " <p> Really ? It was her coping device .

After all , there are n't  many foods that are blue ( although those that are contain anthocyanins , cancer-fighting antioxidants that help protect against cell damage ) . <p> But there is another possible explanation for the glasses claimed effectiveness . <h> Serotonin and weight loss <p> In May 2005 a Japanese television program first reported that when the city of Glasgow , Scotland , changed some of their orangish street lights to bluish lights a mysterious effect was noticed : Glaswegians suddenly mellowed out and the citys crime rate dropped . <p> Serotonin has been connected with various effects on mood , sleep and appetite .

The appetite control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhancing the brains release of serotonin , has been blamed for causing valvular heart disease in some patients . <p> Following the Japanese television report about Glasgow , in 2006 the municipal authorities in Nono City in Japans Ishikawa Prefecture installed blue street lights as a pilot project . The results are still pending . <h> " Blue Diet Glasses " appear on the scene <p> The 2005 television report was also seen by a twenty-something Osaka entrepreneur named Yasuhira Niioda , who by that time had already spent a couple of years working with lens manufacturers to develop blue fashion sunglasses for dieting purposes . Niioda quickly finalized his design and his company , FTF , Inc. , has been marketing Blue Diet Glasses through its Blue-Diet.com Web site and other retail channels ever since . The glasses have been introduced to consumers in magazines and on television . <p> Mr. Niioda is not aware of any purchases of FTFs Blue Diet Glasses by Depp , or at least he s not telling . But if Depp went DIY and ordered his own blue lenses , he should know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to Mr. Niioda , FTFs Blue Diet Glasses filter a very specific spectral range to maximize serotonin production . <p> The editors of Japanese womens Web site My Birthday Happy organized a dietshootout between the Blue Diet Glasses and a pair of blue tinted swimming goggles .

At this point FTF is is not shipping its product to the United States , nor are online retailers like Yahoo ! Japan Shopping . <p> CalorieLab correspondent Khalilah Aleem in Japan has gotten her hands on a pair of these eyeglasses , and you can read her first-hand report in two parts , the initial experience , and the final verdict . <p> While I was away from home for medical school in a large northeastern U.

How many calories can one avoid by simply not eating so much ? Potentially 100 percent . <p> The point of articles such as this one is the hope that you will run with the uncertainty and buy a pair of bluediet sun glasses .

The weather is cold and all we want to do is curl up on the couch with some comfort food . Even the most active of us tend to be a little less motivated to stick to a fitness plan during the colder months . Lizzie Fuhr of FitSugar noticed this trend and pointed out four reasons why we gain weight in winter and how to avoid packing on the pounds . <p> First , everyone is more prone to skipping their workouts in the wintertime . When its cold outside , its far easier to change into pajamas and lounge around the house than it is to head to the gym . It seems most of us are doing just that . Fuhr suggests packing your gym bag the night before and taking it to work with you . If that still does n't  help , try morning or lunchtime workouts instead . <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow and frost , its probable that your city or town is lacking in fresh produce . Make more of an effort to find farmers markets in the area and be open-minded to less-popular vegetables . If you 're really stuck in finding greens , go the frozen route . <p> Wearing layers , a necessary evil during winter , does n't  help with your fitness goals . It allows you to hide your body under clothes that tend to hide your figure . Pump up the heat in your house and walk around in fitted clothes for a day to remind yourself of any areas you want to work on . <p> Winter comes with much longer periods of darkness , which can often trigger Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) . This disorder will have you feeling pretty depressed , but a workout might be just what you need . The endorphins you release when you exercise can help perk you right up . <p> Do you have any tips for staying healthy and active during the winter months ? <h> 4 Responses to " 4 Tips to Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan so this post certainly rings true with me . Winter is definitely more challenging as far as fitness goes and maintaining a healthy weight . I have found though , that winter can be an opportunity to get outside and either snowshoe , snow ski , either downhill or cross country , or simply take a hike in the snow . The exertion created by any of these activities are definitely worthwhile ! <p> So true Rick , however , if you are a cold weather hater , as I am , those activities do not sound inviting at all . I did recruit a friend and we decided on a workout that we do together . Accountability has helped . So we are doing this 3 times a week until nicer weather comes and we can be outside walking . We are trying though . <p> As Rick Morris said , with long winters comes the opportunity to practice winter sports . Especially cross-country skiing is a very effective fat burner . As a bonus you get fresh air and some time off from home or work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat . <p> Exercise is one of the best thing which can be done in any session . This workout help to reduce the fat from the body , if we take the supplement to our session then it become easier to lose the fat from the body . Take some nutritious food like red meat , dairy product , it is bad to take supplements with juice because sometimes in winter through juice cold can be caught but if we will take the supplement with milk it provides additional benefits to our body . <p> Our main motive is to reduce our fat and maintain our fitness and through extreme workout and food stuffs it is possible to have it .

It is a kind of ambivalence , a nagging emotional and intellectual standoff between two opposing and seemingly irreconcilable points of view . <p> On the one hand , we resolutely support the principle that people , insofar as they do no harm to others , have the right to live their lives as they choose . Along with this , we support the corollary principle that those people should be accepted and treated without prejudice or discrimination by others . These principles apply to people who are overweight , or even obese , as much as to any other group .

I do n't  have a resolution of this conflict to offer .

From Dr. Segals Cookie Diet to a Japanese diet plan called Soypal , more and more companies are cashing in on the idea that people want to lose weight while eating sweets . <p> If you 've ever considered a cookie diet , here 's a quick rundown of the major players in the market . <h> Dr. Siegals Cookie Diet <p> The first and probably most well known of the cookie diets is Dr. Siegals Cookie Diet . Dr. Sanford Siegal is a D.O . and M.D. who lives in Florida and says he first came up with the idea of treating hunger with cookies back in 1975 . He s a weight loss doctor who has written books about thyroid problems and weight loss . <p> He says on his blog that he discovered in the 1970s that hunger is the main cause of diet failures , and that a diet of around 800 calories a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastically low calories would have to be accompanied by serious appetite suppression . <p> At the same time , he says he was researching natural substances that suppress the appetite and eventually developed his cookie recipe including amino acids that are known to suppress hunger . <p> He says he went with a cookie because its small , portable and does n't  need refrigeration . He advised patients to eat six cookies a day , no other food for breakfast or lunch , and a small dinner . <p> Now the cookies are available at kiosks in malls across the country as well as online . They cost $8 for a days supply . Keeping to a low-calorie diet of around 800 to 1,000 calories a day should lead to weight loss of about 15 pounds a month , Siegal says . The company also sells diet shakes and vitamins . <p> He says more than 500,000 people have used the cookies and shakes through the years , and that they can be used as his diet plan suggests or as an alternative to less healthy snacks as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who follow the diet should always be monitored by a doctor throughout . <h> Smart for Life <p> The cookie war begins with Dr. Siegal and a Canadian doctor , Sasson Moulavi , who used to sell the Siegal cookies and use his plan in weight loss centers that were called Siegal Smart for Life . The original partnership came about in 2002 and Moulavi was forbidden from selling any products in his shops that werent the Siegal brand , and he was n't supposed to develop his own cookies , shakes or supplements , either . <p> But in 2006 he did just that , severing his ties with Siegal , changing the name of his franchises to Smart for Life and beginning to sell his own cookies , shakes and soups . Siegal says on his blog that he never shared the recipe for his cookies with Moulavi and that his products do not contain the special blend of amino acids that the Siegal cookies do . <p> Instead , the Smart for Life cookies are touted as being 60 percent organic and less expensive than other diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $9.50 a day ) . <p> In addition to the cookies , Smart for Life sells muffins , shakes , soup and dessert mixes , jams , salad dressing and coffee creamer . The company says that people can lose 12 to 15 pounds a month on the plan , and the website is full of revolving pictures of successful people who have lost 28 to 47 pounds in 22 weeks . <p> The companys rhetoric sounds a lot like Siegals , as it explains that hunger and metabolic disorders are the most common reasons people fail at diets . They say their diet is different because the meal replacing cookies eliminate hunger , and people stay motivated because they lose weight quickly week after week . <p> Though you can purchase the companys food online , the website emphasizes evaluation by a doctor at one of their diet centers ( they 're found in 12 states , the District of Columbia , and two Canadian provinces ) .

A Chapter 11 bankrupcy allows a company to stay in business while a bankruptcy court supervises a reorganization of debts and contractual obligations . <h> Hollywood Cookie Diet <p> The cookies come in three flavors and are 150 calories each .

@@97603061 @1803061/ <h> Faith-based diet , wiccan-style <p> Recent reports have pegged churches as breeding grounds for obesity , largely because of the large amounts of fatty foods often served at church social events . <p> Baptists and fundamentalist Protestants were found to be the most likely to be obese , while Seventh-Day Adventists , Mormons , Christian Scientists , and Jews and other non-Christians tended to have healthier weights . Its thought that because those religions put more of an emphasis on health ( Adventists , for example , are vegetarian ) their congregations tend to be healthier . <p> All this got us wondering on this Halloweens eve : what about people with more unconventional beliefs ? Is there , for example , a wiccan diet ? Turns out , not too surprisingly , that there are people who have written about the preferred diet for wiccans , or , more accurately , pagans . <p> As paganism is normally associated with connection to nature and reverence of the earth , it makes sense that these would be the guiding principles in a wiccan or pagan diet . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diet as a way to boost energy and think more clearly , as well as lose weight . The site did n't  offer any details and has since been closed . <p> The emphasis in a pagan or wiccan diet is acknowledging where food comes from . Some people eat meat , some do not , but all are mindful of the origin of their food and eating appropriately for the season . In a way eating is a spiritual practice and its likely there are more vegetarians and vegans ( or even just people who eat organic foods ) among pagans than are in the general population , though a special diet is far from required . <p> But can eating a wiccan diet actually help you lose weight ? I 'm sure if you went from eating a normal Western diet to an all organic or vegetarian diet , you would probably lose weight because of the decrease in sugar and processed foods in your diet . And if diet is n't enough , you can cast a weight loss spell or take a weight lossbath to help you along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss spell for you . <p> Before you start thinking that casting a little spell will make weight loss easy , check out this weight loss spell . You 'll need a green candle and a crystal , and should perform the ceremony outside during a waning moon , on a Saturday if possible . And you 're supposed to carry the crystal around with you and take it out every time you sit down to eat something . This is to remind you to ask yourself if you really need to eat . <p> Also , because " the Goddess helps those who help themselves , " the site recommends you eat sensibly and exercise while the spell is working . Sounds like a regular diet to me , except you 've got to carry around a crystal all the time . <h> 16 Responses to " Faith-based diet , wiccan-style " <p> Interesting article . I just wanted to point out one thing : Seventh-Day Adventists and Mormons are Christians , but your article refers to them as non-Christian . I can not say anything about Christian Scientists as I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied the SDA beliefs , I can firmly tell you that both are very Christian . Editors note : We added a word to the post to make this clearer . <p> No . There 's no " pagan " diet . Furthermore , Pagans and Wiccans are not the same thing . Not even a little bit . Pagan is a term that encompasses many faiths . Wicca is one of those faiths , and it may have absolutely nothing in common with another faith that falls under the pagan umbrella . <p> Well , Wiccans or Pagans are not that healthy . There are a lot of very overweight people in these communities for a variety of reasons . The obesity and sedentary problems in this country are a regional issue , not a religious one . <p> For one , you can try to eat healthy , but Americans put corn syrup in everything . Corn syrup confuses the brain , blocking the chemical that tells us when we are full . That is one major problem . <p> Another : highly refined carbohydrates . They taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toll on the kidneys and the stomach like sugar . Germans call our white bread cale , for a reason . <p> We fry everything , from potatoes , to meat , bread , ice cream , and candy . We stick everything in grease , load it up with butter and lard . and then wonder why our thighs look like 10 pounds of lard in a 5-pound bag . <p> Our highly processed , refined , sweetened diet is unhealthy . You do n't  have to be a Pentecostal to get that . <p> When Pagans have to have " dialog " because people who are so large are arguing for wheel chair access to outside camping events , then clearly the mainstream religions have nothing on us . <p> The whole food processing industry is in dire need of an overhaul , just like everything else in this country . <p> I thought it was a pretty good article . I do n't  expect a diet website to know the ins and outs of religion , but it makes many great points . <p> I think what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do tend to look to the ancestors for our recipes if not in every day life , at least on our sabbats . We do tend to be more conscious of where our food comes from at least that 's the way its been with most Pagans/Wiccans Ive met . <p> Yes , we Americans have very bad eating habits , and its hard to eat on the run , and still eat healthy . I 'm very happy to hear talks of a ban on trans fats . Its a step in the right direction . We do also have to drop our hang-up on sugar . Its killing us . <p> All in all , good article . For those who do n't  study the topic , its a great into into both nutrition and Paganism . <p> Very interesting article . However I do have to agree with Steph . Most of the wiccans and pagans that I know are moderately overweight , and some are even obese . <p> I do have one friend that is a stay at home mom with loads of extra time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband actually still hunts live game , and they do their only grocery shopping at whole food stores . Not everyone has the time or energy to spend living this type of lifestyle . <p> However , it is very cost effective because of all the money that you do n't  spend on eating out , buying prepackaged processed corn syrup- and gluten-filled , high market foods . They also take a bus or ride a bike , or even walk , rather than driving , ( a majority of the time they do own a car ) . <p> Its also good to recycle plastics , glass , and cans . In some areas they actually give you a cash refund . <p> So weve covered cost effectiveness . How about convenience ? Well , what 's more convenient ? Living out of your car eating take out , eventually getting sick and leaving the ones you love to pay your medical and funeral benefits , or taking a page from the book of our ancestors and working hard to reap a healthful lifestyle that we can pass on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree that we all should be more health conscious . I also agree that it is hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle because of what most companies put in their foods . <p> I am unfortunately unable to maintain a vegetarian diet . I am allergic to soy and peanuts and their products and byproducts . I stay away from soy as much as I can , but it is difficult since it is in almost everything in some form or another . Peanuts are easier to stay away from , but I have to watch out for peanut oil . <p> Because of this , I am unable to be vegetarian and must get my protein from meats without fillers ( such as soy ) . Because I am in a religion wherein , i believe , the majority of practitioners are vegetarian ( wicca ) , I have come up with something to justify this lifestyle . Humans are naturally omnivores , eating both plants and animals . We have done so since the beginning of humans . I am only doing what is natural for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eating are not natural , but that humans are suited to eating both , and have the ability to eat one or the other or both . <p> I am quite large , but I am trying to diet , and by using moderation , not starving myself , I have lost several inches from my waistline . I am also trying to make healthier choices . I use the new Edys frozen yogurt instead of ice cream , and I am eating this nice organic mac and cheese when I can get it . <p> This is one way to lose weight , but you have to make your own diet that suits you best . That is the best diet , and you will lose more weight and be more responsible for yourself . I do not think there is some magick spell that will make you lose weight , but faith can help in achieving your goals . <p> I thought this article was pretty well done . Ive been pagan for nearly 20 years now , and I 've met a lot of overweight pagans then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " fattest states " in the US . Were all about eating bratwursts , bagels and beer . We 've got plenty of obesity , among all faiths . <p> At a recent gathering of pagans and Wiccans , someone made a comment to me about the seemingly larger proportion of pagans who are overweight ( as opposed to non-pagans , I suppose ) . I wonder if this is because pagans are more comfortable with their body type than non-pagans ? Maybe were just more accepting of the fact that we do n't  have to be stick-thin to be happy ? <p> most of the pagans and wiccans you know who are overweight or obese are probably examples of those people using unconventional faiths as a social crutch . to say that " most pagans are overweight " means that you 're referring to this segment of the population who has turned to paganism because they ca n't cope with social norms imposed upon them . its pretty ludicrous in the end . ive been a practicing wiccan for a decade and am slim , work in the fashion industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just a wiccan. it sounds like the " overweight wiccans " you 're talking about are the people in st louis hanging out around hot topic and going to conventions , not the women who are out being ambitious and living as wiccans in a way that is complimentary to them , not their entire excuse for not being mainstream . there are other ways to stand out and be different than wielding your sacred religion as a badge . wiccanism is n't a fall-back on an excuse . its a life spirit . get off your asses and get with the program and soar , do n't  hide behind the faith ! <p> I totally agree that there seems to be a disproportionate number of overweight people within Paganism , and I am one of them . Ive thought about it . For my own situation , I have often felt that people who are more " wounded " in life might migrate towards alternative belief systems , and they might also have found ways to fill voids in their lives with food . <p> There is some connection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very overweight people are some of the deepest thinking people I know . This is not to say thinner people are n't  that way , but I 've found more among heavy people in my own life . I think they think over many aspects of their lives moreso than perhaps others do , have experienced more sadness they are eating to " solve " , and can not find a place among traditional faiths because there are so many contradictions among themso many hypocritical issues . Also , traditional faiths do not empower the person very well . They encourage handing over control of the persons life to Deity , surrendering , leaning not on the persons own understanding , etc . Paganism tends to encourage free-though , introspection , and personal empowerment . I think these concepts are attractive to those who have had a lot of sadness and disappointment in their lives , whether fat or thin . For me , the joy of coming to Paganism was aligning myself with what seemed normal . There was no one with their sacred book between me and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to be and how I had to act to be " holy " to Deity . <p> These are just some generalizations , and not all the answers , to be sure . I agree with the post that says many hide behind their faiths , trying to impress others with their " uniqueness " rather than living life and empowering themselves . I continue to work on my own issues with weight , and I feel that when one day I am truly in balance I will no longer use food to fill up some vaccum inside . <p> I have to say ALL of you pretty retarded . To say that all pagans are overweight or most for that matter is just sterotypical . My , my are we still doing this , really ? Its like saying all women are emotional or all men want only sex . If that is honestly what you believe then you are really nieve . You should all just grow up and take a look outside the box .

I am currently looking up many things from Wicca as I am converting . I read this , because I want to know everything and anything to do with Wicca and this article caught my attention . It may just sound like a normal diet while carrying a crystal , but think of it this way . The diet reminds them to keep their thoughts on becoming healthier . The Goddess gives reminder by using her crystal to remind us that if we do not need to eat it , then we should not . And her followers will turn to eat when they need it , and soon will lose the weight . The Magick is in the mind and heart . <p> This is the funniest crap I have read in a looong time !

Yes , some of us ARE obese over here , but the general percentage of obesity is lower . Especially in wiccans here . In other Pagans too , as a matter of fact . But " Sounds like a regular diet to me , except you 've got to carry around a crystal all the time " , I think , is perhaps an assumption without trial ?

I would have done a double take , but he was unfortunately moving too fast for closer inspection . Then a few days later near Pere Lachaise cemetery I saw the same thing but in blue this time . <p> The second mask sighting calmed my worries that I had imagined the whole thing and led me to believe that the first guy is not the lone crazy circling Paris with some sort of air filter mask or carbon monoxide gas mask strapped to his head . <p> Gas masks make me think of war zones soldiers surrounded by land mines and unbreathable air . In civilian areas I associate them with crazies convinced that wearing a mask is going to help them survive while the rest of us perish due to bird flu or SARS . Have major metropolitan areas become a polluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are gas mask companies simply taking advantage of unsuspecting hypochondriacs ? <h> Face mask air filters for pollution common in Europe <p> Not knowing exactly where to begin investigating , I started by searching the Internet for " gas masks " and " city/urban biking . " In English there was n't a whole lot , but the same search in French was far more fruitful . It appears that while cycle masks are relatively unheard of in the states , in European cities with more bikes and often more pollution , they are far more common . <p> There are a handful of companies that specialize in producing air filtering masks specifically designed for cyclists . Theyre intended to cut out noxious gases like nitrogen oxide , carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide as well as particulates like asbestos dust from brake linings and black smoke from diesel emissions . Most models cost around $50 . <h> Air pollution masks may not actually be helpful <p> Determining whether these masks are really necessary proved harder than finding the link to have one shipped immediately to my home . On one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less pollution than people in cars . <p> This may seem counterintuitive since the stink of motor vehicles is far less noticeable when were in one . But air pollutants are densest in the middle of traffic . Just above or on the side of a pileup , emissions levels are significantly lower . Since a cars air intake is located low to the ground not far from other cars exhaust pipes drivers and passengers are generally inhaling anywhere from two to eight times as many pollutants as cyclists and pedestrians . Also bikers are generally inclined to choose smaller roads , avoiding cars and again lowering the amount of pollution they are exposed to . <h> Affordable Kanco Eezy Breethe in Top 3 , but hard to find <p> Another important bit of information I found when evaluating the utility of gas masks is that quite a few brands fail to protect cyclists from many of the gasses and particulates that they claim to . A test done by " Health Which ? " magazine found that brands like Airwear and Freeway Basics did not pass the European Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indication of quality . In fact , the least expensive brand Kanco Eezy Breethe scored among the top three masks . <p> " Perfect for Burning Man ! " <p> " I do n't  cough like a chronic smoker on the lung transplant list anymore . " <p> " As a woman I 'm in danger of harassment while biking in Los Angeles , but the mask intimidates people from saying or doing anything . " <p> Unfortunately , the " Health Which ? " study was done in 1998 , and there does n't  appear to have been a follow-up test since . When I searched for the Kanco Eezy Breethe I found tons of cyclists forums all discussing the same BBC article that covered this study , but nothing in terms of how to get the mask , so it appears no longer to be manufactured . <h> Respro cycling masks ranked highly <p> A company called Respro , maker of the Respro Techno Mask , produced the other two masks that ranked highly . They incorporate in some models both an activated charcoal cloth filter and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrict airflow and thus reduce maximum aerobic capacity somewhat , but valves allow exhaled air to escape without restriction . It all comes down to a tradeoff between comfort and aerobic capacity on the one hand , and air quality on the other . <p> For the less fashion conscious , Dust Bee Gones fabric masks are hand washable , and surprisingly expensive considering that they look like hospital surgery masks . I Can Breathe ! brand masks are only a notch more attractive than Dust Bee Gone , but they claim to have been used by some athletes during the Beijing Olympics ( which sport and which country they represented is n't disclosed ) . <h> If it makes you feel better while you bike <p> Since bikers placement along the periphery of traffic already shields them from some pollution and not all masks filter as much as they claim , gas masks do n't  seem to be the most essential piece of equipment for the urban cyclist . But then I think back to that list of pollutants that some masks prevent from entering your lungs : carbon monoxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcinogens . <p> They say that walking along Marylebone Boulevard in London for 45 minutes is the equivalent of smoking one cigarette . So , I guess one could argue that wearing a gas mask while cycling is about as logical as not smoking in the effort to protect ones lungs . But along that logic , we should also wear them while walking in the city and especially while driving . <h> Bicycle masks not for the self-conscious <p> In sum , determining whether these air filtration masks are " necessary " when riding in polluted areas is extremely subjective . Its true that there are some nasty gasses and particles floating around busy streets . If you 're willing to brave sweating under a synthetic mask while pedestrians like myself spin around to get a better look , gas masks will protect you from at least some of these pollutants . <p> Thanks for this informative article .

He is currently conducting a second clinical trial on the diet , involving 550 extremely obese people , which will end in 2009 . <p> Obesity is spreading around the world in part because people are focusing on the quantity of food they eat rather than the nutritional value . Reducing food portion sizes is a major factor in managing obesity . <p> I think that eating large volumes of food gradually stimulates and motivates the gluttony center of the brain ( hippocampus ) to ask for larger volumes of food . Also , I believe that seeing people eating large volumes of food encourages other people to imitate them , and these behaviors could lead them to enter a vicious circle . <p> I believe that we can reverse this vicious circle by the Luqaimat diet . <h> What is Luqaimat ? <p> Luqaimat is an Arabic word for the minimum amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to keep fit . In January 2005 , I created a new definition for it , meaning the smallest volume of food that could satiate ones psychological hunger . <p> Each Luqaimat may be a half or full serving of fruit , vegetable , a small piece of bakery , sweets , or chocolate , or three to five units of nuts , and so on , repeated about every two hours . <p> In 2005 , I initiated the practice of Luqaimat with my patients , and 313 of them completed the study for 18 months . They lost 70 percent to 103 percent of their extra weight ( ranging from 14.2 kilograms to 102 kilograms ) within 18 months , and were able to maintain their new weight . <p> My obese patients were trained to challenge themselves to eat the least amount they could at seven to 10 Luqaimat per day . These Luqaimat canceled the need for regular meals ; instead they ate a moderate-sized " combo meal , " which included two cups of green salad with one table spoonful of olive oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starch , one piece of meat ( preferred fish or poultry ) , and a small piece of sweets . <p> A key factor for the success of this diet plan is to convince obese patients that Luqaimat are not used for satiety , yet they are sufficient for providing energy and for suppressing the hunger hormone ghrelin , which is secreted by the gastric mucosa every three or four hours . The Luqaimat also satisfys the sense of taste and helps train the brain centers to become accustomed to these very small volume of food ( which I call hippcampul neuroplasticity ) . <p> Luqaimat training is linked to the pleasure , success and reward parts of the brain since it involves eating small portions of favorite foods and losing one or two kilograms weekly . This helps people stick with the plan because they find it easy to be satisfied and they progressively lose weight . <p> My patients lost an average of 4 kilograms of body weight each month on regular basis till they approached BMI of around 25 . Three of my patients have even succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My innovative diet has become widespread in Egypt and I am very pleased that it is applied now by numerous Egyptian dietitians in managing their obese patients .

It also seems to have long-lasting effects and is helpful for lowering high blood sugar levels among diabetic patients .

Orlistat is sold under the brand name Xenical , while sibutramine is sold as Meridia . Sibutramine is an appetite suppressant , while orlistat is known as a lipase inhibitor , which means it interferes with the bodys ability to absorb fat .

Further , many insurance companies will not pay for drug treatments for weight loss , because it is not seen as a chronic disease . Still , if you are dangerously obese ( drugs are usually only prescribed to those with a BMI of 30 and above ) a weight loss drug can help you get on the road to recovery .

The FAA gives airlines many options in how to ensure safe weight and balance , including actually weighing each passenger the best , but usually not done to avoid alienating the customers and asking each passenger his or her weight , which , according to FAA rules , must be increased by 10 pounds , since that 's about the extent to which most people will lie about their weight . <p> But most airlines just use a rule-of-thumb approved by the FAA based on the number of passengers and the male-female ratio .

Very little , according to Dr. Raul Artal , professor and chairman of obstetrics at St. Louis University School of Medicine . Even for a normal weight woman , Dr. Artal recommends no more than 10 to 14 pounds of weight gain , just enough to account for the fetus , placenta , amniotic fluid , increased blood volume , and breast enlargement . <p> These recommendations clash with the current guidelines , which recommend 15 pounds of weight gain even for obese women , 15 to 25 pounds for overweight women , and 25 to 35 pounds for normal weight women . Dr. Artals recommendations are considered extreme by many , but a consensus is developing that the current guidelines recommend too much weight gain , and the Institute of Medicine is planning to convene a committee to reconsider the 15-year old recommendations in light of current research . <p> The issue is especially acute because more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obese even before pregnancy .

@@97603092 @1803092/ <h> Fake food allergy epidemic raging among kids <p> Researchers from the University of Portsmouth ( U.K. ) have discovered the reason why food allergies have increased in recent years : hypochondria . It turns out that four out of five kids who believes he or she is allergic to a food , is n't . <p> The researchers surveyed over 1,500 children , along with their parents , about food allergies and intolerances . Then they tested those who reported problems , both with skin fold tests and by feeding them the offending food . The results were completely unexpected . <p> Lead investigator Dr. Taraneh Dean said , " We were surprised that such a high proportion of people in this age group perceived they had a problem . What this study suggests is that there is a public perception of an increase in FHS food hypersensitivity syndrome , which is not borne out by objective clinical assessment . " <p> About 12% of children claimed to have adverse reactions to a food , with peanuts , dairy products , wheat , and fish the most common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an " intolerance , " and some with an actual allergy . <p> In recent years claims have been made of a sharp increase in food allergies , including peanut allergies , attributed variously to the roasting of peanuts , the use of soy-derived substances in skin creams , and the feeding of peanut products to infants . In reality , only 100 adults and children die link dead from link rot , but here 's another estimating 150-200 deaths per year in the entire United States of anaphylaxis caused by any sort of food allergy . Nevertheless , many school cafeterias have eliminated peanuts form their menus because of claims that some students " can not be in the same room as peanut butter . " <p> A spokesman for Allergy U.K. , an organization of people with real food allergies , expressed worry that if hypochondriacs continue to claim that they have an allergy , " those who really do will find it increasingly hard to be taken seriously .

Of the 14% of infants who responded positively to open food challenges , only 6% actually had sensitivities when tested using double-blind , placebo-controlled food challenges . <p> The researchers emphasized the need for more accurate allergy and food sensitivity testing in order to avoid condemning children to an unnecessarily restricted diet and the possibility of inadequate nutrition . <p> Update : February 14 , 2008 <p> A double-blind study is described here in which children with peanut allergies were exposed to peanut and other aromas , with no significant allergic reaction . Without contact with peanut protein , there can be no allergic reaction , but particulate peanut protein , for instance in peanut shelling factories , may cause mild allergic reactions along the lines of hay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fake food allergy epidemic raging among kids " <p> Wanye , via Whitney , just sent us a very interesting news piece at CalorieLab about baby feeding myths and obesity . I was really surprised to read that our western notions of starting kids off with bland foods in the name of health is probably bunk , bu <p> I am so disgusted with this article . As a mother of a child with severe food allergies ( yes , they were tested via skin and blood tests ) this article just gives the notion that this the problem of the day for some people . This is a real and highly deadly problem for many people . The reason " only " 100 people die a year from peanut allergies is because of research and life-saving products like the EpiPen . Those with food allergies are covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act and schools are required to accomodate them . So if one child in a school of 1,000 cant have peanuts in the room ; guess what ? That one childs life is more important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I am tired of the eye rolling and exasperated here-we-go-again attitude about food allergies and intolerances ( and the use of " merely an intolerance in this article is cruel and insulting ) . <p> I hope the author of this article and the publisher of this site never have to endure this type of treatment and have to fight the myth that this is all in their heads . <p> Is the choice really between a childs life and the right of 999 children to have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ? I think its more accurate to characterize is as a choice between a very small chance of a child dying and the right to eat peanut butter , since the child is only going to die if he comes into contact with the peanuts to an extent to produce a fatal reaction and the EpiPen is n't around . <p> The ADA does n't  require absolute identical accomodation of the disabled and the non-disabled . As the statute has been interpreted by the courts , it weighs the expense and disruption to others of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example , schools are not required to accomodate " bubble boys " by requiring clean-room suits for students and staff and rebuilding of the school with hypoallergenic materials and tented buildings . Supplying tutors to go to the boys home is sufficient . <p> I 'm not sure whether the peanut issue under the ADA has actually been litigated to the appellate level or whether schools have just accomodated kids without challenging it in court . But even if it has reached the courts , the result would depend on the specific case . When a child " ca n't be in the same room as a peanut , " it seems like its starting to approach bubble boy territory , and a reasonable accomodation would be to supply the child with another room to eat a brown bag lunch away from the other children . If in addition to peanuts the child had multiple other food allergies where the school menu would be severely restricted , I 'm pretty sure courts would accept a separate eating location . If a child couldnt even be around children who had recently eaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be appropriate . <p> The other particularly interesting article on the site was about " Fake Food Allergies " . This is something that has been nagging me since we started hearing all the warnings about kids and allergies . The warnings we 'd hear about usually involved not feeding your kid one food or another before they could do long division because they might develop an allergy . According to the article , about 80% of " allergies " that kids have ( likely as told to them by their parents ) are simply not real ! Our culture of fear has created a nation ( or two .. the study was in the UK ) of hypochondriac parents . Its like the folks who think they are allergic to milk when in fact they probably have a mild case of lactose intolerance . I always wondered how we had evolved to this point and still maintained such severe reactions to something as life-giving as food . <p> I 'm 21 now and allergic to a wide variety of foods , including peanuts . Ive been tested at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , and I think its safe to assume I really am allergic to these substances and do n't  just believe that I am . <p> I 'd just like to say two things . Firstly , my congratulations to Shannon for being such a conscientious parent . My mother had to put up with a lot of " eye-rolling " from doctors when I was a kid and she was trying to get treatment for my anaphylaxia , asthma , and severe excema . Now I 'm old enough to appreciate the huge effort she put in and the impact my allergies had on my family . <p> And secondly , I 'm inclined to agree with you to an extent , Stephen . I 'm better lately , but when I was younger , I could n't be in a room with nuts , or close to people who had just eaten them . But its my life that 's at threat here and I have to take responsibility for it and remove myself from dangerous situations . I 'm also allergic to many common foods , such as lettuce , apples , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked other people to accomodate my allergies completely . <p> Although , having said that , peanuts do seem to be the most common cause of reaction for anaphylactics , so I do support a ban on them in schools , and perhaps other public places . Its not an issue of the non-allergic childrens right to eat a peanut butter sandwich at school . Rather , its a social issue of understanding other peoples needs and give and take . I 'm sure most children would rather forgo a peanut butter sandwich if they knew it could harm or kill one of their classmates . <p> I have several allergies to seafood , I carry an EpiPen with me at all times . <p> I am tired of the eye rolling and the attitudes that people have toward people with these problems . I am tired of restaurants frying seafood items in the same place as their non seafood items . I cant eat anything fried in restaurants because of the fear that I may get a severe reaction from cross-contamination . I am also tired of waiters rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he or she can explain to the chef to be careful in preparing my dish . Who knows if they will clean the surface of a cutting board or a knife that they used on seafood before they prepare my dish ? My health is as literally in their hands as a childs welfare is in the hands of the school they are attending . <p> How do you think people like us feel ? Do you think we want this problem ? To live a life in fear when you dine out , or in the case of a student , going to school ? <p> I can assure you that it is not fake . My son had just turned a year old when I discovered his severe food allergy . <p> I did n't  even understand what severe food allergies entailed , and I had never heard of anaphylaxis , so I could not have been biased . I simply gave him his first taste of peanut butter and he immediately developed a red rash around his mouth . I then noticed a wheezing sound when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described what was going on . I was directed to hang up and call 911 ! I did . <p> I was still oblivious as to how severe the situation was . It was n't until the end of the ER visit that the doctors explained that my son almost lost his life ! He was in anaphylactic shock ! <p> It is real . Unfortunately ! He is four now and still reacts to the prick test in the allergy office . He is also allergic to eggs and tree nuts . <p> What about a person who passes the prick tests , and the doctor says she has no allergies , but who will usually not eat in restaurants or social functions where she ca n't be sure something she 's allergic to isnt in the food ? But then sometimes will . A person who will each white bread at a restaurant one day and wont eat it at a social function the next week ( not having access to ingredients at either setting ) ? A person who has cut out all foods and built her options back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by eating them ) and discovering with this method what she 's allergic to ? <p> Being with a person like this requires much special attention and accomodation . Food is a big part of most social interaction . This has a huge impact on interacting with this person , although we try not to make a big deal out of it one way or the other . <p> I spend time with children with severe allergies and do n't  roll my eyes . But I am very confused by the person I have described above . Its the inconsistencies and the lack of medical backing that give me pause . If the accomodations did n't  impact me and my family socially , I would think its none of my business . But I feel controlled by someone who seems to be faking a huge number of food allergies . <p> If someone is inconsistent ( wont eat a food one time , will next ) and doing this on her own the way I 've described , is n't that faking it ? <p> By the way , we have never rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always responded with due respect and attempted accomodation while trying not to make a big deal . <p> My husband and I have a friend who also would eat things that she was allergic to and often we wondered about those allergies . However about three years ago , he developed allergies to a bunch of foods which resulted in a full body rash that lasted over a week and did not respond to any home remedies . <p> Since our home remedies were not helping and the steroids and allergy meds that he was given did n't  resolve all of the rash problems , we took him to an allergist who did a blood test and later a scratch test on him . From that we found out about a number of foods that he was allergic to . What we have found over time is that some of the foods only cause mild reactions such as an itchy scalp , or itchy eyes . while others make him very uncomfortable . We also found that the quantity matters with some of the foods , so he can eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him hives . However , with some foods , like avocados , only one bite will give him terrible stomach pain and heart burn . His allergies are considered part of the oral allergy syndrome . <p> Then my son was born , he had symptoms that turned out to be food allergies . I found that as soon as the foods that were bothering him were eliminated from my diet , his symptoms resolved , and when I accidentally ate something that he was allergic to the symptoms would start up again . With his allergies , any small amount will cause the symptoms and these are the true allergies . For most people true allergies are limited to dairy , eggs , soy , wheat , nuts , &amp; fish . <p> For those of you who are annoyed by not being able to cook for your friends with allergies , my advice to you is to relax . Your friends are probably more stressed out by your worrying about what you can feed them than they are about what they will eat . <p> For those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of advice on another website that recommended bringing a dish with you to any party that you know you can eat , or that your child can eat , to that you too can enjoy good food , and the host/hostess is less stressed . <p> This is a maddening article for someone with celiac disease ( autoimmune-based allergy to wheat gluten ) . <p> Wheat gluten is an ingredient in many food additives , so any consumer who is n't a chemist will have no idea where it will show upit can be found in anything from pickles to potato chips , even though you 'd think its only in obvious wheat products like bread and cereal ! <p> I was bedridden with severe fatigue , chronic diarrhea and abdominal painin my 20suntil I was diagnosed with the disease . This disease affects 1 in 300 people in Americathat means approximately one million people . Hardly a " rare " problem . Despite this , I cant eat at 9 out of 10 restaurants . Usually no one at the reastaurant has any idea which of their meals contain gluten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple chain restaurants that have altered their menus to contain one or two entrees that I can eat . And even this meager selection is only available because of the efforts that people have made to raise FOOD ALLERGY AWARENESS . <p> While it may be true that only 2.3 percent of kids acutally have food allergies , but twelve percent report themthis is no reason to stop pushing for greater awareness of this REAL PROBLEM . Sorry folks , 2.3 percent of the population is a LOT of people . <p> Peanut allergies are not as " real " as one might think only because it is parents of these allergic children who strive so impose their own will on others . Working with students for many years in K-12 and in higher education as an ADA coordinator , I will tell you that one does not see this in later years once the parent is out of the picture . The rush to reinforce a parents behavior by K-12 systems as attention seeking has brought on the real victims in their children . So yes , peanuts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an actual allergy . <p> Steptoe , I am the parent of a peanut allergic child and I disagree with your assessment that parents behave the way they do because they are seeking attention or wanting to impose their will on others . The last thing my child wants is to stand out for being different . However , I do need to be an advocate for his personal safety . As for not seeing these so-called demands once the child is out of school , I assume that the child , now a young adult , is able to manage his allergy independently just as he or she would manage most other personal matters . <p> My son was the first child with a peanut allergy to attend his public elementary school and I found that the staff and faculty knew very little about food allergies . I made an information sheet that I distributed to everyone who has contact with my child that has his name and picture and includes basic guidelines , possible symptoms of a reaction , and emergency phone numbers ( both parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kept in the nurses office and he sits at a separate table in the cafeteria . About the only real " demands " I have are that I be notified ahead of time of special treats or snacks so I can provide a safe alternative and that peanuts and tree nuts not be used in any activity in his classroom , the art room or the science room . Currently , there are four children out of the 800 or so who attend this school who have peanut allergies and as far as I know , only one has had a reaction at school , which was treated with Benadryl . <p> While relatively few people are at risk for actual life threatening reactions , many do suffer intolerances which cause uncomfortable symptoms that affect life QUALITY . <p> Unfortunately , articles such as this one dismiss parental concerns about the well being of their children . The bottom line is that a parents wishes regarding their childrens food should be respected . Dismissing food allergies as statistically insignificant and suggesting that most are simply a product of hypochondria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because those in positions of authority do n't  take the time and energy to understand whether a reportedly allergic child is truly at risk or the parent has ulterior motives . <p> It hurts no one to take certain precautions and reduce exposures .

One is for toads . One is for bullfrogs . One is for cranberry-apple ( cranapple ) juice . One is for water . One is for eating fat . One is for eating oil . One is for using shortening . One if for the real deal . <p> Now out of those 200 , which do you think are real ? <p> The only allergy I listed above is eggs .

Then along come the so-called experts spouting statistics and obscure reports , spreading hostility and making it even harder for these kids to survive . Even tabloid journalists have more integrity than put the lives of children at risk . <p> Great . A whole bunch of " Oh , but MY baby is SOOOO deathly allergic to peanuts ! " comments . <p> You people are the problem . There have been *dozens* of studies that have proven that most of the people that think they 're allergic to peanuts *do not* actually have an allergy to them , much less an anaphylactic reaction . <p> To the above commenters , I do n't  think this article is saying that no peanut allergies exist ( I know I read that 2-6% of those infants had allergies ) .

They certainly like to eat out a lot . <p> I have come to think that if some people are really that bad , then nature should be allowed to take its course . I could never be friends with someone who goes on about allergies .

However small the chance of a child dying from sitting next to someone eating a peanut butter sandwich is , that death is preventable . Its no great inconvenience to avoid eating peanut butter sandwiches . There are nearly infinite choices of things to have for lunch , and peanuts are only one dull choice . <p> Its undeniable that the enormous growth in the amount of kids with peanut allergies over the last decade or so has to have some reason , but its too simple and uninformed to blame it all on fakers . <p> Peanut allergies are a hoax , a cry for attention .

We have had frightening experiences and " almost death " experiences . I have to say that I am scared to death for my brother sometimes , but the doctor tells us that the only thing we can do to ensure his saftey is never let him leave the house and that is impractical .

An allergy is the body mistaking something benign , like a peanut protein for something bad ( like a virus ) and using the immune system to fight it . Thus no one can be allergic to something the first time . They must be exposed to it , the body must misclassify it and treat it as something for the immune system to deal with . The SECOND time the body will attack it . <p> I recall the John Hopkins study show that not one single person in their study was allergic to chocolate in double blind studies . They could n't even produce a reaction . Yet 40% of those same people when told they were given chocolate would develop hives and breathing problems that requied epi pens and such . <p> I do not have a food allergy but I 'm extremly allergic to bees 2 years ago at my sisters baby shower I steped on a yellow jacket I dropped to the floor screaming because my leg burned and it was shooting pain throughout my legI then started to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat it was n't for a friend with what do u know a peanut allergy she had an epie pen I would have died from anaphylaxis so I belive ppl do have food allergies even though some can be mild so if someone is gon na get an epie pen at least you might be able to save a life one dayI now carry an epi pen ! <p> When I was a kid , my mom told my I was allergic to cheese , corn , and chocolate . Guess which ones I was really allergic to ? The thing is that if you tell your kids theyll have a reaction to something , they often WILL . The mind is incredibly powerful and little kids will take to heart what their parents will say . At least my mom never insisted on the school catering to me , no matter how much she loved telling people about my " allergies . " When every other kid in my class got corn-syrup laden popsicles as a treat , guess what suitable alternative I got ? Nothing . <p> Growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soy , bee stings , and gluten . <p> I could n't eat out with my sports team , or at friends houses . I had to sit at another table for lunch at school , facing ridicule , and rollling eyes . I ate some seriously nasty food , for the sake of " safety " . Not to mention , everytime I got sick I could n't take the pink medicine my friends said tasted good , but rather sulfa drugs which tasted well like sulfa ! Playing outside was difficult too since bees were every where . Yet , my mother was always around to make sure I was safe . <p> THEN at the age of 14 I was at a friends house eating what I was told were gluten free brownies ( best browinies ever ) when my friend suddenly blurted out that they werent really gluten free . Needless to say , I totally panicked . I 'd been told my whole life I was allergic , and here I was having eaten a fat mans bounty of brownies . Guess what ? I did n't  get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just had tummy problems as a kid , and my mom assumed it was the gluten , and to be on the safe side soy too . <p> This had me thinking . <p> well , with my eppi-pin in had i was on a mission to get stung by a bee . Believe it or not , this is not an easy task and also , incredibly stupid . <p> After a few hours of running like a mad woman around the park by my friends house I found a bee and smacked it . It stung me . <p> oh wow did it hurt . <p> BUT , I was n't allergic . <p> Turns out , my mom was allergic ( or so she says ) and wanted to play it safe by saying I was allergic to them too . <p> A few days later I ate some peanut butter cookies and was FINE . But what about the rash I had gotten when I was little ? <p> An ongoing REAL allergy to fabric softener . My grandmother who used to make peanut butter cookies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the only time she did my laundry . I was never allergic to peanuts . <p> The last thing was penicillin . <p> That was around 3 years later when I got a bad infection and the doctor asked if i had any allergies . I said nope . And voila . no penicillin allergy either . <p> I had lived my entire childhood till age 14 without really being able to LIVE it . <p> How many other kids are going through the same thing ? <p> Well <p> my neighbors kids for one . <p> Peanut allergies . <p> Then my daughter gave then some of our special thai noodles . <p> the kids loved it . <p> they ate it every time they came over ( its one of the few things my 9 yr old can make ) <p> one day I was saw her whipping some up and I yelled " NO ! ! there 's peanuts in there ! " <p> The kids started holding their throats and acting like they were dying just cuz they were in the same room as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STOP ! ! " then . " have you ever eaten the thai noodles ? " <p> they all nodded . <p> " how many times " <p> every day they replied <p> " it always has peanut butter in it . you 've been eating a cup a day " <p> suddenly they stopped coughing . <p> i told my neighbor who then rushed her kids to the hospital anyway , but come on . seriously ? ? <p> These allergies are a trend . <p> A trend , that can actually end up making the allergy real if people keep avoiding it the plague <p> I take this article to be inaccurate and , as if it were a personal attack , particularly offensive . <p> Severe food allergies are very real . I have had a severe peanut allergy since my toddler years ( possibly birth ) and still suffer one as a high school student . I found that those who are not acquainted with food allergies simply can not understand the effects anaphylaxis has on someones system . Being a victim of relentless bullying by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ingestion I have mere minutes to be injected with epinephrine or else my chances of surviving the attack drop significantly . <p> The effects peanuts have on my body are not fake . It would seem impossible to fake the welts or rashes I get from contact with nut products . Regardless , I fail to see why anyone would wish to fake an allergy , no matter how disagreeable they may be . Socially , allergies cause nothing but bullying , exclusion , and contempt from fellow students . Nothing good can come out of faking an allergy . <p> Growing up with a peanut allergy is tough . In elementary school , on days when peanut butter was served in the lunch line , I was forced to sit by myself at the far end of the cafeteria . Its not fun . Its embarrassing , lonely , and uncomfortable ; and to have someone suggest that my allergy is fraud mocks my pain and the pain of anyone else who has had to live with a food allergy . <p> Save the psychology for mental patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in your head " . <p> I do n't  think allergies do n't  exist , neither is the article above implying this , however I think that there are people who fake it and this makes it a lot harder for people who do have actual allergies , kind of like the boy who cried wolf affecting a whole group . I have relatives who have celiac disease and only discovered it when one started blacking out regularly ( the other relative found out 10 year later and only when asked if they were related to anyone who had it be a doc ) . <p> This has very serious health effects . On the flipside there are people who seem allergic to a lot of things , making people go out of their way to accomodate and making it difficult for everyone . This reminds me of the behaviour of an anorexic to a point ; sneaky and manipulative ( well that 's what i was like when I was anorexic anyway ) but also doing it for attention . <p> So yes i think allergies do exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have them , and this is dangerous as it can make people doubt the ones with the actual serious problems . <p> I know its not nice to wish bad things on others , but I wish food allergies on all of you a**holes who agree with this obviously fake study . Joel Stein got what he deserved . Does that make me an a**hole too ? Sure it does , but I do n't  care . I am so tired of you self righteous , ignorant idiots who risk MY CHILDs life because you think its funny or you think its not real . And if there are any fakers out there , this goes out to you too . People like you ( author and those with uninformed comments ) are my living hell , and if you ca n't skip one PBJ sandwich for the safety of a child , then you are no better than a drunk driver , and you can go f**k yourself ! <p> maybe only 100 people die a year because thes products are n't  banned from certain facilities . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 100 , that would be bad ! <p> Yes , Lou , if my family member died that would be bad . But from a public policy standpoint 100 victims is trivial , compared to other causes of death . Thousands die every year because the speed limit is over 55 MPH , but because lowering it would be inconvenient and raise the cost of goods , we leave it at 65 MPH . There are thousands and thousands of decisions that have been made for reasons less important than the freedom to eat peanut butter that we know result in deaths , each and every one of them a member of someones family . There is nothing special or protected about food allergy patients . Saving lives is one factor to consider when implementing population-wide regulations , but not the only factor . Editor <p> First of all please being offended by this objective article on a legitimate problem , let me put it like this Im offended to see people feeding their children fast food and soda pop as a main food source . No wonder our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the processed foods we feed them . Humans werent created to eat the fatty , greasy useless foods most eat . Enriched white flour is peasant food sorry folks , whole grain is real bread . Well I guess this is what happens when a bunch of crazy hippies reproduce and take everything for granted. ( aka yeah let 's skip breakfast because were offended and our stomachs are n't  awake and modern medicin missed natural selection so let 's ban peanuts and healthy food that our terrible lifesyles created not ban the fake empty calorie peasant food creating this common sense disasterlol ) Anywase I thought I had one of these mysterious multi syptom things too because it fell into place . Shortly After screening revealed a textbook perfect stomach I reaized humans have to consume around 2000 qualitie calories in regular daily meals in which the dr . Never told me b/c its some yuppie who became a doctor . Aka not eating breakfast consistantly or drnking enough water will.give you the irregular poopies ! Common sense most of these people are severly displacing anger and blame of their poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you get offended by my opinion I would be more than happy to tell you how to eat food and gallons of absolutly essential water for human life . <p> This is so sad ! I 'm tired of getting eye rolls at restaurants because people think my allergy is fake . I do n't  think that the skin testing AND the blood testing lied , from a certified allergist ! And I did n't  go into that piece of shrimp expecting to have a reaction , it just happened . I have a severe shellfish allergy , diagnosed through multiple tests and I can assure you that food allergies are real ! <p> I have to say that I really appreciate an article like this being written . Food allergies are overblown , and evidence points towards peanut allergies developing due to NOT exposing infants to them early enough . I am sure this is the case with other types of ingredients . Children who grow up on farms are ridiculously healthier and less prone to asthma and other ailments , as are those who have pets . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop the anti-bacterial wipes and let their children LIVE . They will be healthier and their immune system will not suffer ridiculously consequences that can be avoided . I have a 10 month old daughter who can , and WANTS , to eat everything . She has never refused any type of food or had any type of reaction . She is not even remotely overweight and is considered advanced in every way by her pediatrician . I prefer natural and organic produce , and I have no issue with letting her run around in dirt . She has never been truly sick . Even when she caught RSV ( there was an out break ) her sympotoms disappeared in 3 days without even a fever . More of the story : Immune systems improve by exposure . You cant live in a bubble and expect to be healthy . <p> Food allergies are realthe AMOUNT of allergic people is not . It is trendy for parents to have kids with allergies.it seems that the most popular one nowadays is Gluten allergies . A doctor who is a good clinician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure there is a problem , or to eliminate it completely . A good doctor will NOT take the word of a perent and jump on the Paranoia Wagon and prescribe anything wanted or demanded-or just be lazy and let the parent do all the research and not look into the issue . Part of the problem lies with doctors themselves , misdiagnosing , or blanket-diag " ( blanket diagnosis ) in order to cover their expensive asses . Parentsif you have suspicions your children have food allergiesgo to your doctor . Let that doctor refer you to a Specialist , and KEEP YOUR NOSE OUT OF IT . Yo9u can be just as much of the problem as the supposed offensive food ! Let the clinicians do their jobs . They go to school for a long , long time to learn how to practice medicine . A good doctor will want to get to the bottom of it-and ignore a pushy parent that supposedly knows better-and orders REAL testing and follow-up-not trendy diagnoses , trendy designer-drugs or other such rot . For those with real food allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Designer Allergies will go awayand the kids affected by it wont be too scarred by their hypochondriacal/trendy parentage . <p> We have none of these restrictions at work and we all share one kitchen , refrigerator and common eating area . HR has never sent one memo telling us to avoid eating any type of food anywhere in the building . <p> 800 people ( every race / shape imaginable ) sharing a common area and not one occurrence of anaphylaxis . This is a hoax and you 're a big PITA if you force the rest of the world to cater to your needs . <p> Interesting . If 80 to 90% of the claimed allergic reactions to something as societally innocent as peanuts turn out to be psychosomatically-based rather than physiologically based , then it would stand to reason that <p> ==&gt;IF there were a substance out there that was the subject of a massive media campaign spending hundreds of millions of dollars to warn of the dangers of even the slightest contact with Substance X by even healthy people <p> ==&gt;THEN we would expect a far higher proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychosomatic reaction level to that Substance X up in the 95%+ range particularly if the substance was almost or totally innocent of actual X-proteins . <p> Guess what ? We have EXACTLY such a problem with such substance , with such a campaign , and with such an absence of proteins : tobacco smoke allergies . <p> The sad thing is that we probably HAVE had deaths out there from psychosomatic reactions and their aftermaths by people who have been whipped up into real , but emotionally- rather than physically-based , allergy attacks after even the slightest of exposures to wisps of tobacco smoke . <p> This is what annoys me about science . and their statistics they do n't  goand interview everyone so you cant get an accurate reading of that statistic ther eits a total minority project .. just because they do n't  keel over with anaphalatic shock does n't  mean they 're not allergic . I 'm Allergic to dairy I get nasty cramps if I have it Eggs set my stomach off and I constantly burp and pass wind that smells like methane these are allergic reactions not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different than food allergies , and not dangerous . Methane farts ? Good grief ! <p> Lactose sensitivity can be cured by simply eating and drinking dairy products , a little bit at first and building up . If you 're not in the habit of eating dairy , your body will have stopped producing enough of the enzyme you need to digest it . Let your body know that it needs to produce the enzyme ( by eating dairy ) , and it will do it , but it takes a few weeks . <p> I am a Registered Nurse who works in the Quality Department of a large , metropolitan healthcare system . I read and glean data from hundreds of charts a day . My patients range in age from 15 to 50 . I can not tell you how many patients state they have seafood allergies I see it everyday but very few maybe one or two per year state they have a peanut allergy . And statistically more people are allergic to seafood . Yet , kids are allowed to bring tuna sandwiches to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding to have tuna banned from school lunches ? <p> I have a friend Delia who is allergic to coconut , and her last attack put her in an ICU for 3 days ventilated and I assure you , she had the quickest care possible . We gave her her first epi shot within seconds of her ingesting coconut in a juice product . She does not demand that no one bring coconut to work , although we share a fridge and we eat together daily . She is careful not to ingest coconut and she did n't  mean to drink it . She has been careful with coconut since she was a small child , but coconut was not banned from her school . <p> I think that education is the key . Children who have any food allergies should be taught to question everything , not share food and on the use of an epi pen . As to the comments about food intolerance they are not allergies . I am lactose intolerant and do not eat/drink milk products . If I did , I would not die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intolerance , not an allergy . There are differences . I also have an " adverse effect " if I take Zithromax . I faint . This is not an allergy . <p> Severe allergies do exist . Delia has one as does one of my children ( asprin and bee venum ) . They both carry epi pens ( 2 at all times ) and know how to use them . I know , however , that when I interview patients , every day at least one person tells me she was told by her parents that she was " deathly allergic " to peanuts , but they eat them all the time . My concern is that " peanut allergy " has become a trend and when someone actually has one , no one will pay attention . <p> 1 . I think it is important to recognize the difference between true allergy and food sensitivities . They are not the same , but tend to get lumped together . For a person unfamiliar w/the different variations of food allergies this can look confusing and appear to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 2 . Any doctor worth seeing for food allergies will have blood tests taken . While there are cases of false positives/negatives , ( such as celiac , where you have to have consumed gluten for an accurate test ) blood tests can not be faked . Of course so me sensitivities do not show in the blood , but these are not ( as far as I know ) the dangerous ones . <p> 3 . One of the difficulties w/peanut allergies ( and the reason most schools have now banned it ) is that allergies to peanuts ate notoriously bad . They have a high incidence of anaphylactic shock and often iy is not known that a child is or is that allergic until they have a life threatening reaction . Also , while not the case w/many other foods , all it takes is breathing in the oil particles ( so , the air ) Peanut oil is harder to clean , kids get it on there clothes , stays on the skin , etc . So even sending an allergic child to eat elsewhere does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the risk of transferring the peanut oil to an allergic sibling or friend . So even homeschooling and monitoring your childs friends can become difficult . <p> While there is always risks in life , is your childs peanut butter sandwich really worth another childs life ? If that still does n't  sway you- imagine the guilt your child will have over killing a friend or classmate . <p> 1 more thing- I think doctors need to do a better job of making sure the patients understand the differences between ( true ) allergies , ( true ) sensitivities and a food restrictions for medical reasons . I 'm in turn the parents need to better educate the teachers and parents in their childs life . Is your childs food restriction due to a life threatening allergy ? Does it make their mouth itch ? A rash ? Does a certain food cause behavioral problems , etc . Too often it is easier to just check the box for food allergy . This does a disservice to not only the kids with allergies , but the teacher and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments , are truly frightening , on both sides . There are so many problems with the medical system , allergy testing , continuing education of physicians , and a serious lack of parents/adults in general who capable of critical thinking . Its been known for quite some time that allergy testing in all forms produces unreliable results . A double blind food challenge conducted by a qualified physician is gold standard , and only reliable way to diagnosis a food allergy , yet most physicians still rely on simple skin prick tests for diagnosis ? False positives are common and result it needlessly avoiding foods . <p> Yet were going to blame parents for this , for following a specialists advice , and call them overreacting hypochondriacs ? And then we have the opposite side of that spectrum- children who falsely test negative for an allergy and again are not administered a food challenge , which leads to potentially dangerous situations . Oh , the test is negative no need to worry , go ahead and eat whatever despite having a clinical history of severe reaction . Physicians relying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration of a food challenge is incompetence at its best . Likewise , parents do n't  educate themselves and blindly accept unreliable test results as 100% proof are failing their children . Needlessly avoiding certain foods , while not dangerous , can lead to anxiety and diminished quality of life for children . Failure to avoid allergens can do the same in addition to being potentially very dangerous . <p> People , do n't  be so quick to judge . Educate yourselves , and if you know someone who falls into one of these categories educate them as well . Yes , sometimes people make assumptions based on observations that may or may not be correct . If you get itchy eyes , a runny nose , and wheezing chest every time you mow the lawn its easy to make the assumption that you have a grass allergy . No one would shame you for making that assumption , or call you an overreacting hypochondriac . Would you rush to the doctor to be tested ? Maybe if you 've got really good insurance , or want to get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same can be said for foods . If a person gets hives every time they eat a certain food they may make the same assumption . They may even decide to endure the itchyness for a bowl of ice cream every now and then . That 's a personal choice that every one with a non-life threatening allergy has the right to make . A stupid choice , in my opinion , because allergies are known to change in severity , for better or worse . And that 's something that no onenot even a well educated doctorcan predict ! 
@@97603093 @1803093/ <h> The bodys natural way to lose weight <p> Guest contributor : Karen Collins , M.S. , R.D. , C.D.N. <p> Karen Collins holds a B.S. degree from Purdue University and an M.S. degree from Cornell University , both in nutrition . When shes not writing or speaking , she conducts a private nutrition practice in Jamestown , New York . <p> People often bemoan , " Why is it so easy to gain weight , but so hard to lose it ? " Cornell University professor David Levitsky ( pictured below ) contends that we often get in the way of our bodies natural ability to bring us back to a healthy weight . His research shows that after a period of overeating , if we simply go back to a diet that supports a healthy weight , our bodies will increase the rate at which we burn calories and we will gradually lose weight . <p> In one of his studies , a group of normal-weight men and women were asked to dramatically increase their calorie consumption for two weeks . Not surprisingly , they gained weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their weight gradually decreased without extra exercise or severe cutbacks in the amount of food they ate . Dr. Levitsky points to a variety of human and animal studies that show how a metabolic rate increase could explain this weight loss . The increase in metabolism is greater once a person returns to normal eating habits than during the period of overeating . <p> If our metabolism can speed up , why do so many people have trouble losing weight ? Dr. Levitsky suggests that people still eat more than they need , or they cut back too much . <p> Why is it counterproductive to cut calories too much ? First , when we make changes that are too big or too challenging , we usually ca n't stick with them long enough to be successful . Second , dramatic cuts in calorie consumption can decrease our metabolic rate , slowing down calorie burning . <p> Dr. Levitskys study also supports the wide body of research that identifies " environmental cues " especially portion size as more influential over how much we eat than our actual physical hunger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain over years , Dr. Levitsky suggests that people are stuck in certain eating habits and do n't  realize how much their intake exceeds their needs . According to him , the way people respond to environmental cues determines their weight . <p> A variety of cues can cause us to eat more than we need . In studies involving people of all ages and weights , the more food that was available to people , whether on their plate or in a serving bowl , the more people ate . People are so unaware of this overeating that they do n't  feel any difference in fullness after eating very different amounts of food . Many people could probably eat less without feeling hungry . <p> Another reason we can unintentionally overeat is called " caloric density . " The same quantity of food can vary widely in calories . For example , one-half cup of meat has more calories than one-half cup of vegetables . If people paid attention to their sense of fullness , theyd eat smaller amounts of high-calorie foods , but studies show that people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or emotional cues . The timing of our eating and the hunger-satisfying power of the foods we choose may also influence how much we eat . <p> If you 've gained weight , advises Dr. Levitsky , trim about 200 to 250 calories from your daily food choices . To do this , you can slightly reduce all of your food portions throughout the day , or eat less of one or two higher-calorie foods . You can even cut calories without eating less food by shifting the proportions of what you eat . Choose more low-calorie foods like vegetables and cut back on the high-calorie items . <p> The New American Plate , a healthy eating strategy developed by the American Institute for Cancer Research , combines these two ideas of portion size and proportion of foods into one approach . <p> Once you 've taken up this strategy , exercise patience . In Dr. Levitskys study , people overate for two weeks , but they took more than three weeks to lose the weight they gained . Stick with the modest cutbacks and you should see results eventually . 
@@97603094 @1803094/ <h> How to Teach Others About Your Childs Food Allergies <p> ( CC ) Spirit-Fire/Flickr <p> Living with food allergies entails more than just avoiding an allergen or filling out a 504 Plan at school ; this weeks edition of our Food Allergy Friday interview series explores how to teach others about your childs food allergies. - Weve asked three members of the food allergy community Linda Coss , Elizabeth Goldenberg and Lynda Mitchell to share their time-tested strategies for teaching others about food allergy . Whether you 're meeting a new caretaker , talking with a stranger at the grocery store or explaining your childs condition to family members before a visit , you 're sure to find a few tips to add to your arsenal here . <p> Featured Food Allergy Experts <p> Linda Coss , a food allergy mom and one of the " pioneers " in the food-allergy world , has written three food allergy books , including two cookbooks . Her Twitter handle is @LindaCoss.Elizabeth Goldenberg of Onespot Allergy is a food allergy expert who offers parent-to-parent advice for living safely with food allergy and anaphylaxis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kids With Food Allergies , a national charity that connects parents of food-allergic children . Her Twitter handle is @KFAtweets . <h> Planning and Preparation <p> Embrace your role as a parent , advocate and educator . Understand the importance of your family and caretakers . " Our friends , family and caretakers are our childrens safety net they are the ones who help us keep our children safe . Because food allergies are so misunderstood by the general public , part of our job entails educating others about what a food allergy is and is not , and the seriousness of food allergies and allergic reactions , " says Lynda Mitchell . <p> A parent of a food-allergic child is an inherent advocate for food allergy . Elizabeth Goldenberg adds , " Even among family members , we really have to become great salespeople and advocates to engage them and get them all onside in the effort to protect our children and make things more inclusive for them . " <p> Mentally prepare yourself . Some individuals are lucky enough to have conscientious family members who understand food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is an unfair expectation to have at the outset . " When I speak to people about accommodating my sons peanut and tree nut allergies , I keep in mind that they do n't  have to help me : I need to engage them and make them want to help me . I find that if Im relaxed , friendly , and describe his allergy and what needs to be done really simply , they want to help keep him safe , " advises Goldenberg . <p> Onespot Allergy <p> Arm yourself with educational tools and relevant medications . See our Tools of the Trade section below ; if you do n't  already have items such as a medication belt , emergency plan or 911 script , the planning phase is the perfect time to stock up . <p> Embrace the two Ps prevention and preparedness in each step of the process . " Prevention and preparedness should be applied to every situation " - always . Prevention includes avoiding exposures , communicating clearly to everyone about your childs food allergies and teaching others about food allergy management " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Preparedness includes always being ready to recognize anaphylaxis : know the signs and symptoms , give epinephrine when indicated and activate an emergency response should a reaction occur , " says Mitchell . <p> Relax . " Its very important to be relaxed and calm . Now that my son Jacob is 9 years old , I find it reassuring and calming to see that he s becoming a great advocate for himself . He knows what he can and can not eat , and because he s aware of how severe reactions can be , he has never taken a chance and eaten something unsafe , " says Goldenberg . " I also reassure myself that Jacob has moved through life quite safely to this point . By educating others , planning food in advance , and always having emergency medication within reach , everything has always gone perfectly well , and I hope it always will . " <h> Essential Points to Cover <p> Provide context to evoke a sense of urgency . Many people have never been exposed to food allergy and are unaware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with stories or examples of what types of reactions your child has had and what you need to do to keep him safe and treat allergic reactions , helps in getting others to understand the reality we live with every day " - that food allergies are real , and serious , and prevention and preparedness are key to keeping our children safe , " says Mitchell . <p> During this discussion , prepare yourself for resistance . " Expect disbelief , " advises Linda Coss . " Regardless of how much media attention this condition has garnered , many people still find it hard to believe that good , healthy foods can harm anyone . Your goal is to make it clear that for your child , less than one bite of an allergen really can quickly lead to an extreme reaction or even death . " Use printed pamphlets , handouts or other reference materials to illustrate your points ; see our References and Recommended Reading section for some links to get you started . <p> Onespot Allergy <p> Discuss your childs specific allergens and the medicines he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son is severely allergic to peanuts and all other nuts , even in trace amounts , so he ca n't be exposed to them or ingest them at all , " says Goldenberg . " Avoidance of his allergens is the key , but in case accidental exposure occurs , I go on to say that he wears two EpiPens ( emergency epinephrine injectors ) in the belt at his waist , which treat allergic reactions . If they suspect he s having an allergic reaction , they 're to use the EpiPen within the first five minutes , even prior to calling 911 . " <p> Be specific in your discussion of allergens and your childs sensitivity to them . " For example , if you say dairy , people might just think milk , cheese and ice cream . You need to explain that dairy includes anything that contains dairy products or dairy derivatives in the ingredients . Depending on the severity of your childs allergies , this can also include anything that has merely come into contact with something that contains dairy products or dairy derivatives , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family members . " Its harder to speak with family members about our childrens allergies than it is with others . Were afraid to ask detailed questions or make waves , and they sometimes offer sweeping reassurances that everything is fine with little knowledge , " says Goldenberg . " After reading about a grandmother who gave her nut-allergic grandchild food with tree nuts in it , I realized I have conflicting beliefs about eating at relatives homes : I feel that we should be able to eat what everyone else is eating when were there ; that is , our allergy should be accommodated by relatives . Shoulds can be very dangerous , since I also know from reading studies that its relatives who make mistakes the most . " <p> Ask about all food that will be served . " If food is to be served , I need to speak about selecting safe packaged products or preparing fresh food safely , " says Goldenberg . For specific tips on avoiding cross-contamination in the kitchen , see this past food allergy post . <p> Demonstrate what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who will be caring for your child , you also need to teach them how to recognize and treat a reaction , and get them to understand the timeline in which that treatment must take place . To do this , it is helpful to put your training information in writing , " says Coss . <p> When discussing an emergency , emphasize symptoms and speed . Coss recommends that you discuss your childs common and possible symptoms during an allergic reaction , how quickly an allergic reaction can happen , what emergency medications look like and where they 're kept , how to use an epinephrine auto-injector and when to call 911 . <p> Share the tools of the trade . " Other ways to convey the seriousness of food allergies include having your child wear a medical identification bracelet , and sharing the childs written allergy action plan the doctor has provided so these trusted caregivers , friends or family can act on your behalf if you entrust them with your childs care , " says Mitchell . " Demonstrating how to use an epinephrine auto-injector with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person youre speaking with practice with the auto-injector training device after your demonstration to ensure they have a working familiarity with it . <h> Tools of the Trade <p> Emergency plan and 911 script . " I created my emergency protocol and 911 script card for exactly these situations , " says Goldenberg . " It lists the symptoms to watch for , the exact information to state in a 911 call and the steps to take to treat an allergic reaction , " says Goldenberg . See the Resources section for links to Goldenbergs emergency plan and FAANs Food Allergy Action Plan . <p> Epinephrine auto-injector training device . Ask your doctor for a training device if you do n't  have one already . Some auto-injector manufacturers , such as EpiPen , include a training device in their multi-pack cartons . Alternatively , keep an expired EpiPen on hand to use as a demonstration tool . <p> Onespot Allergy <p> Photos and printed reference material . " I carry a photo in my wallet see right of a child having a severe allergic reaction , which I show when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have shown this to family members . Its important for everyone to continuously keep in mind that food allergies are life-threatening , " says Goldenberg . Coss adds , " It can be helpful to share appropriate literature and educational videos . If available and appropriate , you can also share photographs of your child taken during a prior allergic reaction . " <p> Medication belt . Keep your childs epinephrine auto-injectors in a belt on his or her person so that they 're always on hand . " Having EpiPens in a backpack or anywhere other than on the body causes unnecessary confusion and delay , " says Goldenberg . " All fatalities from food allergy involve not receiving an EpiPen injection or having the injection delayed , and in one study of fatalities , none were reported if a patient received medication within the first five minutes of an attack . That time is easily lost looking around for a backpack or within a backpack , so its best to always be prepared . " <h> Solutions for Tough Situations <p> Bring your own food . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food for us , then I would bring our own food to family events rather than try to monitor everything on the table . It would n't just be Jacob eating his own food : We all would too , so that he would n't feel singled out . Either we 'd make that a regular occurrence , or our host and I would work together to make the meal safe for him the next time were invited over , " says Goldenberg . This applies to play dates , too : " My favorite strategy for play dates is to send along a safe treat for sharing ( I 'm a great baker ) . We all win that way : My sons host just needs to add a drink and maybe some fresh fruit , Jacob gets to enjoy something special that 's safe for him , and he gets to treat his friend to it as well , " adds Goldenberg . <p> Educate less-than-cooperative family members . " If the less-than-cooperative response is because of a lack of information or education , parents can always try to provide family members with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed on what they need to know , " says Mitchell . Use your printed reference materials , videos , handouts and your own knowledge of food allergy studies , research and news stories to illustrate your points . " Sometimes people find information more credible when it comes from third-party sources , " adds Coss . <p> Evoke empathy . Emphasize love and positivity instead of negativity or accusatory speech . " I like to state that we all love Jacob and want to keep him safe , and of course , every family member I say that to agrees with me , " says Goldenberg . <p> " Stress that you know that everyone in the family wants the best for the child , and you need their cooperation to make it happen . Try again to get the person to understand that their actions are literally putting your childs life in danger . Tell the person exactly what you expect from him or her be specific , " advises Coss . <p> Address problems as soon as possible . " If your aunt offers your child a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Christmas to discuss the issue . Try to remain calm and diplomatic . Avoid blaming and finger-pointing . Try not to get hysterical , " says Coss . <p> Protect the welfare of your child at all costs . All three of our experts agreed on the need to stick to your guns with regards to food allergy safety . " Some family members , despite your most valiant attempts , will not get it. Its always so hard in situations when family members choose to not take precautions or not want to work with you despite your attempts to educate and inform . If all else fails , your childs safety and well-being comes first , and you 'll need to make some hard choices rather than take chances that present a risk , " says Mitchell . <p> " I find it difficult to imagine a relative who deliberately puts an allergic child at risk , " says Goldenberg . " If I did encounter such a person , I would not allow my son to be alone with him or her . We also would n't eat any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the person in question is your own mother , you must always put your childs safety first , " says Coss . " If necessary , make it clear what action you will take if the person will not or can not cooperate with the food allergy safety plan . If this would mean that you wont be able to be with the family for the holidays , or Grandma wont be left alone with the children , you need to clearly say so . " <p> The biggest problem with relatives I have found has always been the " unusual terms " which can mean a possible allergen is in that product . <p> We do guard against peanuts and some tree nuts and for most people that is very easy , but what they do n't  understand is natural flavors , asst. butters , pesto , marzipan , extracts and things like that also mean nuts may be in there . <p> I made lists for everyone so they can keep them in their purse or wallet . When they are in the store I ask they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that list . <p> You still need to double-check everything before it gets used , but now mistakes or accidental allergens are very infrequent because everyone feels a whole lot safer when they go to a store
