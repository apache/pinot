If you do n't feel equal to the task of figuring out the distinctly techy ( and often inaccessible ) world of public Cloud storage services like Amazon Glacier and Microsoft Azure ( see more details below ! ) , IDrive offers a much smaller-scale , and significantly more user-friendly , alternative. - <p> Archiving your photos with IDrive works exactly like backing them up , except that it 's optimised for longer-term storage .

Which is why Dropbox is the first name that comes to most people 's minds when you say file sharing ' . <p> Dropbox is the perfect solution if you want to give other people access to your files .

It 's pretty simple just save your files to three separate locations ; preferably both online and offline . A good approach is to backup photos online , on a local external storage device , and in a third alternative location either with a second Cloud storage provider , on a network attached storage device , or on another external drive that 's stored in a different geographical location . <p> Keeping important files in all three places means that , short of widespread destruction , they should be safe from pretty much any disaster that might arise .

You wo n't find enough storage space to hang on to all of your files , and security is fairly limited , but if you 're looking for convenience and access to your data from anywhere , at any time.then you 've definitely come to the right place . <h> - Features <h> About Dropbox <p> Dropbox , one of the most popular file storage solutions available today , was first released in 2008 ; the work of CEO Drew Houston and CTO Arash Ferdowsi . With employees previously working at Google , Motorola and Facebook , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as partnerships with industry giants including Sony Ericsson and Microsoft . Based in San Francisco , they are also a leading figure in the world of business backups , with over 100,000 companies using their services . <h> Backup options <p> Backing up your files using Dropbox is a flexible operation " all you need to do is click and drag , whether you 're using the desktop app or their website . You 're free to upload any files you want to , with no restrictions on types or sizes , although you wo n't be able to- backup- files larger than 10GB using the website . <p> Once uploaded , any changes you make to your data will be automatically applied to your backup , and you can keep things organized by creating and renaming folders , and moving your files freely between them . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> Dropbox is compatible with most major operating systems and has desktop applications available for Windows , Mac , and Linux . Users of iOS , Android , Windows Phone , BlackBerry and Kindle Fire will also all be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader appeal than the many providers that only accommodate Windows , Apple and Android devices . <h> Sync and share options <p> Dropbox is arguably best known as a file sharing platform , so it comes as no surprise that its greatest strengths lie in syncing and sharing data . It 's all about convenience here " all files added to your desktop folder or uploaded online will be immediately synced to your Dropbox account . They can then be opened , edited and shared from all devices registered to your account . <p> There are two ways to share files ; by creating a link or a shared folder . Links can be accessed by absolutely anyone , regardless of whether or not they also hold Dropbox accounts , and can only be viewed ( not edited ) by recipients . By contrast , members of a shared folder all need to be Dropbox users , and can amend the folder 's contents by deleting , changing or adding files .

It allows all members of a company to access basic data in a kind of enormous shared folder , as well as creating additional groups that limit the sharing of relevant files to a single team . <h> File versioning and deleted file retrieval <p> If you ever find yourself looking for information that exists only in a deleted document or an older draft of your work , never fear " Dropbox allows you to restore both deleted files and previous versions of your documents for up to 30 days . <p> Pro subscribers also have the option to purchase Extended Version History for $39 per year . This add-on allows you to restore previous versions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the added bonus that only the most recent iteration- contributes to your storage quota . <h> Speed <p> Upload and download speeds are a significant part of the performance of any storage provider , although it 's less of a priority for users who want to use Dropbox for file sharing rather than full system backups . Here at BestBackups we like to have as much information as possible , however , so we ran some tests and presented the results in the lovely graph below : <p> Our speed tests are conducted by first uploading five individual files and manually timing how long it takes for their transfers to complete . We then divide the number of MB in each file by the number of seconds it took to upload and convert that result into Mbps . Finally , we run five downloads through the same process , and voila ! Results . <p> As you can see in the graph above , Dropbox did n't fare too well when it came to uploads . With an average speed of just 1.6 Mbps ( a 100MB file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the 2 " 3 Mbps range occupied by most of its competitors . Although downloads were somewhat quicker , the 3.3 Mbps average speed still pales in comparison to most competitors , several of which consistently achieved over 6 Mbps . <p> Having said this , we want to make it clear that , while we try to make our results as accurate as we can , some external factors such as slow broadband and even just having a poor quality router can make an impact on your transfer speeds . As a result , although our figures are designed to give you an idea of what to expect , remember that your own speeds may vary . <h> Security <p> Dropbox follows industry standard security measures to keep your data private and secure . Files are subject to 256-bit AES encryption while stored in Dropbox data centers , and are transferred via a secure , 128-bit SSL/TLS connection . They also offer optional two-step verification , which requires a second layer of authentication ( usually obtained via a text of phone call ) before you can access your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the level of privacy afforded to Dropbox users has been called into question in recent years , most notably by Edward Snowden in 2014 . <p> The main problem is that Dropbox holds the keys needed to decrypt its users data , ostensibly to run deduplication processes ( checking the contents of your existing files to ensure that new data is n't replicating what 's already there ) . What this effectively means , however , is that they are able to access your files at any time and , should hackers attack the Dropbox servers , they 'd be able to find everything necessary to decrypt and read your information . There is also a third concern , namely the issue of governmental intervention , as if a subpoena requesting access to your data is issued , Dropbox is legally bound to comply . <p> This problem is not by any means exclusive to Dropbox , although many other backup providers including SpiderOak , CrashPlan , and IDrive do allow you to set a private encryption key . This is a key generated by you setting a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unencrypted form by your provider . Although many people may not feel that this is a necessary measure to take , the fact that Dropbox does n't  offer the option suggests a fundamental lack of respect for user privacy . <p> Ultimately , although Dropbox 's security is good enough to protect against the majority of everyday threats , if you are concerned about the privacy of your data it may be worth considering an alternative provider . There is also the option to take extra security measures without Dropboxs input , such as encrypting data before uploading it . <h> Customer- Support <p> Basic and Pro subscribers looking to contact Dropbox 's customer support can access their Help Center , forums , and submit inquiries- by using a support ticket . <p> While these options are somewhat limited ( we are big fans of a live chat , which is only available to business users here ) , the Help Center resources are pretty good .

In the end , it took around a day and a half for a representative to get back to us . This is considerably slower than the average time achieved by other providers ( approximately four hours ) , and the information we received was a little unclear in places " leaving us ultimately disappointed in the experience . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> When it comes to other sources of customer assistance , Dropbox maintains an active Twitter Support account that 's dedicated to troubleshooting customer problems and offering regular hints and tips on using their software .

@@26491882 @191882/ <h> GUIDE <h> Online Backup vs Offline Backup " 2016 Edition <p> Talk to people about types of backup , and their minds will immediately drift to offline backup " such as external hard drives , DVDs , and good ol USB sticks " or to the Cloud . <p> While there are some people who are fiercely devoted to one or the other , here at BestBackups we firmly believe that any good backup strategy should utilize both online backup and offline backup . <p> Yes , both . <p> Sounds crazy ? Let me make my case . <p> More and more , our lives are becoming dependent on our computers . We store our memories on our mobiles and SD cards instead of in photo albums , keep our contacts on Facebook and LinkedIn instead of in day planners , and lock up legal information and documents in the Cloud instead of in a safe . <p> Heck , even the majority of businesses are beginning to be run entirely on the web ! And if they become victims of a data disaster , you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( But we 'll tell you anyway . It 's massive loss of revenue and , more often than not , bankruptcy . ) <p> If you lose your data , you will lose so much more . <p> So without further ado , let 's look at the different ways in which you can store your data safely and smartly . <h> Online Backup vs Offline Backup Explained <p> Most people are already familiar with both " and if you 're not , we 've got a great summary of the two here " but remain bewildered as to why they 're not okay with just one or the other . <p> Here 's where we come in . <h> Offline Backup <p> The term offline backup ' refers to any form of data storage that is both local and offline . This includes , but is not limited to , DVDs , CDs , Blu-ray , tape drives , external hard drives , USB thumb drives , and memory cards . <p> While each form has its particular advantages and disadvantages , there are benefits and drawbacks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fast backup and restore <p> While uploading or restoring 200 GB worth of data is a time-consuming task no matter the backup type , offline data storage definitely has the edge . Its upload and restoration speeds are almost always going to be faster than that of online data storage , whose backup speed is almost entirely dependent on the strength of your Internet connection . <h> Easy access <p> Nearly everyone keeps their offline backup readily at hand around the home or office . All it takes is for you to hook up your hard drive or plug in your USB stick and your data will start backing up in a snap . <h> Mobility <p> The majority of offline backup media is small and lightweight enough to be conveniently stored in a desk drawer , or popped into a backpack to be carried around for safety purposes . <h> Better safety <p> So long as they are not network drives with an internet connection , your offline backup is safe from cyber security breaches " a rarity in this day and age of ransomware , NSA snooping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Cons <h> Easily destroyed <p> Even the most expensive and well-developed offline data backup media can be destroyed by anything from natural disaster to a knocked over glass of water . The physical vulnerability of things like CDs and external hard drives makes it a bad idea to use them exclusively , as once they 're gone , they 're usually gone for good " along with all of your precious data . <h> Prone to theft <p> While not worth thousands , a lot of offline backup can be easily sold on eBay or at pawn shops for a decent chunk of change , making them a popular target for petty thieves . Worse still , a lot of offline backup is unencrypted and require no passwords , which means that any confidential information you have stored on it " such as bank statements , passport scans , or official documents " would be easily accessible to anyone who steals it , putting you at risk of losing much more than the cost of a 1 TB external hard drive . <h> Risk of technological failure <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and magnets . Optical media becomes unreadable . There 's not a single form of local offline storage that does n't age and degrade . Every piece of technology you buy will die eventually " often before advertised " so you should never put all of your faith into a single piece of hardware . <h> Online Backup <p> Offsite backup services have become wildly popular in recent years , and a plethora of Cloud providers and plans are ready for the choosing for both individuals and businesses . <p> Pros and cons are typically specific to each individual Cloud provider , but there 's also a handful of each that apply to online backup in general . <h> Pros <h> Encryption <p> Any online backup provider worth its salt will encrypt the data of its customers during both transmission and storage using high-level encryption algorithms such as 256-bit AES or 448-bit Blowfish " the same used by banks and government agencies ! <h> Protection against physical theft and natural disasters <p> A tornado could hit your house , or you could be a victim of burglary , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe offsite in the Cloud ( well , not that easy , but you get what we mean ) . <h> Budget friendly <p> Good online data storage services such as Backblaze and Carbonite clock in at $5 to $12 a month " the price of a cup of coffee ( or two ) . While it does add up over the months of years , in the grand scheme of things it 's very little to pay for a peace of mind . <h> Advanced setup <p> Is your offline backup solution run by an advanced IT team , guarded by 24-hour security , and kept in climate-controlled warehouses specifically developed to house data storage infrastructures ? We did n't think so . The cost of setting up anything even remotely close yourself would be astronomical , so why not take advantage of what 's already on the market for a tiny fraction of the price ? <h> Cons <h> No direct control <p> When you send your data up into the Cloudbe that iCloud , JustCloud , or otherwiseyou 're placing your trust entirely in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least . On a smaller scale , it means that you have less control over it than over the external hard drive that you keep by your computer . On a larger scale , it means that if disaster strikes and their servers go down , your data goes down with them . <h> Completely reliant on your Internet connection <p> This is a major bummer , but the honest truth . If your Internet goes down , so does your ability to backup or have access to your data . If your Internet is slow , your backup and restoration will be slow as hell too . <h> Long upload and restoration times <p> Even if you 've got a super-speedy Internet connection , it will almost certainly take ages to initially upload and backup your data . The same goes for restoration . Slow speeds are , without a doubt , the majority of people 's biggest gripe with online data backup . <h> The Differences Between Online Backup vs Offline Backup <p> The main differences between online and offline backup are pretty straightforward : Online backups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior data safety , while offline backups boast easy physical access and faster backup and restores . <p> So in the battle of online backup vs offline backup , who comes out victorious ? <p> The answer is , ultimately , neither . <p> Yes , you read that right . Neither is better than the other . <p> If you want a fail-proof backup strategy that ensures both data safety and ease of access , you must make use of both types of storage . It might seem like overkill now , but trust us . Having more than two copies of your data on hand could mean the difference between keeping it safe and losing it all forever " and that is really not a gamble that you want to take . <p> Want to learn more about the best storage strategies for your backups ?

@@26491887 @191887/ <h> Summary : <p> UPDATE : MyOtherDrive appears to no longer be in operation . The company no longer sends out confirmation codes for new accounts , responds to customer queries , or sends missing passwords . Complaints have also been lodged saying that the data of pre-existing customers is no longer accessible . For those looking for a service similar to MyOtherDrive , we recommend signing up for providers such as Backblaze , Livedrive or Memopal . <p> MyOtherDrive does n't have all the bells and whistles of your typical Cloud provider , but it 's still a reliable service with some strong features , including password-protected encryption , deleted file recovery , and plenty of file sharing options . You can read a detailed MyOtherDrive review below or sign up now . 75368 @qwx275368 <h> Pricing <p> MyOtherDrive personal users can choose from four different pricing points . While the Free account gives you 2 GB at absolutely no cost , the Pro accounts unfortunately require you to fork over some cash . 100 GB costs $5 a month , 500 GB a little steeper at $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is separate pricing for their Enterprise accounts , which we 'll discuss further down in this article . <h> Extras <h> Free account <p> While not advertised as a free trial , MyOtherDrive 's Free account option is the perfect way to give the service a test drive before you decide whether or not you 'd like to sign up for a paid subscription . <p> The MyOtherDrive Free account sports nearly all of the features found in the pro accounts , with the exceptions being that the Free account shows ads and does n't support file sharing . This is a little annoying , but we put up with it , as we still had access to what we consider to be the important things , such as encryption , unmetered bandwidth , and different backup options . <h> Refund policy <p> If you decide to terminate a paid MyOtherDrive subscription , you are entitled to a pro-rated refund . This means that if you signed up for a year 's worth of storage and decide to cancel your account three months in , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Business plans <p> MyOtherDrive has a selection of Enterprise accounts available intended for businesses both big and small . They clock in at $240 a year for 1 TB , $480 a year for 2 TB , $1,200 a year for 5 TB , and $2,400 a year for 10 TB . <p> Aside from a per-year payment option and loads more storage space , the features of MyOtherDrive Enterprise accounts do n't differ from those of the Free and Pro accounts . <h> Payment methods <p> Oddly , you can only pay for MyOtherDrive 's online backup services using PayPal . We find this quite limiting as the majority of other Cloud providers accept other common forms of payment , such as credit cards and bank transfers . <h> How does MyOtherDrive compare to the competition ? <p> The average pricing for an online backup solution is $5 to $12 a month , and MyOtherDrive 's Pro accounts fall neatly into this range . The types and number of features that you get for the cost of MyOtherDrive is also quite standard when it comes to Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage ? <p> Cloud storage . <p> With its limited storage space , well-developed file sharing options , and unlimited number of devices , MyOtherDrive 's services are best described as Cloud storage . That said , it does blur the line between online backup and Cloud storage a little bit thanks to its strong encryption and non-existent file syncing . <p> Want to know more about the differences between online backup and Cloud storage ? You can read all about it in our Ultimate Online Backup Guide . <h> About MyOtherDrive <p> MyOtherDrive was founded in 2005 by John DeRegnaucourt and is headquartered in Dayton , Ohio . On their About Us ' page they claim to be one of the fastest growing online storage companies online , with their services being used by everyone from individuals to businesses to government . <p> In addition to basic details , MyOtherDrive 's website provides useful information regarding company functions , the most pertinent being their data loss prevention techniques . They use racks of RAID 6 storage servers at their Dayton location , as well as backup their users ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against system failures , natural disasters , and theft . <h> Backup options <p> Automatic backup <p> Manual backup <p> Multiple computer backup <p> You have two choices when it comes to backing up to MyOtherDrive : manual and automatic . Manual backup does n't require any lengthy instructions : You simple have to upload any files or folders you desire to have backed up via the file manager ( pressing the Upload ' button if it 's a single file or folder , and the Backup ' button if it 's multiple ) . <p> Automatic backup is a little more complicated , but not terribly so . If you 'd like to have unattended backup running , you 'll have to set up a schedule , choosing days of the week and time , which files and folders you 'd like to have continuously backed up from your computer , and where you would like them to be sent within your MyOtherDrive account . <p> Every time the scheduled day and hour occurs , MyOtherDrive will begin copying your chosen files and folders to their servers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you can do by logging into the file manager , clicking the Backup ' button in the toolbar , and then the View Progress ' button . <h> Which operating systems is it compatible with ? <p> Desktop : Windows , Mac OS X , Linus <p> Mobile : N/A <h> File sharing <p> Public , friend- , and password-based file sharing options <p> Option to password protect shared files <p> Group folders which you can add friends to via their email addresses <p> Whether you want to share a file with a friend or with the world , MyOtherDrive has got you covered . They offer three options : Public sharing ( anyone can access ) , friend-based sharing ( access is controlled by you via permissions ) , and password-based sharing ( access is controlled by you via passwords ) . Moreover , you can share HTML folder and file views ( both include a comments section ) as well as direct links to image thumbnails . <p> The good news ? MyOtherDrive does offer file syncing and deleted file recovery " albeit in limited forms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your MyOtherDrive account to mirror those on your computer , you simply have to check synchronization ' in Settings . However , doing so will prevent you from being able to retrieve files that have been deleted , as they 'll be automatically removed from MyOtherDrive when removed from your computer . <p> If this is a concern of yours , leave the Settings as-is , as by default MyOtherDrive does not transmit deletions that have been made on your computer to their servers . As such , if you mistakenly delete a file from your computer , or if " god forbid " your computer crashes , all of your data can be found safe and sound in your MyOtherDrive account ! <h> Security <p> Funnily enough , security is optional at MyOtherDrive . So if you wish to safeguard your data , you must follow the following steps : <p> First , set an encryption password , which can be done in the Settings window under the encryption tab . <p> Afterwards , you must mark any folders that you desire to stay private as encrypted . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that folder will be AES 128-bit encrypted . As such , the file will be encrypted on your computer first , and then transmitted and stored on MyOtherDrive 's server in encrypted format , so your raw files will not be visible on the MyOtherDrive network or storage servers . <p> If you 'd like to download any encrypted files back onto your computer , you simply have to download as you normally would and enter the encryption password when prompted , which will decrypt your files . Getting the password right is vital as if it 's incorrect all the encrypted files will be inaccessible and contain worthless data . <p> One final word of warning : You must mark your folders as encrypted before uploading any files to them . If you already have the files in the folder and then encrypt it , only files uploaded thereafter will be encrypted . <h> Customer Support <h> Resources <p> If you have any questions or require any guidance when setting up and using MyOtherDrive , you 're likely to find the answer in the company 's FAQ or Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Help page reads like a how-to " and cover all the important topics , such as troubleshooting for different operating systems , explanation of various features , and setup instructions . <h> Contacting staff <p> Issue ca n't be resolved using the information found on the MyOtherDrive FAQ or Help page ? Do n't fret , you can contact the company directly using the contact form on their website . <p> Unfortunately , that 's the only way that you can contact them , which we were n't too big fans of . We think that MyOtherDrive would benefit from introducing additional means of communication to better serve their customers , such as a help line or online chat . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> We decided to assess the speed and quality of MyOtherDrive 's customer service by sending them a query via the contact form on their website . Immediately after sending our question we received this confirmation message : <p> When we 'd receive the response , however , we did n't know , as we were never emailed a ticket number giving us a time approximation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waiting , so could not properly assess the quality of MyOtherDrives customer service . 75370 @qwx275370 75367 @qwx275367 <p> To get started with MyOtherDrive is simple . All you have to do is sign up via their website and " once you verify your account through email " your account will be up and running and ready to use . <p> MyOtherDrive requires no software download as its services are all completed via its online file manager . For the file manager to function properly , however , users must have the most up-to-date version of Java downloaded on their Mac or PC . <h> How to cancel your account <p> If you wish to terminate your MyOtherDrive subscription , you just have to send the Cloud storage provider an email and they will close your account . That said , MyOtherDrive will only close empty accounts , so be sure to clear out your file manager of all data before sending them a line . <p> Another option suggested by MyOtherDrive is to downgrade to a Free account in lieu of total account termination . That way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at no cost , and if you decide to go back to a paid account it will be as simple as clicking a button . <h> MyOtherDrive Review Conclusion <h> We liked <h> We were n't too sure about <p> Limited customer support options <p> Limited payment options <p> Must manually set up security measures <p> No file versioning <h> We hated <p> Nothing <p> MyOtherDrive is not the fanciest or flashiest of Cloud providers , but it gets the job done , and sometimes that 's all that a person or small business needs . Its range of features are small but strong , and include attractive offers such as AES 128-bit encryption , multiple file sharing options , helpful resource pages , and an easy-to-use file manager . <p> If you think that MyOtherDrive meets your basic backup needs and would like to give it a spin , you can sign up for a free 2 GB account by clicking on the button below .

For every person that signs up on your invitation , you will both make 500 MB ( up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are more interested in backing up large amounts of data , however , then the paid subscription may be a better option ; although this plan can only be used to backup data from one computer . Subscriptions can be paid for using Visa , MasterCard , Visa Electron , PayPal or via a bank transfer . <p> Compared to other backup providers that provide unlimited storage for around $60 per year , Memopal 's subscription price might seem a little steep . However , it 's clear that they are trying to make their product worth its price tag by providing a broad range of features designed to meet a diverse array of needs . Are they successful ? We take a look below . <h> Features <h> About Memopal <p> Memopal began life in 2007 , founded by Gianluca Granero and Marco Trombetti , both of whom boast successful records as entrepreneurs within the IT industry . Based in Italy , their small team now provides storage services to over 1 million people and maintains partnerships with a number of large companies . <h> Multiple ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every file on your computer , and online storage solutions focus on storing and sharing individual files and folders , Memopal easily accommodates both approaches .

All files and folders on your C : drive will then be automatically backed up . <p> There are no restrictions on the types or sizes of files that can be backed up , but all single documents exceeding 5GB in size must be uploaded manually . <h> Backup from multiple devices <p> Memopal account holders can backup files from an unlimited number of different devices . As so many of us now own more than one way to work , check our emails , and watch Netflix ( from laptops , tablets and phones to old-fashioned desktops ) , being able to back them all up to the same account without paying extra can come in very useful . <h> Automatic updates <p> Once you 've decided which files to backup , Memopal will automatically update your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The software runs automatically from the moment your computer starts up and requires little to no input once setup is complete . <h> Scheduling <p> Browsing through the desktop app 's advanced settings , you 'll find the option to change your backup schedule . You can choose automatic ( whereby all changes are immediately uploaded to the cloud ) , daily or weekly , with the latter options also allowing you to select your preferred day and time . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> Memopal is compatible with Windows , Mac OS X and Linux , and its mobile app runs on Android and iOS . Those using Memopal 's free plan can backup and access files across as many different devices ( and operating systems ) as they like . <h> Sync and share options <p> It 's very easy to share files with Memopal " you can either right click on a backed up file and select Share ' , or drag a file into the Share ' box on the desktop app . Both methods will generate a secure link , which can be copied and pasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit on the size or type of file that can be shared , but it 's worth noting that there is no way to password-protect links . <p> Memopal also provide a synchronisation service that allows you to access backed up files from multiple devices , just by adding documents to a sync folder . <h> File versioning <p> Memopal joins other providers including SpiderOak and ElephantDrive in offering unlimited file versioning . This is a process by which previous versions of your documents are automatically saved " allowing you to return to an earlier draft of your work should you need to retrieve information further down the line . With plenty of providers limiting how many versions can be saved or how long they are retained for , Memopal 's unlimited capacity is a big plus here . <h> Long-term storage <p> As well as versioning , Memopal will also hang on to files after you 've deleted them from your hard drive . This means that you can use the service as a long-term storage solution " keeping files safe while freeing up space on your PC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance , but it 's an extra security measure ; if you delete an important file by mistake , you can always get it back . You can also disable this feature if you prefer . <h> Speed <p> To get an idea of Memopal 's upload and download speeds , we ran some simple tests . Starting with uploads , we manually timed how long it took for five individual files to transfer to the Cloud , then divided the number of MB in each file by how many seconds it took . We then converted our results into Mbps , applied the same process to five downloads , and recorded our findings in the graph below . <p> As illustrated by the graph , Memopal 's average upload speed sits at around 2.1 Mbps , with a high of 2.9 Mbps . A 100MB file took just over five minutes to backup " slightly below the typical speed of other providers we 've tested . <p> Downloads were quite a bit faster , with an average speed of 3.8 Mbps the same 100MB file taking around three minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout about when it comes to Memopal 's speeds , but nothing to be too worried about either unless speed is your top priority . <h> Priority uploads <p> The official line from Memopal is that your first full system backup can take as long as a month to complete . As backup services are often slow , this is n't particularly unusual " but Memopal are going the extra mile in an attempt to make the process as painless as possible . <p> They achieve this by using a system of prioritization based on file types and frequency of use . This detects which data is most likely to be important to you and backs it up first , so you can relax in the knowledge that your essential files will be safe within the first few days rather than waiting at the back of the queue . <p> This is a nice idea , although it does n't work perfectly- in practice " here at BestBackups , not all of our important files get accessed regularly , so did n't make it into the first round of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current projects first , however , it does come in handy . <h> Location <p> Memopal is an especially practical choice for users based in Europe , as its datacenters are much closer to home than those used by US providers . This proximity helps to speed up your upload and download times , making backups run more smoothly . <p> The company also falls under the jurisdiction of the Court of Rome , Italy , which conforms to the EU 's Data Protection Directive . For those concerned about privacy , this is an advantage , as EU guidelines make it much harder for corporations and governments to demand ( and receive ) your data than in the US . <h> Security <p> Memopal 's security credentials are good , with plenty of detailed information about their standards and processes available online , and an extensive set of regulations in place to maintain user privacy . <p> All data backed up with Memopal is protected with 256-bit end-to-end encryption , and transferred using a server-side SSL certificate " meaning that your files are locked up tight whilst still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again . The company also takes steps to reduce the risk of Man-in-the-Middle attacks by requiring clients to present a valid digital certificate before any communication takes place . <p> In addition to this , Memopal also takes measures to ensure that no stored data can be connected to its author , by encrypting the data structures that link the two together and storing user registration data and files in different geographical locations . These security standards are maintained by Memopal employees as well " data can not be connected to its author or accessed in any way by staff , even during system maintenance . <h> MGFS <p> In order to protect stored data against physical damage , Memopal run RAID 5 technology on their servers , and also developed MGFS " the Memopal Global File System . This allows the company to save your data across multiple different data centers in different geographical locations " meaning that if one should be disrupted or destroyed by a natural disaster , your files will still be safe in another . <h> Customer- Support <p> Memopal 's customer support options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a toll-free option for US users . All other enquiries and technical problems can be solved by submitting a support ticket . <p> For more general information , you can turn to the Memopal YouTube channel , which features a few basic introductory videos , or to their FAQ , which contains around 45 practical questions and answers to help you get started . Do n't  expect too much , however - questions are basic and a little repetitive , with an absence of any advanced topics or troubleshooting advice . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> Having sent off a support ticket of our own , we were very pleased with the speed and quality of Memopal 's response . Within four hours of submitting our request , we received a friendly and detailed reply that gave us all of the information we were looking for and clear directions on how to find out more .

As soon as the installation is finished your selected files will begin to upload " the process running in the background until they are all securely backed up to the Cloud . <p> The majority of backup information can be found on the Memopal app Dashboard , which displays the progress of any files currently being uploaded , as well as showing how much of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also shortcuts for sharing and restoring files , and a quick way to invite your friends to join Memopal .

For those looking for speed and simplicity , it 's the perfect answer . <h> Using the mobile app <p> You can upload files and download and share backed up data from the Memopal mobile app , which is ( once again ) easy to understand and use .

On the whole , then , Zoolz ' pricing structure is hard to fault . <h> Features <h> Online backup or Cloud storage ? <p> Zoolz is a bit of a tricky service to categorise , as it lacks the unlimited storage space typically associated with online backups , but also has much more limited file sharing options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

After 3 months of running backups daily , the data has not been completed ( I have 200 MB Internet up/down service ) . The tech support is USELESS . They take 24 hours to respond each time , and when they respond they ask you to run logs reports for another 24 hours and send then the logs , which you cant because the logs are so big you cant email them . <p> What a waste of time . We went with a rigid plan to backup 3 million files about 10 TB of data to keep off premises for an emergency recovery . <p> After 7 days of back and forth on emails from support , their recommendation was to restart the backup from the beginning because I have " TOO MANY FILES " <p> Deduplication service does n't  work because , ( you have to laugh here ) they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uploaded a lot of files that you have already uploaded before ( not recommended ) .

The support is next to useless , and the tool does not deliver on performance for downloads or uploads . But what most worried me was exactly how safe are my documents were so I did some research and found out this is not actually a UK business , these people are based in the middle-east in Jordan of all places , which is why I moved what documents I could retrieve to a new provider called Datacastle RED who I checked out before signing up to their business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents then keep well away from this smoke and mirrors business ! <p> Stay FAR FAR away and DO NOT TRUST ZOOLZ . Complete scam . We started with an unlimited plan for $60/year , and they jacked it up to $1620 after 2 years , literally holding 5TB of data hostage unless we paid ( though kindly offering a 40% discount WTF ) . Absolutely unbelievable , and probably illegal . Who knows how much they would charge to actually restore a lost backup . This company is BAD NEWS . <p> UPDATE : I am sure I am just rare customer who got caught in the cracks , but we had a tough experience with Zoolz . We started with an unlimited-space plan for $60/year , but after 2 years , our price apparently increased to $1620 ( we uploaded 4.5T of data ) . Zoolz ended our subscription without notice , and only offered to upgrade to a much more expensive service . Happily , they did finally offer to continue with the same deal we started with . I guess I wish it did n't  take complaining and threatening to post bad reviews .

Sure , it is not Europe-founded company but Mozy has business operations in Ireland and UK , and have a network that cover Europe region . Plus , they are backed by VMWare and EMC Corporation so its one hell of a solid company . Customer service is also available in English , German and French , so its a nice change from only having English language support . You do n't  get unlimited storage and starting plan will cost you $5.99 per month for 50GB of storage and one PC . Next up to the tier is $9.99 per month which will give you 125GB storage space . Additional computers will cost $2/month per computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Professional plans will start from $17.50 to $332.50 per month depending on space of 50GB up to 1 TB . Those are only for one computer and additional computers will cost you more . We have a full review about Mozy here . <h> 2 . SOS Online Backup From $79.95/year <p> SOS Online Backup has business operations and network in Europe , Asia and US , covering a wide part of the world for their customers all over on this planet . The starting plan will cost you $79.95 per year and give you 50GB of storage , but you can backup up to 5 PCs or Macs without any additional cost . 100GB plan is charged at $99.95 per year and 150GB will eat $149.95 per year from your wallet . Sure , it does n't  offer unlimited storage , and the pricing may seem kinda high . But if you compare it to other services like Carbonite or Mozy , then it will cost a lot more for you to backup 5 computers with other companies while SOS let 's you do it straight out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features such as unlimited versioning ( most companies give 30 days or 60 days versioning ) , Facebook backup and many more . But their software is dead simple to use despite of all those features they offer . You can read our full review here . <h> 3 . HiDrive From Free <p> HiDrive is a Germany-based company and have networks in both Europe and US . The website is very cheery and colorful , and its cloud backup services are kinda unique . First of all , it let 's you access to your storage space using WebDAV , FTP , Rsync SCP and Samba . Basically , it let 's you backup to them in your own way . Their only client software will do restoration for you . You will find yourself performing a lot of file management tasks , uploading and whatnot using the web interface ( pretty slick one at that ) . There are only three plans , and you get 5GB for free with WebDAV access . HiDrive 100 ( 100GB storage ) will cost you- --9.99 per month and HiDrive 500 ( 500GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per month . There are apps for iOS , Android and Windows Phone 7 too . Here is our full review . <h> 4 . DollyDrive From $3/month <p> We actually want to give this kick-ass company higher position than #4 . But DollyDrive only works with Mac and Time Machine . Actually , its created to backup your Time Machine onto the cloud . If it offers more than that , we would definitely be happy to put it on somewhere higher . DollyDrive is n't a Europe-based company , but they have a data center in Rome , and will let customers choose to use either Europe grid or US grid when they sign up . Its plans are nowhere near pricey ( from $3 per month for 50GB of storage ) and you also get 5GB additional free storage every month ( yes , compounding free storage ) until Standard Plan which will cost you $7 per month and give you 250GB of storage . After Standard Plan , you no longer get to enjoy free 5GB every month but you will also get plenty of storage starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual plans . Family plans will give you 250GB ( $7/month ) of storage up to 8TB ( $143.96/month ) if you want , and you get to backup more than one Mac too . DollyDrive also gives you syncing as well as fully bootable hard drive cloning features . You can go ahead and read how much we love DollyDrive here.Visit DollyDrive <h> 5 . Memopal From Free <p> Memopal is based in Rome , Italy , so if you live in Europe or nearby , then you may want to check them out . They offer 3GB storage plan for free , and you get all the backup features with it . If you want to upgrade to get more storage space , there comes the confusion . You can get 200GB at $49/year or 300GB at $69/year . If you purchased 200GB first and later decide to switch to 300GB , then you can do so at additional $30/year . If you stick to 200GB then , additional 150GB is charged at $70/year while 200GB more will set you back for $100/year . And if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either get 50GB more ( $40/year ) or 100GB ( $70/year ) . So the bottom line is that for personal plans , you can get up to 400GB , although pricing is hella confusing . If you want business plan , then its a lot simpler . $48/year for 10GB storage , 1 computer . Any additional storage will be charged at $2.4/year per GB . Now that you are confused , you can either read our full review here or move on . 75371 @qwx275371 <h> One response to " 5 Best Online Backups In Europe " <p> Your guide is not much use as it does not specify if " ALL DATA " will ONLY be held on servers located within the EU ( other European states ) and thus be subject to their privacy and security laws and kept out of other jurisdictions e.g. USA . I would imagine most people who look at European servers are doing so for this reason .

First , we signed up and got the backups going , for some reason the back-ups would keep more versions then we specified and we were going over our space limit . Only after multiple " Tickets " , emails and phone calls did we get it fixed . We were threatened to have a hike on our fee , it was frustrating because we were doing everything we could to delete the data and it would not go away . Fast forward several months , we got the local cloud going , we did feel it was a service that would help us . Once we got that going , we invested in a Ready NAS Device to create an Office Cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a $60 fee per month for the Office Cloud . We were having problems and were making phone calls and tickets , it was very frustrating . <p> We do n't  do business with vendors who are not upfront with fees not matter the amount , we feel were were victim of " bait and switch " . If they were honest about the $60 fee hike we would have been ok with it , but they never indicated that to us until we owned a $1800 NAS device and were trying to set it up . We terminated our service because of this . We will not do business with Egnyte.

Here at BestBackups , however , we 've got early access to the info so can confirm that users will now be able to get- 1TB of storage space for just $9.95 per month a huge improvement on their previous plan , which offered 100GB for the same price . <p> If you decide to sign up , ElephantDrive accepts payment from most major credit cards , and yearly subscriptions can be purchased through PayPal. <h> - Features <h> About ElephantDrive <p> ElephantDrive was founded April 2005 by Ben Widhelm ( now company Principal ) and Michael Fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological services , with Widhelm contributing to application management product Burstly ( which was later bought by Apple ) , and Fisher involved for several years with Vivendi Universal Net USA . <p> Located in Santa Monica , California , the company has expanded significantly in recent years and now processes millions of files every day , as well as upholding partnerships with companies including QNAP , NETGEAR , and Thecus . <h> Backup options <p> There are three ways to manually backup your files to ElephantDrive ; right clicking on your chosen file or folder , using the desktop app , or via their website . There are also two locations that you can save your data to ; Backup ' and Everywhere ' . All data will be backed up to the Cloud , but while files placed in the Backup folder can only be accessed from the ElephantDrive website , those saved to Everywhere will be synced with all other devices registered to your account . <p> If you prefer , you can also run continuous , automatic backups , or set a schedule for new uploads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little time consuming . <p> You 'll need to navigate to Manage Backups and select the backup set you want to schedule <p> then click " edit backup " and pick your preferred times and dates , or the frequency with which you want to process to run . <p> When it comes to choosing which files to backup , there are no limits on file types , but individual file sizes are restricted . For Personal subscribers , no single file can exceed 1GB , while business accounts have a limit of 5GB . This is an important point to consider if you have very large files to backup- if it 's a deal breaker , then there are other providers on the market that give you much more freedom . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> ElephantDrive is compatible with Windows , Mac , iOS and Android . If you own multiple devices that run on different operating systems , that 's fine too . You can still backup and sync all of your files , even if half of them were created on a Mac and the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devices <p> Key to ElephantDrive 's philosophy is the view that users should be able to access their data from multiple devices without paying extra for the privilege . In a time when most people work from more than just one computer , this is a real advantage " especially as many other backup providers do n't offer the service or charge extra to register more devices . <h> Sync and share options <p> If you want to sync your files across multiple devices or share them with others , you 'll need to save them in ElephantDrive 's Everywhere folder . When you place a file in the folder , it will automatically appear in the Everywhere folder of all other devices registered to your account . <p> Once in the Everywhere folder , it 's easy to share your files from the ElephantDrive website . All you need to do is log in , find the file you want to send and select Share ' from its options menu . This will generate a link , which you can copy and paste in any location or email directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versioning <p> ElephantDrive , like competitors including SpiderOak and Memopal , offers unlimited file versioning . This means that files synced to ElephantDrive will not only exist in their most up-to-date form " you 'll be able to access previous versions of them as well . It 's a very useful tool should you need to return to an earlier draft of a piece of work to retrieve deleted information or undo any changes . <p> Most backup providers offer some form of versioning service , although many limit how many versions can be saved , or how long they are retained for . While ElephantDrive does n't impose any such restrictions , it does give you the option to put them in place yourself , as versions can take up valuable storage space . You can change your versioning rules from their website , as well deleting versions that you 're confident that you wo n't be needing again . <h> Archived files <p> In addition to versioning , ElephantDrive also archives your saved files , so that when you delete data from your hard drive , it wont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain intact . If you 've ever deleted an important document by mistake , you 'll understand just how helpful this service can be . <p> You can customize your archiving rules , too " determining how long archived files are kept for , and deleting any that you do n't want or need to keep . <h> Speed <p> Upload and download speeds are a significant part of the performance of every backup service , so we ran some tests on ElephantDrive to get an idea of just how quick it is . We did this by first uploading five files and manually recording how long they took to upload , then dividing the number of MB in each file by how many seconds it took to transfer . We then converted this number into Mbps and repeated the process on five downloads . You can take a look at our results below . <p> As you can see , there 's not an especially big difference between upload and download speeds , with a 100MB file uploading in just over five minutes and downloading in a little under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2.6 Mbps , similar to that of many other providers " the majority of which sit between 2 and 4 Mbps . Download speeds , on the other hand , averaged at just 3.2 Mbps , noticeably slower than many of their competitors , most of whom recorded figures between 4 and 5 Mbps . <p> While our tests are designed to give a basic idea of what you can expect from transferring files using ElephantDrive , it 's worth noting that speeds do fluctuate depending on your broadband speed and other external factors , so our results should be taken as a guide only . <h> NAS <p> One of ElephantDrive 's greatest successes is its compatibility with Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) devices . The company 's development in thi area has led to partnerships with major manufacturers of NAS hardware including NETGEAR , QNAP , Thecus , ReadyNAS and TurboNAS . While you can add files and folders from any NAS device , these companies have integrated ElephantDrive 's backup software into their product , making it particularly easy to use . As- this compatibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes ElephantDrive an excellent choice for NAS users . <h> Security <p> When it comes to protecting your data , ElephantDrive is pretty thorough , with industry-standard encryption and physical security measures in place . <p> All data backed up to ElephantDrive is encrypted on your computer using a 256-bit AES key , and sent via a 128-bit SSL channel " the same standard of protection used by banks to keep online transactions private and secure . For an extra layer of security , you can also choose to encrypt your data using a privatel key based on a password . This is a powerful means of keeping your files private , as the password is never known or stored by the company in its plaintext ( unencrypted ) form unlike if you use their standard key . <p> Personal keys have a lot of security advantages , but they also carry a risk . If you were to forget or lose your password , you would have no way of signing into your account , and your data would be permanently inaccessible . ElephantDrive creates a new password for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the service without paying for a new account ) , but it would n't allow you to access any files saved using your private key . You 'd have to start your backup all over again . <p> On a physical level , ElephantDrive 's data storage infrastructure is provided by Amazon Web Services . All data is stored across multiple devices in diverse geographical locations both inside and outside the US to ensure that , should one data center suffer any physical damage , your files will still be safe on another . <p> There are plenty of security measures in place inside the data centers as well , protecting servers against extreme temperatures , power failure , and natural disasters . Staff access is also restricted , with all personnel entering the building subjected to high-level authorisation checks . Responsibilities are divided up so that employees managing users ' data are not given tasks that require interaction with encryption keys . <h> Customer- Support <p> All ElephantDrive customers have access to an online FAQ and video tutorials , and Lite subscribers can make use of their email-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a live chat . <p> While ElephantDrives online resources are useful for beginners , their frequently asked questions and tutorials cover a limited range of topics , and more advanced troubleshooting resources are mostly absent . <p> On the plus side , there is a lot of information available for NAS users , so those choosing ElephantDrive for its NAS compatibility will find plenty of useful information on making the software work for them . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> Having sent an inquiry via support ticket , we received a reply in a little over eight hours . While this is fairly slow compared to some providers such as Memopal and Backblaze , who got back to us in less than half that time , we did receive an apologetic email informing us of the delay . It was a thoughtful touch and our reply , when it came , was clear and gave a detailed answer to our question as well as inviting us to respond should we have any further queries . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> ElephantDrive has an unusually limited social media profile compared to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Facebook and Twitter accounts , none is updated more than a few times per month , and feature very little interaction with users . This is particularly noticeable on Twitter , where they have under a thousand followers , compared to the five to ten thousand that is typical of most other major backup providers . <h> - The Process 75367 @qwx275367 <p> Downloading ElephantDrive is just a matter of visiting their website and choosing which plan you want to go for . If you opt for the Personal subscription , you 'll need to enter your payment details " if you 're happy with a Free account , you can proceed straight to downloading the 35MB installation file . <p> While installing the program was perfectly straightforward , getting started can be a little confusing as ElephantDrive 's functions are split between the desktop application and their website . With limited instructions provided , it can take a little while to familiarize yourself with all of the available features , and the interface is not particularly intuitive so poses a few challenges . There are also confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to upload and download files from the website " a somewhat clunky piece of software that we were n't convinced was really necessary . If you get stuck , however , there are tutorials and instructions available on their Support website . <h> Using ElephantDrive <p> With three different ways to backup your files , you can choose which option works best for you . The ElephantDrive desktop app works in much the same way as Google Drive and Dropbox " all you need to do to upload your files is drag or copy them into the ElephantDrive folder . Right clicking on a folder will also give you the option to back it up , although this does not work for individual files . <p> You can also backup files by logging into your account on the website and clicking on the upload icon , which will launch the ElephantDrive Transfer Manager . You 'll need to install this if you want to upload or download any files , but be aware that it has compatibility issues with some browsers , such as Chrome , which require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three methods work a little differently , uploading files to slightly different locations in subtly different ways , which can be somewhat confusing . Once you 've accustomed yourself to the processes you 'll be okay , but it feels unnecessary that something made simple by the majority of other providers is so complicated here . <h> Using the mobile app <p> For iTunes and Android Store users , downloading the ElephantDrive mobile app is simple . If you purchase applications through Google Play , however , you 'll have more trouble . With the app not currently listed in their store , you 'll have install it directly from the ElephantDrive website , which does n't yet have a mobile-friendly version . <p> Once you 've got the app up and running , it 's considerably easier to find your way around than the website or desktop app , with clear settings and upload options . Opening- folders and viewing files is very time-consuming , however , and the app crashes frequently , so beware . In addition to this , making your files available offline is only possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only open and view their data , although an update is currently in development . We found this pretty disappointing given ElephantDrive 's much-lauded file syncing options ; with the majority of providers offering full access to files from mobile devices , we expected more . <p> - ElephantDrive Review Conclusion <h> We liked <p> NAS compatibility <p> Successful combination of backup and file sharing features <p> Good security <p> Flexible versioning and archiving options <p> Backup multiple devices to one account <h> We were n't so sure about <p> Limited sizes for individual file uploads <p> Software can be confusing to use <p> No option to save or edit files from Android app <h> We hated <p> Nothing much ! <p> ElephantDrive 's greatest achievement is its successful integration of NAS , so if you 're looking for an NAS-compatible program , it 's an excellent choice . For other users , features such as file versioning have been very well developed , and the ability to backup multiple devices without paying extra is a major bonus . On the downside , their website and software are not particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it well worth taking a little time and effort to learn how to make ElephantDrive work for you . <p> It was pre-installed on the NAS ( mine is made by Western Digital ) and was pretty simple to set up . Solid solution and very affordable ( lower pricing than what is shown above not sure if that is old or there is some deal with WD ) . <p> I 've double checked their current price plans , and can confirm that the prices in the review are still up to date perhaps you were charged the discounted yearly fee , or were part of a localised promotion . I hope you continue to find the service useful keep us updated if you learn anything new ! 
@@26491902 @191902/ <h> Summary : <p> MEGA offers a generous free online storage plan with 50MB of space on offer , although bandwidth caps are a major turn off . Although controversy related to founder Kim Dotcom 's involvement may raise a few eyebrows , good security features are a powerful draw. - You can read a detailed review below or sign up now . 75368 @qwx275368 <p> MEGA has one of the largest free plans on the market , offering 50GB of space completely free of charge . As with all of their accounts , there is a bandwidth cap , and for free users this is dynamic " you ca n't exceed 10GB at any time , but that allowance is refilled every 30 minutes so long as you 're logged into your account . As you might expect , such a small cap can really slow things down , and is likely to put off a lot of users . However , if you do n't  have too many large files to transfer then the lure of so much free space might outweigh- its disadvantages . <p> Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose from . At the lower end , a Lite subscription gives you 200GB of space and 1TB of bandwidth for 4.99 Euros ( around $5.35* ) per month . <p> If you 're looking for a larger allowance , a PRO I account will give you 500GB plus 2TB of bandwidth for 9.99 Euros ( approx. $10.75 ) per month and a PRO II offers 2TB and 4TB of bandwidth for 19.99 Euros ( approx. $21.45 ) per month . At the top end of the scale , signing up for PRO III will set you back 29.99 Euros ( approx. $32.20 ) per month in exchange for 2TB of space and 4TB of bandwidth . There 's also an added bonus if you decide to pay for a year upfront , as you 'll receive a discount of two months ' worth of fees . <p> MEGA 's stringent security measures mean that there 's no business subscription available , on the grounds that sharing files openly among multiple employees is inherently insecure . Instead , companies are encouraged to set up all of their users with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign up for a paid account , you can pay by credit or debit card , as well as by wire transfer , or using Bitcoin or Paysafecard . You can also make a mobile payment using Fortumo or Centili . It 's rare to find a provider that does n't insist that payments are made by credit or debit card , so if you prefer to keep your purchases anonymous , MEGA is a smart choice . <p> * Currency conversions are based on the exchange rate at the time of writing . <h> - Features <h> About MEGA <p> MEGA , which stands for MEGA Encrypted Global Access , was created in 2013 by Kim Dotcom ; the infamous founder of file hosting site Megaupload . Although a controversial figure whose practices have been brought into question many times , Dotcom 's project successfully gained widespread support , and MEGA , which has moved away from file hosting and into Cloud storage , is now used by more than 15 million people around the world . <p> In recent months , however , Dotcom has distanced himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect the company 's founding principles . Whether this is the result of a personal dispute or legitimate concerns is a contentious issue , but it does appear that MEGA may be changing direction in the months to come . <h> Backup options <p> Although MEGA offers its users larger than average storage allowances , there 's no option to run automated backups of everything on your hard drive , or even to schedule scans for new data . Instead , you 'll need to select all of the files that you want to upload manually , and update them yourself when significant alterations have been made . <p> It 's possible to utilise the majority of MEGA features exclusively from your web browser , with no need to download any software at all . Backing up and restoring data , sharing files and managing your account can all be performed online , although certain processes such as uploading folders and downloading large files work better in specific browsers , primarily Google Chrome and Opera . <p> Apart from this , there are no limitations placed on the type or size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course their bandwidth limits will keep you in something of a chokehold . You can also work around browser limitations and increase MEGA 's performance by downloading the MEGAsync app , or their browser extensions for Chrome and Firefox . <p> If you 're not sure whether MEGA is the best choice for you , you can give it a try before you even register an account , so you do n't have to hand over any personal details until you 're sure you want to proceed . Any data you upload before registering will be retained for two weeks and automatically transferred to your account if you choose to open one , or deleted if you do n't  . <p> Another point worth noting is that , in accordance with their hands-off policy , MEGA does not automatically perform any automatic checks on whether the files you are uploading already have duplicates in storage . This means that if you backup a file that already exists in your Cloud storage , you 'll just get two copies of it . If this is a problem , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selecting Yes ' in the Skip identical files ' section of your account settings . <p> Finally , accounts that are not used for long periods of time may be deleted , although MEGA will send several warnings in advance , giving you the opportunity to revive the account or close it officially after removing any personal data . <h> Bandwidth restrictions <p> All of MEGA 's subscriptions include a monthly bandwidth limit , with the exception of their free account , which has a dynamic cap . For those not familiar with what this means , your bandwidth allowance is the amount of data that can travel between your computer and the MEGA servers at any one time . It 's not exactly the same as your file transfer speed , but more bandwidth will give the impression that uploads and downloads are running quicker . There 's an excellent explanation on TechTerms if you 'd like to know more . <p> Capping bandwidth is an unusual decision in the world of online backups , and is likely to put a lot of people off MEGAs service . Although pairing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow slightly , the restriction still feels unnecessary and invasive . <p> In an attempt to make things less uncomfortable , MEGA is planning to implement a policy in the coming months that allows Pro users to draw on bandwidth beyond that which automatically comes with their accounts . Users can utilise this themselves , or assign it to third party users that have been granted access to their data ( including those without a MEGA account ) . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> MEGA is compatible with Windows , Mac and Linux operating systems , as well as Android , iOS , Windows Phone and Blackberry . Files transferred using mobile applications are subject to the same end-to-end encryption as those accessed via the MEGA website , so users can work from multiple devices in confidence . There is also no limit on the number of devices that can be registered to one account , so you can backup from as many computers , mobiles and tablets as you like . <h> Automatic sync <p> Once you 've registered with MEGA , you have the option to download the MEGAsync @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your computer and your Cloud storage space . <p> Sync also let 's you upload and down files directly with MEGA , and significantly increases the speed of your file transfers . All changes made to synchronised files online or on your desktop are implemented in both locations almost instantly . <p> In addition to this , MEGAsync also gives you the option to run a Full Account Sync , which backs up all of the files on your system " making it something of a hybrid of online backup and online storage providers . <h> File sharing <p> To share files with other users , you 'll first need to add them to your contact list by entering their email address in the Contacts section of your account . You 'll then need to manually verify their identity , after which you can grant them access to your files . <p> Shared access can take three forms " read only , read/write " in which users can add new files but not remove or edit any existing documents , and full access . You can also share public links to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are MEGA account holders or not . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> Neither MEGA online nor MEGAsync offers any official file versioning system , although it is possible to access files that have since been overwritten from a hidden debris folder . This is n't exactly easy to find , however , so will require a bit of an effort to achieve . <p> When it comes to deleted files , anything documents that you remove from MEGA are moved to a recycle bin , from where you can manually restore them at any time . <h> MEGAChat <p> Although still in Beta , MEGAChat is a video messaging service designed to rival Skype , although placing greater emphasis on keeping your conversations private . All communications get the benefit of end-to-end encryption and are available to all account holders " including those with a free subscription . You can also now send encrypted text messages to your contacts as well . <p> In order to get a taste of what is to come , I gave MEGAChat a trial run , and overall , the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming when talking in a busy room , the connection was stable and audio quality good , making it worth watching out for when it 's unveiled in its final form . <p> There are also plans for a MEGA-run email service , which once again aims to improve on existing providers by increasing security measures . The project has been delayed due to difficulties developing a user-controlled encryption algorithm that works with the email client , but aims to bring an extra layer of privacy to users ' personal communications . <h> Security <p> MEGA is all about security , so it 's no surprise that their privacy features are highly developed . Encryption starts on your computer , with keys created on your own device and remaining there ; meaning that MEGA is never able to access the information needed to decrypt your data . <p> This is determined by a system of user controlled encryption ( UCE ) that hands over control of encryption keys to the user , so that even if hackers were able to access your files , they would n't be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as MEGA never holds your UCE password , if you lose it you wo n't be able to get it back " and therefore wo n't be able to access your MEGA files . If you 're concerned about this , you can choose to backup your master key , so that you can refresh your memory if an emergency strikes further down the line . <p> As well as applying to files transferred using the MEGA app , UCE is also available for in-browser transfers a weak point for many other providers when it comes to data security . You will need to use a HTML5 supported browser in order for this to work , however the best options at present being Mozilla Firefox , Google Chrome , and Opera . <p> UCE is open source , so is open to scrutiny by the wider community . They also use RAID technology to ensure that your data wo n't be lost if a server fails , and control staff access to all user backups . <p> When talking about MEGA 's security , the issue of founder Kim Dotcom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially as he attributed his exit to concerns that new investors and recent management changes have compromised some of the company 's core principles . For further information , this write-up from TechCrunch gives a good overview of the situation . <p> While Dotcom 's allegations raise some obvious red flags , it is important to note that no substantial evidence has been put forward to support claims that security at MEGA has been changed or compromised in the months surrounding his departure . <h> Customer- Support <p> MEGA 's customer support is limited to answers to frequently asked questions in their Help Center , and email support should you want to contact them directly . <p> The Help Center covers a fairly extensive range of subjects and is easy to navigate by selecting your topic or using their search function . Email support is fairly basic ( there 's no integrated messaging system , just an address for you to contact from your own email account ) , but it gets the job done . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> Having submitted an email support request , I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had by a long way , but not the slowest either . Unfortunately for MEGA , in the absence of any live chat or phone support to get problems resolved instantly , the delay has much more of an impact on their overall service than it may have on other providers . <p> When it comes to content , MEGA 's response contained plenty of information , but sadly less clarity . I was given plenty of useful details , but it took some further research on my part to understand the bigger picture . While this may not be the case across the board , it was still somewhat disappointing . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> MEGA holds Facebook and Twitter accounts , both of which are widely followed despite only adding new content every few weeks . Posts primarily feature company news and promotions , and user comments and requests appear to receive prompt replies . <p> There is also a MEGA blog , which features more in-depth , technical articles than typically featured on social media sites , although here again updates are infrequent. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin using MEGA , as the majority of processes can be run from their website . <p> When you 're first getting started , you do n't even have to register an account " you can just upload files directly to their home page , although it makes sense to get yourself a proper account once you 're confident that you 're happy that you 've made the right choice . <p> Once you 're signed up , you can download MEGASync . The installation is quick , and you 'll immediately see a pop-up appear on your taskbar , which acts as a control center for all MEGA processes . <p> From there , you can upload and download files and change your account settings , including setting a bandwidth limit and selecting files to exclude from your next backup . <h> Using MEGA <p> On first glance , everything is fairly straightforward , but in practice there were a few issues . To start with , when I tried to upload a folder , it did n't start syncing automatically " I had to press a few experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resuming worked in the end ) . <p> There is also a confusing division of features between the desktop client and the MEGA website , with different settings available to change from each location and different ways to access your account information . It 's nothing dreadful , but it does make it more of an uphill struggle to get all of your files backed up and ready to go . <h> Using the mobile app <p> MEGA offers a comprehensive app for mobile users* , which is appealingly flexible and easy to navigate . Account holders can upload and download files ( including automatically backing up photos from their phone ) , change settings , share documents , check on their file transfers and even add new contacts just as easily as they can online . It 's clear , easy to install and works well , and has the added bonus of incorporating end-to-end encryption . Impressive . <p> *Two editions of the MEGA app are currently available in most stores " v1 and v2 . This review refers to v2 , as it is the most up-to-date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good security features <p> Generous free storage allowance <p> Simple file transfers <p> Well-designed mobile app <h> I was n't so sure about <p> Iffy customer support <p> Question marks over the company 's reliability <h> I hated <p> Bandwidth restrictions <p> MEGAs main selling point is its free plan , which offers a very generous amount of storage space as well as access to the majority of features . Unfortunately , bandwidth caps do limit the benefits of so much free space , but extensive security features give the software an additional appeal for users that want to keep more than a few files safe without coughing up for a subscription fee . Kim Dotcom 's involvement and recent withdrawal from the company undeniably raises some troubling questions , but the software itself is solid , with some undeniably strong privacy measures in place .

For this , we will only be trying out their Backupify for Personal Apps service since most of our audience here are personal users . - We will be doing another tutorial soon on how to use Backupify for Google Apps and Salesforce . <p> Backupify website is pretty easy to use , and they seem to push Free Trial pretty heavily . However , for Personal Apps backup , you can even sign up to free account . <p> During the sign up , they will ask for pretty complicated kind of password . But that 's fine , since itll strengthen the account security . We just wish that they would put a notification beside password box , not just giving us an error right after we fill in everything and submit . <p> - <p> Another weird thing is that initially we chose free plan MyCloud Personal ( not even free trial ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought me to another page saying we need to enter more complicated password , the signup was changed to free trial for MyCloud 500 which cost $19.99 . What the heck ! We only learned it a bit too late after we signed up . And when we tested the sign up process again , its confirmed that the plan we tried to sign up is changed to MyCloud 500 during " Enter the password with blah blah blah " page . Annoying ! <p> Right , so after the hiccup with sign up stage , we are finally brought to its dashboard , which is where we can add our social media services . The process is actually pretty easy . <p> Regardless of what service we choose , it will use OAuth kind of token authentication to link your Backupify account to available social media services . So Backupify will never ask for your password ( horay for that ) . <p> We added two social media accounts , Facebook and LinkedIn , to test how Backupify will work . The process is actually a breeze , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup process is automated for both services , so we just have to sit back and wait . <p> When you click each service , you will see what things are backup from each account . Then you can actually click on each of them to view your backup data . <p> If you want to download , just click on " Request an export " at the left and you will get ZIP file within 2 days . Sometimes it takes quite awhile due to the data volume . <p> We actually do n't  get a chance to test restoration since backups are n't  completed . However , according to our interview with some Backupify users , one click restoration promise really works , although sometimes Backupify tends to leave out certain data . The service is still young so we cant really blame them for that now . <h> Conclusion <p> Backupify is a young company in emerging new industry . However , there have been a lot of developments with the service as they learn more about what users need . It is a good sign that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly care about their customers . It seems like this industry is still young so there will be a lot of rooms to grow , for both Backupify and its competitors like Spanning . Right now as it stands , Backupify is still a mystery to us . If we want to backup our Google Apps , Backupify wont be our first choice for now ( there are other enterprise-level services ) , but for personal users Backupify seems to be doing its job . Yet , if you want to remain as a free user , just beware that you will hit a wall sooner or later . There is no way that 1GB and weekly backup is enough for any needs . So be prepared to upgrade . For other social media accounts , there is n't a lot of choices that allow you to backup all those in one platform . The jury is still out , but it is a worthwhile service to try . 75371 @qwx275371

If you do decide to sign up , payment can be made with most major credit cards , including Visa , Mastercard , American Express , and Discover . <h> Online backup or Cloud storage ? <p> Online backup . <p> Unlimited storage space , automatic backups and stellar security make Backblaze one of the most traditional online backup providers on the market . Although this means it 's not ideal if you 're looking for sync and share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect for keeping up-to-date copies of all of your files safely stored online . <h> Features <h> About Backblaze <p> Backblaze started life in 2007 and is the brainchild of current CEO Gleb Budman and CTO Brian Wilson . Both previously worked together at MailFronteir , developing anti-phishing and anti-spam email filters before moving into online backup . Now fronting Backblaze , they are located in San Mateo , California and are known for their innovative storage pod design , as well as for documenting their product development online . <h> Unlimited data <p> When it comes to storage , Backblaze 's buzzword is unlimited ' ; unlimited storage , unlimited file sizes , unlimited file types . If you sign up for their personal plan , you 'll get as much storage space as you could possibly want , and plenty of flexibility in how you can use it . It 's worth noting that some file types ( such as EXE application files and ISO disk images ) are n't automatically backed up , although this can be changed by altering your settings . All default restrictions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being that the majority of people want to backup text documents , photos , videos , music and so on . If this is the case , then excluding non-user generated and temporary content will make most backups more streamlined . <h> Automated backup <p> One of Backblaze 's main selling points is its simple , automated backup process ; all you need to do is set it up and let it run . In its default state , Backblaze will backup absolutely everything in supported file formats , leaving no stone unturned . If you 'd prefer to be a bit more selective , you can simply choose which files you want to exclude " a much quicker process than having to identify the ( typically much larger ) selection of files that you do want to save . <p> Although great for those wishing to perform a straightforward , full backup , things can get difficult if you want to store a more specific selection of data not least because you can only exclude folders , not individual files . If you 're looking for a service that enables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , Backblaze may not be the best choice for you . <p> For users looking for something low-maintenance , however , it 's a solid choice . Backblaze 's data backup is a continuous process , so every new document and updated file will be instantly uploaded to the Cloud . If you 'd rather have more control over when this takes place , you can alter the schedule in settings " instructing the program to run once a day , or only when you tell it to . <h> Backup to external drives <p> The Backblaze Personal account only works for one computer , but it can also be used to store files taken from an unlimited number of external drives . The service is free of charge and is compatible with USB , Thunderbolt and Firewire drives " although NAS hard drives are not supported . Just plug in your drive during backup , and the files will be transferred automatically . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> Backblaze is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems , and its mobile application can be used on Android and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and share files from their mobile device , making it easier to access data on the go . Although all content can be viewed in the app , mobile users wo n't be able to download individual files of over 30MB . <p> So far as mobile security is concerned , you 'll need to sign in with your Backblaze email and password every time you launch the app , and all communication is sent to the Backblaze datacenter through an HTTPS ( encrypted ) connection . <h> File sharing options <p> Backblaze has no integrated file sharing options at this time . <h> Optimized performance <p> Many Cloud backup services use up a lot of your computer 's CPU , causing other programs to run slowly . Backblaze has tried to evade this common problem by designing software that has minimal impact on your PC 's performance " and they 've succeeded . By avoiding memory-intensive processes like installing drivers , and utilizing a slow scanning system that opens files in read-only mode , Backblaze rarely uses more than 1% of a computer 's CPU . So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a price ; a fast computer means a slow backup ( see our Speed ' section below ) . <h> Speed <p> You can check your upload speed in Backblaze itself , by clicking on Settings then choosing the Performance tab " the speed is displayed at the bottom of the page in Mbps . We ran five upload and five download tests to monitor the transfer speeds of files ranging from 30MB to 1GB and recorded our findings ; you can take a closer look at the results in the graph below . <p> As you can see , Backblaze 's low impact file transfer system really does slow things down " an average upload speed of just 1.9 Mbps means that you 'll be waiting a long time for your backup to complete . Downloads are even slower at approximately 1.2 Mbps , confirming Backblaze 's position as one of the slowest providers out there . Obviously , the reduced impact on your normal computer processes will make the compromise worthwhile for some , but if you 're searching for something speedy you may want to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backups should take around 30 days , and advises users with very large amounts of data or a slow internet connection to consider using a different service . <h> File versioning <p> Backblaze offers a limited versioning service , in which old saves of your documents are retained for 30 days before being deleted . This is a helpful tool if you ever want to read back over an earlier version of a document , to retrieve deleted information or pinpoint when a particular change was made . Although some backup providers offer unlimited file versioning , this is a handy feature that 's worth having even in its limited form . <h> Emergency file restoration <p> Common wisdom states that you should backup your files three times " once online , once on a local device and once on a remote device . This should mean that one copy of your data will survive no matter what happens . For example , environmental damage such as flooding ca n't affect your online storage , while problems with your internet will leave external hard drives intact . Should it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have a physical backup to hand , however , all is not lost . <p> Upon request , Backblaze will send you a hard drive containing all of your data , courtesy of FedEx . Drives are shipped within 3 to 10 days , with large quantities of files taking longer to prepare . This service is n't cheap , with a 128GB Flash Drive setting you back $99 , and 4TB available for $189 , but in an emergency , it could definitely come in useful . <h> Expiry <p> Not a feature in the usual sense , but this is something we think you should know . According to the Backblaze website , their storage is not designed as a permanent archive , but as a regularly-updated mirror of your hard drive . This means that , if you do n't access your online files for six months , they will close your account , and all of your data will be deleted . So if you want to find a safe place to store things long-term , Backblaze may not be the best option for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best out there , with end-to-end encryption and high-level security measures available . <p> During backup , Backblaze encrypts all files automatically on users ' computers and then sends them to one of their datacenters via a secure SSL ( HTTPS ) connection . Once transferred they are stored , still encrypted , on disk . When you want to retrieve files , entering your login details will activate the decryption of your data , allowing you to browse and access them freely . <p> Backblaze 's encryption is military-grade and uses both public/private and symmetric key algorithms , and additional layers of protection can be added using two-factor authentication and private key encryption . The latter is an important feature for the security-conscious , as it means that only you hold the information required to decrypt your files " it 's never recorded or stored by Backblaze , and can not be reset if the original is lost or forgotten . It 's a very good security measure , but if you ever lose the passphrase you 'll permanently lose access to your files , so be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept in Storage Pods in the Backblaze datacenters . These centers are equipped with redundant power and biometric security , ensuring that they will be protected from most technological and natural disasters . The buildings are also monitored by staff 24 hours a day , seven days a week , so data is never left vulnerable to outside interference . <h> Customer- Support <p> Backblaze subscribers that run into difficulty have access to a live chat and a support ticket system , the latter of which promises to send a reply within one working day . The live chat is useful for US customers , but not much help for those in other parts of the world , as it 's only open between 9 am and 5 pm PST ( with an hour 's break from 12 to 1 pm ) . The ticketing service is easy to use , and also features a tracking system that allows you to check on the status of your request before it is answered . We did n't find that knowing our request was awaiting assignment to a support agent ' told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was reassuring to know that our request had n't been forgotten . <p> The primary resource for customer support and troubleshooting on the Backblaze website is their Knowledge Base , which contains answers to frequently asked questions and a few basic guides to changing your settings and restoring files . It 's not the easiest resource to navigate , however , and their insistence on referring to Q&amp;A-style guides as forums ' does n't make things any clearer . If you 're willing to trawl through the posts you 'll probably find the information that you need , but sending a ticket is much easier and catching someone on the live chat is by far the quickest option . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> In our experience , Backblaze 's ticket response time is pretty good we submitted a request at 5 pm , and had received a reply by 8.30 the same day . The response was friendly and personalized and gave a direct and helpful answer to our question . <p> You 'll also find a rather sweet meet me !

Admittedly , it does n't get the problem solved any quicker , but it 's a nice touch and suggests that they 're making the effort to keep their service human . <p> When we were able to access the live chat ( being based in Europe , this required a bit of careful scheduling ) , we got almost instantaneous replies and clear , helpful information . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> Backblaze is well known for its social media presence , and its writers are particularly active when it comes to giving followers an insight into the creative process . With Twitter , Facebook and blog accounts all receiving regular updates , they broadcast information on new designs and innovations , sneak-peeks into their office and workrooms , and interesting snippets of industry news . They frequently reply to comments , and most questions ( technical or otherwise ) do get answered , although troubleshooting is not their primary focus . <p> Backblaze also maintains a YouTube channel that features video insights into the companys most recent developments , as well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handy for the novice user . <h> - The Process 75367 @qwx275367 <p> Signing up for Backblaze is simplicity itself " there 's a clearly signposted store on their website , and getting started is just a matter of a few clicks . Subscribers will need to give their card details and a ZIP code , while the free trial requires just an email and password ( no card details ) . The installation is straightforward too , with the 5MB file taking just a few minutes to install . <h> Using Backblaze <p> Once downloaded , Backblaze 's control panel is very simple to use ; you can choose to start or pause your backup , explore restore options or change your settings , and that 's about it . If you want to have everything backed up with the minimum of hassle , this makes things very easy the program starts backing up automatically , so all you need to do is let it run . Modifications can be made by selecting Settings , and all options are clearly signposted . <p> Excluding files that you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is select the Exclusions tab from Settings and then add the folders that you want to leave out . You can also approve automatically excluded file types and folders , and restore default settings if you change your mind . <p> This works well if you 're happy just to backup everything you 've got , but if you want to be more selective , it 's almost impossible to single out particular files to keep . In addition to this , the upload of new files can take a while to start , making it quite frustrating if you 're in a hurry and want to be sure that your files are being backed up . <p> When it comes to retrieving your files , you 'll need to go to the Backblaze website , from where you can request them as a free ZIP download , or on a flash drive or hard drive sent ( for a charge ) by FedEx delivery . We went for the ZIP option , and received an automated email once our files were ready to download , after which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download . <p> While we did n't encounter any significant problems with retrieving our files , the process was annoyingly convoluted , running counter to Backblaze 's low-input attitude . While other providers allow you to retrieve files just using their desktop app or website , here you have to keep an eye on your emails , downloaded files and their website all at once . <h> Using the mobile app <p> Using the free Backblaze app is just as easy as accessing their software from a computer . You ca n't upload any files from your phone , but it 's easy to browse through your online backup and download files as and when you need them . <p> Once you 've installed the app , you need to enter your account email and password ; your details can be remembered if you like , or you can re-enter them each time you log in . It 's then easy to browse through your backed up files , which are arranged in much the same way as on a computer , and choose which you want to recover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but documents that have been recovered can be easily found in the Downloads ' tab . <p> True to form there are no fancy flourishes in the Backblaze app , but it 's convenient , functional and extremely easy to use . <p> - Backblaze Review Conclusion <h> We liked <p> Unlimited file storage <p> Reasonable price <p> Minimal damage to computer performance <p> Easy to use and requires minimal input <p> Good security <h> We were n't so sure about <p> Limited options for customizing the backup process " not ideal for advanced users <p> Slow upload and download speeds <p> Permanent deletion of files after six months ' inactivity <h> We hated <p> Time-consuming and difficult to upload smaller selections of files <p> While it 's not the best choice for those wanting a highly customizable backup service that can be adapted to meet specialist needs , Backblaze is an excellent option for the less technically-minded .

It 's the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions that makes few demands on your time . <p> I have no problem with the service from BAckblaze but my monthyl fee went from under $8 per month to almost $13 .

However , with disaster recovery , archiving and disk management tools also available , it offers a distinctly different service to many of its competitors moving away from typical backup and Cloud storage features , and into more heavy-duty data protection processes . <h> About Acronis <p> Acronis was founded in 2003 by Serguei Beloussov an experienced entrepreneur with more than 15 years of experience in helping companies ( dealing in everything from electronics to automation software ) to succeed on a global platform . Today , Beloussov holds the position of CEO and , along with President of Global Operations Yury Larichev , manages Acronis now boasting more than 5 million personal users and over 500,000 business subscribers in 145 countries worldwide . <h> Acronis True Image and Disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Acronis True Image backup program , which is designed to automate backups to external hard drives .

You 'll also find tools for predicting hard drive failure and migrating data to new storage devices . <h> Backup and restore options <p> Acronis True Image Cloud offers both online and local data storage , with unlimited storage space available in the Cloud . Unlike many of its competitors , Acronis does n't just store user-created files it also supports the backup and restore of system files and application data , meaning that you can retrieve your entire operating system should disaster strike . <p> You can also manually choose which files you want to store or download , and there 's the option to schedule regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , there are some strange restrictions on basic processes .

Be warned , though the file management pages of the Acronis dashboard can be really slow , so getting to the documents you want to share can take a frustratingly long time . <p> Sadly , you 'll also find a disappointing lack of security features here so you wo n't be able to set passwords to determine who can and ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the plus side , however , you can withdraw sharing permissions whenever you feel like it . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> Full system versioning Restore 10 most recent system statesRestore individual files Applies to both online and local storage <p> Like many online backup providers , Acronis offers file versioning , which let 's you restore copies of your files that have since been saved over . However , while most providers do this by simply saving previous drafts of individual files , Acronis keeps the 10 most recent snapshots of your entire system an excellent technique if you need to restore your entire system after being attacked by a virus or suffering hard drive failure . <p> If you 're concerned about how much space this will take up , never fear you can choose to save your system images to an external hard drive or NAS device .

It does this by retaining all uploaded files , regardless of whether or not they 're also saved on your hard drive unlike some providers that simply create a mirror of everything on your PC , removing files from the Cloud whenever you delete them from your computer . <p> Once archived , you can view and restore your files from any device ( PC , mobile or tablet ) , and can even select which of Acronis ' data centers you would like to store your files in , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of reassuringly thorough security measures on offer , and places decisions about encryption largely in the hands of its users .

While using a longer encryption key will slow things down a bit , it 's unlikely to make a really significant difference to your backup performance and , as longer is usually better under these circumstances , we 're not sure why 256-bit is n't just offered as default . <p> Having said that , it 's hard to find any major criticism to level at Acronis ' data security .

So the convenience of Time Machine + better data safety on cloud = pure awesomeness . Not only that , it can also clone your hard drive on an external drive if you want a local bootable backup for data redundancy . It also boasts syncing and mounted remote storage which you can store files on Dolly Drives servers as if on your local drive . How awesome is that ? You no longer need to use three separate applications to do all that . All you need now is one software suite and you will be set . Read full review below or sign up now . <p> Time Machine Rocks ! <p> Everybody knows that . Well , at least everybody with a Mac . Ever since OS X Leopard was introduced , Apple gave us Time Machine , which is basically really awesome and simple backup software that will run silently behind the scene and backup your files to an external hard drive . Ive been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> But what happens when a disaster strikes and you also lose your external hard drive ? Or somebody steals it ? I know I have been repeating about it numerous times here but such things could really happen . It happened to me . Long story , so I would n't go there . <p> But I did n't  lose all my data . None at all . Dolly Drive got me covered for that . In fact , I was able to recover all my data back as soon as I get a new Macbook . Why ? Because Dolly Drive ( from $3 per month ) brings your Time Machine backups onto the cloud . <p> innerad <h> Pricing Plan <p> Dolly Drive has two main offerings : Individual and Family . Each has 6 storage plans . Honestly , with such wide array of options , I feel a bit confused to pick one from them . But if you really look carefully , the difference is all in storage space . <h> Individual <p> Small ( from $3 per month ) You will get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as you remain as a customer . <p> Basic ( from $5 per month ) 100GB of online storage space and 5GB additional every month , which is more than enough for most of your data if you do n't  store apps and videos . <p> Standard ( from $7 per month ) 250GB of storage and additional 5GB every month . Its enough to backup almost everything you have . <p> Inspired ( from $13 per month ) 500GB of storage . No additional storage will be given monthly . Most Macs come with 500GB storage and so this is perfect if you want to backup your whole Mac , apps and everything . <p> Deluxe ( from $22 per month ) 1TB of online storage . You might not need this much storage unless you have tons of photos and perhaps videos . <p> Power ( from $40 per month ) 2TB of online storage . This is plenty even if you are a photographer or just have loads of data . <h> Family <p> Small ( from $7 per month ) 250GB of storage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macs . <p> Basic ( from $13 per month ) 500GB of storage and for 3-4 Mac users with about 75GB each of files . <p> Standard ( from $22 per month ) 1TB of storage and its suitable for 2-3 Mac users with quite a fair bit of data . <p> Inspired ( from $35.83 per month ) 2TB of storage and for 3-4 Mac users . The pricing is a tad odd though . <p> Deluxe ( from $72 per month ) 4TB of online storage will be best suited for small companies or multiple Mac users creating a lot of data regularly . Photo studios , videographers and multimedia creators will rejoice . <p> Power ( from $143.96 per month ) Massive 8TB of online storage , best suited for power users , small businesses and heavy multimedia users . <p> All plans for both Individual and Family are entitled to discounts if you sign up for 6 months to 2 years . <p> There is also " Hard Disk Seeding " service which will set you back $50 on lower priced plans and free on higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard drive and you can load your data onto it then send it back to use it as initial seed backup . It is useful especially if you have loads of data to backup . <p> Dolly Drive also has Pro plans which are yet to come , and seems like they will cater for business needs with more features and storage . There is no word on when Pro plans will be available . <p> Currently , Dolly Drive is doing free trial for 100GB storage . There is no word on how long that trial will last so I would advise you to take up the offer while its still around . <h> Features <p> US and European Grids . If you live in Europe , then do n't  be afraid of having slow speed when you upload to Dolly Drive . You can easily choose which network you want to store your files on . For Europe network , Dolly Drive has its data center in Rome . <p> Manual Backup . If you are on a trip or would prefer to do backup when you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conduct manual backups whenever you feel like it . <p> Speed Control . You can actually control your backup speed if you like , so that you wont be using too much bandwidth when you are working , and use full speed when you are sleeping . <p> Dolly Clone . If you have used SuperDuper or Carbon Copy Cloner , then you would know what this feature does . Dolly Clone is also freely available from Dolly Drive even if you stop using their online backup service . Basically , it will let you create bootable clone of your entire Mac installation onto an external hard drive . Once initial cloning is completed , it can also perform incremental updates to cloned drives . <p> Dolly Sync . This is exactly what it sounds like a syncing feature . It works same as Dropbox and Google Drive . Enabling this will create Sync folder on your Desktop , and anything you drop into the folder will get synced to Dolly Drives servers and any other computer on which you have installed Dolly Drive and enabled Dolly Sync . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which requires you to install OSX FUSE ( which allows non-standard volume types to be mounted ) . Basically , Space is Internet-hosted drive where you can store files remotely . Unlike Sync , it wont leave local copies of files and all are stored remotely .

Space alloted to to Sync and Space can be changed upon request . <p> iOS apps . iDolly app will let you access your Space and Sync files , as well as view your backed up files on your iOS devices . <p> innerad <h> Security <p> Dolly Drives secure your data by using secured AES-256 bit encryption during transmission as well as on their servers .

Not only do they have comprehensive video library containing a vast amount of video tutorials on how to do things , they also have a pretty solid knowledgebase . There is also a discussion forum and support desk for you too . <p> If you are new to Dolly Drive and do n't  know how to setup , you just have to contact them via email or phone and they will arrange a time to help you out via screen share , where they will show you how to do things step by step , without any cost to you . How awesome is that ? <p> My experience with them have been very smooth . I actually do n't  need a step-by-step spoon feeding to set it up ( its darn easy , trust me ) but I requested for it anyway for review purposes . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> Currently , Dolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you do n't  even need to enter credit card details . It just needs username , first name , last name , email address and password . Then you can immediately download Dolly Drive software and start enjoying the trial . <p> If you choose to buy a plan , then you will need to choose a plan first then enter your billing details as well as credit card information . There is no PayPal payment option , which is a bit inconvenient if you want to use PayPal . Honestly , I also feel like Dolly Drive is offering too much options , so much so that it can even make you feel confused . But then , the more choice there is , the better it is for users . <p> Dolly Drive interface is inspired by Mac interface , and it will let you access Dolly Drive functions through big icons . <p> When you go into Cloud Drive icon , it will let you see all your backed up files . It will even show respective application icons for each file formats and how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can view backup files by applications. - Also if you wish , you can browse through files using calendar. - Browse tab will let you see folder hierarchy of your backed up folders , either in list or big folder icons . <p> Restoring is very easy by clicking on " Restore " button and then choose the files or folders you want to restore . <p> If you want to make a clone drive using Dolly Drive ( which creates bootable clone of your hard drive to an external drive ) , then go to Dolly Clone under Dolly Drive . From there , you just have to choose source and destination drives then the software will take care of you . Do keep in mind that your destination drive must have larger capacity than source drive to create a clone . And your destination drive will be wiped out and reformatted to be prepared as a clone drive . <p> When you enable Dolly Sync , it will create DollySync folder on your Desktop , where you can put any files there to be synced . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to install OSX FUSE which enables you to mount non-standard volumes . Then you will find Space in Finder . You can access files and store files to your Space remote-volume directly . <h> Conclusion <p> If you are a Mac user , then Dolly Drive is something you should give a thought about . Sure there are other competitors like CrashPlan and Backblaze , but none of them have Time Machine integration like Dolly Drive . Dolly Drive may not give you unlimited storage like CrashPlan does , and it does n't  offer a lot of advanced features such as advanced scheduling and throtling features . But it packages syncing , mounted remote storage and cloud-based online backup of your Time Machine backups in one neat offering . The interface is pretty amazing too . For me right now , Dolly Drive works pretty darn well on my Macs and I have no plan to switch . I love CrashPlan but now its mainly used for Windows and Linux computers . If you are really thinking about giving Dolly Drive a go , you have all my support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review " <p> Dolly Drive never worked overseas in a year of travel . Even when it connected it never completed a backup . My subscription renewed automatically . I asked for a credit and Mark Ross agreed . here 's the rub the credit was never issued despite an email indicating it was processed and the account canceled . I disputed it with the credit card company and it went all the way to arbitration ( 3 rounds ) . First , they blamed me ( I accepted auto renewal ) , then Paypal and finally apologized and said credit would appear that week . Never happened . There 's something funny going on with this company . I do not recommend 
@@26491910 @191910/ <h> GUIDE <h> Backup Costs : Are Online Backups Worth It ? <p> Are online backups worth it ? My simple answer would be " definitely ! " Having worked in IT for many years , I 've always had the attitude that everything should be backed up in two places ( i.e. locally- and on an online service ) . This common-sense strategy has saved my bacon ( and my clients ) on plenty of occasions , and backup costs are low enough that most people should be able to follow this methodology . <p> However , some people really want to drill down into the finances before committing to something . Some years ago on this site , my colleague carried out a study to compare the cost of online backup and local backup . The cost of both has since fallen , so I thought it was high time to revisit the numbers . <p> For the sake of this study , I 've used the example of a terabyte of data this is enough for the vast majority of people . <h> The Cost of Local Backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1TB USB backup drive for $59 . A quick calculation shows - us that the cost of local backup storage is therefore a very low 6 cents per gigabyte . <p> This is , of course , just a one-off cost as well at least for as long as the backup drive keeps working . <p> As I discussed in a previous article about backup statistics , consumer hard drives are generally considered to have an annual failure rate of 5% . This compounds year-on-year , so once a drive is five years old you 're left with a rather uncomfortable 1 in 4 chance of a drive dying on you if it has n't  already . As such , for our comparison of backup costs , I 've worked on the basis of a physical drive only lasting five years. - ( Its important to note that Ive generalised a little here regarding failure rates for the sake of keeping things simple . ) <p> So the key point local backup storage costs around just 6 cents per gigabyte . <h> Backup Costs- for Online Backups <p> For the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industry-leading online backup provider who performed well in our detailed review . <p> Backblaze costs $5 per month , and its important to note this is for- unlimited- storage . To keep the comparison simple , let 's say you 're using it to store that same terabyte of data . <p> $5 works out to just half a cent per gigabyte . However , we must remember that this is a monthly cost . After twelve months , the service will have cost $60 a dollar more than the external hard drive , but still a very small amount in the grand scheme of things . <p> Let 's then work that out over the five-year " life " of the hard drive : <p> Over one year the backup costs for Backblaze work out to- 6 cents per gigabyte the same as local backup storage . <p> Over five years- the backup costs for online backup work out to 30 cents per gigabyte . <p> All in all then , over five years , online backup is five times more expensive than the local option . Over a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup worth it ? <p> Once again , my instant answer to this question is " yes ! " In fact , I was rather surprised by the low cost . 30 cents to keep 1GB of data safe from harm in the cloud for five years really is n't bad at all and if you happen to have more than a terabyte of data the cost falls further , so long as you choose an online backup provider with unlimited storage . You can see our roundup of the best unlimited storage providers here . <p> Although this article has concentrated on cost , that is n't the only important factor here . Online backups offer a host of other benefits , such as : <p> Location Independence : - You neednt be in the same place as your backup drive to perform a restore because the datas online . <p> Protection from Disasters : - External hard drives can be lost to fires , floods , burglaries and spilled drinks . Online backup providers typically run from resilient data centers , with lots of redundancy protection to keep your data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most online backup services keep your deleted files for a period of time so you can get them back if you remove something in error . Similarly , file versioning allows you to revert back to previous file versions if you overwrite something by mistake . <p> Automation : - Once you 've set up your online backup service , you can generally leave it to do its thing its not dependent on you remembering to run your local backup , or dependent on you getting around to it . ( Even so , you should still regularly check your online backups are working ) . <p> Finally , the most important point is that best practice for backups involves making multiple copies of your data . As such , the most sensible thing to do is run local backups AND use an online backup service . You 'll find more on this strategy- here . <h> Backup Costs : Conclusion <p> Backup costs are so low nowadays that there 's really no excuse not to have a backup plan- in place that includes both local and online backups .

For the uninitiated , we 've come up with a handy guide to getting started with NAS or keep reading for our rundown of the 5 best NAS backups for 2016 . <p> The list below is primarily concerned with backup providers that have native apps for commercial NAS devices by industry giants QNAP , Synology and Netgear , but if you 're more interested in the DIY approach , scroll down to find out which other services let you run NAS backups in different ways . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> ElephantDrive <h> 5/5 <p> PROS <p> Compatible with most major NAS devices Easy to use NAS apps Good for both home &amp; business use <p> CONS <p> Software can be tricky to use <p> ElephantDrive makes it to the top of the list because , simply , it 's all about NAS . As well as offering a standard range of backup services including sync and share options , automatic backups , and archiving , ElephantDrive has successfully cornered the market in NAS backups . As a result , you 'll find native ElephantDrive apps available from not just QNAP , Netgear , and Synology , but also Western Digital , Drobo , D-Link Vault , Thecus , and Seagate and extensive support on offer for all of them . <p> This makes ElephantDrive one of the most easy-to-use providers when it comes to NAS backups , as it 's pretty much all done for you and there are plenty of experts on hand to help you out with any problems .

Rather , it 's a tool for managing existing accounts with backup services like Amazon S3 , Google Drive , OneDrive , Oracle Cloud , Rackspace , and Microsoft Azure . That does n't make it any less worthy of being on this list of the best backups for NAS , however , as it has plenty to offer in regards to both NAS and other features . <p> CloudBerry has free Apps for popular NAS providers QNAP and Synology . Using these applications allows users to backup data from their NAS device to their backup service of choice , as well as allows them to restore NAS files from the CloudBerry desktop client . This is on top of other nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versioning , compression , and optional 256-bit AES encryption " all for as low as $10.00 per month ! <p> Fancy giving CloudBerry a try ?

IDrive 's new and improved customer support system is also on hand to help out with any NAS-related issues , and there are some introductory guides in their FAQ to help you get set up . <p> With IDrive , 1TB of online storage space comes at a generous $3.71 per month ( paid in a yearly lump sum ) although be warned that this will increase to $4.95 per month once you reach your second year .

That 's because , rather than being a traditional online backup service that focuses on storing your data for retrieval in emergencies , it 's a Cloud storage provider , so much more concerned with file sharing and remote access . <p> So how does this work with NAS ? Rather than backing up files from network storage devices like IDrive and ElephantDrive , Dropbox comes as part of more general Cloud Sync applications that allow you to sync the files saved on your NAS with multiple Cloud storage services .

CrashPlan is an excellent backup service , offering unlimited storage space and top-notch security for a very reasonable price . While most of the software is pleasantly easy to use , however , its NAS options are a bit of a mixed bag . <p> QNAP users have it easiest , with a dedicated ( albeit third-party ) app on offer , and Mac and Linux users should n't encounter too many problems either , as they can easily process backups from mounted drives . <p> Surprisingly , it 's Windows users that really suffer , as a limitation built into the Windows OS means that CrashPlan is n't able to support backups from mounted drives . However , they do offer a useful list of unofficial mounting methods for anyone willing to put in the time and effort and as one of the best and most affordable backup services around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Business &amp; Enterprise Users <p> NAS is a very popular storage solution for small businesses as well as home users , so you 'll find QNAP , Synology and Netgear offering plenty of apps for NAS backups from more heavy-duty storage providers too . <p> Microsoft Azure , Amazon Glacier , Google Cloud Storage , and Symform all work with NAS providers making it easier for organisations to keep their data as safe as possible both locally and online . <h> DIY NAS Backups <p> If you 're more interested in creating your own NAS than shelling out for a pre-made box , then you wo n't have access to apps but there are still plenty of ways to store your data online . Providers including SOS , Acronis , MyPCBackup , JustCloud , BackupGenie , and ZipCloud all let you backup from a NAS device simply by selecting it as a file location , although all members of the MyPCBackup canon ( aka .

While useful to some , it is n't as easy as downloading it and running . Due to it being an app unsupported by CrashPlan , the app consistently needs manual updating , and file editing to run properly . Which can lead to the need of hours of troubleshooting . <p> If there 's any doubt , feel free to refer to the QNAP CrashPlan subforum to see how supportive but difficult maintaining CrashPlan is . This is not to say CrashPlans Windows and Mac clients suck . I find them extremely useful . Its their lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using CrashPlan for a year with my Synology DS214Play .

And indeed , after each CrashPlan update my backup would fail and only with bloggers help and very detailed low level instructions able to get it running again . Had to do this about every few months or so and finally decided to give it up and choose a supported system . <p> Am also looking at Amazon Glazier , which is not included in the list by Miranda , hope it is not because it falls off the top 5 list ? <p> I 'm currently trying out CrashPlan and while its smooth on Mac ( despite the ugly UI ) its been 2 days of punishment trying to get it to run on my QNAP NAS .

@@26491913 @191913/ <h> GUIDE <h> Online Backup for Music : Is it Legal ? <p> Discussing whether or not is is legal to use online backup for music opens a huge can of worms . Its actually very difficult to provide a definitive answer , but my intention with this article is to come as close to a practical solution for - you as possible so please read on ! <p> A lot depends on where your digital music files actually came from in the first place . If you obtained some of your music via illegal torrents , or downloaded it in the " golden age " of Napster , Morpheus and AudioGalaxy , when acquiring- digital music was still too much of a niche pursuit to attract much attention from the authorities , then you should be honest enough with yourself to accept that you do- possess what is , essentially , illegal music . <p> As such , its impossible to really argue that its even legal for you to have it in the first place , let alone to use online backup for music . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also feel sufficiently comfortable to keep it backed up via a- zero-knowledge backup service- but more on that later . <h> Is ripping CDs illegal ? <p> Even if you built up a digital music collection by " ripping " CDs you had already purchased and still " own , " then believe it or not you may still be on the wrong side of the law , due to some bizarre grey areas that exist in certain countries . <p> For example , let 's consider a report from The Telegraph- late last year . This report confirms that a High Court ruling actually overturned a previous decision that " legalized " CD ripping in 2014 . This means , believe it or not , that its actually technically illegal to turn- CDs you OWN- into digital files in the UK . <p> Obviously this is n't a law that 's actively enforced . If it was , the authorities could have spent from 2001 to 2004 ( the period between the launch of the iPod and the launch of the iTunes Music store ) rounding up and prosecuting everyone using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the launch of the iPod . Older generations will probably remember the " home taping is killing music " campaign . Under the laws as they stand in the UK , its also technically illegal to record a vinyl LP onto a cassette tape , and has been for most of the past three decades ! <p> Its important to note that these laws vary from country-to-country . The USA has a rather more sensible approach , where according to the RIAA , ripping CDs or making a digital copy of music " for personal use " is acceptable . <h> What are the implications for- using online backup for music ? <p> If you are determined to follow the exact letter of the law , regardless of how preposterous it seems , then you 'll need to find out exactly what laws are in place in your country . <p> If you are in the USA , and wish to use online backup for music with completely- legal- digital music , including ripped copies of music you have purchased legitimately , then its hard to see that you 're breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the UK , thanks to that rather misguided High Court ruling , doing exactly the same thing is technically illegal . Its only " as " illegal as recording the Top 40 from the radio was " back in the day , " and were not all in prison for that right now ( ! ) , but in terms of black and white thinking it IS illegal . <p> This Wikipedia- resource- discusses laws on CD ripping in various countries . Thankfully , the UK is in the minority with its prehistoric stance , but if you really want to be " too legit to quit , " you should check where your country stands on the issue . <h> What about " zero knowledge " online backup ? <p> If you 're determined to use online backup for music , and you live somewhere where keeping copies is in a legalgrey area , one option for you is to use a " zero knowledge " online backup service like SpiderOak . <p> I 've produced a detailed guide to zero-knowledge backup here , but briefly , thanks to end-to-end encryption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nobody but you can ever see what you choose to upload to your backup service . This even extends to staff at the online backup company . <p> Simplistically speaking , this means you can upload whatever you want , even media files you obtained illegally . However , that does n't  mean you wo n't end up technically in breach of your providers terms of service . <p> For example , SpiderOak themselves say the following in their terms and conditions : <p> " You may not store , transmit or share through the Services.any material ( that ) violates or infringes the rights of others , including without limitation patent , trademark , trade secret , copyright , publicity or other proprietary rights . " <p> I did warn you that this issue opens up a can of worms ! <h> What about- cloud storage for digital music ? <p> Broadly speaking , there 's nothing to stop you using these to store legal digital music . However , things get more complicated if you 're going to make use of the sharing features available with these services . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically the same as burning three copies of a CD and handing them to three friends . A great many people do it , but were discussing whether its actually legal. - Well its not . <h> Legal alternatives to online backup for music <p> With people increasingly using streaming music services for all their musical needs , there are thankfully some more legally straightforward options out there . <p> The first to emerge was iTunes Match . This looks at your iTunes music library , including the content you 've imported from CDs , and allows you to store the whole lot in the cloud . To shorten the upload process , it recognises songs that are available in the iTunes Store , " matches " them and makes them available to you straight away , rather than pulling a copy up from your computer . <p> iTunes Match is far from perfect . You 'll find plenty of anecdotal reports of muddled up music libraries , especially from people with tens of thousands of tracks . However , this is a cheap(ish) alternative to manually uploading your music to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tech giants have got in on the act too . Google Play Music- allows you to upload up to 50,000 of your own tracks to the service , and ( more recently ) Amazon has added this facility to Amazon Music . Here , Amazon Prime and Amazon Student account holders are allowed to upload up to a staggering 250,000 tracks , while standard account holders can also download the Amazon Music app and upload up to 250 songs of their own . <p> As a final aside , its worth noting that all of the above services are fully open to UK users , when technically its ( currently ) illegal to rip music from CDs in the first place . This certainly implies that nobody takes the CD ripping law- that- seriously ! <h> Online backup for music : Conclusion <p> As you 've no doubt realised , the question of whether online backup for music is truly legal is a hard one to answer , and much depends on where you are located and where your music collection came from . <p> As such , I feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few bullet points : <p> In most- places ( with the notable exception of the UK ) , you should have no legal issues with keeping a copy of your music on an online backup service , so long as you obtained it by legitimate means . <p> If you used " less " legitimate means to aquire your music , you 're already on shaky legal ground being in possession of it . On that basis , it may not bother you to go a step further and store it on a zero-knowledge backup service , on similarly shaky legal ground and at your own risk ! <p> If you 're open to the idea of subscribing to a streaming music service , you have lots of extra options for keeping a copy of your music online . <p> Written by Ben TaylorBen was a geek long before " geek chic , " learning the ropes on BBC Micros , before moving on to Atari STs and IBM compatibles .

Ive read here : LONG ... about mp3 compression , and my logic tells me it is the right thing to do , but in your opinion , does it harm the quality that much ?

Sorry about the confusion with regards to Amazon Music in order to upload your own music files , you 'll first need to download the Amazon Music app . Once this is installed , Amazon Prime and Amazon Student subscribers will be able to upload a maximum of 250,000 audio files , while standard account holders can upload 250 files for free .

While we ca n't say with certainty that they 're the absolute lowest there is , at $2.50 a month for their personal premium , they 're definitely among them , as the market average hovers around $5 to $12 a month . <h> Features <h> Online backup or Cloud storage ? <p> Cloud storage . <p> Due to its focus on file sharing and synchronization , its limited storage space , and security that leaves something to be desired , ADrive is best classified as cloud storage . If you 'd like to learn more about the difference between online backup and cloud storage , you can check out the dedicated section in our Ultimate Online Backup Guide . <h> About ADrive <p> ADrive was first launched in 2007 in California . They claim on their website to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but oddly enough do n't provide any names to back up their statement . Unfortunately , additional research did not supply us with any further information . <h> Backup options <p> Manual backups <p> Automatic backups <p> Scheduled backups <p> Backup via web-based file manager and desktop app <p> ADrive offers its users a few different ways to backup their files and folders . The first ( and simplest ) way of doing so is to upload via their web-based file manager , where you will find the upload button and options in the lower left corner of the main page . <p> Backing up files via the ADrive Desktop app is a more complicated process . However , unlike the file manager , it allows you to create both automatic backups and scheduled backups , so it 's worth the effort of setting up . To do so , launch the desktop app , click on Backups ' , and then New Job ' . After entering details such as which files and folders you 'd like backed up and how often , you simply need to click save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Which operating systems is it compatible with ? <p> Desktop : Mac , Windows <p> Mobile : Android OS , iOS <h> File sharing <p> Basic file sharing <p> Option to password protect shared files <p> Option to set an expiration date on shared files <p> Share on social media <p> ADrive 's integrated file sharing feature is fairly standard . It gives you the option to set a password for your publically shared files and folders , as well as an expiration date . As such , you can share your files with friends , family , colleagues , or even on Facebook in a safe , secure manner . <h> Sync options <p> Sync feature on desktop app <p> Sync across multiple computers <p> Users can use ADrive Desktop 's dedicated sync feature to keep folders on their computer synced with their ADrive account . The sync feature allows you to create scheduled jobs " including uploads , downloads , and the removal of folder contents " that will keep the files and folders on your ADrive account and computer mirrored . <p> In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another by configuring multiple computers to a single ADrive account . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> Screenshots available from the last week <p> Nightly backup <p> ADrive has a built-in file versioning and recovery tool , dubbed file history recovery .

As such , users who 've made a data blunder can choose between recovering the version from the night before or from the week before , depending on their preference . <h> File transfer <p> Web interface <p> Desktop application <p> Via FTP , SCP , Rsync and SFTP <p> Via WebDAV <p> Where ADrive really shines is its extensive range of file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computing industry . In addition to the standard transferring of files via the web interface and desktop application , they also support a number of file transfer protocols such as SCP , SFTP , Rsync , and FTP .

We 'd also like to see them replace their current account verification method " asking for answers to two private questions " to something more foolproof , such as two-factor authorisation . <h> Customer Support <h> Resources <p> FAQ page <p> Community forum <p> ADrive has a comprehensive FAQ set up on their website that will provide the answer to most questions that future or existing users may have . They cover a multitude of topics " including things such as error messages , file sharing , and account maintenance " and even have a Miscellaneous ' section that goes through the odds and ends that are left over . <p> If you ca n't find the answer to your question on their FAQ , you can always give their user forum a try . However , it 's not particularly active , so if it 's a pressing matter you 're probably better off contacting ADrive staff directly . <h> Contacting staff <p> Contact form <p> Email support <p> Phone support <p> ADrive 's customer support consists of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone number for a helpline . <p> Oddly enough , only the contact form can be found on the ADrive website .

It 's straightforward to fill out : You 're prompted to specify your operating system and browser , describe your issue , and then fill in your account details . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> To test out ADrive 's customer support , we decided to send them a backup-related query through their online contact form . After sending the query , we were emailed a support ticket as promised : <p> We received a response within several hours from an ADrive employee .

All you have to do is go to their website , and click the Sign Up ' button in the upper right corner . After entering some basic details , such as full name and email address , you 'll be sent an account confirmation email . Once verified , you 'll have access to both ADrive 's web-based file manager and the ADrive Desktop download . <h> Getting set up <p> While ADrive 's file manager is easy to find " you can access it by logging in via their website " downloading their ADrive Desktop is a bit more complicated , as the download button is not clearly pointed out . It can be found by clicking on the ADrive Desktop 2.2 link under the Remote Access ' subsection on the front page of the file manager , which will take you a tutorial page where you can download the software for either Windows or Mac . <p> Once the software is downloaded , you 'll be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the process and have ADrive Desktop launched in less than a minute . <h> Using the software <p> While the lengthy and comprehensive tutorial page may have you thinking otherwise , using ADrive Desktop is actually a fairly straightforward process . The interface itself is clearly laid out and does n't have too many options ( only Account , Backup , Sync , Drive , and Help ) , making it easy to figure out instinctively . <p> As you can see above , from ADrive Desktop you can set up scheduled automatic backups , manage backups , sync devices , map your account so that it 's linked to a drive on your computer , and receive customer support . <p> From the web-based file manager , on the other hand , you can manually upload files , set up file transfer protocols , view both your public and private files , and manage your account settings . <h> How to cancel your account <p> If you ultimately decide that ADrive is n't for you , you can just let your account expire after the 60-day free trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card details required when signing up for the trial , so both trying out and canceling ADrive comes completely free . <p> If you 're signed up for an ADrive paid account , on the other hand , and wish to cancel , you will have to contact ADrive staff directly and ask to have your subscription terminated , and account disabled . <p> Once your account itself is canceled , you can uninstall ADrive Desktop manually from your computer . All you have to do is go to File Explorer &gt; Downloads and delete the following files : ADriveDesktop , 710b042multilanguage , and all WSClient installation software . <h> ADrive Review Conclusion <h> We liked <h> We were n't too sure about <p> No refunds <p> Automatic plan renewal <p> Poor security <p> Not very user-friendly <p> Poor customer service <h> We hated <p> Nothing <p> ADrive is what you 'd expect from a bargain backup provider : It 's a little rough around the edges , but it gets the job done . We were n't crazy about ADrive cutting costs when it came to important features such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good job trying to make up for it with their loads of backup options , integrated file sharing system , and support for obscure file transfer protocols , among other handy features . <p> In the end , if you 're looking for a bulletproof backup system , ADrive may not be the provider for you .

@@26491918 @191918/ <h> Review <h> Cubby Review <p> Summary Cubby comes in strong in the market full with industry behemoths by providing simplicity of Dropbox and flexibility of SugarSync . Not only that , its DirectSync peer-to-peer syncing feature will catch the attention of many looking for cloud syncing without storage limits . With its attractive pricing , Cubby is already a serious contender for Dropbox and others to watch out . Read our full review below or if you cant wait anymore , sign up now . <p> Folder-syncing and cloud-based file storage services are nothing new . We have the mightiest of all , Dropbox , and other serious contenders like SugarSync , SkyDrive , Google Drive and even business-oriented Box . Smaller competitors such as Wuala and SpiderOak are competing in other aspects like zero-knowledge privacy policy and better data security . With all the giant behemoths competing in this space , it almost looks scary for any newcomers . <p> Cubby , a new entry in this market from well-reputed remote-access software maker LogMeIn , comes in strong with a new twist that laughs at storage limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own computers without using any space on Cubbys servers . The service is currently in beta , but offers a free 5GB of online storage space , Web access , apps for Mac , Windows , iOS and Android . Pretty standard affair in this market . But we have to give our respect to Cubbys design team , as it has really sophisticated , and visually-appealing design that just radiates " happiness " . The website design is totally in line with Cubbys motto , " Your digital happy place . " <p> Among syncing and cloud-based file storage services , there are two different practices when it comes to syncing . Its either a centralized folder where you drop anything there to sync ( a la Dropbox ) , or configure in your chosen services client app to sync any folder you want ( a la SugarSync ) . The former is simple but rigid when it comes to folder structures since you have to move your entire folders into a centralized place if you want to sync , and the latter gives you a bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle ground for both . Let 's see after the break if Cubby is good enough for us to consider making a switch . <h> Plans &amp; Pricing <p> Cubby is currently in beta , and it offers special beta price 40% off for all Pro version users . It also has free Basic Version account which comes with 5GB storage space . Let 's take a look at the pricing in a bit more details . <p> Basic Version . Free , and comes with 5GB of storage space . Through referrals , you can earn up to 25GB of free storage space as well . It has all basic features such as private and public sharing , syncing , desktop and mobile apps , and client-side encryption . If you 're excited about DirectSync then you 're out of luck with free plan . <p> Pro Version . At current special beta promotional price 40% off , you will only pay $3.99 per month and get 100GB of storage for one user . At normal price , its gon na be $6.99 . And it comes with all features that you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user held encryption keys ) , and Level 2 support . <p> For any additional storage , its gon na be $3.99/month per 100GB before the beta promotional price ends ( no word on when yet , but possibly when Cubby gets out of beta ) . Regular price would be $6.99/month per 100GB . Every additional user will also cost $3.99/month per user , and we can safely assume that the price will be higher when beta ends . Right now , the highest storage you can buy from website is 1TB and you can also add up to 10 total users for your account . If you want more than that , you will have to contact their sales department . <p> In comparison , Dropbox charges $9.99 for 100GB , and SugarSync will cost you $9.99 for only 60GB . The only contender when it comes to pricing would be Google Drive , charging $4.99/month for 100GB. - But if you get in Cubby before beta ends , you will still get $1 cheaper rate on your monthly rates . <h> Features <p> Cubbys main focus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  go out of their way and offer us features just for the sake of having a huge list . Its actually a good thing , since it shows that Cubby will be focused on delivering what it promises us , not releasing irrelevant features just to make the press . <p> Unlimited Syncing . Same as any other syncing services in the market . Nothing much to talk about it here . <p> DirectSync . Now this is sexiest feature of Cubby . With this feature , Cubby let 's you sync unlimited folders and files across computers without using your cloud storage on Cubbys servers . If you are not familiar with this , the key takeaway here is that it will " sync " so all computers will have offline copies of you folders and files too . When there is a change on one computer , it will be synced across Cubbys network , and onto other computers . And yes , storage resides only on your computers , not on Cubbys cloud storage . <p> 25GB Free . Through referrals , you can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its 2nd only to SugarSync which gives 32GB free storage in total . <p> Public Sharing . Same as generating public share links in Dropbox or SugarSync , you can share your files or folders on Cubby using public share links . People can only see what you share and download the files , not edit anything inside your cubby . So your files are safe . And yes , you can even do public sharing of files and folders under DirectSync . Cool , is n't ? <p> Private Sharing . Private sharing is available only among Cubby users , so that you can privately share ( no pun intended ) files and folders with your colleagues or family . Collaboration has never been easier . When you do private sharing , shared files and folders will automatically sync to all shared parties . <p> Unlimited Versioning . This is one thing Cubby beats out every competitors in the market . Sure , Dropbox provides unlimited syncing too but you have to pay extra for that . SugarSync only keeps up to 5 previous version of your files , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cubby will keep all previous versions of your files , without any extra cost . How cool is that ? <p> Cubby Locks . Basically , these are user-held encryption keys , giving you extra level of protection for your folders and files . You are basically putting your files into a lockbox before putting onto Cubby , and only you have the key to unlock it . To use or share that folder or file , you will need to enter your account password , which is encrypted at your side . <p> Cross-platform Compatibility . Cubby will run on Mac and Windows , and there is no word on Linux client app development . <h> Security <p> Cubby maybe new , but its parent company LogMeIn is n't . In fact , LogMeIns products and services are used by millions of individuals and businesses , from government agencies to Fortune 500 companies . The experience and reputation of LogMeIn is clearly reflected at Cubby . <p> Many other syncing and cloud-based file storage services use other public cloud services like Rackspace or Amazon AWS to deliver their services . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data Services , which is their own proprietary data synchronization and storage cloud . Our data are protected in same way as LogMeIn protects their data , and we will be sharing same infrastructures as LogMeIn too . <p> Cubby uses AES 256-bit encryption as its standard encryption , which is used by banks and eCommerce sites . Not only that , any folders and files uploaded to Cubby through its desktop application automatic encryption from client-side , offering another layer of protection . Cubby Locks also provide you with third layer of additional security for your sensitive documents . <h> Customer Service <p> Cubby provides very good help center with extensive knowledge base , FAQ , and online support system . We did n't  even need to contact Cubby support team since all questions we have are answered by their knowledge base . The design of their help center is a joy to use , and visually appealing . Through help center , you can also give feedbacks too . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> Signing up is actually very easy . You can do so via the website ( although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they want to actually encourage signing up via the desktop app ) , or just download the client app and sign up from there . The home page itself encourages you to download the app . <p> We chose to explore and found out that there is a small " sign-up " link in Log-in page . Turns out that you can use your existing LogMeIns account to access Cubby , and when you sign up for Cubby , you will get a LogMeIn account . But even if you are getting a LogMeIn account , kudos to Cubby and LogMeIn for not bringing us to LogMeIn page and making users confuse . And it does n't  ask you so many fields to fill in . You only have to put in your email , and password . <p> After that , it will send you a confirmation email but you do n't  have to wait to log-in . As soon as you create an account , itll automatically log you into your account , welcoming you with a message asking you to download the desktop client app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The interface definitely reminds us of Dropbox and SugarSync , and Cubby still carries its branding elements very well . You can create new " cubbies " which are folders on the web dashboard , manage each folder and files like whether you want them to sync on the cloud or use DirectSync , download , generate sharing link and deleting . <p> But when we try to upload , we find out that the web app will only let us upload files one by file . There is no bulk uploader , nor drag and drop . It is a bit annoying , although we can understand that Cubby is meant to use with its desktop client apps . The file size limit for web upload is 2GB , which is pretty goddarn big . <p> If you want to check older versions , just click on a file , and click on Versions at the above navigation bar that will appear when you select a file , and Cubby will show you previous versions . Restoring is pretty easy too . And if you want , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a finalized version and do n't  want to accidentally restore to an older version . <p> That 's pretty much about it for the web apps . Yes , it actually leaves a lot to desire . We actually want more functions , and we are n't  asking for more . Just a function to upload multiple files at once would be pretty good . But since Cubby is still in beta , we hope that they will improve the web interface once it exits beta stage . <p> The desktop app is a joy to use , actually . The interface still carries a lot of elements from its web interface , crisp clean with a lot of white space . After installing the desktop app , you can sign up or login . <p> After logging in , you can start adding cubbies by drag-n-drop folders and files into the desktop app . You can also use " Create cubby " button , and point the folders you want to . Oh and the grey one are using DirectSync . And here is one thing to note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add sub-folders into a folder a cubby represents , that sub-folder will be synced too . <p> If you want to do DirectSync for a folder that 's already syncing onto the cloud , you just have to turn off the cloud option and it will automatically switch to DirectSync ( if you are on Pro version account ) . This is very easy . You can also configure DirectSync separately . <p> Cubby will also put itself as in context menu , allowing you to instantly put any folders and files into " cubbies " and also generate public link to share . This is very much like SugarSync . <h> Conclusion <p> Cubby is still in beta , but its already a joy to use . And beta status does n't  stop us or other reviewers from giving it very high rating . It works the way we expected it to , and its designs for both web and desktop apps are very well-designed , clear , easy to use and user-friendly . The flexibility it offers to sync any folders we want without having to configure too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sync any folder , eliminates any confusion that users may have . The best part is in its DirectSync function , since it essentially eliminates storage concerns for cloud-based file syncing . Overall , we are very confident that Cubby is ready for serious usage , even in beta , and it will be a serious contender for the crown in syncing and online file storage market . Watch out , Dropbox ! 75371 @qwx275371 <h> One response to " Cubby Review " <p> Hmmmm . For a beta tester I would have expected you to notice the lack of delta-sync and indexing of block data . If you change a folder name all of the files in that folder must be re-uploaded . Ditto for files . Imagine if you renamed a 250MB file or accidentally renamed a 50GB folder . Bug show stopper . This is n't even mentioning the lack of media support on mobile for shared video files ; forget sharing that video you took of junior with grandma . On Dropbox sharing video actually works . Also , many reports of users losing files mysteriously with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a few saying it . <p> There is a reason why Cubby is priced at nearly 1/2 the price of any other service . You get what you pay for .

From the times of punch cards which fit 960 bits ( yes , bits ) of data maximum , we are now at the age of storing hundreds of terabytes of data on the cloud . <p> Twenty years ago , we were still using 3.5 ? floppy disks that could fit approximately 1.44MB . We bought software that was archived split onto multiple floppy disks . Then came CDs which fit about 650MB to 700MB . Around those times , hard drives were only at around 1GB to 4GB . Even 8GB drive was pretty big in the early 2000s . <p> Today , the standard hard drive size that comes with most computers is 500GB . Back in 2009 when we purchased laptops , it was 160GB . And we are already seeing 1TB hard drives becoming standard size . Even SSDs , the most expensive and fastest of data storage , are now at 500GB . Terabyte drives are coming soon . Who knows what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know for sure is that data storage needs and space will see exponential growth in coming years . <p> With that much of storage available for personal users and businesses , backing up terabytes of data is the new name of the game . It used to be expensive even to backup a few hundreds gigabytes but not anymore . Things have changed since then . And here we have curated 5 best online backups that will let you backup terabytes of data , right after the break . <h> Summary <h> Winner ZipCloud " From $4.95/month <p> We figure that simplicity is always the best for most users . Even if you are technically proficient , sometimes you may just want a backup solution that is simple and straightforward ; something that does its job and nothing else . For that very reason , ZipCloud is chosen as the winner in this list . Simple , straightforward and easy to use . It maybe missing power user features like bandwidth throttling and others , and can only do scheduled backups for down to every 1 hour but it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Amazon S3 servers so they are in safe hand , and you do n't  have to do anything after setting up ZipCloud desktop client software on your computer . $4.95 a month will only get you 75GB of backup storage space on the cloud and that 's nowhere near a terabyte . However , if you shell out a bit more and pay $6.95 a month , then you get a whopping unlimited backup storage at your disposal . Absolutely a great fit for those that want a " set it and forget it " backup system . If you are interested , we have a review on ZipCloud here for more details . <h> 2 . Backblaze " From $3.96/month <p> Backblaze is the perfect marriage of simplicity and awesome features . Simple and elegant in its own right , Backblaze is for people who want more control over their cloud backups than what ZipCloud could give . Still , its desktop client software is dead easy to use , and you wo n't find yourself wanting for any other cloud backup services at all ! For just $5 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage and no limit on individual file sizes . If you commit to Backblaze for two years and pay $95 , then your monthly cost is going to be only $3.96 which is a goddarn steal ! Since there is no limit on individual file size , you can now backup huge files like Lightroom catalogues , Photoshop design files , HD movie files and whatever big files you have . What 's the use of terabytes of backup storage when you cant upload your huge files ? Backblaze will also let you backup your external hard drives and NAS without a complaint either . Restoration is pretty easy and it will give you a ZIP archive of the files you want to restore , in same directory structure as the original . We have done a review on Backblaze . Check it out and see for yourself how awesome it is. <h> 3 . Livedrive " From $6/month <p> Do you like Dropbox ? And do you also like to backup your computer ? What about marrying both of them ? A bundle package of both data syncing and online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is known for its online backup services with huge array of features that can astonish even the industry veterans . We reviewed them in 2012 and we were only mildly impressed . But when we revisited them this year , the revamped service and quality just blow us away . If you only want cloud backup , then just shell out $6 a month . You will get unlimited storage backup for one computer . If you want syncing service that offers a lot more storage than SugarSync , Dropbox or Google Drive but do n't  want to spend too much , then Briefcase plan from Livedrive is perfect for you . At just $12 a month , you get 2TB of syncing for any numbers of computers . Now if you want a package that marries both , prepare to shell out $19 a month ( which is a steal in our opinion ) , and you get 5TB of syncing plus unlimited data storage backup for up to 5 computers . Absolutely perfect for people with multiple computers . If you are a power user , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FTP and SFTP too . Here is our review . You should really check it out- before buying it . <h> 4 . Carbonite " From $59/year <p> The most well-known and advertised company in the whole online backup industry , Carbonite is an industry pioneer and among the first ( or perhaps THE first ) to offer unlimited backup service . Top notch customer service , amazing performance and good pricing are what they offer . For just $59 a year , you get unlimited storage backup for one computer . It breaks down to around $4.91 a month so its comparable to other companies . However , there are two things we do n't  like about Carbonite . First thing first , its desktop client software is designed to work with all advanced bells and whistles on Windows . But Mac users are n't  that lucky . They will only get basic features so while they can still enjoy the unlimited backup , they ca n't tweak much to fit their needs . Granted , it is pretty easy to use but we would choose something else like Backblaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Carbonite throttled bandwidth to around 1GB of data upload a day , even though they offer unlimited backup . So even if your Internet connection is really fast , you are n't  going to completely backup that 2TB hard drive anytime soon . Still , it is a great service .

With very innovative technology on compression , encryption and data de-duplication , Bitcasa is able to provide infinite storage service at just $10 a month . If you are wondering about the difference between " unlimited backup storage " and " infinite storage " , then we have to say that both still give you unlimited amount of storage . However , the key difference is that Bitcasa acts like a cloud-based hard drive rather than a backup service . Instead of scheduled backups , when you are running Bitcasa software , it is going to mount a cloud-based virtual hard drive which you can use as a normal regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be transferred onto the cloud the Bitcasas servers ( they are based on Amazon S3 for data storage ) . Unlike Dropbox and other syncing services , it wont store files on your computer .

Free account comes with 10GB of storage and all features . $10 a month or $99 a year is the cost for paid account which also comes with infinite versioning support .

Among the superpowers in that region , Canada is also quite a prominent country . <p> We may not hear much about Canada in the tech world .

Their smaller Business plan is available for a minimum of three users and offers 300GB of storage space , plus an additional 5GB per- computer , - while the Department edition- has the same features but provides 1TB for a minimum of 25 users . Both plans are available for $60 per user per year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days free of charge . <p> In addition to these standard business plans , there is also an Enterprise edition of Syncplicity , which features hybrid Cloud storage and unlimited space for $150 per user per year . If you decide to sign up for this , or any other paid plan , Syncplicity accepts most major credit cards . <h> Features <h> About Syncplicity <p> Syncplicity was- created by Ondrej Hrebicek , Isaac Hall and Leonard Chung ( all former- Microsoft employees ) , and- first launched to the public in 2008 . In 2012 , the company was purchased by EMC Corporation , which also owns RSA security and fellow backup provider Mozy , after which it was bought again by Skyview Capital in 2015 . <p> Syncplicitys attempts to crack the business market have placed it in direct competition with Box , who- claimed their former CEO Jeetu Patel in 2015. - With more than 25,000 subscribers around the world today , however , Syncplicity remains a major player in both personal and business markets . <h> Backup options <p> There are no restrictions on the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syncplicity , - but all uploads must be implemented manually ( no automatic backups here ) . You can backup to the same account from an unlimited number of devices , and all updates to stored files are automatically synchronised . If you want to ensure that particular files are available offline at all times , you can favourite ' them , which will mean that they are continually pushed to other devices . <p> Enterprise subscribers also have the ability to save their files not only to the Cloud , but also what Syncplicity calls on premise ' aka. offline in separate Syncplicity data centers . This gives them not just one place to store their data , but two ; increasing security and sparing the company from having to arrange physical storage elsewhere . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> Syncplicity is compatible with Windows and Mac operating systems , as well as Windows Phone , Android and iOS for mobile . <h> Sync and share options <p> All data stored with Syncplicity can be synchronised between multiple devices so that you can access current versions of your files from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notable restriction , however , insofar as files can not be synced individually only when they are in folders . <p> When it comes to sharing your documents , you can grant other Syncplicity users the permission to access both individual files and entire folders . This access can take two forms " either as a Reader or an Editor . The former can only view shared data , while the latter can make changes to files or add new content . Everyone that you share folders with can share them in turn , although the original author of the content ( the owner ' , in Syncplicity-speak ) is ultimately able to change permissions or deny access to any user , regardless of who invited them . They are also the only person that is ever able to delete files or folders . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> Syncplicity does n't impose any maximum limit on how many previous versions of your files can be saved for later retrieval . Settings default to retaining the most recent ten versions of your files for 30 days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to save and how long youd like them to be kept for . <p> In addition to versioning , Syncplicity also offers the opportunity to recover files that have been deleted from your hard drive . Once again , you can alter the specifics of the service at will and without limitations although the default is to retain deleted files for 30 days . <h> Speed <p> We ran some tests to get an idea of Syncplicity 's upload and download speeds , as speed is of the essence when you 're transferring large amounts of data . We did this by first uploading five files and manually timing how long it took the transfers to complete . Next , we took the number of MB in each file and divided it by how many seconds the upload took , then converted our answer into Mbps . Download speeds were calculated on the same basis , and we put all of our results into a simple graph to give you an idea of what to expect . <p> With most providers recording upload speeds of between 2 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not particularly impressive . A 100MB file took around nine minutes to backup , meaning that larger files could leave you waiting for a long time . Downloads were unfortunately even less impressive , averaging just 1.6 Mbps compared to the typical rate of 3 to 4 Mbps recorded by other providers . While this should n't be too much of a problem if your primary objective is to sync and share your files , if you 're planning to upload a more extensive amount of data , you may want to look for a faster service . <p> As with all speed tests , it 's worth remembering that performance can vary depending on external influences such as your broadband connection and even the quality of your router . Although we do everything we can to give an accurate representation of transfer speeds , then , our results should be taken as a guide only . <h> Security <p> Syncplicity encrypts your files using AES 256-bit symmetric encryption both during transit and while in their data store , and all data is transferred via HTTPS , using TLS/SSL protocols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encryption keys are stored in an independent database . In addition to this , Enterprise subscribers using on-premise storage can rest assured that their files will not pass through the cloud during transfer " instead , they are moved directly from your devices to Syncplicity 's data store . <p> So far so good , but Syncplicty 's personal accounts fail on one crucial point " files are first encrypted during transfer rather than when they 're on your computer , so encryption is not end-to-end . This means that there is time during which your files are unencrypted , unprotected and in the hands of the company , leaving you far more vulnerable to an invasion of privacy than if you use a provider that encrypts your data before it leaves your PC . <p> Another important feature is also absent from personal plans ; namely the ability to set a private encryption key . This service allows you to set a password that only you will ever have access to " it is never visible to or stored by your backup provider in plain text form . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your stored data , the information needed to decrypt it is only held by you . <p> While both of these features are available to business users , personal subscribers concerned about security may want to consider other , more secure options such as SpiderOak or CrashPlan . Alternatively , if you do n't mind making the backup progress a little more complicated , Syncplicity supports files that have been protected by independent encryption services . <h> Customer- Support <p> The Syncplicity website features a range of different resources including forums , an FAQ dedicated to troubleshooting common problems , a Knowledge Base and the Syncplicity University , which features video tutorials . <p> There 's enough information across these platforms to meet the majority of needs , although most content appears to be written primarily with business users in mind , so can be a little confusing if you 're using a personal account . <p> You can also contact Syncplicity staff directly by submitting a support ticket , although there is , disappointingly , no option to communicate via live chat or phone . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while for a reply " 36- hours- in fact , much longer than the average time of around six hours taken by other providers . Syncplicitys response was short but concise and professional and gave us all of the information we needed . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> Along with social media profiles on Facebook and Twitter , Syncplicity also maintains a blog that is updated every few weeks with in-depth company news and developments . Their Twitter profile has 5,000 followers and features regular company promotions , as well as- occasional- reposted articles on industry-related- topics , - while their Facebook page receives less frequent attention . <h> - The Process 75367 @qwx275367 <p> Syncplicity 's 7MB installation file is easy to download and run , and getting set up is a quick and simple process . Do n't be put off if they invite you to log in with a corporate account when you first sign up " just proceed as normal , and you wo n't encounter any problems . <h> Using Syncplicity <p> Syncplicity runs primarily from a pop-up in your taskbar , from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folder on your computer , manage your backed up data , visit their website or change your settings . <p> While it 's not difficult to navigate this way , it does seem unnecessarily convoluted , as each function runs from a different location . A more centralised system would be more intuitive to use , and would avoid the hassle of working from multiple places at once . <p> Once you 've learned your way around , however , Syncplicity is easy to use , with easily recognisable icons and nothing too complicated to master . <h> Using the mobile app <p> The Syncplicity mobile app allows you to both upload and download files from the Cloud , as well as sharing links to backed up content and tracking what changes have been made to favorite files and folders . On the whole , the app is easy to use and is an effective way to access Syncplicity from mobile devices . <p> - Syncplicity Review Conclusion <h> We liked <p> Good sync and share facilities <p> Option of unlimited file versioning and deleted file retrieval <p> Appealing plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Limited storage space available <p> Different functions operating from different locations <h> We hated <p> Lack of end-to-end encryption and no option to set a private key <p> Syncplicity is an undeniably solid program that performs the majority of basic backup tasks in a simple and effective way . Although their security features are likely to leave privacy-conscious users feeling uncomfortable , those looking for a straightforward way to store and share files will find little to complain about here . <p> Unfortunately for Syncplicity , however , their personal plans have very little to make them stand out in the competitive world of online backup providers . This is fine for customers not bothered with frills and innovations , but it puts Syncplicity at a disadvantage in a market that relies increasingly on new product development to grab audience attention . 
@@26491929 @191929/ <h> Review <h> CloudMe Review <p> Sweden-based CloudMe looks like a fairly standard online backup and sync service , and its clearly taken a lot of inspiration from the well-known Dropbox service , with similar pricing , a free option , and extra storage for referrals . The service itself works well , and may be exactly what some users are looking for . However , there are a few shortcomings that may put you off so you should read this review in detail to see if any of them will affect you before you sign up ! <p> Well start with the good news about CloudMe : you get 3GB of completely free storage , paid storage at roughly the industry average , and a service that 's fairly simple to use . <p> The basic feature-set covers all the major bases , but its fair to say that some other services offer more to play with . If you want to do anything particularly complicated , you are left to your own devices to use the solutions WebDAV integration . This may appeal to some enthusiasts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " out of the box " functionality . <p> Support is a bit of a disappointment . All we could find was a forum , and a social networking presence on Facebook and Twitter , neither of which showed much evidence of support-related interactions . Furthermore , the support email address was unnecessarily rather hard to find . Its never ideal to find yourself short of support options , and even the forum is fairly light on content . <p> Still , CloudMe does work as a simple backup , sync and sharing service , and with the free 3GB of storage expandable up to 16GB if you refer your friends ( in a similar manner to Dropbox ) , you could find some use for it as a simple place to dump some important files . Just do n't  expect masses in the way of bells and whistles . <h> Pricing Plans <p> Like many online backup services , CloudMe offers a completely free service for up to 3GB of data storage , 1GB more than Dropbox . <p> In common with Dropbox , you can also add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 500MB of extra storage provided for each referral . You can refer new customers via Facebook , Google+ , Twitter or email invitations , and CloudMe also provide you with a referral link . <p> When it comes to paid storage , CloudMes pricing structure is clear and simple : <p> Pricing is as follows : <p> 25GB " G3.90 per month ( US$5 ) , or G39.90 ( US$51 ) per year <p> 100GB " G9.90 per month ( US$12.75 ) , or G99.90 ( US$128 ) per year <p> 500GB " G39.90 per month ( US$51 ) , or G399.90 ( US$514 ) per year <p> All the above prices are based on the EUR/USD exchange rate at the time of writing . <p> As you can see , you make a 16% saving on each paid package by committing for a year at a time . These prices are almost a carbon copy of those offered by Dropbox . <p> One point worthy of note is that both the free and 25GB packages are limited to a maximum filesize of 150MB , making these lower-level services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other large media files . <p> Payment for the chargeable services can be made by PayPal , Visa or Mastercard . <h> Features <p> CloudMe has a- relatively- bog-standard feature set , but its worthy of note that its WebDAV functionality does give you the ability to interface with a host of third-party products . While this will appeal to techies , less experienced users would arguably prefer to have more functionality built into the core solution . <p> CloudMes key features are as follows : <p> Web Interface : - CloudMes main Web interface is simple and clear , and its obvious how to upload files from your computer and drag and drop between folders : <p> Music Streaming : - You can also stream any music files you have uploaded to your storage directly from the Web interface or from the mobile apps . <p> Multiformat Apps : - CloudMe provide synchronisation apps for Windows , Mac , Linux , iOS and Android . These all essentially work by providing you with a " blue folder , " which provides live synchronisation between all devices , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folders by mapping folders on your computer(s) to specific folders within your CloudMe account . <p> Sharing : - CloudMe offers a good range of sharing options , ranging from basic sharing , which allows you to provide access to your files to people by sharing a link , to more collaborative sharing options which allow your friends or colleagues to upload to your CloudMe space as well as accessing the contents within . <h> Security <p> In fact , we had to dig around in the forums FAQ section before finding any reference to encryption on the providers website . <p> Essentially , CloudMe does n't  offer any built in encryption . As is described in the FAQs , you are free to upload and download encrypted files , but the encryption process itself is down to you . <p> Information on data redundancy is similarly thin on the ground . While the FAQs state that all CloudMe data is " backed up once a day , " there 's little else to tell you exactly how it is replicated and protected . <p> What you are told is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweden . " <p> If you plan to use the free service for non-confidential data , this lack of detail may be of little concern . However , if you step up to a paid subscription , or are working with sensitive information , you will probably want to know a little more about what goes on behind the scenes . <h> Customer Service <p> Clicking on CloudMes " Support " link takes you straight to a support forum , which in turn includes an FAQ section . <p> We initially thought this was the sum total of our support options , but an email address for the support department was , in fact , hidden away within the answers to one of the questions . <p> Still , support options are still very limited . While finding no number for telephone support is fairly normal , its a shame there is n't live chat , or at least some other kind of support option available . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> Signing up to CloudMe is pleasingly simple . Clicking the " get your free account " link takes you to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name , desired username , email address , password and country . <p> As soon as you provide the information and click " create account , " you are ready to go , and taken straight to the services Web interface . From here you can begin to upload files to your account via a simple drag and drop interface . <p> To get into the synchronisation features of the program , you need to download a custom software client for your desired operating system . We downloaded the Mac version , which installed courtesy of a regular Mac ( . dmg ) installation file . We simply needed to drag the program file to our " Applications " folder to complete the install . <p> Then , we simply had to log into our account : <p> And then we had to provide a name for our computer : <p> With these simple setup steps complete , a new " blue folder " for CloudMe was created on our Mac . - This corresponded with the blue folder within our online account . The default location for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logged in users " Documents " folder . <p> All we needed to do was map a selected local folder to a folder within our remote storage . For example , we created a new folder called " Cloud Pics , " and chose to map it to the " Pictures " folder in our CloudMe account . <p> Music Streaming <p> We used the Web interface to drop a couple of MP3 files into our CloudMe music folder : <p> We were then able to stream those files , both from the Web interface and from the iPhone app , which we tried later . <p> Sharing <p> Sharing folders also proved quite straightforward . From the Web interface , we just needed to right click on any folder or , indeed file , to be presented with a range of sharing options : <p> On our Mac , it was also possible to select a folder to share from the " other " end , by selecting " share folder " from the CloudMe program menu . Doing it this way provided us with a browse window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same share options ( shown above ) appeared . <p> Social networking is well integrated here , with Facebook and Twitter options appearing alongside email options once an item has been shared . <p> Mobile Operation <p> We visited the Apple app store to download the mobile software for CloudMe . <p> The software was pleasingly slick in operation , and we were rapidly able to access the test files we had uploaded to the service via our Mac . This included directly streaming the audio from our " Music " folder . <p> We also like the fact we were given the chance to automatically sync all of the photos on our iPhone : <p> However , we were not entirely convinced many people would use this facility rather than Apples own free ( and effective ) Photo Stream service . <h> Conclusion <p> In all honesty , we ended up liking CloudMe more at the end than we had thought we would at the beginning . What initially looks like a service that 's very light on functionality does , in fact , have a little more hidden away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great uses for the free service . Both the Web interface and iPhone app were slick in operation , and the music streaming worked very well . In fact , we were tempted , after the review , to fill our free 3GB allocation with extra music to supplement our iPhones storage space . <p> Once you start to think about the paid service , however , a few doubts do creep in . Essentially , this is only because there are similarly priced options with- more- support options and- more- features , particularly when it comes to encryption . Do n't  run a mile from CloudMe , however , as what 's here works well and if you 're a believer in " less is more " you could get plenty of mileage from this service . 75371 @qwx275371 
@@26491930 @191930/ <h> NEWS <h> IDrive One and the future of Cloud storage <p> Just a few months after unveiling their low-cost archiving solution Nearline , IDrive have- taken a few steps further towards the future of Cloud storage by announcing the release of new wireless storage device , IDrive One . <p> It 's hardly surprising to see this new endeavor coming courtesy of IDrive , who 've never been strangers to pushing the boat out where features are concerned . Currently enjoying a flood of new customers courtesy of Bitcasa , that trend seems- to- be continuing as they capitalize on their success by rolling out a range of new products and schemes . <p> Their newest innovation takes the form of a combined physical storage device and wireless base station , which allows users to store and stream media via a personal Cloud , as well as extending and focusing their WiFi network . <p> Despite a few usability issues and one of the worst logos in recent memory , IDrive One 's competitive pricing ( you can get a device with 1TB of storage space for $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll throw in a year-long 1TB subscription to the IDrive Cloud storage service for free ) suggest that it 'll be a strong competitor in the wireless storage device market . <p> As well as predicting the success of this new development , it 's also worth taking a look at the motivation behind it . One of the biggest names in online backup today , IDrive 's instincts have served them well so far so it 's worth paying attention to their recent departure from developing traditional online backup features . So what does it tell us ? <h> A bit of context <p> There 's no denying that Cloud storage is a rapidly changing field . Since the beginning of 2016 , we 've seen not only Bitcasa but Barracuda Networks ' Copy.com and CudaDrive close their doors not to mention SOS scrapping their unlimited storage plan , and Backblaze 's live data storage service B2 making it out of beta and into general release . But what is notable is that these developments all seem to be pulling in different directions . <p> For a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services revolved around the integration of Cloud storage features such as file sharing and synchronization , as more traditional providers adapted to the post-Dropbox world of collaborative working and instantly-accessible file storage . <p> Now that these features have become the norm , however , new innovations are being made by companies at the forefront of the industry both with regards to personal plans and business backup solutions . While companies like Backblaze are attempting to take on the big guys and reach enterprises and developers in the market for large quantities of storage space with optimum access speed , other providers are condensing or shutting down their online storage plans and focusing their efforts on other ventures . <h> Where does IDrive One fit in ? <p> So far , it appears that IDrive are hedging their bets by heading in several directions at the same time although each clearly moves away from the traditional scope of online backup plans . But why ? <p> As our understanding of internet security has been shaken by news of invasive national security measures and corporate data breaches , people 's faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprise , as spies and hackers make it to the front page with increasing regularity , and more and more backup companies close their doors , leaving users in a mad rush to securely restore all of their data . <p> While backup providers such as SpiderOak and CrashPlan combat these concerns with stringent security measures , many users are clearly struggling to regain their faith in the system and , as a result , are beginning to look for backup solutions that keep their data in sight and out of harm 's way . Hence IDrive One . <h> The rise of the personal Cloud <p> Storing files in a personal Cloud is one of the newest solutions to grace the world of online backup allowing users to backup and restore their files from a local device that they have complete control over , whilst also allowing for remote access and more flexibility than provided by an offline storage device such as an external hard drive or USB . <p> While personal online storage solutions were initially restricted to static , techy solutions like network attached storage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Synology brought the possibility to a much broader audience and opened the door to smaller , more convenient alternatives , too . <p> IDrive One is one such alternative aiming to be quick , light , and easy to use on the go , it brings Cloud storage into the homes of individual users accommodating their audience 's increased desire for control over their own data , without straying too far from their core product . <p> IDrive 's decisions thus far suggest that , while their original online backup service is n't likely to disappear any time soon , the most promising avenues of expansion lie elsewhere . Whether personal Cloud storage is the way to go remains to be seen , but IDrive 's competitors should certainly take note of this move . <h> Conclusion <p> The current paradigms of traditional online backup and Cloud storage services are shifting already , and we 're likely to see them change even more in the months to come . <p> While there may not yet be a great migration towards a single new strategy , and industry giants like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , personal backup users are likely to see considerable diversification in the offerings of smaller companies encompassing new takes on consumer-level data storage , such as dedicated archiving services and new home Cloud solutions . <p> For now , IDrive 's competitors and customers alike should keep a close eye on how their services are changing , and prepare for a new , changing future of online Cloud- storage . 
@@26491931 @191931/ <h> 5 Best Online Backups For Servers <p> Your companys servers are the lifeline , the lifeblood and at the very core of your business . If its a disaster when you lose data from your personal computers and laptops , imagine what it can do to your business when your server crashes and you have no backup . <p> Servers are built much sturdier than personal computers , but they still use same components and prone to similar hazards : fire , theft , natural disaster , electric shock and heck , even hard drive failures . Imagine having all 500 of your customer information on a CRM database server within your network , then losing all those data because of whatever reasons . What would you do without a backup ? <p> Traditional way is to have NAS attached within the network as well as using tape drives to do regular backups , and those are time-tested and proven methods that work . But these are still local backups and you will need a remote offsite backup to add another layer of protection . For larger companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for SMEs , the cost can be too high ( which is one reason why many IT executives in SMEs tend to neglect offsite backup , resulting in thousands of data loss every year ) . <p> Fortunately , there are robust , cost-effective and hassle-free options out there . In order to save your time , we have gathered a few companies that do very well in server backups . <p> However , there are several different types of servers and thus we have divided this article into several sections for each types of server . Take a look after the break . <h> Windows , Mac OS X &amp; Linux Server Backups <p> The following are providers of cloud based backup solutions for both Windows and Linux servers . <h> 1 . MozyPro From $13.98 Per Month ( Windows , Mac OS X ) <p> MozyPro is business-grade cloud backup service offered by Mozy for servers . It includes all the kick-ass awesome things we love about Mozy and so much more . For instance , it has much improved and faster file scanning , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without slowing down your servers . After initial backups , it will do incremental backup to save bandwidth and performance , only backing up the new changes . You can create multiple custom configuration settings with policies on bandwidth usage , custom backup sets and file types , and so on . And since most servers will have tons of data to backup , you can use their Data Shuttle service and send in your data on encrypted hard drive , with price starting from $275 for 1.8TB Shuttle device . The pricing is simple , and it let 's you also backup your business computers , not just servers . The price is calculated based on how many computers ( non-servers ) you want to backup , how much storage each computer will need , and whether you need to backup servers or not ( which will cost you as " Server Pass " ) . At minimum it will cost you $13.98 per month for 10GB of storage and one computer to backup . 1TB storage with Server Pass for one computer will cost you $409.98 per month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything higher than that . Itll also backup SharePoint , SQL and Exchange servers . We have a review about Mozy Personal Plans here if you want to know more about Mozy. <h> 2 . JungleDisk From $5 Per Month ( Windows , Linux ) <p> JungleDisk maintains its " pay what you use " pricing plan for storage with its Server Edition plan . You pay $5 a month per server for its awesome client software along with 10GB free storage at your chosen storage space provider ( Rackspace or Amazon S3 ) and for later usages , you will be billed for your usage . Not a penny less , not a penny more . Amazon S3 will cost you $0.125 per GB storage , along with $0.12 per GB downloaded , $0.01 per 1,000 upload requests and $0.01 per 10,000 download requests . Confusing , is n't ? If it confuses you , Rackspaces pricing model will delight you . It charges you a flat fee of $0.15 per GB per month . No download fee or upload requests fee are there . It is much easier to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will cost you only $150 per month on top of $5 monthly fee for 1TB of storage . JungleDisk will backup both Windows and Linux servers , and you can do remote management from any Mac , Linux and Windows computers , using Jungle Disk Server Management Client . And with JungleDisks Backup Vault technology , specially designed for servers , 1GB wont cost you 1GB of storage on the cloud . Backup Vaults offer block-level compression and de-duplication , making backup more efficient and reduce storage costs . We have n't done a review on Jungle Disk Server Edition yet but here is a review on their personal plans . <h> 3 . Carbonite $599 Per Year ( Windows ) <p> Among all plans offered by Carbonite , only BusinessPremier plan , which cost $599 per year , supports backing up Windows servers . You get 500GB of storage and ability to add unlimited amount of Windows servers as long as you have storage space for them . You can also do database backup of SQL Server , Exchange , SharePoint , MySQL and Oracle but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For additional storage , it costs $46 per year for 50GB and $89 per year for 100GB . You can add additional storage packs up to 12TB . For a modest storage for most SME needs , it would cost about $5227 per year for 5200GB additional storage ( total 5700GB ) . With Carbonites amazing customer support , robust offering and pretty fast uplink speeds , we would say the price is fair for most businesses . BusinessPremier plan also let 's you backup all your work computers too , not just limited to servers . The only limit will be available storage . You can also backup unlimited numbers of external hard drives and NAS too . We still do n't  have a review on Carbonites business plans but for home plans , here is our comprehensive review . <h> General Server Backups <p> Basically , companies in this category can be used for any kind of backups , but need more technical knowledge to deploy and run . You can use them to backup your entire servers , including databases , or web servers , or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakop gives us simple FTP-based backup solution , with a free starter plan that comes with 500MB of storage and 2GB upload/download bandwidth . It let 's you use FTP , rsync , sshFS , scp and rdiff-backup protocols to backup your servers onto Bakop network , so there is no client software and thus it is pretty much platform independent . For $4.99 a month , you get Bakop Pro FTP account which offers 10GB storage space , 3 FTP users , 20GB transfer to server and 10GB transfer from server . rsync and other advanced protocols are only supported on Pro accounts . If you need more space , you can purchase more at $2 per 1GB storage , $0.08 per 1GB upload bandwidth , and $0.20 per 1GB download bandwidth . All those prices are monthly rates . For experienced sysadmins , they can easily use scripts to automate the backup process . So it is really a no-brainer . Here is our very detailed review on Bakop. <h> 2. rsync.net From $0.24/GB/month <p> rsync.net is pretty similar to Bakop but they have been in this business for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11th year in operation ) . What rsync does is simple it provides offsite backup for disaster recovery ( or any other usages you can think of ) . It supports- ssh , scp , sftp , ftp protocols and tools like rsync , rdiff-backup , duplicity and Unison . Unlike a lot of other backup service providers , rsync actually owns their own data centers across 4 locations in the world , not just using space from Amazon S3 . So they have complete control over their whole data centers and everything . One really great thing about rsync is that their engineers will provide you unlimited amount of tech support for any kind of usage you want to do with rsync.net , as long as you are using the protocols they support . All technical support will be handled by a real live Unix engineer , and you will not have to deal with annoying ticket systems , or junior level technicians . That is rsync.nets promise . Storage rates are pretty cheap too . Up until 24GB , it will cost you 80 cents per GB per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents per GB per month . If you go higher than 200GB , then until 399GB , it is about 48 cents per GB per month . Once you go over 4TB , the cost is significantly lower , at just 24 cents per GB per month . They also offer two bulk annual packages , at 1TB ( $1800/year ) and 10TB ( $9500/year ) . Those two bulk offers are cheapest options , since $1800 year is just 15 cents per GB for whole 1TB , and $9500 breaks down to about 8 cents per GB . We will be doing a review about rsync.net soon here . <h> Database Server Backups <p> Now , this part is tricky . Backing up your databases onto the cloud is not just about offsite data storage anymore . It also involves with regulation compliance for each industry . And there are different level of complexities and layers on layers of technical complications depending on your database server setup . Fortunately for those with single database server setup , or rather simple setup , we can use MozyPro or Carbonite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are doing ) for backups . But if you prefer easy to use tools , we have two providers for you . <h> 1 . SQLCloudBackup.net From Free <p> You might not have heard of this company but they are not new in this industry . In fact , Intelligent Database Solutions , Inc. , the company behind SQLCloudBackup.net , has been around since 2003 and been providing advanced solutions for DBAs and developers operating SQL servers . What SQLCloudBackup.net is now offering is a free but very powerful SQL Server backup tool , which allows you to backup your databases and store them on local disks , network drives or on cloud . The software is packed full of features but not overloaded with them . We would say that the programs features are sufficient enough for most small and medium-sized businesses with moderate IT budget . Most other SQL Server backup solutions charge an arm , a leg , a kidney and a heart the kind of spending power most SMEs do n't  have . The initial offering is free , but already includes powerful features such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup scheduling . It wo n't include cloud backup storage though . For that , you have to shell out $10 per month , which gives you even more features on the software , as well as 25GB of cloud-based backup storage . For $50 a month , you get further advanced features , as well as 100GB of backup storage space . Highest Enterprise plan will set you back for $100 a month , and comes with 200GB of storage space . Additional storage can be purchased at $0.20 per GB per month . <h> 2. iBackup From $9.95 Per Month <p> iBackup as a company has been around since 1999 , and prices are a bit steep . For 100GB , you are paying $9.95 per month or $99.5 per year . 500GB will set you back at $49.95 per month or $499.5 per year . Highest option is 3TB , which will burn a huge $299.95 per month hole in your wallet . The software supports Windows , Mac and Linux ( through rsync scripts , as there is no client software for Linux exist yet ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oracle and Exchange servers . But there is no pricing plan published on the website about how much it will cost for those additional plugins though . Here is our review on iBackup . <h> Do n't  Forget Your Tapes <p> As much as we love cloud backup solutions for their convenience , data redundancy , and added layer of security for our backups , you simply cant forgo tape backups . They are still the most reliable method of local backups . Our suggestion is to have local tape backups according to your schedule , and for daily incremental backups , use cloud based solutions . If you have a setup that already works well , then do n't  destroy it just to use only an online backup service . Instead , add online backup as another layer . Having multiple layer of protection is , after all , the best protection of your data against any possible disasters . 75371 @qwx275371 <h> One response to " 5 Best Online Backups For Servers " <p> Hi Matthias , yes , in idle mode with the harddrives not snnpiing ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it takes some 5+ Watts , like an internet router does as well . With the hard drives rotating , its slightly over 17 Watts ( depends on what kind of drives you build in ) . Still not too much for a small server , what it basically is .

@@26491934 @191934/ <h> Computer Backups : Some Scary Statistics ! <p> Let 's face it computer backups are not particularly exciting . Everyone knows deep down that they 're important after all , nobody wants to lose their business files , their precious family photos , or their personal documents . But a sense of complacency can mean that taking care of backups is a job that often ends up far too far down the average " to do " list . <p> Ive been a freelance IT consultant for twelve years , and I still help various individuals and businesses with their computing needs when I 'm not writing articles like this one . As such , Ive seen first hand just how endemic this complacency regarding backups truly is . I 've also , sadly , seen what happens when it blows up in peoples faces . <p> I 've seen everything from my clients having to " fess up " to their- clients because they 've lost crucial work , to families losing everything from treasured photo and video memories to their childrens school coursework . Sometimes , with the help of expensive data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their data from failed hard drives . But on other occasions , I 've had to watch faces fall when I 've been the one to have to tell them not only that there 's nothing I can do to help , but that really they only have themselves to blame . <p> With all this in mind , I was n't altogether surprised when I saw some statistics from Backblaze , based on a survey of over 2000 computer users , regarding how often each of them back up all the data on their computers . <p> I 'll begin with the really scary numbers : 25% of respondents said they never backed up , and a further 39% said they only backed up annually . Only 8% backed up daily , and 9% weekly . <p> Let 's think about what that really means : In the past couple of weeks , Ive- saved plenty of new files on my Mac . These include articles for clients , business and personal cash flow spreadsheets , a VAT return , a bunch of invoices , dozens of photos from a weekend break , and numerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose all of this , I 'd be pretty gutted , and would have wasted an awful lot of time . A months worth of work would be a disaster and could potentially land me in trouble with my clients . A years worth would be a serious crisis and yet 64% of the survey respondents take exactly this risk . <p> Some of my data is backed up automatically . My photos all go into iCloud , and my emails are all stored in a Hosted Exchange system but that still leaves significant gaps that mean my only safe option is to back up to an online system on a daily basis . On top of that , I periodically run a local backup to an encrypted external hard drive . I recommend to all of my clients that they have at least two reliable backup methods in place . <p> If you 've never lost any data , you may think my view is alarmist . If so , please consider this : Various studies point to hard disk drives failing at a rate of 5% per year . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drive in your PC or laptop will fail in a given year . If your hard drive fails and you have no backup , that 's everything gone . To me , that 's far too much of a risk . <p> But what about if you keep your computer for five years ? Well , that 1 in 20 failure rate is each year so you 're up to 5 in 20 . That means that over five years , there 's a one in four chance you 'll lose any data youve not backed up . <p> I do have one group of clients who back up their data religiously . They do n't  need reminding or hassling about it , and their eyes do n't  glaze over when I bang on about the importance of computer backups . This group probably accounts for about 25% of my clients , and they 're the ones whove lost data before and either paid for expensive data recovery or been forced to wave goodbye to their client work or their precious memories .

@@26491936 @191936/ <h> Summary : <p> iCloud is Apple 's answer to online storage . It 's built into every device from iPods to iPads , is easy to setup and use , offers reasonably priced plans , and allows seamless syncing between anything that 's Mac-made . While iCloud is n't perfect , it 's close to it , making it the Cloud provider of choice for any Apple aficionado . You can read our detailed iCloud review below or sign up now . 75368 @qwx275368 <h> Pricing <p> Every user receives 5 GB of free online storage space upon signing up for iCloud . Should you require more storage space " which is very likely if you own more than one MacBook or iDevice " there are different monthly pricing plans available dependent on the upgrade ( 50 GB , 200 GB , and 1 TB ) . <p> Apple has set prices for their iCloud storage plans based on the location and currency of its user . It goes without saying that some countries get a better deal than others , but on average they tend to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set at : <p> If you 'd like to find out how much exactly iCloud costs in your country , you can check Apple 's pricing page for yourself here . <h> Extras <h> Free trial <p> You can get a good feel of everything that iCloud has to offer by making use of its free 5 GB . The monthly plans do n't buy you anything besides more space , so you can experience the full range of its features without paying an extra dime . <h> Refund <p> You can receive a refund if you upgraded your iCloud account and then changed your mind about it up to 15 days after purchase . You can also downgrade by selecting a new plan , which will take effect once your current monthly subscription ends . <p> The new plan " and new cost " will be implemented once your current monthly plan expires . <h> Business plans <p> Unfortunately , Apple does not currently have a business version of iCloud on offer ( cue sad trombone ) . Given this , and the fact that it 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing files beyond your iDevices , it should almost exclusively be considered a personal online storage solution . <h> Payment methods <h> How does BackupProvider compare to the competition ? <p> Considering " or perhaps because " Apple products are some of the most expensive pieces of technology on the market , the cost of iCloud storage is slightly cheaper than the average online backup service pricing of $5 to $12 to month . <h> Features <h> Online backup or Cloud storage ? <p> Both , though it leans a bit more towards being cloud storage . <p> iCloud 's well-developed sync and share options , limited storage space , and an unlimited number of devices put it firmly in cloud storage territory . However , there 's some crossover with online backup due to Apple 's tight security and the option to set up automatic backups . <h> About iCloud <p> Apple itself should require no introduction , but for those not in the know : Apple is one of the leading innovators in technology that designs , develops , and sells consumer electronics , online services , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve Wozniak , and Ronald Wayne , it is now the world 's largest technology company in terms of assets and revenue . <p> If you 'd like to read more about the company or software , there is no shortage of reading material available online , though the Wikipedia pages for Apple and iCloud are a good place to start . Or you can take the lazy route and watch the movie version . <h> Backup options <p> Automatic backups <p> Manual backups <p> Full-system backups <p> Select data backups <p> File size restrictions <p> iCloud gives you the option to choose between backups that are automatic or manual , full-system or of select data only . <p> You can set it all up on any of your iDevices by going to your System Preferences and clicking on iCloud . <p> iCloud has no restrictions on file type , which means that you can keep your photos , emails , videos , PDFs , Microsoft Office documents , music , and more , up-to-date and available across all of your Apple products . That said , each file must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed your iCloud storage limit . <h> Which operating systems is it compatible with ? <p> Desktop : OS X , Windows <p> Mobile : iOS ( for iPhone , iPad , iWatch , and iPod ) <h> File sharing <p> One of iCloud 's few drawbacks is that you can not share files beyond your personal network of devices ( though you can curiously share individual files with iWork , an office suite of applications created by Apple that includes Keynote , Pages , and Numbers ) . <p> Users who are keen on using iCloud as their primary Cloud storage service , but who require file sharing for , say , work or school projects , would be wise to compliment their subscription with one from a service that has an emphasis on file sharing , such as Dropbox or Google Drive . <h> Sync options <p> You can upload and sync files and photos from an unlimited MacBooks and iDevices by using two main features of iCloud : iCloud Drive and iCloud Photo Library . <h> iCloud Drive <p> iCloud Drive is an online data storage facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the iCloud . Once stored on the Drive , you 'll be able to access them from all of your Apple devices in addition to web browsers on just about any kind of computer . <p> To get started with iCloud Drive , you will have turn it on your MacBook in System Preferences &gt; iCloud and on any iDevices in Settings &gt; iCloud ( except for new iOS 9 devices , which will have a dedicated iCloud Drive App that comes pre-installed ) . After doing this iCloud Drive will appear in both your Finder sidebar and under Go in your control panel . <p> Once set up on two or more devices , you can view and access your synced files via your computer or iCloud.com . Managing your data , however , is largely limited to your Mac , as on devices running iOS , files stay in the folders belonging to the Apps that had created them . <h> iCloud Photo Library <p> iCloud Photo Library is essentially a photo-specific version of iCloud Drive . It 's a subfeature of iCloud that stores every photo and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> To utilize iCloud Photo Library , you will have to turn it on on your Mac in both System Preferences &gt; iCloud and in Photos &gt; Preferences &gt; iCloud . <p> When setting it up , you will want to check iCloud Photo Library ' and My Photo Stream ' ( as well as iCloud Photo Sharing , should you wish to create albums of your photos to share with others ) . <p> Here 's where people tend to get a little confused . When uploading your photos to the Cloud , you will be given the choice between Download Originals to this Mac ' and Optimize Mac Storage ' . <p> Download Originals to this Mac keeps all your photos and videos as they are on your computer , at full size and resolution . Optimize Mac Storage , ' on the other hand , moves all of your original photos and videos to the Cloud , leaving only low-resolution thumbnails behind ( though the originals can be accessed via Photos and individually downloaded via iCloud when connected to the internet ) . <p> Before you begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People who want multiple copies of their original image files on hand should click Download Originals ' , as it 'll be a pain in the rump to have to individually download each file on iCloud back onto your computer in the case you want to later copy the photos to an external hard drive or the like . <p> Conversely , if you 're content playing Russian roulette with your data and are okay with storing the sole copies of your precious photos offsite , then click Optimize Mac Storage ' . Not the safest option in our opinion , but hey , it means you 'll free up some space on your hard drive . <p> Setting iCloud Photo Library access up on a synced iOS device , meanwhile , is a considerably simpler process . All you have to do is go to Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Photos and activate the sharing of your photo stream with the Cloud . After which , it 'll appear in the iCloud with the rest of your photos . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> No file versioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deletion <p> iCloud has no built-in file versioning capability , storing only the most up-to-date versions of your files . <p> File versioning is , however , one of the main features of another piece of Apple software " Time Machine . You can find instructions on how to use it to backup and restore your computer here . <p> Frustratingly , even if they are both company made software , Time Machine and iCloud functions can not be connected . That said , they are complimentary backup services and work well alongside one another , so if file versioning is very important to you , we 'd highly recommend using one in addition to the other . <p> What iCloud does offer is deleted file recovery . If you 've accidentally deleted an important document , you can go fishing for it on iCloud.com . Once logged in go to Settings &gt; Advanced , where you will find the following options : <p> You do n't have to panic and act fast , either : The above data can be retrieved up to 30 days following their deletion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option , but Apple does provide detailed instructions on their website on how to copy your photos , documents , and other types of data . Once copied , you can archive them via your archiving tool of choice . <h> Security <p> All sessions at iCloud.com and all iCloud mail traffic encrypted with SSL <p> Optional two-step verification <p> When you use iCloud , you do n't need to worry about weak encryption , or your cloud provider pawning off your personal information to the government or some other baddie corporate organizations . Apple 's devotion to privacy and security is legendary " they even went so far as to publicly stand up to the FBI in the name of protecting their users ' data . <p> iCloud ensures the safety of your data by encrypting it when sent over the Internet , securing it in an encrypted format on the iCloud server , and using secure tokens for authentication . This way , any data you store is protected both while it 's being transmitted and when stored in the Cloud . <p> Apple uses a minimum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendars to photos to backups " and encrypts all iCloud.com and iCloud Mail sessions with SSL . <p> If that all was n't enough , Apple offers the additional option of setting up two-step verification on your devices , so that you can make your data that much safer . Boom ! <h> Customer Support <h> Resources <p> iCloud resources are lumped in with those of every other piece of Apple software over at Apple Support , with the iCloud-specific section being found here . <p> Apple Support provides comprehensive guides and FAQs for just about every question regarding iCloud that you can think of . <p> If by some slim chance , you can not find the answer that you 're looking for directly on their website , you also have the options of community answers and directly contacting support staff . <h> Contacting staff <p> Contacting Apple staff via their website is not a particularly clear-cut endeavor . Rather than providing you with email addresses or contact forms , you must navigate a maze of topics through which you narrow your search to a particular subtopic , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Apple Support does try to make up for the lack of email options by giving you three phone options : 1 ) provide your number and Apple Support will call you right away , 2 ) schedule a time when it is convenient for Apple Support to call you , or 3 ) provide your contact information and call Apple Support yourself . <p> If you 're phone-phobic , you also have the option of making a reservation at an Apple Genius Bar , which are found at every licensed Apple retail store . There , you will receive face-to-face help and advice from a certified Apple expert . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> As it 's the option most pushed on their website , we decided to give Apple Support our number and have them call us regarding an issue with iCloud Photo Library . <p> Apple Support wasted no time calling us after submitting our request . The representative we spoke to was friendly , knowledgeable , and professional , engaging us in some small talk before getting down to the business of our iCloud problem . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirming that we had no further questions , the call ended . <p> All in all , we were very impressed " but not very surprised " by the incredibly high quality of Apple 's customer service . The pleasant , personalized interaction made us almost thankful that there is no option to contact Apple Support by email or online form , as it would mean not getting to talk to one of Apple 's charming ( and clearly dedicated ) employees . 75370 @qwx275370 <h> What you 'll need to download <p> Apple 's Cloud backup service will only function on your devices if you 've got the latest and greatest software update on them . <p> New iOS devices that are running iOS 9 and new MacBooks running OS X El Capitan already have iCloud enabled , but if you 've got the older hardware you 'll be required to do some system upgrades . <p> iOS devices must be running iOS 8 or later while MacBooks must be running OS X Yosemite or later . PCs , on the other hand , must be running Windows 7 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself requires Safari 6 or later . <h> Setup options <p> iCloud comes preinstalled on every Apple product , making setup as simple as signing up for an iCloud account online , putting that login information into your MacBook and iDevices , and turning it on . <h> Using the software <p> Like all Apple products , iCloud is sleek in design and easy to use . <p> iCloud is incredibly simple to setup and manage on your computer , thanks to System Preferences and Finder . The same can be said for iCloud.com , whose interface is clean , minimal , and easy to navigate . <p> When it comes to browsing your files , you can do so in your web browser via iCloud.com , or via the dedicated computer Apps , iCloud Drive , and iCloud Photo Library . <h> How to cancel your account <p> You can not cancel and uninstall iCloud , as it is a built-in feature of Apple products , but you can disable it on both your Mac and all of your iDevices . <p> Once your accounts have been disabled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , you can either create a new Apple I 'd and an accompanying account , or switch to a different , pre-existing iCloud account . <h> iCloud Review Conclusion <h> We liked <h> We were n't too sure about <p> Lack of file sharing <p> Only supports the most up-to-date operating systems <p> No file versioning <p> Can not be completely uninstalled <h> We hated <p> Nothing <p> There is a reason why almost every single OS X and iOS user signs up for iCloud . The cloud storage solution is tailored to work specifically with Apple products , is laughably easy to set up and manage , and boasts prices that are competitive with other backup options available on the online market . <p> Sure , iDevice devotees always have the option of giving the offerings from other online backup and storage providers a try , but when it comes right down to it , it 's hard to pass up software that was literally made for you .

You can read a detailed review below or sign up now . 75368 @qwx275368 <p> There are three subscriptions available for LiveDrive users Backup , Briefcase and Pro Suite . Unlike the majority of providers , which offer either an online backup service ( focusing on automatic backups of all your data ) or a Cloud storage plan ( which prioritise file sharing and manual uploads ) , LiveDrive gives you the full range of options , with the choice to pick whichever service suits you best or a combination of the two . <p> To start with , their Backup plan offers an online backup service only , with no file sharing options but an unlimited amount of storage space . With prices beginning at around $5.40* per month , you 'll get coverage for one computer , although you can add additional devices for 1 Euro per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can turn to Briefcase , which offers 2TB of online space as well as a local storage option which acts as an additional hard drive for your computer .

If you 'd like additional Cloud storage space , you can add more for approximately $6.50 per TB . - <p> Finally , there 's Pro Suite , which combines the two . This option gives you 5TB of online storage space , as well as backup features and local storage , and can cost as little as $15.30 per month . <h> Real ' prices <p> All those prices as low as ' conditions are there for a reason , as LiveDrive are very sneaky about their pricing .

Be warned though you 'll need to enter your bank details to make an account , so might end up with an account you do n't want if you decide not to go ahead . Payment can be made using most major credit and debit cards . <p> * All prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of writing . <h> Features <h> About LiveDrive <p> UK-based online backup and Cloud storage provider LiveDrive was founded in 2000 by Andrew Michael a tech entrepreneur also responsible for creating hosting services site Fasthosts and online services marketplace Bark . <p> In 2014 , LiveDrive was bought by j2 Global , inc. a communications company with brands including IGN.com , PCMag.com , and KeepItSafe to its name and now has over 1 million customers around the world , as well as maintaining partnerships with PC World , Dixons , CompUSA , and more . <h> Backup options <p> LiveDrive 's Backup account holders can automatically upload all of their files to the Cloud , with the option to schedule how often files are backed up , and when uploads start . Alternatively , Briefcase users can manually select which documents they want to upload , and Pro Suite account holders can do both . <p> If you opt to use Briefcase , you can also use their Priorities tool to decide- the order in which you want different file types to be backed up . <h> Cross-platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mac operating systems , as well as mobile devices running iOS , Android , and Windows 8 . <h> Sync and share options <p> Although LiveDrive 's Backup subscription does n't support file sharing or synchronisation , users of their Briefcase and Pro Suite plans can give friends and colleagues access to their files . Sharing can only be initiated from the Briefcase area of storage , but the process is nice and simple . <p> If you want to share files , you can choose between creating a public link , which can be shared anywhere , and inviting specific friends or colleagues to view individual files . Both require just a few clicks , with the latter achieved by using LiveDrives integrated messaging system to grant them access via email . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> LiveDrive retains the 30 most recent versions of users ' files , allowing you to return to previous drafts of your documents , even if you 've since saved over them . They also hold on to deleted data for 30 days after it has been removed , in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . <h> NAS-compatibility <p> Users of LiveDrive 's Backup and Pro Suite accounts get the benefits of NAS compatibility making it easy to backup from your network attachhed storage device- <h> Local backups <p> As well as Cloud storage , Briefcase subscribers also get access to local storage space . This comes in the form of a mirror of your C : drive , into which you can simply drag and drop your files to add them to the Cloud . As well as providing extra storage space , this also helps to speed up your backup process . <h> Local network transfers <p> If you want to access files from more than one computer on a single network , LiveDrive will make things easier for you by bypassing the Cloud entirely . Instead , they 'll transfer your data directly from one computer to another across the network , saving you the inconvenience of waiting for slow uploads and avoiding the risk of using up all of your bandwidth . <p> This process is not encrypted , which may outweigh the positives for some , but there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharing . Once again , this feature is available to Briefcase and Pro Suite subscribers only . <h> Streaming <p> A few years ago , LiveDrive incorporated a service which allows users to stream backed up movies and music directly from their LiveDrive account . Available to access from both web browsers and mobile devices , this feature removes the need to use a third party service to play files and also gives LiveDrive the added bonus of acting as a media player . <p> Although very basic , we found the whole streaming process to be simple and speedy , making it easy for us to watch videos almost instantaneously . Familiar navigation and a full-screen mode sealed the deal this feature may not be fancy , but it certainly does the job . - <h> Security <p> It 's hard to find details of LiveDrive 's security features on their website the only concrete information we could discover at first was that files are encrypted with 256-bit AES . A bit of poking around also revealed that you can choose to encrypt files during transfer , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in . <p> Briefcase and Pro Suite users can also elect to encrypt the contents of their local storage , although this has to be manually applied by navigating to your account ; s Security Settings. - <p> While this all sounds fairly good , there 's a distinct lack of information available on the encryption process itself . From the information that was available , we surmised that users can not set their own private encryption keys meaning that encryption is n't end-to-end , and LiveDrive ( and therefore also j2 Global ) have access to the information needed to decrypt and access your files at any time . <h> Customer Support <p> LiveDrive 's customer support comes courtesy of their Support Force One ' team , who offer customer support with technicians on hand 24 hours a day , seven days a week . While this sounds very impressive , it becomes a little less so when you discover that there is no live chat or phone support on offer just an email service , although they do promise replies within 24 hours . <p> Support resources are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallish range of topics , and no forums on offer either . On the plus side , the ability to check whether your performance is being affected by LiveDrive system maintenance is a handy extra , and Getting Started guides are likely to come in useful for less experienced users . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> LiveDrive remained true to their promise , replying to all of our support requests within 24 hours both providing information and fixing technical issues . All communication was clear and professional so , although direct forms of contact are still missed , it seems that LiveDrives email-based support has been developed well enough to meet the majority of needs . <h> Closed accounts <p> LiveDrive made news in 2014 when they closed around 400 customer accounts with little warning . The deletions , which affected only customers in the UK , were reportedly performed due to accounts holders ' excessive use of bandwidth and/or storage space during the previous year ; although no official definition of what was considered excessive use was given . <p> LiveDrive received many complaints regarding the incident , with most berating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those affected . Although this did impact upon the companys reputation at the time , LiveDrive has since bounced back , with public support for the brand recovering and no further problems making the headlines since then . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> LiveDrive maintains profiles across all major social networks , including Twitter and Facebook . Both of these accounts feature one or two posts every month , mostly consisting of company updates and a few replies to customer support requests , although these tend to be fairly limited . They also have a blog , which follows a similar format , although posts tend to be longer and more detailed . 75370 @qwx275370 75367 @qwx275367 <p> We encountered a couple of problems with logging in when we first signed up to LiveDrive , with error messages repeatedly stopping us from accessing our account . Unfortunately , there 's no way to contact Support Force One unless you 're signed in so , with low expectations , we sent an email to the Sales department instead . <p> To our pleasant surprise , we received a response around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been resolved , and were able to sign into our account without difficulty . While this may have been a much more general problem that was resolved for other reasons , we still appreciated the notification , as well as the fairly prompt response . <h> Using LiveDrive <p> LiveDrive is easy to use for basic tasks , with a nice enough website and a simple ( if distinctly unstylish ) desktop interface . However , when using their Pro Suite , the combination of Backup and Briefcase features can become confusing as , rather than integrating features from both plans into one cohesive subscription , they appear to have simply given users access to everything . <p> This means that there are two locations to transfer files to and from ( only one of which allows you to share them afterwards ) , two sets of settings , and two places from which to access and retrieve your files . Fortunately , it 's not quite as complicated as it sounds , as all of the processes are , by themselves , quite straightforward . On the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locate a particular feature . <p> In addition to this , uploads are very slow , with even text files taking a long time to upload using a 20Mbps broadband connection . <h> Using the mobile app <p> LiveDrive 's mobile app let 's you perform all of the major functions associated with your account . For Briefcase and Pro Suite users , this means accessing all files saved to the Cloud and in your Briefcase , as well as file sharing , automatic uploads and the option to stream saved music files . Well-designed and easy to use , it compliments computer-based accounts well . <h> LiveDrive Review Conclusion <h> We liked <p> Option to choose between Cloud storage and online backup-style accounts <p> Option to combine Cloud storage and online backup features in a single plan <p> Unlimited storage on offer ( Backup plan only ) <p> File sharing on offer ( Briefcase and Pro Suite plans only ) <h> We werent so sure about <p> Lack of clear info on real subscription prices <p> Confusing division between backup and briefcase features in Pro Suite <h> We hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tried to combine the unlimited storage of online backups and the convenience and accessibility of Cloud storage into a single account , but LiveDrive has gone the extra mile by offering both options separately as well . While we really appreciate this attempt to provide more flexibility , it 's been somewhat clumsily done , leaving the Pro Suite ( their most promising subscription ) something of a confusing mess . <p> If you 're looking for a very basic online backup , there 's something to be said for their Backup plan , although do n't expect much beyond uploading and downloading files , and if you like the idea of local storage bundled in with Cloud-based file sharing , Briefcase might be of interest . <p> However , by trying to do so much , LiveDrive fails to do a really exceptional job of anything . That 's not to say it 's bad if you do n't mind untangling all of the threads , there are some good features in there but ultimately there are easier ( and more secure ) ways to keep your files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Signed up for a lifetime subscription via DripBit . What can you say about a service that took six months to back up my files online , consistently used up 30% of my memory , and then , when things went sour with DripBit , arbitrarily cancelled my subscription , no refund or recourse ? Avoid LiveDrive like the plague . 
@@26491939 @191939/ <h> Summary : <p> Carbonite is a great choice for Windows users looking for simplicity and basic customisable features . While security features are limited and access to full features comes with a fairly hefty price tag , Carbonite remains a straightforward- and user-friendly program with plenty to recommend it. - You can read a detailed review below or sign up now . 75368 @qwx275368 <p> If you 're thinking of signing up with Carbonite you 've got plenty of choice , as they offer three plans for personal use " Basic , Plus and Prime . <p> The Basic plan costs $59.99 per year and is compatible with both Windows and Mac operating systems .

You do n't need to provide your bank details when you sign up , and all of your files will be permanently 15 days after the trial ends unless you purchase a paid version . <p> Price-wise , Carbonite 's Basic plan sits in the same range as major competitors Backblaze and CrashPlan . Both also offer unlimited storage , with all three providers charging between $50 and $60 per year . Carbonite does suffer in comparison , however , as neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those wanting everything that Carbonite has to offer will have to shell out considerably more . <p> Of course , price is n't the only factor in choosing your backup provider , and Carbonite has a lot to offer for the price . If you decide to go ahead with Carbonite , you can pay using Visa , MasterCard , American Express and Discover cards . <h> Features <h> About Carbonite <p> Carbonite was founded in 2005 by Jeff Flowers and David Friend , entrepreneurs who had previously worked together to get companies including Sonexis , FaxNet and Pilot Software off the ground . Today , the Boston-based company employs over 400 people and backs up more than 350 million files for over 1 million subscribers every day . <p> A well-established contender in the field of online storage solutions , Carbonite 's Business backup service is subscribed to by companies across a range of disciplines , from health care and insurance to real estate and non-profit . <h> Unlimited data <p> All Carbonite subscribers can take advantage of unlimited backup space " even using their Basic plan you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . You can also backup most file types , although you 'll need to manually add videos ( unless you 're a Prime subscriber ) , and any individual files that are more than 4GB in size . <h> Backup options <p> Carbonite backs up your data automatically , making it very easy to just set up the program and let it run and , allowing files to be uploaded with minimum effort on your part . You also do n't need to worry about manually updating your backup every time you change or create a document , as Carbonite continuously scans your computer for new and updated files and uploads them automatically . <p> If you 're concerned about continuous backups taking their toll on your bandwidth or computer performance , then you can also set a backup schedule that runs the program only once a day at the time of your choosing . There 's also the option to stop all backups and scans during selected hours of the day a useful way to ensure that Carbonite wo n't slow things down at an important moment . <h> Backup from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option to backup files from one external hard drive . When the drive is plugged in , Carbonite will automatically upload its contents to the cloud in exactly the same way as it backs up files on your computer . This allows users to backup larger quantities of data without first having to move them all to their computer . <h> Sync and share options <p> Carbonite subscribers can also download the free Sync &amp; Share app , which is used to keep files up to date across multiple devices ; from phones and iPhones to laptops , desktops , and tablets . When you update a document , the app will ensure that any changes are synchronized across all of your devices " so you can always access the most recent version of your work , no matter where you are . <p> When you first open the app , you 'll be presented with every document that you 've added or amended within the last 30 days , and you can access older files with a quick search . You can also share files from the application " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to friends , family , colleagues and clients via Facebook , Twitter or email . <h> Speed <p> We took a closer look at Carbonite 's upload and download speeds by backing up a selection of files . We then divided the number of MB in each file by how many seconds it took to upload or download , and from there calculated how many Mbps Carbonite is capable of . Our results can be found in the graph below . <p> With an average upload speed of 2.1 Mbps , Carbonite is at the slower end of average , although not notably so . A 100MB file took around five minutes to upload , with downloads a little faster . Retrieving the same file took just under two minutes , with a more impressive average download speed of 4.2 Mbps . <p> While we endeavor to make our speed tests as accurate as possible , it is important to remember that there are several factors that can influence the speed of your backups , from packet loss and latency to slow broadband . <h> File versioning <p> File versioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of your files , allowing you return to an earlier version of a document or identify at what point a change was made . Carbonite subscribers can access three months ' worth of file versioning . This is longer than with some of its competitors , - even if its not unlimited . It 's a useful feature to have in any form , however , and Carbonite 's allowance is above average and should be adequate for most users . Unfortunately for Mac users , versioning is currently available for use on Windows operating systems only . <h> Deleted file recovery <p> Most people know the feeling of despair that comes from urgently needing a file that you 've already deleted . Luckily , there is an answer to this problem , as Carbonite let 's you retrieve files that have been removed from your computer up to 30 days after their deletion , so recently scrapped documents can be easily restored . <p> It 's worth noting that this makes Carbonite impossible to use as a long-term storage solution , as all files stored in the Cloud but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 30 days are up . Instead , Carbonite is best used primarily as an active backup of your current work ; a safety net taking care of your relevant data rather than a way to free up space on your computer . <h> Mirror Image Backup <p> Carbonite 's Mirror Image backup let 's you create a complete copy of your computer and save it to an external hard drive ( though you 'll need to provide the drive yourself ) . It copies everything , including your installed software and operating system as well as your folders and files . This means that if your computer dies unexpectedly , you can upload the mirror image to your new PC and carry on exactly where you left off . <h> Courier Recovery Service <p> For Personal Prime users located in the USA , there 's another layer of protection available should you lose access to your files .

You can then use this to access your data without having to connect to the internet . <h> Security <p> Carbonite 's security measures are good in some respects , but some essential features are missing . All files that they receive and store are encrypted using 128-bit SSL technology , but files are not encrypted client-side ( only during transmission and while stored in Carbonite servers ) , so encryption is not end-to-end . It is possible to set a private encryption key , which is never known or stored by the company and can not be reset , but this is only possible for Windows PC users , and restricts access to certain features . <p> In Carbonite 's datacenters , you 'll find RAID 6 technology , which makes three copies of your files and spreads them across 15 disk drives " so if one drive fails , the data wo n't be permanently lost . They also use the Carbonite File System @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the backup process , and emergency power generators , climate control , and uninterruptable power supplies ensure that neither natural disasters nor power failure- have- any adverse effects . Physical access to datacenters is also carefully monitored and restricted to authorized personnel only , with biometric scanners on site and extensive security procedures for staff with online access to stored files . <h> Customer- Support <p> Customer support is available from 8.30 am to 9 pm EST , with a phone line and live chat available .

It 's a good quality program that will appeal to both novice and middle-range users . <h> 2 responses to " Carbonite Review " <p> WARNING : Carbonite does not backup very important files that you put in your Mac Home directory . I called a tech support person after I could n't find some of my files and they told me the only files it does n't  backup are video files . Not true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Carbonite does n't  backup . Some of them very important . <p> I made the mistake of paying for 2 years of service instead of just one . I asked for a refund and they refused saying it was past the 30 day trial period . I 've also seen other reviews that say they automatically charge your credit card again when your service expires . That person had trouble getting a refund too until they finally had to contact the Better Business Bureau . <p> Do your research and you 'll find better alternatives such as iDrive or CrashPlan.

Its a pity that it is n't available for Windows . <p> Backing up iPhoto is essential ! <p> For Mac users with serious collection of photos , they will want to keep backups of their iPhoto library . And you might be here thinking why would you want to do that . You can just keep backups of your photos , after all . But it just is n't the same . You see , with iPhoto , it has all meta data of your photos . Location , Faces , and so on . With all such information , if you just backup your photos and then put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do restoration , it will be a lot of hassles for you to go through the whole thing and build up your whole library . Not only that , many people tend to have more than one library , for different purposes . <p> Backing up iPhoto library is n't as easy as it sounds . Since iPhoto library will be continually growing , the online backup service of choice should have massive storage at affordable rate . And since backing up the whole iPhoto library over and over again will be bandwidth consuming , not to mention time , the provider should be able to perform incremental backup . Restoration should be painless too , without having to do a lot of configurations and whatnot . <p> To be perfectly honest , there is n't a perfect backup solution dedicated for iPhoto yet . But for those of you looking to backup your iPhoto library , here are 5 best backup solutions for iPhoto. <h> 3 <h> 4 <h> 5 <h> Winner ZipCloud From $4.95 Per Month <p> How does never running out of space on your cloud backup sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave you feeling frustrated about how it works , since its well designed and simple ? And finally , for a price that beats almost every other competitor ? If you answered " Yes please " to these questions , you understand why ZipCloud is the number one choice for backing up your photos and memories with them . <p> Unlimited space is available from $6.95 per month , which is one of the lowest prices for cloud backups . Upload speeds ? No problem ! The files are backed up to Amazon Data centers , which means the most secure and reliable servers on the planet right now , and download and upload speeds are great too . Thousands of other websites trust Amazon data centers to keep their data , so you cant go wrong with them . <p> Negatives ? There are n't  that many " power user " features , so the most complex features are missing . Some features cost extra money , but these are all optional , and not that expensive . Also consider that many other services also have hidden costs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any feature a standard user of iPhoto could want is available , from scheduling to bandwidth throttling .

Whether its 2 weeks from now , or 2 years from now , you can claim a refund if you are unhappy . <h> 2 . LiveDrive $6 per month <p> Positives : Simple , Great price , Reliable , Instant backups <p> Negatives : Cheapest package limited to 1 machine <p> LiveDrive has come a long way as a company . They are based in the UK , and have released new versions of their website and software quite a few times . Finally 6 months ago , they dropped their prices . These improvements and price drops have now made them the 4th best backup company for Mac out there . Their basic package is just $6 per month and that 's with unlimited storage . <p> Their more expensive packages support NAS drives , multiple devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $19 per month , which is still a good price ( and with unlimited space of course ! ) <h> 3 . DollyDrive $10 / month <p> DollyDrive is another company who target Mac users specifically , in fact their software only works on Macs . It also automatically includes Time Machine backups , which is a nice touch . Although their basic package is fairly cheap at only $3/month , it hardly has any features or space , most certainly not enough for your photos . At a nice amount of 150GB , you are looking at $10/month which is a lot more than the previous 2 recommendations . <h> 4 . SugarSync from $14.99/mo <p> SugarSync client app has the best user interface among all syncing services in the market . Not only that , when it comes to free space SugarSync offers 5GB for free , and you can get up to 32GB free . SugarSync also offers the widest range of mobile apps for all platforms , including iOS , Android , Blackberry , Windows Mobile and even Symbian . All you have to do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It will be automatically synced . However , additional storage maybe a bit expensive . 100GB will set you back for $14.99 per month , and 250GB will cost you $24.99 per month . Maximum is 500GB at $39.99 per month . If you are a paying customer , every referral will give you 1GB of free storage , without any upper limit . That 's one plus if you are feeling a little jaded about the storage cost . One thing for sure is that you will totally love SugarSync speed and its client user interface . Here is our review for more details . <h> 5 . JungleDisk From $10 per month <p> JungleDisk is pretty unique among all other firms here , since it offers " pay as you go " storage option . You are paying from $2 a month for the software for just backing up , or $3 a month for software with syncing and mounted network drive storage . Both comes with 5GB of free storage at your chosen storage provider Amazon S3 or RackSpace . The cost is $0.125 per GB at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you more for data requests and downloads so to save yourself from headaches , RackSpace might be better choice . For 500GB , you are only paying $75 per month which is really sweet deal . Either way , the upload speed is pretty fast and you can point JungleDisk to backup your iPhoto library ( it will run perfectly on Mac OS X ) . As it does incremental backups , the software will automatically backup only the changes to your iPhoto library so that you do n't  have to wait for uploading your whole iPhoto library over and over again .

In other words can you go back to previous versions of backups ? In terms of iPhoto I 'm not sure this would be necessary unless you want to get back files you deleted a few weeks back . I think Jungledisk would work better for you in that case though , to answer your question ! <p> I do n't  need versioning . Just wondering that , if I had one photo to my iPhoto library , which of these services would only upload that one file to the backup service , rather than having to upload the whole library again ? Otherwise I 'd use up my entire monthly bandwidth cap just on backing up iPhoto once . 
@@26491942 @191942/ <h> GUIDE <h> How to do Social Media Backup " Facebook , Twitter , and More <p> Nowadays we seem to post everything that we do on social media . For some of us it might be selfies , for others it 's just those special moments that we want to remember . Heck , there are even those who document everything that happens from the moment we wake up until we go to bed . <p> When we take these pictures we generally upload them to all of the accounts we have " Facebook , Instagram , Twitter The list never seems to stop growing . Ever wondered what would happen if one of the social media accounts you used suddenly disappeared over night ? Perhaps your account may get accidentally deleted , or your login credentials stolen . What would happen to all of your pictures and memories ? <p> Many people upload their pics to Facebook , Twitter , Instagram or the like and then soon after delete them from their photo stream . Why would n't they do this ? They 're safe right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up all of their servers you never know what might happen . As such , it 's better to be safe than sorry . <p> That 's where we have good news for you . You can back up your social media accounts using various methods . In fact , more and more tools are coming to market that are making it easy for you to do so . Cloud storage providers are beginning to offer a social media back up service , and the networks themselves give you the option to archive your data . <p> In this article we 'll examine the various methods starting with two of the best cloud solutions that we could find , followed by the networks ' own solutions for social media backup . <h> Backup Social Media via Cloud Storage Providers <h> pCloud <p> Based in Switzerland and launched in 2013 , pCloud protects the data of over 4 million customers . It 's an incredibly intuitive service and has plans that start at just $3.99 a month for 500 GB . Its user-friendly browser- and desktop-based software allows you to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Picasa at the touch of a button . <p> Never lose " or risk losing " a memory again . Simply sign up for an account and choose the option Social Backups from the My Uploads menu . <p> Once you choose to backup social media , pCloud provides you with a list of the accounts that they 're able to back up . Afterwards , you only need to click Start to begin the process . From then on , regular updates are carried out automatically and the status of your upload will be shown in the menu . <p> Once your data is backed up it is easy to share it with anyone , anywhere . Currently you can back-up your data from Facebook , Instagram and Picasa. <h> iDrive <p> Usually when you take a photo on your phone it is stored in the photo stream of your device . You might upload it to Instagram and Facebook and then delete it to free up storage , thinking that it 's safely stored on social media servers . This is not always the case , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can backup not only your own social media images , but also those that you are tagged in by friends and family . <p> Other perks of iDrive ? Like the majority of Cloud storage solutions , with iDrive you can upload and backup from one device and then access said files from any other device connected to your account . Moreover , there 's the option to start a free account , but as space is limited to 5 GB you may find yourself needing a paid account . While coming at a cost , a paid account gives you a whopping 1 TB of space , so we think it 's more than worth the price ! <h> Backup Social Media via Social Media Backup Providers <h> Frostbox <p> Frostbox is a Polish social media backup provider founded in 2010 . Once you sign up for the service , you are able to choose to connect to your accounts on Facebook , Twitter , Flickr , Instagram , Foursquare , and more . Once you connect , the backup process will begin immediately its as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will automatically encrypt and back up your data to their servers on a daily basis . The whole process is incredibly secure thanks to their use of Amazon S3 storage for both transit and storage . <p> Frostbox not only backs up social media , but other valuable data as well , including that from Gmail , Evernote , and Tumblr . This makes it a great one-stop solution for all your account backup needs . <h> SocialSafe <p> SocialSafe provides its users with password-protected social media backup software that they can download straight to their desktop . <p> Currently , SocialSafe is able to backup Facebook , Facebook Pages , Instagram , Twitter , LinkedIn , Pinterest , Google+ and Viadeo . Youre permitted to backup from four of your social media channels of choice for free , but after that it will cost $7 per year . <p> Once the initial download is done ( how long that takes will depend on how much data you have on whatever social media account ) , SocialSafe will regularly monitor your accounts and backup any new photos , videos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other Solutions for Social Media Backup <p> Aside from popular cloud storage providers , there are other ways to back up your social media accounts . More often than not , these are one-click solutions that are simple and effective . Take Twitter for example . It may not seem important now , but imagine keeping a journal and looking at it 20 years into the future , reminiscing about the good old days ! Backing up your tweets enables you to preserve your digital diary forever . <p> Do n't rely solely on social media sites to automatically store your data in their company Clouds . If they abruptly went out of business , everything would be gone . As such , you should take matters into your own hands . <h> Backup Twitter <p> It is possible to archive tweets through Twitter itself . They now offer a one-click solution that allows you to back up everything . Simply scroll down to the Content section in the Account tab and request your Twitter archive . Afterwards , click Save . Within 24 hours you 'll receive a link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can download a ZIP file containing your Twitter backup . <p> We personally recommend that you download your Twitter archive regularly , as Twitter will automatically delete your tweets after a certain period of time . By backing up every now and again , you ensure that you 'll never lose a single tweet . <h> Backup Facebook <p> It 's painfully easy to retrieve your data from Facebook . Simply log in and go to General Account Settings . At the bottom ( underneath the general options ) you will see a link to download your Facebook data . Once you have clicked this link you can click Start My Archive . <p> So what does this give you ? Will it just give you your images and videos or can you archive everything ? <p> Well , first of all you get all the personal posts , photos and videos you 've shared , as well as your messages and Facebook Messenger conversations . It even includes all the information from your About section ! <p> Once your archive is complete , Facebook will email you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your computer . We 'd recommend saving it to an account on a Cloud storage service " such as the aforementioned pCloud and iDrive " to make it ultra-secure . <h> Other Forms of Social Media <p> We could go through every single social media account one at a time , but we would be here a while . As such , we 'll just quickly cover the most popular ones . <h> Backup LinkedIn <p> If you want to download your LinkedIn data you can do so in a way that 's similar to Twitter and Facebook . Simply click on Settings , then Account , and then request an archive of your data . Doing so will download a file that you can then save to your computer ( or to a third-party Cloud service provider ! ) <h> Backup Google+ <p> Google also make it simple to download things from not only Google+ , but other Apps as well . You simply select what you want to download and they 'll immediately email you a link . <h> Backup Instagram , Pinterest and Twitter <p> Image-focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where it gets tricky . These platforms require a third-party application to download your archives . That said , Pinterest allows you to download your data to Evernote . <h> Social Media Backup Conclusion <p> Just because the Internet never forgets , does n't mean that the photos , videos , and messages on your various social media accounts are safeguarded forever . Like with all data , you need to take the necessary measures to back them up in order to preserve their contents . As we detailed in this article , you can do so via a third party Cloud storage service , such as pCloud or iDrive , or you can do so directly from the social media sites and Apps themselves . In doing so , you ensure that all of your memories , life events , special images , funny videos , and family treasures are kept safe forever .

Check out our reviews for more detailed information , or head over to their sites to learn more and sign up today ! <p> The option of this working with Time Machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like Apple is getting out of the router business ( no more time capsules , airport extremes , etc iDrive really needs a test drive tool that would allow users to " Try out " the ability of their own modem &amp; wireless speed to confirm if this alternative is viable before dishing out the money . I have 75 mbit xfinity service , but telling me 3TB can be backed up within a week is cluelesshow fast was the service , how fast was the wireless or was the machine hard wired to the router ? I 'm looking at a QNAP replacement that may run $400 but I know it will work and it will be redundant . <p> On the basis of this review I subscribed to iDrive . After running constantly on my ( measured ) 5mpbs uplink it failed to complete even one backup . The status screen shows conflicting information : either 20% or 40% complete , with a constant " retrying " status . Checking the log I can see it has been running for two months ( with a reboot in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a single backup . This is on my server which runs constantly ( lots of services we depend on ) . <p> iDrive support says there are no refunds past 15 days . She was most adamant it was my own fault for not calling back within the first two weeks . I 'm out a years subscription and have relearned an old lesson : caveat emptor ! <p> Net Promoter Score theory suggests this warning may be useful on a couple of levels . <p> We use CrashPlan too but there 's a gap in our backup approach , namely , CrashPlan will not be able to fully support me if the system breaks down , viruses do nasty stuff or if my computer meets to concrete floor . For this I believe TM is the better option , although maybe not the best option . <p> I 'm almost on the verge of doing it like this : on all client work stations , I install Virtual Box or Hyper-V , then I setup a guest VM that people should work from at all times . From the host operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single guest VM file from day to day ( provided that you are ok with frequency ) . This would then allow me to restore the entire system as it was should any major disaster occur . And of course , let CrashPlan run inside the guest VM for easy file restoration . <p> Ideal would of course be one product doing all of this , but havent found any so far . Anyone ? <p> For my client I recommend crashplan , and just disable Time Machine ( TM is a poor knock off of rsync really ) Crash-plan offers revisioned backups just like TM . <p> Anyone who sings TMs praises has never had to deal with its failure . Any worthy backup system uses a normal file system , making recovery possible . Seriously what numskull choose sparse bundles over hard links ? <p> Rsnapshot or syncrify ( if you need a gui ) are so much better then time machine for local backups . Both will also work over ssh , nfs , afs , and cifs . Another major weakness of Time Machine . 
@@26491945 @191945/ <h> GUIDE <h> Backup Plan : Five Ways to Get it Right <p> Everyone who 's serious about not losing valuable data needs a backup plan . This article is here to help you design one . <p> A study from Backblaze- revealed that over 50% of people surveyed said that they knew people who had recently lost electronic data , or had lost some themselves . That 's an awful lot of lost- photos , documents and work files . <p> As an " IT guy , " I can personally concur with these findings , as I 've seen countless clients lose information due to complacency . Hard drive failures are surprisingly common , but nobody expects one to happen to them . However , the statistics prove that it will likely happen to you sooner or later . So , a little time in preparation is time well spent to avoid the stress and heartache of data loss . <p> Online backups are what this website is all about . They are a valuable part of every backup plan , as they ensure you have a copy of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from anything that could physically happen to your computer equipment from a fire or flood to a ( sometimes equally destructive ) spilled cup of coffee . <h> 1 . Decide what you need to back up <p> Personally , I 'm a fan of backing up everything . Most backup systems , online and offline , allow you to select exactly which files and folders to back up , and this has merit in some situations , but its also fraught with potential problems . <p> Say , for example , that you 've selected for backup your photo folders and a couple of documents folders ? This is fine , if you religiously stick to only saving the stuff you need to back up in these locations , but data can hide itself away all over your computers filesystem . There 's also no guarantee that other people using your computer are so disciplined in where they save things . Furthermore , programs like Microsoft Outlook have their own rules on where they save your data . I have produced a guide to backing up Outlook here . <p> Years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give my clients an easy " one click " backup of their selected locations . The problem was that the clients would hardly ever remember to only save important data in those locations . I stopped creating those programs quickly after realizing this . <p> This is why I 'd personally use something like CrashPlan- that gives you the ability to back up everything . Its up to you if youd rather select files and folders individually , and this is , without doubt , better than not backing up at all . However , I 'd rather back up too much than too little . <h> 2 . Work out a 3-2-1 backup- plan <p> Conventional wisdom states that a good backup plan involves having three copies of all your data and this is the essence of a 3-2-1 backup plan . ( BackBlaze do a very good job of describing this backup strategy here ) . <p> Basically , you want the original copy of each file ( usually on your computer ) , a second " local " copy , usually on an external hard drive , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloud . " <p> This is very easy to implement you just need to regularly run backups using a " local " method , such as Apples Time Machine , or the Backup and Restore option within Windows , and also use an online backup provider . <p> Having two backups gives you more options should something go wrong , and acts as a failsafe if one backup method fails . <p> I 'd personally add one additional tip to this " best practice " recommendation , which is to think about where to keep your external hard drive . Many people leave it permanently connected , but its always occurred to me that there 's little point in a backup drive if it can burn in the same fire or be stolen in the same burglary as your computer ! As such , you may wish to consider keeping the external hard drive containing your local backups somewhere apart from your computer at least when you 're away . <h> 3 . Think about encryption <p> Encryption is an important thing to keep in mind regarding backups as you do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to your data . <p> When it comes to online backup , most providers encrypt your data in some way . However , if you 're concerned about data security ( and in this day and age , you should be ) , you 'll want to find out the exact details . For example , try to find out whether encryption happens before your data is sent to your provider , in transit , or when it arrives . All of our detailed backup provider reviews- address this issue . <p> Its also worth giving some thought to encryption on your local backups . <p> If you do n't  encrypt a backup hard drive , the data is easily accessible if it falls into the wrong hands usually literally a case of just plugging the drive in and seeing what 's there . This is obviously potentially disastrous if you hold sensitive data and lose that drive in a cab or during a burglary . <p> Thankfully , both Windows and Mac OS X now make it easy to encrypt backup drives you just need to make sure to turn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another thing I used to say so often that I 'd bore myself and my clients to tears is that " an untested backup is little better than no backup at all . " <p> Its true though ; Its important to familiarize yourself with how to actually restore files if you need them and the time to do this is when you 're relaxed and have some time . The time NOT to do it is when you 've had a hard drive failure and you 're already stressed and behind . <p> You do n't  need to do restore checks obsessively , but just make sure you occasionally check your valuable backups ARE restorable. <h> 5 . Keep checking those logs <p> Modern backup solutions are generally very reliable , but that does n't  mean you should just " set and forget . " <p> Forgive me for once again banging on about my IT consultancy experiences , but Ive lost count of the number of times the previous " IT guy " had set up a backup plan for a customer , but not shown them how to check its running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if nobody checks that the backups are successful , its easy to live in blissful ignorance that everything is fine , only to find the backup stopped working months ago . <p> Its very easy and very quick to check backups are completing successfully you just need to make sure you do it or all your backup plan efforts could be in vain . <p> Written by Ben TaylorBen was a geek long before " geek chic , " learning the ropes on BBC Micros , before moving on to Atari STs and IBM compatibles .

Supposedly around since 1999 ( providing online consulting services ) , they must be one of the oldest backup providers . The cheapest option is $9.95 per month of $99.50 a year . I like the fact that I could find out the price one click away from the homepage , a lot of companies try and conceal this information . 10GB for $9.95 is not that good a price though. - They are currently running a promotional offer , where you actually get 100GB instead of 10GB for the $9.95 .

Their prices are a bit higher than the best options Ive found . You only really get a discount when buying the 3000GB options , which is a bit annoying . I can only imagine a company needing that much space really . <p> One interesting feature they have is that you can set up multiple computers on one account , so if you own a small business you could backup all computers on one iBackup account . <h> Security <p> The servers on which IBackups accounts reside are continuously monitored for any attempted network attacks on a 24 x 7 basis , using sophisticated software tools . They also have high redundancy as they use RAID ( multiple hard disks contain your data multiple times ) .

Renamed and re-branded , it was relaunched as Google Docs to a limited audience in 2007 , and to the general public in 2009 . In 2012 , it officially became known as Google Drive , incorporating not just Docs , but also Sheets and Slides , as well as offering both free and paid online data storage . Today , Google Drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an ever-expanding selection of new Apps and add-ons increasing its functionality and appeal . <h> Backup options <p> Google Drive is a form of Cloud Storage , meaning that its main focus is on file sharing , rather than storing large quantities of files . It also facilitates both the creation of new documents in native Google applications such as Google Docs , Google Sheets and Google Slides , as well as the storage of externally-created files . It also gives users the option to edit existing documents , work collaboratively on group projects , and sync and share their files . Unsurprisingly given Google 's overarching commitment to the maximum integration of all of their services , you can use a single Google Drive account to backup and create files from an unlimited number of devices . <p> Backing up data with Google Drive is just a matter of uploading files or folders to their website , or downloading the Drive client and adding documents to the folder it creates on your desktop . It 's all very easy and intuitive to use , although storage limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full backup of all of your files . <p> There is a way to get around these restrictions , however , as no files created in native Google formats count towards your storage quota . This exemption also extends to videos of under 15 minutes and images of less than 2048 x 2048 pixels that are saved in Google+ Photos , and also to any files created in other programs but converted to Google Drive formats . This- means that if you do n't mind the extra work , you can get a lot of mileage out of a free plan . <p> In theory , this sounds pretty exciting , as Google are effectively offering unlimited storage space for free . However , if you do n't have the time or patience to transfer everything over to a new format , or if you have any qualms about Google 's monopolization of the internet , it might not be quite as good a deal as it sounds . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> Google Drive can be used with Windows and Mac operating systems , or mounted to a Linux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present . Drive is also automatically integrated into Chromebooks , and mobile users can access it from both iOS and Android devices . <h> File sharing options <p> Sharing files is easy with Drive " all you need to do is open the document from your online account , then choose to either share it directly by entering an email address , or generate a- link to post or send anywhere you like . Both options give you a choice of three permissions read only , comment only , or full editing . If you choose to give your- recipients free rein over shared files , theyll be able to edit them in real time , and see all changes as they are made . <h> File versioning <p> The versioning history of files saved in proprietary Google formats is unlimited when using Drive " meaning that you can access previous drafts of your documents even after they have been replaced with more up-to-date versions . Non-Google files are subject to more restrictions " a maximum of 200 versions can be kept for 30 days , although the default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any files or folders that you remove from Google Drive will be transferred to a recycle bin much like the one on your desktop . There 's no time limit on how long they can stay there " just delete them permanently when you 're confident that it 's time for them to go . <h> Backup from Gmail <p> Google Drive users can also save attachments directly from Gmail , simply by hovering over the emails them and selecting the Drive logo . A useful bit of integration , this is great if you 're using Drive for work , as it saves you the bother of downloading , saving and then re-uploading any email attachments that you want to backup . <h> Create new content <p> As previously mentioned , Google Drive is not just a Cloud storage provider , but also a place to create new documents online that can be instantly accessed from any device with an internet connection . You can also access Google Drive files offline , but we 'll get back to that a little later . <p> Many people are familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Microsoft Word to create text documents , but there are other versions of familiar programs available too . <p> Google Slides is used for presentations , much like PowerPoint , while Google Sheets replicates Excel . Each program allows you to select from a range of templates , and contains most of the formatting tools that Microsoft Office users will be familiar with . <p> In addition to these Google-created takes on Office software , there are also plenty of add-ons that you can use to enhance your experience , from speech recognition to image editing tools . <p> Finally , there are Google Drawings for creating new images , and Google Forms , which helps users to create surveys , forms and schedules , the results of which can be represented in tables and diagrams , or exported to Google Sheets . <h> Real-time editing <p> To our minds at BestBackups , one of the best features of Google Drive is the capacity for multiple users to work on the same document at the same time . Whether you 're operating in Docs , Sheets or Slides , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be instantly viewed by everyone else currently working on the document . Unfortunately , this can slow things down a bit if you 've got lots of people concentrated on one file , but it 's an excellent tool for working collaboratively . <p> The days of losing hard work to a computer crash because you did n't save frequently enough are over , too " Drive saves changes automatically while you 're working , and allows you to access previous versions should you want to retrieve information that 's since been rewritten . <h> Offline editing <p> You can choose to access your files offline by installing the Google Drive app in the Chrome browser or from mobile devices running Android and iOS . This will allow you to view and edit your documents offline without losing your progress . On a PC , you can do this directly from Chrome itself , or by choosing Settings in Google Drive . Only files created in native Google Drive formats can be accessed offline , with the exception of Google Forms , which are available online only . Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files , can only be viewed when you 're connected to the internet . <h> Security <p> Finding out the particulars of Google Drive 's security is no mean feat " the security page on their website is short on useful information , and privacy does n't get a particularly prominent mention in their customer support resources either . After some digging around , however , we did manage to find a few answers hidden in their support forums . <p> So , just how secure is Google Drive ? Simply put , not very . Your files are encrypted with SSL while they 're being transferred between your computer and the Drive servers , but that 's about it . In storage , they 're completely unencrypted , meaning that they could theoretically be read by anyone and , by not encrypting them first on your computer , Google can find out anything they want to about the data you 're choosing to backup . <p> On the plus side , there 's no problem with uploading files that have been encrypted in advance , if you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also opt to use 2-factor authentication , which requires you to confirm your identity by phone or text message as well as by password when you sign in . <p> All things considered , Drive might not be the best choice if you 're looking for a program with high-level security features built in , or if you 're uncomfortable with sharing so much of your personal information with Google , although plenty feel that its other features make up for these shortcomings . <h> Customer- Support <p> One notable problem with Google Drive 's customer support is that it 's extremely difficult to submit an enquiry that does n't fit into one of their predetermined categories . <p> The Google Drive Help Center is fine , covering basic introductory topics such as how to edit files offline and how to retrieve deleted documents , providing simple video tutorials that give clear step-by-step explanations . Similarly , a good range of subjects are covered in the forums , with a search function helping you to sift through all of the queries . <p> It 's when you start trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're given a selection of topics to choose from , with your choice leading to the generation of a specific email enquiry form , live chat or phone call . <p> Once you 've reached this point , there 's not much room to customize your question , and there 's no Other ' option that gives you a blank canvas . While it is possible to enter whatever additional information you like here , leading questions lead to the vaguely uncomfortable feeling that you are being pushed to only contact them about a specific set of topics . <p> This system is undeniably useful for troubleshooting , as it means that their customer support team will know exactly what you need help with as soon as your request goes through , but if you 're looking for more general information , it can be frustratingly limited . <p> On the plus side , phone support is available 24/7 , although the live chat is limited to US working hours . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> We submitted a support ticket requesting more information on Drive features , but at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have yet to receive a reply . Their phone service was much more impressive however , with a call back in less than half an hour , and staff operating the live chat were able to answer our questions quickly and with plenty of useful information " although we had to wait several hours before our office was in sync with US opening hours . <h> Blogs and Social Networks <p> Google Drive maintains a blog that features detailed posts every few months , showcasing new features and offering company updates . Similar content is posted on their Facebook page , while Twitter is much more active , with over a million followers and regularly tweeted updates ; although there 's very little by way of troubleshooting assistance on offer . <h> - The Process 75367 @qwx275367 <p> Setting yourself up with Google Drive is very easy , especially for anyone that already has a Google account , as you can use your existing login details . You can store documents exclusively using the Google Drive website , or download the desktop client , which creates a folder on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to backup . All files added to this folder are automatically backed up and synced to your Drive account . <h> Using Google Drive <p> As you would expect from Google , Drive 's interface is simple and user-friendly , with familiar features that are easy to navigate . Backing up files is just a matter of uploading them to the Drive website or adding them to your Drive folder , and restoring only requires a click . If you download a folder , its contents will be zipped to speed things up , so you 'll need to extract the files before you can open them on your computer . Do n't  worry , though this is an easy process , and zipping has the advantage of making downloads significantly quicker than average backup transfer speeds . <h> Using the mobile app <p> The Google Drive mobile app let 's you view and download stored and shared files , as well as backing up images and audio files directly from your mobile device . If you want to create a new document , all of the features of Google Docs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to download their designated applications to get started . <p> From there , you can also create new content , edit and share existing documents , and make use of mobile extras such as the Research tool , which allows you to copy text and images directly from a Google search without ever leaving the file you 're working on . While this might not sound like much , it comes in very handy on mobile devices that make heavy work of switching between different processes . <p> - Google Drive Review Conclusion <h> I liked <p> Excellent for creating content online <p> Real-time editing that 's great for collaboration <p> Loads of storage space potentially available <h> I was n't so sure about <p> Much less versatile for files created in non-Google formats <p> Limited storage space for externally created files <p> Poor customer service <h> I hated <p> Data encrypted during transfer only <p> Google Drive is something of a different beast to most online backup and storage providers , as its focus is as much on having a place to create new documents as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Google Docs , Sheets , Slides and more allowing users to create files in various formats , you get plenty of flexibility " although some people may have concerns about buying into Google 's growing monopolisation of the internet . In addition to this , security measures are pretty thin on the ground , but ease of access and usability are second to none , and the provisions made for collaborative working are excellent . <p> On the whole then , Google Drive is an extremely convenient option for file sharing and new document creation , although it 's unlikely to hold much appeal for people looking to backup large quantities of files and keep them as safe as possible .

This will often include family photos , private documents , and , if you run a business , commercially sensitive information . <p> Our detailed online backup reviews- are your perfect starting point in finding a backup provider you can trust . You need to feel that your data is safe because the whole point of using online backup is to have something to fall back on should the worst happen . <h> But what about zero knowledge backups ? <p> Zero knowledge backups are what you need if total data privacy is your priority . <p> Despite the use of encryption , many backup providers could still , in theory , access your data and see what 's there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member could have a nose about at what you 're storing in the cloud . <p> True zero knowledge backups eliminate the chance of this happening . In this zero knowledge scenario , even the online backup companys own technical staff could n't access your data if they wanted to . <p> This is achieved by using true end-to-end encryption . Your data is encrypted before its even uploaded to your providers servers . Once there , the company does n't  have your encryption keys or passwords , so could n't access your data even if it chose to . ( Of course a small disadvantage to this approach is that if you lose or foget those credentials , there 's nothing the provider can do to help ! ) <h> Why would I NEED zero knowledge backups ? <p> You may be inclined to wonder why any of this should matter to you if you do n't  have anything amongst your data that you really feel you need to hide ? If you 're of this " nothing to hide , nothing to fear " school of thought , you may wish to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sister site , BestVPN.com . <p> Zero knowledge backups are n't  just for people who are backing up data they 're worried about possessing torrented movie files or other pirated content , for example .

For example : <p> If you are in business , you may hold client or customer information , and have compliance obligations to ensure this data is encrypted as much as possible . <p> The chances are there are at least some sensitive personal details amongst your document files why take the risk of exposing them ? <p> If you 're worried about your data being intercepted in transit ( for example if files upload while you 're connected to a public wireless hotspot ) , it makes good sense to ensure they 're encrypted before your data even begins to make its way to your backup provider . <p> Of course , there- are- people out there who will want to choose- zero knowledge cloud storage or backup specifically because they 're holding files that they may have obtained illegally. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities if it was asked to . However , the point I 'm making is that using this kind of backup does make sense for everyone else too . <h> Where to find zero knowledge backup ? <p> Our top recommendation for a true zero-knowledge service is SpiderOak .

Their software does not have all the features a power user could want . You can sign up now . <p> Founded in 2012 , MiMedia is an angel investment funded online backup service . They seem to have a lot of experienced business people running the company , so I hope that means they pay a lot of attention to the customer ! They do have quite a few decent blog posts , so they are definitely paying attention to the business . <p> Their prices are good , about average , however you can get 7GB for free which is a good amount , and more than almost anyone else offers ! Their software is only 3MB , which I was really impressed with as most software is 20-30MB . <h> Pricing Plans <p> Pricing plans are initially broken down into two categories , free ( 7GB ) or paid ( 100GB ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more .

Their customer service reps replied to a query within 24 hours , which is an acceptable time frame . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> I like their website design , it is easy to find everything and definitely looks like it is from the Web 2.0 generation . I also like how you can find out their pricing structure within 2-3 clicks of the homepage , a lot of companies hide their pricing from the front page . <p> There is a small signup form to fill out , pretty simple . <p> Once that is filled out , the download of the software starts straight away , which is only 3MB , Im amazed by how small their software is . Unfortunately once downloaded you need to login again . <p> Despite their website being nicely designed , Ive seen better designed software before , I did n't  think MiMedia software was that nice to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first of all selecting what folders you want to back up .

The website is very nice , but the software is n't that great , and does n't  have a lot of advanced features that people might want to use .

Mac users expect high quality , and ZipCloud delivers . The price is one of the best in the industry , and you can get unlimited space if you need it . <p> Zipcloud are so confident about their product , they offers a anytime moneyback guarantee . This means that you can get a refund any time , even a year from now . There is no risk ! <p> Your data is backed up to Amazon S3 , which is the same place where Netflix and Reddit are hosted . If they trust their data with Amazon , do you think you can too ? <p> " ZipCloud makes light work of backing up , sharing and retrieving your files either automatically or manually . The promise of unlimited data back-up , at a reasonable price , is also appealing , one that should ensure all your important files are safe from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 million files on their network , ZipCloud is a cloud storage company from UK which heavily promotes simplicity of its services and software . Data is stored at Amazon S3 ( huge data center provided by Amazon ) , and utilizes pretty sophisticated grid infrastructure to handle the data . They currently offer 3 Personal plans , 3 Business plans and 3 Reseller plans . The free trial offers 2 weeks of storage , and they also offer an " Anytime " moneyback guarantee . So there is pretty minimal risk when you sign up . Signing up is as easy as 1 2 3 since they literally do n't  ask for anything more than your name , email , and password . Their Unlimited storage plan is worth the price , and have we talked enough about the simplicity of their software ? <p> One thing you need to be aware of , a lot of features on ZipCloud cost an extra fee . In other words they do a lot of " upselling " . However , since their basic price is very low , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will get a good deal compared to other services . <p> If you commit to Zipcloud for 1 or 2 years , then you get a discount of monthly rates , this is worth thinking about since most users will use an online backup service for a long time , so locking in a good price for the future makes sense . <p> For Business accounts , you have to signup by entering your name , email and password in order to reach the pricing plan where you have to choose one <p> The business account pushes 1 year upfront payment for each plan , with 35% discount across all accounts . <p> 100GB Plan " $9.60/month if you pay for one year upfront . $12.79/month if you opt for monthly plan .

It seems if you want additional storage , 500GB plan gets the most expensive one at $0.08 per GB , while 2TB plan gets $0.06 per GB . We still do n't  understand why they wo n't make it a flat rate , apart from subtly pushing the customers to sign up for 2TB plan . For each user ( your customers ) you sign up , you will have to pay $0.99/year flat fee . There is also a $0.50 per additional service fee as well , but we can not find out what those services are . You can use their Reseller control panel demo to get a feel of what you will get . <p> As this is a white label reseller service , you can rebrand everything to your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customized plans with own pricing as well as same plans from Zipcloud . Zipcloud will not be mentioned anywhere , and you are basically going to look like you are running everything on your own . <h> Features <p> Zipclouds main selling point is its simplicity . It is so simple that we fear it might be a double-edge sword , making it its advantage as well as its downfall . Advanced features you usually see in other online cloud backup services like Carbonite , Mozy and SugarSync wont be here , but you wont be disappointed unless you are a huge geek and power user of backups . All " standard " features are there . <p> Unlimited multiple devices syncing ( just like Dropbox ) . You get 1GB free syncing storage for paid accounts . However , you can upgrade up to 20GB at an additional cost <p> Yes , the features are quite simple . But like we already stated numerous times before , the main selling point is in " downright simplicity " , not " boatloads of feature you may not care about " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly Mac users , since Mac users do appreciate simplicity and things " just working " . After all , that is what Steve Jobs tried to do with every Apple device . So ZipCloud is catering to these users , who do n't  want to " hack " their online backup software with lots of random features . <p> Reseller accounts get features for rebranding , plan customization options , account monitoring and usage statistics , online invoicing and billing , and so on . It seems that there is a Linux software for Zipcloud that is being developed , but is not ready yet . <h> Security <p> Zipcloud uses Amazon S3 for their data storage , and utilizes their own sophisticated grid infrastructure for handling storage requests . 256-bit encryption is used for all transmission and backups , and given that data will be stored on Amazon S3 , we feel that its more or less secured , relatively speaking to other contenders in this space . Half the internet is currently hosted on Amazon Data centers , so they are reliable and secure . <h> Customer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they do not offer phone support . Maybe this is to do with the simplicity motto , or they just do n't  want to be bombarded with calls . They responded to our email query within a few hours , so they are quick to help customers , but only in writing . <p> They do have video tutorials and a huge knowledgebase with questions , so most queries can actually be answered just by searching through their tutorials. 75370 @qwx275370 <p> After you sign up to Zipcloud using your email , name and password , it will bring you to Dashboard as well as immediately prompting you to download the software , which is only about 500Kb or so . The dashboard is where you control and monitor your account activities , as well as purchase additional storage or upgrade your account plan . <p> Installation of the software is a breeze , its quick and non-resource intensive . When you first run it , it will ask for your account logins , and afterwards , you will see Setup Wizard . <p> You can either just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection , where you can filter the file types , and even filter files based on file sizes . This let 's you exclude unnecessary files hogging your bandwidth , like films , while letting you back up documents if they are all in the same folder . <p> There is a nice visual bar showing how your backups are going . <p> You can also browse your backed up files via Zipcloud file browser as well . It works a lot like Windows Explorer so you will be in familiar environment , except that it works online . Which is great since you can access your files anywhere where there is an internet connection . <p> Zipcloud sync feature works much like Dropbox , with a dedicated sync folder . You just put files into that folder , and it will sync across all other computers and mobiles that you logged in using same Zipcloud account . You get 1GB free sync space with every paid account but you can upgrade up to 20GB . <p> Once you 've been using ZipCloud for a while , they will prompt you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also some other features that they will ask you whether you want to buy . It is up to you whether you decide to buy these , they are worth the price . As we said before , due to their good starting price , with unlimited storage , ZipCloud still offers a good deal even with these upgrades . <h> Conclusion <p> Zipcloud is another cloud service company that adopts " dead simple that even your great grandfather can use " philosophy . The setup is easy and simple . Backing up is a breeze . Yes , it lacks a lot of advanced features that many power users will yearn for . But then , if you are a power user , you will not be looking at Zipcloud for sure ( but perhaps you would be running linux not OSX ) . So if what you want is a simple cloud backup that just works without tweaking , affordable and offers unlimited storage , Zipcloud is for you . Otherwise , you have to look elsewhere . 75371 @qwx275371 <h> 8 responses to " Zipcloud Review " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel my account , due to loss of service , due to technical problems that their tech support was UNABLE to resolve , and due to them LOSING 2- years-worth of my files " they went ahead and charged my credit card IMMEDIATELY , ON THE SAME DAY I CANCELLED , instead of waiting till my February renewal date . <p> When my CC bank contacted them they said no refund would be issued since " he cancelled in less than the 30 days mentioned in the contract .

Deleting apparent copies of the folders made all of the files in all folders disappear ! So far , customer service has been completely unhelpful . In addition , each time I delete a file manually , I get a message asking if I want to upgrade , and selecting " Please do n't  ask again " has no effect .

I have no way to talk to anyone in person as they have no call center and they have so far only sent me generic emails . A very unethical company . I wish I had known sooner ! ! If 800 GB in todays day and age is too much to back up then this company has some serious issues .

File size restrictions and a lack of private key encryption are obvious downsides , but some good features and an appealing interface continue to make it a valid competitor in the personal backup market. - You can read a detailed review below or sign up now . 75368 @qwx275368 <p> Box offers two personal subscriptions ; Free and Pro . Free users will receive 10GB of storage , while a Pro account entitles you to 100GB for G8 ( approximately $9* ) per month . <p> While Box 's personal plans are developed in their own right , the company 's primary focus is on Business users . Over 90% of Fortune 500 companies currently use their backup software and an extensive range of business features are available . <p> For just G4 ( approximately $4.50 ) per user per month , organizations can subscribe to the Starter plan , which covers up to ten users with 100GB of storage space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more space may prefer to opt for the Business subscription , which offers unlimited storage space , a 5GB maximum file size and additional security features for- 12 EURO ( $13.50 ) per user per month . A third option is also available for business users , called the- Enterprise plan . This offers access to yet more features , and is custom made and priced to suit individual needs. - <p> Whichever plan best meets your needs , you can pay by Visa , Mastercard , American Express , and Discover cards . <p> *Prices are calculated based on the exchange rate at the time of writing . <h> Features <h> About Box <p> Box was founded in 2005 by current CEO Aaron Levie and CFO Dylan Smith , while they were still at college . From humble beginnings , the California-based company has grown considerably and now serves more than 39 million customers , receiving multiple awards including the 2009 Silicon Valley Emerging Tech award for cloud computing . <p> Today , their development is primarily focused on products for the Business market , with over 50,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the position of CSO was taken by Jeetu Patel , the former CEO of fellow online storage company Syncplicity . <h> Backup options <p> There 's no option to run automated or scheduled backups with Box , making it much better suited to users looking to manually select a smaller number of files and folders to store . <p> Otherwise , however , its a pretty flexible program to use ; - you can backup data from an unlimited number of devices , and both the desktop client and website are easy to use . It does have one major disadvantage , however , as while there are very few restrictions placed on the type of files that you can backup to the Cloud , there are significant limitations on their size . Free subscribers can only upload documents of up to 250MB , while Pro users have a maximum limit of 5GB . This comes as something of a disappointment given that so many other providers allow uploads of any size , and is likely to limit Box 's suitability for many users . <h> Cross-platform compatibility <p> Box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Android , Blackberry , iOS and Windows Phone- operating systems . <h> File sharing options <p> Box facilitates file sharing in several ways . You can allow people ( both Box users and non-users ) to view individual folders or whole files by generating a link , or invite other subscribers to edit , upload or delete documents by joining a shared folder . <p> Given Box 's focus on business users , it 's not surprising that their sharing features have clearly been designed with teams and offices in mind . Their file sharing system encourages collaborative working , with shared folders easily accessible to all members , and the option for anyone to add or remove files . There is also the ability to leave comments and feedback on documents , to tag colleagues in order to notify them of relevant information , and to create new documents from scratch " making it easy for multiple users to work on a single piece of work at the same time . <p> In addition to this , Box allows users to assign tasks to specific team members , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calendar . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> File versioning is a feature that allows users to retrieve older drafts of their documents , and is an excellent way to find information that has been lost or deleted . While the majority of backup providers offer versioning services , they differ in how they are constrained ; - with some limiting the number of versions that can be saved and others capping how long they can be saved for . <p> Box allows its users to access and download the last 100 versions of their documents , which is a reasonably good deal . While its outshone by providers who offer unlimited versioning , it is generous enough to be of practical use . Versioning is only available for users of Box Edit , which has to be downloaded independently , although documents created using Box Notes also have a version history . <p> As well as versioning , Box also allows you to recover files that have been deleted from your hard drive for up to 30 days after their removal . <h> Speed <p> I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to give you as much information as possible about what it 's like to backup using their software . The speed tests were carried out by first uploading five individual files to Box storage space and timing manually how long it took for them to transfer . Next , I divided the number of MB in each file by the time it took in seconds . From there , I simply converted this number into Mbps to get the results . Exactly the same process was then applied to five downloads , and the results were added to the graph that you can see below . <p> Box 's upload speeds were n't particularly impressive , averaging just 1.7 Mbps " less than the 2 " 3 Mbps typical of most other providers . A 100MB file took around six and a half minutes to upload , which could make backing up large quantities of data a rather slow process . <p> When it came to restoring files , a notification popped up to say that the process may be a little slow . Ironically , these speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an average of 3.4 Mbps . This result- is still at the lower end of the spectrum , but taking between three and four minutes to download a 100MB file is relatively common- for backup providers . <p> I include speed test data in my reviews because it 's such an important factor when it comes to backing up your files . However , please do bear in mind that speeds can vary considerably based on external factors such as the strength of your broadband , so these figures should be taken as a guide only . <h> Box Sync <p> Box Sync is a downloadable program that installs a Box folder on your desktop . By dragging or copying files into the folder , they will be automatically uploaded to the Cloud , and all changes made from you desktop will be automatically synced with its online counterpart . This means that the most up-to-date versions of all of your documents can be accessed from anywhere at any time . <h> Box Edit <p> For those wanting to create and edit documents online with Box , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to open stored files with their native apps , then save edits directly back to the Cloud . This allows Box to effectively function as a virtual hard drive ; a place where you can not only save your files but also create and edit them . <h> Box Notes <p> Box Notes is a word-processor-style interface that subscribers can use to create documents directly from the Box website . Somewhat similar to Google Docs , other users can make edits and add comments to Note content , and formatting tools are available . There is also the option to generate a link in order to share notes externally . While Box Notes currently functions well as a collaborative tool , it seems strange that this feature is so limited . Box markets the feature primarily as a note taking device rather than a full-on word processor , but it seems that this could easily be extended . Given that it 's a fairly new feature , however , it 's possible that such developments will be seen in the not-too-distant future . <h> File embedding <p> If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website , or wiki , Box allows you to embed them directly into your chosen page . Once again , there are no limits on the type of files you can embed , so you 're free to add anything from text , music and images to PDFs , slideshows , and even videos ( although your accounts file size limitations still apply ) . <p> If you want to limit how much other users can do with your files , then you also have the option to determine whether or people can share , download and print them . <h> Business and Enterprise features <p> Although I do n't typically discuss business plans in reviews , as so much of Box 's high-quality content is featured in their Business and Enterprise plans , I thought it was worth giving it a mention . The main advantages are related to security , with Enterprise Key Management allowing organizations to manage their own encryption keys ( see more on this below ) . Access to other integrated software is also available , along with greater control over permissions and account management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the flexibility to change file size limits if required . <h> Security <p> All data backed up using Box gets the benefit of 256-bit AES encryption , and is transferred using high-quality TLS . As Box 's encryption is end-to-end , your data will be protected at all times , including during all sync and share processes . <p> Unfortunately , Box does not currently offer personal users the option to set their own private encryption keys , which is the best way to ensure that no-one else can access your data but you . Enterprise users have more luck in this respect , as Box recently announced the Enterprise Key Management ( EKM ) feature , which is designed to allow companies to manage their own private encryption keys . The idea here is to make data NSA-proof ' " aka. impossible to access by anyone who does not possess the key , whether they are poking around in your files legally or not . Business security measures also incorporate- other features , including the ability to turn Cloud provider access to company data on and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their clients . <p> EKM is still patent-pending , and there is currently no personal version available . This is disappointing as private key encryption is an essential part of maintaining your data privacy online , but I- hope that with the advent of EKM , a personal option will be made available before too long . <h> Customer- Support <p> Box 's customer service options are extensive , if a little overcomplicated . In addition to a standard support ticket system , subscribers are also able to log into Box Community , which contains regularly updated forums and profiles of all of their support staff . Here , you can view their activity and feedback rating , read their responses to previous queries , and add them as a friend or send personal messages . <p> This system does admittedly give off an air of trying a little too hard ( does customer service really require a mini-Facebook framework to be effective ? ) , but it 's nice to feel that you can make an independent choice of who to contact . Customer service in general is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by making their staff details available to all members , Box does go some way towards overcoming these criticisms . <p> In addition to contacting staff directly , you can always turn to Box 's Knowledge Base for information and troubleshooting advice . Both videos and articles are available on an impressive range of topics , and information is all clear and detailed . 75369 @qwx275369 <p> I sent a couple of support requests Box 's way and were pleased with their replies . Every issue was resolved in between four and eight hours , and information was helpful and detailed . I had some trouble explaining my inquiry on one occasion , but a few emails back and forth resolved the confusion , and I got a satisfying result in the end . While this did cause a bit of a delay , I appreciated them making the effort to send a useful reply . You can also select the severity of your problem when you submit an inquiry , so that more serious problems can be prioritized , and those in more urgent need of a reply receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Box runs a Facebook page , blog and Twitter account , all of which feature regular updates on company and industry news . Their Twitter boasts more than 68,000 followers , and a Box Support account is also on offer , providing updates and guidance on technical issues as well as answering user queries. - <h> BoxWorks <p> BoxWorks is an annual conference hosted by Box , featuring talks and discussions by representatives of industries as diverse as IT services , movies and healthcare . Discussion is based around the ways in which technology will shape the future , and contributions are invited from across the board . Representatives of IBM , Apple , and Pixar all made keynote addresses in 2015 , and appearances were also made by public figures including actor Jared Leto . Tickets are available to the public , and the majority of events are filmed and available to view on Box 's YouTube channel . <h> - The Process 75367 @qwx275367 <p> As many of Box 's features can be used from their website alone , getting set up is just a matter of registering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free subscription , and those opting for a paid plan only need to hand over their address and card details in addition to this . Registering online grants you immediate access to all website-based services , including uploading and retrieving files , creating folders , using Box notes , and changing your settings . You 'll also get a handy introduction on your first use to help you along the way . <p> If you want to upload files from your desktop , you 'll need to install Box Sync . As well as simplifying the backup process , this also allows you to upload or download folders ; a useful feature given that only files can be transferred from the website . There is also the option to install Box Edit , which does n't have its own interface , but facilitates the editing of Box files in their native applications . <h> Using Box <p> When performing basic tasks like backing up and retrieving files , Box is very user-friendly and simple to use . The web interface is attractive and intuitive , and Box Sync acts just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more trouble when I wanted to use their extra features , particularly Box Edit , as their website lacks clear instructions for use , and descriptions of the program are mostly vague. - <h> Using the mobile app <p> The Box mobile app is very versatile , as well as being- easy to navigate and use , with a tutorial available when you first get started to point you in the right direction. - As well as viewing your stored files , you can also create sharing links , open files with other apps and leave comments on both documents and Notes . In addition to this , files located on your mobile device can be uploaded directly to the Cloud , and new Notes can be created. - <p> - Box Review Conclusion <h> I- liked <p> Great features and flexibility for business users <p> Extensive sharing options , ideal for working collaboratively <p> Good customer service options available <p> Ability to create and edit files directly from Box using Box Note and Box Edit <h> I was n't so sure about <p> Some unclear information on features such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No option for personal users to set private key encryption <p> As a service for companies looking to backup their data , Box is an excellent choice . Business and Enterprise plans offer a broad range of features , comprehensive security measures and the flexibility to tailor subscriptions to individual needs . Unfortunately , personal users do n't get to enjoy all of these advantages , with significant limitations placed on storage space and upload sizes , and no private key encryption currently available . <p> Having said this , when it comes to simple functionality , Box performs well " the interface is appealing , it 's easy to use , and customer service options are excellent . <p> On the whole , Box is a decent option for personal subscribers , and a stand out for businesses . While those hoping to- store large files or implement the very best in security measures may wish to look elsewhere , interesting features and impressive customer service will appeal to many users . 
@@26491962 @191962/ <h> GUIDE <h> The Rough Guide to Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) <h> What is NAS ? <p> NAS , or Network Attached Storage , is a way of storing files from multiple devices in a local network by attaching an external hard drive to the network itself , rather than plugging it directly into your computer . As well as giving you plenty of storage space to play with , you can also add and share files from multiple devices within your network - for example , giving all of the people in an office access to a centralised selection of files . <p> Primarily used by small businesses and individuals with lots of data and/or multiple computers , network attached storage devices are a very useful accompaniment to internet-based data storage , although you 'll need a little tech know-how to get the most out of them . If you 're already confident in your network knowledge and want to save some cash , you can also try your hand at making your own - either by using a router and an external hard drive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once you 've got your data safely onto your NAS , it 's worth considering backing everything up to the cloud with one of these backup providers for NAS. - 75367 @qwx275367 <p> NAS can be a bit of a challenge for the uninitiated , but do n't let that put you off - many pre-packaged network attached storage devices come complete with downloadable apps that help you to navigate a whole range of different processes with the minimum of hassle . Alternatively , if you 're taking the DIY route , we 've put together some useful info to help you along the way . <p> If you 're stuck on any of the terminology , our Glossary should point you in the right direction , and for more general backup info , you can also check out our Ultimate Online Backup Guide . <h> Understanding NAS devices <p> Network attached storage can take several different forms , from pre-made boxes that just need to be plugged in , to DIY efforts using Raspberry PI or repurposed hardware . What they all have in common , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard disk ) , and the ability to connect to or incorporate a wireless router. <h> 3 types of- network attached storage <h> 1 . Commercial NAS servers <p> Pre-made NAS servers are designed to make things as simple as possible , with a wide range of apps available to download for tasks as diverse as backing up your files to the Cloud , playing music , and managing a home surveillance system . Commercial NAS devices for home users usually contain between one and six disk drives , and cost upwards of a few hundred dollars ; although models for business use can have upwards of 20 disk drives , and prices can reach the thousands . <p> Although using a commercial box is undeniably the easiest way to setup your network attached storage , you 'll still need a bit of know-how to get set up , as choosing redundancy settings , managing user access and so on can be a bit of a stretch for technical novices . Fortunately , walkthroughs are provided by most manufacturers and app providers , so there 's plenty of guidance out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 2 . Router + external hard drive <p> If you 'd like to save some money and do n't mind getting a little hands on , then a simple way to create your own NAS is to purchase an external hard drive and a router with a USB port - and put the two together . While this part is easy enough , you 'll also need to use DD-WRT firmware and a- compatible router to perform more complex functions . Once again , this might seem intimidating to newcomers , but can be mastered with a little time and effort . <p> Creating your own NAS this way has the benefit of being much cheaper than buying a pre-made device , as well as not requiring you to make any changes to hardware or start completely from scratch . It does have its limitations - most notably that , unless you have a router with multiple USB ports or an external drive that can be divided into multiple storage units , you wo n't get any of the redundancy measures usually associated with network attached storage . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own network attached storage for a fraction of the price . <p> It 's also possible to buy WiFi routers with integrated storage space , which are good for casual use , if not so suitable for advanced processes . Asus , D-Link , and Linksys all produce routers with basic network storage , as do several other manufacturers . <h> 3 . Full DIY NAS <p> If you 're handy with hardware , it 's also possible to create a network attached storage device from scratch , using your own supply of repurposed materials - typically taken from an old PC . Home server software such as Amahi and- FreeNAS can then help you to transform old hardware into not just a NAS device , but also a home VPN , file server , media streamer , and more . What 's more , you can get hold of an old computer for next to nothing ( or possibly find one in the back of your garage ) , saving you the expenditure associated with commercial devices . <p> - <h> So why use NAS ? <p> NAS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of benefits : <p> - <h> 1 . Keep everything in one place <p> Network attached storage devices let you store files from any number of computers , tablets and phones - so long as they 're all part of your local area network . This means that , if you 're working from multiple devices at home or want to create storage space that can be shared by all of the people in your office , then you wo n't have to bother creating multiple individual backups - something that can get very complicated very quickly . Instead there 's one central location that everyone can go to to backup and retrieve files . <p> - <h> 2 . Keep your data secure in your own home <p> Handing your files over to a Cloud storage provider is n't without security risks , although lots of providers take precautions like using Zero Knowledge policies to keep your data as safe as possible . <p> However , if you prefer not to make your files visible to a backup company , then NAS offers a great solution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own house - helping you to keep an eye on your files without losing benefits like big storage allowances , file sharing , and remote access that are usually associated with online backups . <p> - <h> 3 . Protect your business data <p> Although network attached storage is a great way to keep your data safe at home , it 's an excellent resource for small businesses , too . Of course , backing up an office worth of data is going to require more storage space , more complex software and a little more processing power than managing a home setup , but commercial NAS manufacturers like QNAP , - Synology and Netgear all have plenty of business-friendly options available . <p> It 's not just laptops that can be hit by hard drive failure either - using a standard external drive is still a risky business , as they can crash too . Luckily , network attached storage- devices offer a way to protect against both of these threats by creating redundant copies of your stored data - effectively backups of your backups - that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if one fails , another can spring into action and keep your files safe and accessible . <p> Check out the Security section of our Ultimate Online Backup Guide for more info on data redundancy and other methods used to keep your files secure online . <p> - <h> 5 . Access your files from anywhere <p> Although NAS is , by its very nature , designed to be accessed within a single LAN , it 's also possible to view and edit your NAS files remotely . Most commercial models will have an app for that or , if you 're going for the build your own ' approach , there are some fairly simple steps you can follow to enable FTP transfers , after which you can manage the movement of your files downloading software such as FileZilla or rsync . <p> - <h> 6 . Make use of loads of extra features <p> Commercial NAS devices are pretty versatile , offering considerably more than just basic file storage and sharing functions . If you do n't mind putting in a little time and effort , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manage local video surveillance , as well as setting them up as web hosting devices and mail servers . If you want to backup photos , you 'll even find features for editing , organising and sharing pictures , and direct camera uploads , and there 's also the option to encrypt your files both during storage ( at hardware or folder level ) and transfer using SSL . <p> Home-made NAS devices can do a fair bit too , although it 'll require more work on your part - take a look at our guides to Setting Up a DIY NAS Using DD-WRT and Building Your Own DIY NAS from an Old PC for more info ! <p> - <p> - <h> 7 . Build your 3-2-1 backup plan <p> NAS is commonly included in 3-2-1 backup plans - an approach to storing data that involves keeping copies of your files in three different locations - one copy online , one on an external storage device , and one on ( you 've guessed it ) a NAS device . <p> The 3-2-1 approach to backups is great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - your external drive crashes or gets damaged ? Lose your internet connection and want to retrieve your files in a hurry ? No worries - you 've got an external storage device to hand with a full copy of your files . Hard drive crashes ? It 's fine - you 've got a NAS device with redundancy settings keeping multiple extra copies of your files safe and sound . Lose your local storage devices to fire , flood or theft ? The internet 's there to save you . <p> While casual users might not feel the need for three separate backups , any personal or business users with important data to protect should seriously consider this approach , as the initial investment will seem like nothing when it 's helping you restore essential files . <p> - <h> Things to consider <h> Storage space <p> It 's an obvious one , but the amount of data you need to store should be one of your first concerns when it comes to setting up network attached storage . Are you backing up from a few personal devices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Router/external drive combinations are great for home setups , but not so much for process-intensive arrangements , as processing speeds can be very slow , and the amount of available space limited . Companies such as QNAP , Synology and Netgear all offer business-oriented NAS devices with huge storage capacities ( we 're talking petabytes ) , and great options for data management , security and redundancy . Alternatively , creating your own NAS from scratch will allow you to attach as many external drives as your motherboard has ports , so could be a worthwhile option for anyone with some experience of customizing hardware . <p> If you 're looking for something a bit more domestic , then an external drive or two could be the perfect fix - just make sure that you know how many USB ports your router has available ( two is fairly standard ) , the capacity of the drives that you 're planning to attach , and how much of that space you want to use for redundant copies of your data . For an idea of how much space personal data takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Online Backup Guide . <p> - <h> NAS transfer speeds <p> You might be wondering how NAS compares to online backups when it comes to file transfer speeds . The simple answer is that transferring files within your local network is a lot quicker than moving them from your computer to the internet at large , because the speed of local transfer is n't affected by your bandwidth allowance . However , you will need to be connected to your network to transfer files to and from your NAS - although many commercial NAS boxes feature a way to view already-stored files offline . <p> - Of course , if you want to backup files to the Cloud , there 's no discernable difference between uploading them from your NAS and uploading them from your computer , as all of the usual speed restrictions apply . Other processes , such as port forwarding , are also subject to bandwidth limitations . <p> Alternatively , if you think a different method of data backup might suit you better , our- Ultimate Online Backup Guide has loads of information to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck !

Visit their website below to give Syncplicity a try ! <h> Our criteria <p> All of the plans that have made it to the top 5 are completely free , with no hidden charges or time limits . We 've only taken into account storage space that is available by default , or by inviting friends . We 're not big fans of swapping benefits for Facebook likes , so providers that offer extra space in return for this alone have n't made it to the list . <p> Finally , we know that biggest does n't always mean best , so the top five have been chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( although this is undeniably important ) , but also on the quality of the product . Additional features , reliability and ease of use all factor into the selection process too . <h> Conclusion <p> Whether you 're looking for space or security , there are plenty of ways to keep your data safe for free and with nothing to pay , why not take these providers for a spin and see for yourself ? <h> 4 responses to " 5 Best Free Backup Services 2016 " <p> Thanks very much for listing Memopal and Syncplicity , which I have not seen mentioned much elsewhere . For me , a true backup solution is one that let 's me back up files and folders in place rather than forcing me to dump them into the backup applications dedicated virtual black hole . Online storage is not the same thing as online backup . I would like to see articles like yours focus on this issue . I personally would not consider Dropbox and Google Drive to be backup services despite their usefulness in other respects . <p> Thanks for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between online backup and Cloud storage is really important ( you can even find a whole section on it in our Ultimate Online Backup Guide ! ) but also appreciate that the distinctions werent too clear here . I 've now updated the list to make it more obvious exactly what kind of services all of the featured providers are offering hope that 's helpful ! <p> Interesting that you did not include Flickr for photo storage . 1TB free . I have used them for 4 years , without problems . A down-side of Flickr is that it is owned by Yahoohow long will Yahoo be around for ? ?

@@26491974 @191974/ <h> GUIDE <h> AWS , Azure and Beyond a Basic Guide to Storage as a Service <p> Storage as a Service ( also known as Public Cloud Storage ) is an essential part of current business and enterprise-level data storage . Designed with developers and application hosting in mind , its appeal has grown over time , with providers now catering not just to developers , but also to businesses and individual users , and providing the infrastructure required to backup , archive , and analyse vast quantities of information using- big data services such as Hadoop . <p> Dominated by tech giants including Google , Microsoft , and Amazon , Storage as a Service is now starting to gain popularity with users across the board , and looks to be shaping the future of Cloud-based data storage . <h> What is Storage as a Service ? <p> Storage as a Service ( SaaS , though not to be confused with Software as a Service ) is the umbrella term used to refer to services such as Amazon S3 , Microsoft Azure , Google Cloud Storage , Rackspace Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billing system , and allow individual users , developers , businesses , and enterprise-scale companies to rent out storage space and run applications from their servers . <p> The major difference between these storage services and online backup providers like Dropbox and Carbonite is that S3 , Azure etc. really just offer the raw storage space , without much by way of consumer-friendly navigation features built in . As a result , in order to utilise Storage as a Service if you 're not familiar with processes like using a command line interface , you 'll need to find a platform that parcels up the storage space with some additional usability features which is exactly what programs like Dropbox are offering . <h> So why are we even talking about Storage as a Service ? <p> The low price point of SaaS services has led to a rise in popularity amongst individual users looking to store large quantities of data online , and new user interface services have sprung up to make the process more accessible to the casual consumer . These services , which include CloudBerry Backup , S3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least significantly cheaper than paying a monthly fee to use an online backup service like Dropbox . <p> *Please note : With so many SaaS services on the market , it would be extremely time-consuming for us to write ( not to mention very time-consuming for you to read ) about them all in an introductory guide like this one . As a result , we 've stuck to the big three services ( Amazon S3 , Microsoft Azure , and Google Cloud Storage ) to give you a good idea of the most common practices though of course , we strongly advise that you do your own , more in-depth research before signing up for anything. - <h> Pros and cons of SaaS <h> Pros <p> Only pay for what you use <p> When you sign up to services like Dropbox , you 're paying for a maximum storage allowance , rather than the number of gigabytes that your data is actually taking up . This means that , if you 're paying $11 per month for a 1TB storage account but are only using 250GB of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empty space . <p> By contrast , SaaS services will only ever charge you for the space you 're actively using . You do n't need to estimate or plan your usage in advance just add and remove data as required , and pay accordingly . <p> No upper storage limit <p> While lots of other backup services have a hard cap on your storage quota , or start charging astronomical monthly fees for custom extensions to your account , Storage as a Service systems really do offer unlimited storage space . We 're not just talking terabytes here Amazon S3 , for example , wo n't even raise an eyebrow if you want to stray into petabyte territory . <h> Cons <p> Complex pricing <p> While there 's no denying that Storage as a Service is cheap , paying for it is not quite as simple as it seems on first glance . While most online backups charge for storage space alone occasionally with a few paid add-ons available too using SaaS will require you to not just pay for your storage space , but also every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other users . - While the charges are still fairly minimal , getting your head around all of these different fees can be confusing to start with , and many users have found themselves with larger-than-anticipated bills at the end of the month as a result . Do n't get us wrong there 's nothing fundamentally wrong or untrustworthy about the SaaS pricing model . Just make sure that you do your research first . <p> Lack of user-friendly interface <p> As mentioned above , SaaS services are n't really designed with the casual consumer in mind . So although basic processes are n't too hard to master , they 're not what you 'd call intuitive ; and more advanced features will definitely require a bit of tech knowhow- ( or a subscription to a user interface service ) if you want to use them to best effect. - <h> Understanding Storage as a Service Pricing <p> Pricing for Storage as a Service is often more complex than it initially appears as , alongside variable storage fees , there are almost always other charges involved too . <h> Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Service providers are subject to several influencing features . <p> Location <p> Many providers alter storage prices depending on the location at which you choose to store your data . For example , if you 're purchasing S3 Standard Storage , keeping your files on servers in Seoul - will cost $0.0314 per GB per month , while the same service with data stored in North Virginia will cost $0.0300 /GB . <p> Frequency of access <p> Prices can also vary depending on the frequency with which you want to access your data . In the case of Amazon S3 , this takes the form of two alternative accounts Standard ( prices starting at $0.03 per GB per month ) and Infrequent Access ( from $0.125 /GB per month ) . <p> Amount of data stored <p> Finally , - the more data you have , the cheaper the per-GB price will be . For Amazon S3 Standard account holders storing data in North Virginia , the first 1TB will cost $0.003 per GB per month , the next 49TB $0.0295 /GB /month , and so on up to 5000TB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored your data on SaaS servers , you 'll need to pay to get it back . Depending on which service you use , data transfer fees may be fixed or variable in the latter case , depending on factors including how quickly you want the download to take place , and how long it 's been since the data was uploaded . <h> Access/request costs <p> Providing others with access to your files ( typically via a URL ) is a useful tool for managing access and storage within the same service but once again , there 's a cost . In this case , it 's usually a low one ( S3 charges as little as $0.004 per 10,000 GET requests ) , but if that 's a big part of your plan for utilising the storage space , then it 's worth taking into account . <h> Other charges <p> Some services , including Microsoft Azure , offer add-ons ( modules ' ) which contribute to your monthly charges . These range from analytics tools to domain hosting and provisioning for virtual machines , and can range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Discounts and offers <p> As mentioned above , pricing for SaaS is always changing and there are plenty of good deals out there to take advantage of too . In most cases , these take the form of a trial offering free or discounted storage up to a certain amount ( usually at least 100GB ) or for an initial time period . <h> Are Storage as a Service Providers Secure ? <p> As with the majority of features , data security measures vary between providers but some basic standards do exist throughout the industry . In most cases , this takes the form of AES-256 encryption for data held on the company 's servers , and HTTPS/TLS used during transfer.While some services , including Microsoft Azure , stop at this , others ( including Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Services ) also offer client-side encryption , and the option to manage your own encryption keys . The risk here is that , if you lose your password , you wo n't be able to regain access to your data however , if security is your top priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking a more advanced range of security permissions , there are also Enterprise-standard gradated data protection settings on offer from services including AWS . <p> If you 'd like further reassurance that your stored data will be kept private no matter what , then almost all Storage as a Service providers support the upload of files that have been previously encrypted using services like VeraCrypt and BoxCryptor . <h> More About User Interface Services <p> There are dozens of SaaS user interface services on the market today some designed specifically for use with one provider ( such as S3 Browser and Bucket Explorer ) , and others compatible with a broad range of services ( such as CloudBerry Backup ) . <p> In general , these interface solutions provide a more user-friendly point of access to SaaS , as well as facilitating the easy use of additional features such as the following : <p> Centralised management of multiple accounts <p> Folder synchronisation <p> Multipart file transfers that can be manually paused and resumed <p> Transfer scheduling <p> Data sharing <p> Bandwidth throttling <p> Proxy support <p> Client-side encryption <p> Desktop-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeware , and many are open-source . Those services which do charge often offer perpetual licenses for a one-off fee removing the need to worry about monthly charges or renewal costs . <p> In addition to dedicated Storage as a Service user interface services , you 'll also find Cloud Storage Managers such as Otixo , Jolicloud and CloudFuze . These services are primarily designed to give you a centralised location to manage data stored with multiple providers including both consumer-level online backup services such as OneDrive and Box , and SaaS solutions but also offer a user-friendly platform from which to manage your files . <h> Amazon S3 vs.Amazon Glacier <p> When it comes to online backup and SaaS , however , there are just two facets to consider Amazon S3 and Amazon Glacier . So what 's the difference between the two ? <h> Amazon S3 <p> Amazon S3 is much like other online backup services insofar as it 's designed to be constantly updated with new and changed files , and facilitates regular requests for access to your data . Of course , as mentioned above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll find plenty of other features there too but for the purposes of comparison , it 's a day-to-day storage solution for any files that you may want to download , share , amend , or access at short notice . <h> Amazon Glacier <p> Amazon Glacier acts primarily as a low-cost archiving service giving users a place to store data that wo n't be accessed for months , or even years , at a time . With prices starting from as little as $0.007 per GB per month , it 's one of the cheapest data storage options out there but you 'll be charged much higher rates if you attempt to retrieve recently-uploaded files . In addition to this , there is also a minimum waiting time of four hours for file retrieval making it inconvenient as well as expensive to use if you 're seeking frequent access to your data . <h> Conclusion <p> As one of the major forces in Cloud Computing today , there 's an awful lot to be said about Storage as a Service . In this guide , we 've set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with other online backup services , and the main strengths that it has to offer . For more in-depth information , the best place to go is the providers ' own websites but watch this space for more !

Among new competitors in cloud storage and syncing industry , Copy is definitely set for a big bright future . Potentially hundreds of gigabytes of free storage , ease of use , cross-platform compatibility and extremely polished base product are going to tempt existing Dropbox users and lure the newcomers . But will Copy.com live up to our predictions and its current hype ? Check out our review - or sign up now . <p> When we first heard of Copy.com , we exhaled and thought " yet another cloud storage and syncing services again ! " . <p> And we could n't be happier to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a fantastic newcomer that we believe will change the game in online storage and syncing niche . It has addressed issues that we have trouble with other providers , and seems like they are prepared to take the industry by storm . <p> So how fantastic is Copy.com ? We can tell you about a few incredible things Copy.com has done right but perhaps the highlight will be on their storage , and their incredible referral bonus . <p> Copy.com is created by Barracuda Network , a well-reputed player in market for network security , anti-spam , enterprise-level cloud backup , and application delivery . Copy.com is their latest product an attempt to enter the lucrative consumer-level online storage and backup niche . Given their track record , we wont hesitate to trust Copy.com with our data . <p> We have reviewed over 52 online storage , backup and syncing services . And there are more to come . So it is safe for us to say that we know the industry like back of our hands . But we know that you wo n't take our words for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right after the break . <h> Plans &amp; Pricing <p> Copy.com currently offers 15GB free storage for anyone who subscribe . It is not a free trial , nor limited time offer . Just like what Dropbox offers , it is permanently free . And that is if you subscribe directly on Copy.com . More on this part later . <p> Right now , they offer six plans in total in both Personal and Corporate plans . Free plan is part of Personal plan so that leaves 2 paid plans in it . <p> Pro 250. $9.99 a month or $99 per year and you get 250GB of cloud storage . <p> Pro 500. $14.99 a month or $149 per year . You will get 500GB cloud storage . If you need more than that , you can buy additional increments in 500GB for $149 per year each increment . <p> Copy.com plans for companies come with more features catered specifically for companies , and instead of limitation on users or charging per user , you can get a whole bunch of storage with all features for companies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with access privileges for any numbers of users . <p> 100GB . It costs $399 a year , and comes with all company features . There is no per user features nor limits . <p> 250GB. $699 a year will get you 250GB with all company features . <p> 500GB. $999 a year will give you 500GB storage space with all company features . If you need more storage , you can purchase increments in 500GB at $999 a year . <h> Referral Bonus <p> What makes Copy.com more interesting is its referral bonus . It is nothing new , since Dropbox , SugarSync and others also offer referral bonus storage space but what makes Copy.com more unique is in how many bonus you get . For each referral ( sign up , install client app and log in ) , both you and whoever you referred to will get 5GB additional storage space . And there is no limit on how much you can get on referral bonus . Yes , there is no ceiling . <p> We know of people who have already earned like 525GB or 600GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . So yeah , Copy.com essentially redefines the meaning of referral bonus space ! <p> In comparison , you can get up to 18GB total free space from referrals with Dropbox . SugarSync will give you up to 32GB . Yup , you really cant compare Copy.com with them in this aspect . <h> Price Comparison <p> Another win for Copy.com is in paid plans . Dropbox charges $9.99 for 100GB and $49.99 for 500GB . SugarSync will charge you $7.49 for 60GB and 250GB will cost $24.99 . Those are monthly prices . Copy.com only charges $14.99 a month for 500GB . That is , of course , assuming you do n't  have a vast network or people who will sign up through your links . It is entirely possible to get 500GB or so without spending a time . <p> So in this aspect , Copy.com 1 Dropbox and others 0 ! <h> Features <p> Cross-platform compatible . Copy.com offers desktop client apps for all three major operating systems : Mac OS X , Linux and Windows . This is impressive since most will just cater to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apps for all here . They also have mobile apps for both iOS and Android . No words on Windows Phone though . <p> Cloud Syncing . You already know what cloud syncing is if you have used Dropbox . You put your files on your account at Copy.com , and every other devices logged in to your Copy.com account will automatically get the files you uploaded . <p> " Any Directory " Syncing . Okay , we totally make up this name but it is exactly how it sounds . While Dropbox limits us to sync only files in a central folder ( aptly named Dropbox ) , Copy.com let 's you sync any directories on your computer . You can do this by creating a shortcut to that folder and place it within Copy directory . Not very intuitive like SugarSync though , which let 's us do exact same thing within right-click menu . <p> Permission-based Sharing . When you share your files and folders on Copy.com to others , you can set permissions for each . So basically , you can set permission to just " View Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set permission based on files . Now this is a feature that Dropbox users have been begging to have . Copy.com addressed that . <p> Fair Sharing . Fair sharing is another concept we feel that Copy.com has done it right . With Dropbox and SugarSync , when you share files to someone , the size of shared files will consume space on both accounts . So basically if you share a 1GB large file between two people , both will have to give up 1GB of their space for that file . Not with Copy.com . Let 's say you share a 3GB file or folder with a friend . Instead of consuming 3GB on both accounts , now only 1.5GB will be consumed on each account . The file size is split and shared between all shared accounts . If you share the same file to two more people , then only 750MB will be used on each users . <h> Customer Service <p> Using Copy.com and its desktop client app are incredibly easy . There is no guess work , and everything is pretty intuitive . So unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant really imagine why you would need customer support . Regardless , Copy.com has a web-based knowledgebase and support forum over at Zendesk . The knowledgebase covers a lot of issues and questions that you will have . If you have anymore questions , you can just submit your request through support forum . Simple as that . <p> We did n't  test on response time here since all questions people will have are already addressed in the knowledgebase . We just could n't think of anything else to ask . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> Once you visit Copy.com , there is no complication on the home page , and it is pretty clear of what you can do . Sure , it has two call to actions : " Drop files here to share " and " Sign Up Now " prominently on the home page . But they are not that confusing . If you use Drop Files Here , then you can upload one file without signing up , and after it is uploaded , you will get a shared link to access your file . This is quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign up an account . Since it is web-based upload , there must be a ceiling on maximum file size you can upload so it is best to sign up an account if you are looking for long term usage . <p> Signing up is also very easy and straightforward . You do n't  have to fill in countless forms or whatnot . It only asks you for your first name , last name , email and password . Then voila , your account will be created and you will be logged in immediately into your account . Such straightforwardness and simplicity are always welcomed in todays world of clutter and chaos . <p> Right after you log in , you will get this welcome dialog . It is basically a short tour , and will show you things you should know about Copy.com . It also comes with a short message for you to tweet it so that you can spread the words about Copy.com on Twitter . <p> After the tour , this is the Dashboard of your account . The interface is very simple , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copy folder and Shared With Me folder . The names aptly reflect what they are so we wont explain what it is . When you click on either one , at the right panel , you will see all folders and files . The interface is intuitive enough that you do n't  need to guess what is what . <p> So did you see the arrows pointing right ( &gt; ) beside the folders ? When you click on it , you get what you see above . Those are functions you can do with that folder . You can download whole folder , you can rename it , or you can share it . You can also see file activity ( for folders already shared ) . <p> When you click on Share , this is what you will see . You can choose to share publicly or securely ( private link ) . Everybody with a link for a publicly shared folder can access it . However , for privately shared folders , users must verify their email address in order to access it . So even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will know exactly who accessed what based on the email address . <p> Public sharing will just give you a link , but Secure Sharing has an extra step for you . You have to enter email address of people you want to invite , and also set permission for each on whether you want them to view only or let them also edit and sync . Then Copy.com will send an email containing a link to your shared folder . <p> Right click anywhere in the right panel and you will be able to create a new folder or upload files using Copy.com web app . There is no bulk upload feature , as Copy.com intends you to use their desktop client app . <p> You can just click on Install App on the top navigation menu , then you will be prompted to download the desktop client app for your OS ( it detects your OS ) . If by any chance you want to download the app for another OS then there are also links right under the download button . Pretty nifty . Kudos to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess work and extra steps from users , making the whole experience pretty seamless and smooth . <p> We will skip the installation of the app itself but after you install it , you only have to log in and it will put an icon in your system taskbar . The menu items from the taskbar icon are pretty similar to Dropbox . <p> We wont explain other interfaces in Preference settings of Copy app but Sharing tab deserves a mention . Basically , here you can manage all your public and private sharing of your folders . You can manage permissions , and set which default directory will accept incoming shared files . Pretty useful . You can also use Copy Actions in right-click menu , which will only appear if you are right clicking in Copy folder on your computer . <h> Conclusion <p> While Dropbox seems to be resting on its laurels and still enjoying the market leader position , others are catching up . And among those plethoras of cloud storage and syncing services , we can confidently predict that Copy will be taking a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to innovate more . Right now , there are no gallery views of photos uploaded , and its mobile app needs to play catch-up with SugarSync ( which is great in streaming music , video , viewing documents and so on ) . But it was launched extremely polished , stable and usable so we have no doubt about its future . <p> If you are looking for an efficient , decently fast , cross-platform compatible cloud syncing service with loads of free storage , then go ahead with Copy.com . Heck , even if you are already using Dropbox for years , still try them out . You will fall in love . We promise . 75371 @qwx275371 <h> 19 responses to " Copy.com Review " <p> Copy.com has the issues mentioned by Kenton Simons until today . It is great for getting a lot of space . However it is not reliable to make the files available . Files listed on copy.com can not be found by users with a valid link to it . They get nonsense error messages . If you want to distribute your files @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . I moved to MEGA which offers 50GB and is highly reliable . <p> I have been using copy for a few months , I have my own blog , so I used it as platform to advertise copy and get additional storage . <p> my problem with copy started two months ago when I figured out that my main folder is missing . when I try to access the folder I get : " There was a validation error on our server . Check your URL . " <p> I contacted support , they answer back two times but were not helpful : clear the cookie ( even due I already specified in the support form that I tried in different computers and got the same result ) ; what is the path of the folder with the issue ? ( even due it is already specified in the support form ) . <p> after I answered these questions , there was no reply for a few months , I am still waiting <p> If your files are important to you , I suggest to keep your distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy for a year and a half now . I have Dropbox and OneDrive as well , but Copy is much cheaper ( especially when using over 250 GB ) . I use two aliass in Copy , one for " My Documents " and one for my " iPhoto Library " , they are strictly for back up . Two weeks ago I deleted my entire iPhoto Library by accident and a few days later my Time Machine backup crashed . So I ended up losing 202 GB of photos . Photos that were irreplaceable . <p> Since I deleted my iPhoto Library by accident it was also removed from Copy . So I contacted Copy support and after a few emails they said that they could replace the files , but that it would take time . <p> It did take time , as the comments above suggest , it took almost 10 days , but in the end I had all of my 202 GB of photos back , photos that I myself deleted . <p> Im impressed with Copy and their Tech Support , very impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of Copy to add my two cents . They saved my 202 GB of photos for me . <p> Are they slow ? You betcha they are , slower than molasses going up hill . But for a cheap cloud backup for large GB of data you cant beat them . And for customer support they ca n't be beat either . Like I said , I use Dropbox and OneDrive for my day to day management of files , and I 've had issues with those services as well . But their customer support was no where near as good as Copys . <p> So thanks Copy , you have my business now for a long time to come . Its nice to know that even my stupidity is covered . <p> All laments . Hmm . I 'm quite happy with copy.com ; to me it does beat dropbox . It usually updates changes fast , I have yet to find any problem , hunky dory . My qualm , and I informed copy.com already , though no change yet , the client ( Linux ) on one and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources . And it is a quad-core 4 GB machine . Strange . <p> Yes , I can recommend copy.com ; and I cant say dropbox has worked any better for me ; aside of that singular resource hog . <p> Ive been a dropbox user for the past 6-7 years due to samsung promotion ( 50GB of storage for 2 years ) , which is still going on for specific models and HTC devices offer 23GB . Having been used to so much storage , Copy is generous with its offering of 15GB ( 20 if you use a referral link ) . A lot of these other promotions only last a limited time and are used as a marketing tactic . They make you invest all of your time into their service in hopes that it would be too big of an inconvenience to not buy their premium accounts . From my limited used with Copy , it seems just as good if not better than most other cloud storage clients . Their app for mobile phones is simple and intuitive . I 'm not sure if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you can set a passcode for the mobile app which is a great option . Obviously they offer automatic backup of your photos/videos . <p> I was really hopeful that this service would be a Dropbox alternative ( not that there is anything wrong with Dropbox ) . Ive been using Dropbox to distribute photographs to clients , amongst other things , so I thought I would give Copy a go . <p> After too many clients complaining they could n't access files , terrible upload speeds , being unable to access by files through the web from other computers , I have given up and removed all trace of copy from my machine . Do n't  bother stick with Dropbox . <p> Hi This is an interesting info on copy.com . I just have one question : I have a webhost with an unlimited disk space ! ; Is there any way to move my copy.com files directly to my webhost disk without having to download them first before reupload them to the webhost. thanks for answer me . <p> Ive been trying to integrate Copy into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm trying to keep two windows workstations and a linux dev server in sync and have found this service to be pretty undependable . I cant maintain permissions , and I cant ignore filetypes . The linux " CopyControl " daemon wont stay running . Yes , I am trying to maintain over 30k files , but is n't that the point ? <p> I like their web interface , and I like how much space they give you , but I 'm not sure this service is ready for primetime . <p> The biggest flaw I 've found with Copy.com is the inability to " empty the trash " . When you delete a file or folder its moved to an undelete area where it can be recovered . Unfortunately , it stays there forever , using up your allocated space . If you upload a huge folder full of photos or videos or whatever by mistake , say good-bye to the space it takes up . Many users have complained about this , and the company has said they plan to offer a permanent undelete in the future , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the quality of upload is poor . It ca n't handle a folder with a large number of files . The script crashes . I hope they improve it , but Skydrive and Dropbox are better , then Google Drive . <p> Something interesting : I have 2GB on my account , one directory has 1GB , I shared this directory with someone , my usage dropped to 1,5GB , then I stop sharing this directory and my usage is now 1GB . I still have the same data as before . <p> And it seems that there is no automatic sync from your computer to Copy.com . I added a folder to my computer Copy folder , it does not appear on my Copy.com folder . And Dropbox beats Copy.Com on that too 
@@26491976 @191976/ <h> GUIDE <h> USB Disk Security Guide <p> There are three main things to take into consideration when it comes to USB disk security : adding secure authentication , protecting your data from any unwelcome , prying eyes , and ensuring that your files stay virus-free . <p> Fortunately , you can solve all of those problems using three simple solutions password protection , encryption , and antivirus software . So here 's our guide to choosing , using and managing all three to make sure that the contents of your external drive stay safe no matter what . <h> USB Password Protection <p> Protecting your USB disk files with a password is an excellent way to ensure that , should the device be lost or stolen , no-one will be able to access the data stored on it . There are several ways to password protect files backed up to a USB drive either by setting a password for the device as a whole- or by protecting the documents individually . <h> Password protect files using Microsoft Word <p> The simplest way to secure individual documents , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for all MS Office users . The following process is for Office 365 , or you can find guides to using earlier versions elsewhere online . <p> While your chosen document is open , click File ' <p> When the Info page opens , select Protect Document ' <p> From the dropdown menu , select Encrypt With Password ' <p> Enter your chosen password in the box that pops up . <p> Enter the password again to confirm . <p> Congratulations ! Your document can now only be accessed after the correct password has been entered . <p> Once this is done , all you need to do is copy and paste the documents onto your USB drive as normal the password protection will remain . Sorted ! <h> Password protect your USB device using USB Safeguard <p> USB Safeguard is a simple password protection program that runs on your USB drive itself traveling with your device wherever it goes . Compatible with use on Windows , Mac and Linux devices , it automatically locks your drive every time you unplug it , or after a period of inactivity though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 'll need to make sure that you keep this one safe ! <p> There 's a free version of USB Safeguard available , although it can only be used on drives up to 2GB in size , as well as a free trial of the full program , which will set you back 19 Euros for a single license ( around $21 , based on the exchange rate at the time of writing ) . This license wo n't expire ( although you 'll need to activate it within a year of purchase ) , and can still be used after formatting your drive . Here 's how to use it : <p> Download the software from the USB Safeguard website. - <p> Insert your USB drive in order to install the program . <p> During setup , you 'll receive a message telling you to format the drive in NTFS before use . Click yes to proceed though make sure that you 've already saved any data already on the device elsewhere , as this will process will wipe it all . <p> Once setup is complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll then be prompted to enter a password . <p> After this is done , you 'll need to input the password again to gain access to your USB drive . You can then add , remove and edit files exactly as normal . <p> Close the program and safely remove your USB device to finish . <p> NOTE : The protection that these methods provide for your files is only as strong as the passwords you use . So rather than opting for an obvious word or phrase that only takes a few seconds to think up , spend a little time coming up with a strong password . Including a combination of numbers , symbols , lowercase and capital letters , and making sure that it 's more than eight characters long is a good place to start , or here are some other ways- to avoid creating passwords that can be easily broken . <h> USB Encryption <p> Encrypting your USB drive is a highly effective way to keep your files secure offering the most extensive protection of the options discussed here , although it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be used to encrypt files on your PC , but one of the best for use with USB drives is the opensource freeware , DiskCryptor . Follow the instructions below to set it up : <p> Download and install DiskCryptor <p> Make sure that your USB device is plugged in , and select it from the list of Disk Drives that pops up during setup <p> The next step will require you to select an encryption algorithm . We 'd recommend using AES . <p> When prompted , enter a secure password to protect the device <p> At this point , you will also have the option to use keyfiles . These complex , randomly generated codes add an extra layer to the authentication process , as both your password and your keyfile will be required to access the device , making it much harder for a hacker to gain entry using brute force . Create a keyfile by clicking Generate Keyfile ' and saving the file to a secure location . It will then appear on the list of Keyfiles , after which you can click OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that this may take a while if you have a large capacity USB device , and if it already contains data . <p> Once the process is finished , the DiskCryptor dashboard will display your USB drive as mounted . While in this state , you can add and remove files from the device <p> To make your USB drive inaccessible again , select it from the dashboard and click Unmount ' . You may be asked if you want to format the drive at this point select No , as unmounting will wipe the contents of the device . <p> Finally , when you want to access the contents of your USB disk again , simply plug it in , open DiskCryptor , and select it from the Disk Drive list . Then click Mount ' , and enter your password and keyfile if you set one . <p> Repeat as required ! <p> NOTE : If you 've already got files on your drive , setting up DiskCryptor wo n't delete them unless you format the device although we 'd recommend making an extra copy just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If this sounds like too much work , then never fear you can buy USB drives with their own encryption included . They 're a little pricier than their encryption-free alternatives , but still wo n't break the bank with an 8GB Kingston drive with 256-bit AES encryption setting you back $30.99 , and other similarly encrypted models starting from just $5 . Alternatively , if you 're serious about security , you may want to select a USB device that offers hardware ( rather than software ) -based encryption as this eliminates the risk of inadvertently handing over your password details to a disreputable company . Prices on Newegg are similar to those using software-based encryption , with most devices ranging from $5 to $40. - <h> BitLocker <p> BitLocker is Microsoft 's own encryption tool , which can be used to protect data volumes within Windows OS . Offering both encryption and password protection , it 's a good tool for safeguarding any storage device , which you 'll find recommended in many USB disk security guides elsewhere online . <p> While the tool itself has plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , as it 's not always clear that BitLocker in fact has a very limited range of use . This is because you 'll need to be running a Pro version of Windows in order to make use of it an upgrade which will cost Home users a hefty $199.99 . If you 're already upgraded , however , its a great way to combine multiple USB security features in one program . You can find a great guide on how to set it up over at How-To Geek. - <h> USB Disk Virus Protection <p> Storing infected files on a USB disk can be pretty disastrous , as , not only will the documents themselves be corrupted , but plugging the drive into another PC can transfer the virus in a matter of seconds . So if you 're using a USB disk to transfer data , it 's worth taking steps to protect yourself just in case . <p> USB virus protection software does n't run on the device itself instead , you 'll need to install it on your laptop , after which it will scan any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , in order to ensure that the files are not corrupted in the first place , it 's best to make sure that any device your USB drive is plugged into is using strong antivirus protection of its own but if you 're moving data between home and work , friends and family etc. then it can be hard to guarantee the security of every computer you connect to . Which is exactly why it 's so important to take extra steps to enforce USB disk security from your own PC . <p> There are several antivirus providers that specialize in USB security , including USB Drive Antivirus and USB Disk Security both of which are available to download for free . Here at BestBackups , we slightly favor USB Disk Security for its excellent reputation and ease of use . You can find a full walkthrough of how to install and use the software in this video- from Free and Secure Softwares . <h> USB Disk Security Conclusion <p> The USB disk security measures detailed in this guide are a great way to put your mind at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a USB device on a regular basis . As with all things privacy-related , bigger is definitely better so combining all three approaches is the best way to make sure that your data will stay safe no matter what .

They feature backup revisioning which is not a common feature but is extremely useful ( in other words you can go back and check previous uploads of backups . They have a 30 day free trial for you to use before you have to start paying . <p> The home version of the software does not have any features basically at least for backing up , no bandwidth throttling , scheduling or anything like that . <h> Features <h> Security <p> KeepIt use a 256-bit Rijndael-encryption , which is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support multiple location servers , which enhances your security as well . <h> Customer Service <p> Their documentation is in PDFs , which I think is a lazy way of not transferring your written guides onto the website . I do n't  think that 's very good customer service . Their website content is also a bit short , so I think they just wanted to get the guides out of the way as soon as possible . <p> The customer service people responded to my question in 2 hours , so very very quick customer support , I was very happy about that . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> You can download the software from the front page , although for business versions you do need to pay first . You can see here the prices generally of the business plans . You do get a 30 day moneyback guarantee . <p> After downloading the files , there is a standard installer that installs the files , after which you can sign up via the software , all you need is an email address ( and password later on ) : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back up : <p> And with that the initial backup happens straight away : <p> Now the interesting thing is that once this has happened , the software does not really have any features at all . The settings page looks like this , the only option is to change the backup-ed folders : <p> And finally we have a very simple restore page : <h> Conclusion <p> I think KeepIt is a bit too " simple " . They actually lack any basic features that many other providers give you , which are actually useful . I would n't mind scheduling downloads myself , and throttling the bandwidth if my ISP is n't that keen on lots of uploads . <p> Their price is very impressive though , it matches some of the best other providers , unlimited space for around $5 is great ! 75371 @qwx275371

Once you are using a provider and have no issue , its hard to be convinced to switch . <p> Today Gmail has over 425 million users . <p> And that is not counting Google users who already have Gmail accounts but not actively using it . Since having a Google account means having access to all Google services and apps , its no surprising that Gmail surpasses all other email providers and become the de facto email provider everybody is using . <p> While its mostly safe for your emails since they are stored on Google servers , things can still happen . Human error can still be deadly to all your important emails , so as being hacked . Imagine someone getting access to your account by illegal means and delete all your emails . It could be your recent ex that have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwed if it happens . <p> So how do you protect your emails ? Backup . Now you must be thinking Google has their backups .

In fact , we are going to list 5 of them here ! There are still a few more but GMVault takes the crown in all of them . It is cross-platform , free , very lightweight and feature rich . In fact , we have n't seen other solutions that is as extensive as GMVault .

It will backup your Gmail , Google Drive , Picasa , Calendar , contact and local files . It is very easy to use , however we found that its initial backups can be a bit slow . For free account holders , you get 5GB of storage space , and you can download up to 1GB of data a month . Backup bandwidth is unlimited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way you can backup every emails on your account . For $3 a month though , you will get 120GB of cloud storage and 120GB of download data bandwidth . It will also allow you to backup up to 4 Google accounts . Basically , that will let you backup everything from your Google Drive , Gmail and Picasa. <h> 3 . Backupify From $3/month/user <p> Backupify is not exactly just a Gmail backup solution but rather a Google Apps backup solution . Because of its nature , personal users may not want to use Backupify unless they are using Google Apps with their own domain . It is one of the best solutions in the market now , and has pretty tight integration with other cloud apps like Salesforce and it can even backup Twitter and Facebook ! Probably only solution in the market with that much coverage . Instead of limiting you with storage space , the starter plan will give you unlimited storage for just $3 per month per user . Enterprise accounts start from $4 per user per month and have more features like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backup Sites - as well . Restoration is , as Backupify stated , just one click affair .

CloudAlly From $2.49/month <p> Backupify is not the only company with good cloud apps coverage for backup . CloudAlly , a direct competitor of Backupify , is also a great cloud backup solution for people who are using Gmail and Yahoo Mail . Yes , you read that right . With CloudAlly , you can even backup your Yahoo Mail , as well as Google Apps , Office365 , Salesforce , Amazon SimpleDB and DynamoDB too .

@@26491985 @191985/ <h> Review <h> FilesAnywhere Review <p> Established in 1999 , FilesAnywhere has been around for a lot longer than many companies we have reviewed here . Its so surprising that they do n't  get as much media attention as other companies now , especially when they offer plethora of amazing features which will surprise you . In fact , many features FilesAnywhere offer to its users are n't  anywhere to be seen at its major competitors . Read details below or sign up now . <p> FilesAnywhere combined both online file storage and cloud backup into one neat package , and also offer syncing on top of file storage . At a first glance , the brand name and the website will remind you of other file sharing services such as 4shared , MediaFire and SendFile . But when you look closer , or sign up , FilesAnywhere will definitely surprise you . Many of its features offered may seem to be only useful for companies or teams , but in many circumstances they are also useful for individual users . <p> Only thing we have an issue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are an individual user and can content with 1GB storage space , FilesAnywhere has a free plan with all other features included . Larger storage and additional users will cost you more . By looking at the storage cost and its features , its clear that FilesAnywhere is intended towards collaborative file storage and syncing on the cloud , rather than real-time backup of your whole machine . <p> Having said that , its interesting features that help us in storing , organizing and sharing our documents and important personal data on the cloud definitely make FilesAnywhere a viable choice for any personal users and businesses . Take a look at them after the break . <h> Plans &amp; Pricing <p> FilesAnywhere currently offers four plans : two for home users , one for SMBs , and one plan for enterprises . Features seem to be more or less the same , with FTP , SFTP &amp; WebDAV access , more reporting , user management and white label branding options for SMBs and enterprises . <p> There is 30-day free trial offer and personal users can enjoy a free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FilesAnywhere let 's you use all of their features without any hidden charges , except those that are only available for plans intended for SMBs and enterprises . Let 's take a look at the plans . <h> Home Plans <p> FilesAnywhere offers two plans here : Free and Advanced . <p> Free . You will enjoy 1GB of free storage for 1 user , and 10 outbound faxes . All other features of Home plans are accessible , except automatic backup , version control , FTP , SFTP , &amp; WebDAV access . <p> N.B : One thing to note with Free plan is that you can always upgrade your storage or add additional users in your online dashboard . And when you do that , you do n't  need to jump straight to Advanced plan , nor any other higher tier plans . And it seems like you can still maintain same disk space ( 1GB ) but upgrade your account to be a paid account ( which let 's you enjoy FTP/SFTP/WebDAV access and other features that Advanced plan has ) and it will cost $2.95 per month . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ user will cost $3 more on your monthly bill . Oh and if you tweet about FilesAnywhere from billing page , you will get additional 1GB for free too . <h> Work Plan <p> FilesAnywhere offer one plan for SMBs under this . <p> Work . $129 a month , and it will get you 100GB storage for 10+ users , white label branding options , and VIP support .

But you can request for more storage and users , as well as customizing other features to fit your business needs . <h> Features <p> Now this is the part that got us feel like running a marathon . FilesAnywhere happen to have exhausting list of features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before you continue to read . Trust us , its gon na be a long one . <p> Syncing . Think Dropbox . FilesAnywhere client software will let you do something similar to that . Nothing much to talk about here . <p> Real-time backup . Using FilesAnywhere client software , you can set it to backup certain folders in real time . After initial backup is complete , FilesAnywhere software will monitor the folder for any changes and do incremental backups . <p> Daily Snapshots . This is just a fancy name of deleted file retention and versioning . FilesAnywhere will keep your files previous versions for up to 30 days so that you can easily restore even after deletion , or just go back to a version from a previous date . <p> FileShare Links . You can generate single or multiple files , or even whole folders , by generating share links . You just need to give the link to whoever you want . <p> GroupShare . Using GroupShare , you can share your files and folders to only selected group of contacts . They need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not to be mistaken with Dropbox , the most popular cloud-based file storage and syncing service , Dropbox Links from FilesAnywhere is actually a way to receive files from other people . Using Dropbox Links , they can get to a web page where they can just upload files they want to send to you and those files will be automatically uploaded into your FilesAnywhere account . <p> Picture Link . While you can definitely use FileShare Links , Picture Links can show your photos as slides or in album format , rather than a list of files . <p> Send Local Files . If you would like to share files to other people but that file is n't in your FilesAnywhere account , you can use Send Local Files function which will do both : uploading and sharing , at the same time . <p> Send Fax . Yup , you read that right . You can send fax of images and documents and any other file types that FilesAnywhere can read to any numbers in the world . 10 outbound faxes are included with free account , while paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who still send fax these days ? <p> Convert Docs and Images to PDF . For those of you that need to convert your documents and images to PDF , you can do so right in the web dashboard of your FilesAnywhere account . It makes things so much simpler to share some files since everybody can open PDF files , even in browsers . <p> Virtual Folders . You can definitely create real folders and put your files in them , but when you want to give structure to your files without changing the folder structures , you can use this feature . Basically , those folders can be seen only in FilesAnywhere , and nothing else . <p> Life Cycle for Files &amp; Folders . Basically , you can setup lifecycle rules for automatic deletion of files and folders . You can set how many days a file or folder will be live , and after that duration , they will be automatically deleted . Pretty cool if you want to share a file for only specific period . <p> Aviary Photo Editor . Aviary is a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work with most popular image file types . It is integrated with FilesAnywhere web client . <p> Blogger.com &amp; WordPress.com Posting . You can post to your blogs on Blogger.com and WordPress.com together with files shared from your FilesAnywhere account . This is especially if you have a big file you want to share on your blog but does n't  want to upload there . And some file formats may not be allowed to upload on the two blogging platforms . <p> eForm . Basically , you can create forms within FilesAnywhere , using an easy to use visual editor . Then you can publish the form link or embed it in any HTML pages , and record all form submission data in your FilesAnywhere account . <h> Security <p> Security is a big deal at FilesAnywhere . Apart from usual 128-bit and 256-bit AES encryption for data uploads and all your files on the server , there are other security measures put in place too . <p> Independent Security Evaluation FilesAnywhere engage independent , third-party security experts to test and ensure that their network and software system are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been audited for ISO-27002 compliance . <p> Three-Tiered Testing In order to eliminate bugs , mistakes and glitches before introducing any new codes or changes to their network and system , updates are tested at a minimum of three levels before releasing for live environment . <p> Off-site , Monitored Data Center FIlesAnywheres data centers are monitored 24/7/365 by trained security team and have strict protocols for physical access into servers . <p> Now you might think that this is all mambo jambo marketing talk , but when Duetsche Bank , BBC , Du Pont , CITI Capital , The University of Chicago and GE are among its corporate customers , it is apparent that FilesAnywhere really take its security very seriously . <h> Customer Support <p> FilesAnywhere has pretty extensive knowledgebase , and ticket support system for personal users . Although rich in feature , the software and web dashboard are nowhere near complicated to use so not much technical support is actually needed . They also provide VIP support with live telephone and dedicated support for business users as well . We did n't  get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the web reveals that FilesAnywhere is quite attentive to its customers . Its knowledgebase is a joy to browse , and email support is responded within about 6 hours . Impressive , actually . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> Account creation is pretty easy . Just click on Sign-up on the website , and you will be led to a page where you have to choose a plan . Here we went with Free Account for testing purposes , and delighted to find that we do n't  have to fill in too many form fields . Just username , your name and email address are enough . Password will be mailed to your email . <p> After we registered , we are led to another page with different design , which confused us a bit . It seems like FilesAnywhere redesigned their website and missed out the redirect page after signing up . Regardless of the case , the confusion may be enough for normal end-users to feel like they are in a wrong website . <p> So we checked out the log in page through " Log-in " link from FilesAnywhere.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new design . Confusing , we know . <p> So anyway , when we log in , we are welcomed by a welcome screen , and right after that we are put in our web dashboard , in My Files page . <p> So let 's try uploading some files here . You can actually drag and drop your files and folders into this web dashboard , and it will automatically start to upload the files . Or you can just click on " Upload " button at the top right corner . File uploads are actually fast . 1MB image we tested only took about 10 secs . Compare this to Dropboxs 22 second and SugarSyncs 18 second , it is significantly faster . Note that we are testing on a 6mbps ADSL line . <p> Now let 's explore what 's in Share tab . Apparently in that tab , there are several features that allow you to do file sharing , as well as accept files other people want to share to you . A bit of warning here : it might overwhelm you first but the interface is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everything under 30 secs . We will not go into details of each feature here since its easy enough for any users to explore . In brief , there is Access &amp; Permission on most of the features on Share tab , where you can set password protection for your share links or Dropbox links , link expiration date , allow either only view files or download , limit how many downloads are allowed , and even track file activity . We have n't seen such extensive features with file sharing on any other companies , not even on Box.net . Impressive array of features here . <p> When you first start , you will be welcomed by Getting Started page , and in next page , you will see an easy to use visual editor where you can choose what form elements you want to include , and configure each of them . <p> After you are satisfied with elements in your form , you can hop along to next page where you can choose desired theme . Not many choices here and changes are only in coloring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link to share your newly created eForm . You can also get HTML embed code if you want to embed the form in your web pages . <p> In Tools tab , this is where you can convert your docs and images to PDF , look up reports , manage file and folders life cycle , create virtual folders , enable plugins such as Zoho Editor and Aviary Image Editor , and group your files using several taxonomies such as tags , file types , date , and whatnot . This is the page with most features and you should take your time to go through each of them . <p> In History page , you will see file history , logs and whatnot . <p> At the top right corner , you will see your first name and when you click on it , you will be able to go to your Account Settings , and that 's where you can upgrade your storage , add additional users and change other information like passwords and billing information . <p> One thing we do n't  like about FilesAnywhere web client is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor any links to its mobile apps . You have to go to Account Settings and go under Mobile &amp; Sync , or go to main website and look at the footer for download link . Having to dig that much and giving no prompt to download even desktop client is really a bummer . <p> The desktop client is very simple as well , and pretty straightforward . Configuring which folders you want to sync and backup is just drag &amp; drop into the client , or use the built in configuration function . That 's pretty much about it so we leave out our review for the desktop client software . Speed tends to be the same as uploading via a browser . <h> Conclusion <p> FilesAnywhere is really solid , and offer a wide array of features , but it left a mixed impression for us . Sure , it is definitely feature-rich without overwhelming the user . And judging from its features , it is apparent that FilesAnywhere is never intended as an online backup solution provider but rather for online file storage and sharing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for the best bang for the buck option , its going to disappoint . At $9.95 , you only get 8GB of storage , but at Dropbox you get 100GB for $9.99 a month . SugarSync will give you 32GB for free and at $9.99 , you get 60GB additional storage . Heck , even Box.com a service that FilesAnywhere seem to be competing with gives you 25GB at $9.99 per month . So the price per GB at FilesAnywhere leave a lot to desire . Perhaps if they bump up their free storage offer , or at least offer 25GB to 50GB at $9.99 a month rate , they will become a serious contender in this space . Otherwise , we do n't  see it getting mainstream attention for home users . Maybe this is their intention , since they seem to be doing fine with corporate customers . If you are business-oriented user and share files a lot , then definitely look for FilesAnywhere . If not , why do n't  you try Dropbox , SugarSync , Wuala or SpiderOak to see if any fits your need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Agree that they offer an expensive service . Interesting that you can not revert back to the free service . You must close the account . When I download my files it resets all the date/time stamps . Big ouch for me . <p> I can not recommend this service . There are so many better , cheaper , alternatives like box , dropbox , onedrive , etc . Service is extremely slow compared to others , much more expensive and has horrible billing practices . <p> Just found out about this software . I see that there is a free LONG ... version of their software but i can not understand if i can use this free software with other webdav servers . The fact is that i already have a webdav space , and i would like to use it with this software ( or any other that performs similarly ) . Anyone can tell ? <p> There are so many features with this service that you could get any type of work doneeven personal stuff ! Its weird when I have to fax something but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . 
@@26491987 @191987/ <h> 5 Best Online Backups for Graphic Designers <p> As a graphic designer , the amount of data you generate on daily basis is astounding . One of our team members here at BestBackup is a digital artist and he churns out like hundreds of megabytes of data on daily basis . Understandably , when we are working with graphics for magazines , posters and billboards , we are working with really high resolution images and high quality files . Put those images and work in InDesign , Photoshop and Illustrator , you get yourself a nice chunk of gigantic new data blocks . <p> So with that much of new work data everyday , it is important to effectively manage your data storage as well as backups . Its important to have backup copies of your works since they are client works as well as part of your portfolio . Hours and hours you poured into each design works , all the creativity you put into your works , they can be gone in an instant if you do n't  have backups . We have pretty much established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data on your computer is n't safe at all . The drive might die on its own , or you might drop your laptop , or it might be a coffee spill . And that applies to any external hard drives you may use for backup too . <p> And let 's not even talk about Dropbox . Sure , it is amazing file synchronization service . But that 's about it . 100GB will cost you $9.99 a month and 100GB is what your two weeks amount of data ? Now , there are quite a few reputable companies offering unlimited storage backup at affordable prices . Upload speed are pretty decent too . So without further ado , here are top 5 of them . <h> Summary <h> Overview of some favourites <p> Now that the important questions are clarified , let 's explore some really good online backup companies for graphic designers . <h> Winner Backblaze From $3.96 <p> The advantages Backblaze has over its competitors are almost unfair . You see , its built by ex-Apple employees so the polish and ease of use is what you would expect if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are a Mac user , Backblaze integrates so well with Mac OS X , so it will run just like a system app . It runs awesomely on Windows too . Best part of Backblaze is that it is very simple and straightforward to use . If you are expecting a lot of bells and whistles to configure , tweak and edit , then you maybe disappointed . But we have a feeling that as a graphic designer , you just want an online backup service that will simply work . No extra . Oh and did we mention that it will give you unlimited storage space ? Yup , unlimited . There is no upper limit on individual file sizes either so you can merrily upload those huge Photoshop files . <p> Now you get all of that for just $3.96 or $5 a month . You see , if you opt to prepay two years in advance , then you will only pay $3.96 a month . Even if you choose to pay for monthly payment , its just $5 . Thats peanuts compared to what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ files , since you really do n't  need to back them up anyway . But Backblaze will backup all your personal files nicely . Oh and here is our review . <h> 2 . ZipCloud From $4.95 <p> ZipCloud is an online backup provider from UK with a reputation for its uber simplicity . In fact , it is so simple that its just completely set it and forget it thing , without any settings to configure . If you think Backblaze is too simple , you might have your jaws dropped with ZipCloud . Yup , that simple . It is built for Mac by Mac users , although it will also run swimmingly on Windows . It is simple , and it is really elegant to use . Its been number #1 choice of many of our users , and our team as well . The only reason ZipCloud gets a first runner-up position to Backblaze is due to its individual file size limitation and a tad expensive price tag . For $4.95 a month you will get 75GB . But that wont be enough for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah its just a couple bucks more than Backblaze . <p> One thing we absolutely love about ZipCloud is that it has- anytime money back guarantee . So basically even after a year or two with them , if you feel unsatisfied , then just ask for refund . They will give you your money back . Yup , they are that good and confident about their own product . We see no other in the industry like them . Here is our review about ZipCloud. <h> 3 . CrashPlan From $2.5 <p> CrashPlan is by far the most advanced consumer online backup solution available . Its software will run on any platform , be it Mac , Windows or Linux , since its developed on Java . We are told that CrashPlan is now working on native Windows and Mac apps so we can expect the desktop client app to be even more awesome . What we LOVE about CrashPlan is its flexibility . You get whole loads of things to configure , from backup sets to speed and bandwidth to backup destinations . Oh yes , regarding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can backup to an external drive or NAS , CrashPlan online server , or to another computer at remote location running CrashPlan software . If you are planning to do backup just on external drive and remote computer , then you can download its desktop client for free . The only charge you will have to pay is when you want to use its online storage service . <p> CrashPlan excels in this too . Pricing plans start from $2.5 a month for 10GB , but hey your needs are bigger , right ? So CrashPlan+ plan with unlimited storage will cost just $5.99 a month if you pay monthly , and $3.96 a month if you choose to pay for 4 years . CrashPlan also allows unlimited versioning too so you do n't  have to worry about retrieving file versions from like three months ago . You can also set that versioning to whatever you want . Yup , that flexible . You will see how much we love it in this review . <h> 4 . Carbonite From $59 <p> Carbonite is probably the most well-known and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also one of the pioneers . In fact , it is also one of the first few companies that offer unlimited storage for backups . While its **30;31;TOOLONG Mozy downgraded to not-unlimited-plans in 2011 , Carbonite stayed true to their promise and did n't  budge . You can get unlimited storage for one computer at $59 a year . Yes , you will have to go with annual plan since there is no monthly payment plan . But $59 a year breaks down to about $4.916 a month which is still comparable to all other providers in this list . <p> What you get with Carbonite is an amazing software that can be either straightforward or advance as you wish . It allows you to tweak and configure to some extent , while also allowing you to just use the wizard and setup an automated backup which you do n't  have to look after . One thing though , if you are a Mac user , then advanced features of Carbonite software wont work with Mac . All advanced features only work for Windows client . Having said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Oh and you are getting top-notch customer support that no one else can beat . Read more about them in our review here . <h> 5 . Livedrive From $7.95 <p> Livedrive comes with a wide array of features that will leave you dazzled . For one , it has syncing feature which work just like Dropbox as well as online backup . The software is a bit less than stellar compared to others in this list , and its customer support can be spotty . But that does n't  mean Livedrive is n't an amazing online backup service provider . If you are looking for unlimited storage without a lot of hassles , then you will love Livedrive . <p> It allows syncing , mobile apps for iOS and Android , WebDAV and FTP access , pretty impressive encryption and other arrays of features are available with Livedrive . But if you are looking for long duration of versioning , then you will be disappointed as Livedrive only offers 30-day versioning . The pricing is reasonable at $7.95 a month for unlimited storage for one computer . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Briefcase storage which works just like Dropbox and allows unlimited syncing .

@@26491991 @191991/ <h> GUIDE <h> Backup Encryption : Everything you Need to Know <p> When you choose an online backup service , it makes sense to consider how your provider deals with backup encryption . This will ensure your data is kept private , and safe from prying eyes . <p> If you check out our backup reviews , - you 'll notice that we always spend some time finding out the finer details of what all the providers do in terms of backup encryption when we check out their services . The purpose of this article is to explain what all the terminology means , to help you make an informed decision about the kind of backup encryption you want and need . <h> Backup Encryption : The Basics <p> Almost all online backup providers perform at least some form of encryption on your- data . This is primarily so its safe from interception while you upload it . <p> At a very minimal level , this means your data is encrypted during data transfer . However , there 's much more to backup encryption that this . What you really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what happens to your stored data in terms of encryption , and also whether your data is encrypted before it even leaves your computer . <p> Let 's start there then , with the " gold standard " for backup encryption known as " end-to-end encryption . " <h> End-to-end backup encryption <p> If a provider uses end-to-end encryption , the backup software encrypts the data you wish to backup before it even leaves your computer and begins its electronic journey to your providers servers . Once there , it remains encrypted . Providers that use this kind of secure backup encryption include Backblaze , iDrive and CrashPlan . <p> Its even possible to go one step further than this with a zero-knowledge backup- provider such as SpiderOak . Zero-knowledge providers use end-to-end encryption- and do n't  even hold the encryption keys to- decrypt the data you store on their servers . Even if the NSA turned up at their data center with a warrant , they would n't be able to get to your data without the credentials that only you know . <p> Depending on your own stance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dagger , " but its a good way to illustrate the ultimate in backup encryption . Zero-knowledge backup may not appeal to you if you 're someone with a tendency to lose passwords , as not even the providers staff will be able to get you into your data if you lock yourself out of it ! <p> So , stepping down to the next rung of the ladder , we have end-to-end encryption but without the zero-knowledge element . This is still very secure , but generally means that the provider ( and some of its staff ) could see your data if it chose to . - Obviously this highlights the need to choose a trustworthy provider ( and our reviews can help with that ) , but this is a good middle ground between privacy and usability . <h> Online backup vs. cloud storage <p> As we step further down that ladder , we lose more and more in terms of privacy . Without end-to-end encryption , data is encrypted during transit but not before , increasing the potential for data to be intercepted by some kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the other end , you can have data that 's stored in unencrypted form once its completed its journey . <p> At this juncture , it makes sense to emphasise the difference between online backup services and cloud storage . <p> Although boundaries are often blurred between these services , cloud storage services such as Google Drive and Dropbox- are more about storage and collaboration than traditional backup services , which are about keeping a safe and secure copy of your data . <p> These cloud storage services are also largely at the bottom of the pile when it comes to backup encryption . Although there is some level of " at rest " encryption in place with most services , these are far removed from the zero-knowledge backup services described above and as news stories prove , data breaches do sometimes occur . <h> DIY Backup Encryption <p> If you wish to take backup encryption " into your own hands " there is another option open to you . You can encrypt your data yourself before you send it up to your chosen backup or cloud service provider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make use of the collaborative sharing powers of something like Dropbox , but also store some self-encrypted files on your account . <p> Use VeraCrypt to create an encrypted " container " in which to store all the files you wish to keep private . This container takes the same form as any other file on your computer , but is fully encrypted and garbled without your encryption keys . <p> Upload this file to your chosen backup or cloud storage service , resulting in a backed-up copy of all of your secret files , which can not be accessed without your credentials , even if the file is intercepted at any point . <h> A note on backup disk encryption <p> If you create local backups using something like Apples Time Machine or the Backup and Restore functionality built into Microsoft Windows , these backups are not encrypted by default . Therefore , if someone steals a backup drive from your home or your bag , your data is easily accessible . <p> You have various options here ; Adding encryption to- Time Machine backups is a simple question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple with Windows , but only if you have an " Ulimate " version of the operating system ( or " Professional " in the case of Windows 10 ) . <p> Another option for you is to use VeraCrypt or similar , as described above , to handle backup disk encryption . The key point is not to invest loads of time in ensuring maximum privacy and security for your online backup , only to leave an unencrypted backup drive next to your computer as easy pickings for a thief ! <h> Backup Encryption : Conclusion <p> Hopefully , this explanatory article has given you the information you need to make the right decisions about backup encryption . <p> Some people wont feel the need for zero-knowledge backup ; Others will be prepared to sacrifice end-to-end encryption for the convenience of Dropbox ; Many will fall somewhere in the middle . <p> Now you know what the terminiology all means , our online backup reviews would be the ideal next port of call to find a service that fits your requirements perfectly . <p> Written by Ben TaylorBen was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ropes on BBC Micros , before moving on to Atari STs and IBM compatibles .

That said , if you do n't mind coughing up the cash , we think you 'll find yourself more than satisfied with what the cloud backup service has to offer . You can read our detailed JustCloud review below or sign up now . <p> Please be sure to take note that JustCloud pricing may vary slightly depending on the conversion rate at the time of purchase . Also , prices are subject to VAT , which will be charged at your local rate . <h> Extras <h> Discounts <p> JustCloud frequently offers initial term discount promotions for new users , which automatically renew at the regular non-discounted renew after the end of their first subscription term . <p> In addition , once users are signed up they are qualified for up to 250 MB of free bonus space , which they can earn by doing things such as inviting friends and family to signup ( 100 MB per referral ) , trying out new features like file sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and posting on social media about JustCloud ( 100 MB per post ) . They also offer a loyalty bonus , wherein users earn 1 GB per month of being a JustCloud customer . <h> Free trial <p> When you sign up for a JustCloud free trial , you receive instant access to a free account with 1 GB of storage space and a 15 MB sync folder . This is lower than average ( Google Drive offers 15 GB of free storage , for example ) but is still enough for users to get a feel for the service . <p> Unlike some online backup service providers , who require credit card details upon signing up for a trial , JustCloud requires only your name and email address , which means that you do n't have to worry about being charged if you ultimately decide that the service is n't for you . <h> Money-back guarantee <p> JustCloud touts an anytime money-back guarantee , promising to refund customers with no questions asked at any point during their subscription terms . <p> A little bit of digging on our end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge termination fees , with no specific numbers given . Also , their money-back guarantee does not apply to the vast majority of their add-on features , which unfortunately make up the bulk of their services . <h> Hidden costs <p> The huge number of hidden costs at JustCloud is the service 's biggest caveat . <p> While their lengthy list of add-ons can be found on JustCloud 's pricing page , the fact that you even need to purchase add-ons to use many of the advertised features is conspicuously absent from the rest of the website . <p> All add-ons are optional ; however , users will want to opt-in if they want their accounts to have anything more than very basic functionality . To make matters even worse , all add-ons can only be purchased on an annual basis . The result will be a subscription that far exceeds the yearly price that 's advertised . <p> To add insult to injury " as was mentioned above " add-ons are not included in JustCloud 's money-back guarantee , meaning that you wo n't be refunded for all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . To make sure that you do n't end up signing up for JustCloud only to find out that your desired features come with a surplus price tag , be sure to compare the add-ons listed on their aforementioned pricing page with those mentioned on their features page . <h> Business plans <p> In addition to their personal plans , JustCloud also offers a range of business plans . <p> Business plans are currently enjoying a 20% off promotion , clocking in at $33.39 a month for a standard business plan , and $66.84 a month for their enterprise plan . <p> Should businesses wish to customize their plans , it will " unsurprisingly " come at a price . Each additional computer over the five given will cost business plan users $5.52 per month , and each additional 100 GB of storage space in addition to the 100 GB that 's included will cost the same . For enterprises , who receive 20 computers and 500 GB of space , it costs $3.29 per additional computer per month , and $5.52 per additional 100 GB of space per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable features for what they pay . Some of them are shared with the personal plans ( such as the 256-bit encryption and free mobile device apps ) , while others like the 100% automated backups and administrative control panel are unique to business plans . <p> For more information , check out the dedicated business page on JustCloud 's website . <h> Payment methods <h> How does JustCloud compare to the competition ? <p> Both JustCloud 's pro plan and premium plan fall into the average online data storage subscription cost of $5 to $12 a month ( though consumers typically get more space from providers for those prices ) . Also , if and when you use any of JustCloud 's add-ons , the monthly price will rise , making JustCloud 's full range of features much more expensive than those of most other online backup providers . <h> Features <h> Online backup or Cloud storage ? <p> Cloud storage <p> Because its storage space is limited and it places an emphasis on syncing and sharing files , JustCloud is best classified as cloud storage . That said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a little into online backup territory . <p> If you 'd like to learn more about the precise differences between these two kinds of backup , check out our detailed section on the subject in our Ultimate Backup Guide . <h> About JustCloud <p> JustCloud lacks an About Us ' page on its website , requiring us to do our own research " and information is scarce . <p> After doing some serious investigating we discovered that JustCloud is owned by JDI Backup LTD , a UK-based company that was founded in 2011 by Nick Baker ( currently the CMO ) and Brooke Bryan ( currently the CTO ) . They also own and run backup providers MyPCBackup , ZipCloud , and BackupGenie . <p> Also , we learned that JDI Backup is a branch of Just Develop It , a large parent company that 's involved in many diverse ventures , including real estate , web hosting , children 's wear and social account management . <h> Backup options <p> Automatic backups <p> Manual backups <p> Scheduled backups* <p> File size restrictions* <p> Manual video uploads only* <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in that it let 's users choose between manual , automatic , and scheduled backups " a rarity among online backup providers , who typically offer fewer options . <p> Concerning backup times , users can select days , weeks , and months . If they want to go that extra mile and select time as well , they will have to pay $53.40 for the Hourly Backups add-on . <p> While JustCloud claims that users can backup all of the files and the folders of their choosing , the reality is that there are restrictions . A standard backup plan allows you to upload files only up to 1 GB while a trial only permits a paltry 5 MB . <p> Music , pictures , emails , PDFs , and Microsoft Office documents can all be uploaded to JustCloud in manual , automatic , and scheduled backups . However , video files up to 10 GB can only be uploaded manually , unless you purchase the Automatic Video Backup add-on for a yearly fee of $40.00 , only after which you 'll be able to include them in automated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatible with ? <h> File sharing <p> JustCloud users can share their files in two different ways : 1 ) by posting public links that anyone has the freedom to access , and 2 ) by sending private invitations to others to view and edit your documents . <p> If you change your mind about giving outside access to any of your documents , it is easy to disable links or withdraw individual permissions . <h> Sync options <p> Sync from unlimited devices <p> Upload and sync from unlimited mobile devices <p> Single backup license ( transferable ) * <p> 1 GB sync folder* <p> *Can be extended by purchasing add-ons <h> Devices <p> Signing up with JustCloud gives you one backup license , which you can use to upload your files from a single computer . The license is transferable , but to do so you will have to first cancel its registration with the original device , and then manually set it up on a new one . All in all not a difficult process , but one that is involved and more than a little bothersome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra cost , more precisely $80.15 each per year . <p> On the plus side to all this , files placed in your sync folder can be accessed and restored from an unlimited number of unlicensed devices , and you can upload files from mobile devices free of charge . <h> Sync folders <p> JustCloud 's sync folders serve as a central storage space wherein you can keep all the files that you 'd like to have accessible to and shared among other devices . <p> Trial accounts have a mere 15 MB of sync folder space to play with while standard accounts are given 1 GB . If you 'd like to purchase additional space , you can buy them as add-ons at the following prices : <p> If you 'd like even more space , we recommend you contact JustCloud directly , and they will happily give you a quote for your desired amount . <h> File versioning and deleted file recovery <p> Seven most recent file versions* <p> Instant file deletion* <p> *Can be extended by purchasing add-ons <p> The default setting for file versioning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent versions of your data . <p> If you would like to have older versions available to you , there 's always the Previous Version Plus add-on . For $133.68 per year , it will give you access to all your file versions from the past 30 days . <p> When it comes to file deletion , in a standard setup all files will be permanently removed after being deleted ( though the action can take up to 24 hours to process ) . If you would like to have the option to view and restore deleted files up to 30 days after deletion , you 'll have to cough up $27.91 in annual Recycle Bin fees . <h> Archiving <p> As JustCloud does n't mirror the contents of your hard drive , you are able to move files from your computer to your backup for long-term storage . We would n't particularly recommend it though , as that would mean having just one copy of your file " kept offsite , no less " which can be risky . <h> Speed <p> Option to cap CPU usage <p> Schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep mode <p> Supercharged Backups add-on available for purchase for faster service <p> JustCloud has a nice array of options that users can take advantage of to minimize the slow-down effect that uploads typically have on computers . These include personally setting a cap on the backup program 's CPU usage , and running backups only when the computer is in sleep mode . <p> If you 're not satisfied with that , you can always buy the Supercharged Backups add-on ( $66.73 per year ) . Once installed it will speed up the upload process even more by eliminating server traffic , connecting you to a server that handles fewer processes , and further reducing the program 's CPU usage . <h> Backup network drives <p> Manual backup <p> Automatic backup with Network Drive Support add-on <p> If you 're on one of JustCloud 's personal plans and would like to upload files from your network drive or NAS , you can do so by simply clicking and dragging the files to your JustCloud folder . All-in-all it 's an easy process , but one that can become tedious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data . <p> If this is the case , you 'll probably want to pony up the cash for the $267.48 Network Drive Support add-on , which will make transferring large amounts of files quick and easy thanks to its automatic uploads . It 's quite simple to set up and if you get stuck at any point during the uploading process " which differs a little from the standard approach " you 'll likely find the answer to your problem on this handy support page . <h> Security <p> All files stored with JustCloud are encrypted initially for transfer , before being securely stored in the company 's data centers . <p> That said , because JustCloud sets your encryption key themselves , the encryption is n't end-to-end , and the company retains the information required to decode your data . This means that should your data be requested by a corporate or governmental organization , JustCloud will be able to provide them with it . <p> While this fact is very troubling , JustCloud 's privacy policy is a little more reassuring , as it states that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to employees . As such , your personal data is safe from prying eyes . <p> If you would like to go that extra mile , however , JustCloud happily accepts the uploading of files that you 're pre-encrypted yourself using third-party software . <h> Customer Support <h> Resources <p> JustCloud has a comprehensive knowledge base housed on their website , wherein you are likely to find the answer to any questions you may have regarding the backup software in their FAQ 's and articles section . <p> Also in the knowledge base , you can find a setup section , which will guide you through processes such as installation and set up , drag and drop , and restoring files . <h> Contacting staff <p> The ways and means to contact JustCloud staff are clearly listed in the Contact Us ' section of the company 's website . <p> The backup provider 's sales , technical and billing departments are all accessible 24/7 via email or by submitting a query using their contact form . People with billing questions have the extra option of phone calls to a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JustCloud 's customer service we sent a simple question via their contact form , which is advertised as being manned 24/7 by helpful and knowledgeable staff . <p> Upon submission , we were told that we 'd receive a reply within two hours . <p> However , we later received an automated response that stretched the response time to 24 hours . <p> When we finally received our reply , it had been six hours since we 'd sent our question . Not the two hours that we 'd been originally promised , but still within the 24-hour timeframe we 'd been notified of in the automated email . <p> The email we received was professional and provided us with a straightforward answer regarding our add-on pricing question . It also supplied us with some additional information which they thought could be beneficial to us . <p> Overall , we were satisfied with the customer service , though it could 've been a little quicker . 75370 @qwx275370 <h> What you 'll need to download <p> Setting up JustCloud is a simple process . All you have to do is signup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial or a paid subscription " and then download their desktop app . <h> Getting set up <p> When you start setting up JustCloud on your computer , you will be given the choice between starting your backup with Recommended or Advanced settings . <p> If you choose to follow the Recommended setting , JustCloud will automatically upload your My Documents ' folder , which includes folders for your pictures , desktop , documents , music , videos , and downloads . The Advanced setting , on the other hand , allows you to pick-and-choose which files and folders you 'd like to be backed up first . <p> Ca n't decide which one to go with ? If you 're registered for a subscription and want to get everything uploaded in one fell swoop , we 'd suggest you go with the Recommended setting . However , if you only want to backup a few select files , or if you 're just testing out the software during the trial account period , choose the Advanced . <h> Using the software <p> JustCloud 's software does n't have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most modern cloud backup providers , but this can actually be thought of as a positive , as it makes it easy to use even for those with little to no technological know-how . <p> As you can see above , the desktop app is simply set up , making it incredibly easy to navigate to your desired feature or function . Browsing your files , however , can only be done from your browser . <h> How to cancel your account <p> You may cancel your JustCloud subscription at any time by emailing their cancellation department at cancel@justcloud.com . <p> Once confirmation is received that your account has been canceled , you can proceed with uninstalling the software , the instructions for which can be found on JustCloud 's uninstallation help page . <p> A word of warning : upon cancellation you will not have access to or be able to retrieve any of the data that you had backed up to JustCloud 's servers . As such , be sure to retrieve all of your data before canceling your account . <h> JustCloud Review Conclusion <h> We liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading pricing <p> No end-to-end encryption <h> We hated <p> Hidden costs for all extra features <p> Testing JustCloud left us feeling terribly conflicted . The software itself is easy to use , offers a diverse range of useful features , and is well-designed . However , one can not ignore JustCloud 's glaring fault " that is , the plethora of hidden costs for add-on features that come free in the basic plans of nearly every other online backup provider out there . <p> JustCloud is not a bad backup provider in and of itself , but it is n't for everyone . If you 're a fan of the software and have pockets deep enough to sustain the extra costs of add-ons , then we 'd suggest you give it a spin , but if you 're on a tight budget and want a backup plan that 's cheaper and more transparent , we 'd recommend you look elsewhere .

Instead , they 're now supporting online data archiving so that , once your backups are stored in the Cloud , they 'll stay there no matter what happens to the original . <p> So if you 've got old files that are filling up your PC , but that you wo n't want to lose , then read on , because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archiving , 2016 ! Alternatively , to find out more before you decide which provider you prefer , head over to our Data Archiving Guide . <h> 5 <h> ElephantDrive <h> 5/5 <p> ElephantDrive takes a refreshingly straightforward approach to online data archiving , without any complicated folders or advanced settings to worry about if you 're looking for a quick storage fix . <p> Once a file that 's been synced to your Cloud storage account is deleted from your computer , ElephantDrive will mark it as archived ' . You 'll still be able to access the file , and it will stay in your backup account for as long as you like , but you can easily identify which documents still exist on your local device , and which have been removed . <p> One common problem with online data archiving is that archived files can take up a lot of space , and can be tricky to remove for good . Fortunately , ElephantDrive provides a solution to this too allowing its users to customise their Archiving Settings by setting the length of time that archived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not worried about running out of space , then you can opt out of this altogether , and just manually remove any files that you 're positive you wo n't be needing any more . <p> Under new pricing plans , ElephantDrive now offers 1TB of storage space for $9.95 per month with a free trial on offer too . <p> To find out more about what ElephantDrive has got to offer , just follow the link below ! <h> IDrive <h> 4.5/5 <p> Like the other providers on this list , IDrive 's True Archiving service promises to hang on to all of your files , even ones that you 're not keeping on your PC . <p> With 1TB of storage space available for a very reasonable $3.71 /month in your first year , most personal users wo n't need to worry about running out of space and if you are concerned , then you can always take advantage of IDrive 's Archive Cleanup service .

It comes as no surprise , then , that their ForeverSave File Retention feature takes a thorough approach to online data archiving , with indefinite storage provided to any files removed from your local device . <p> There 's more on offer , with all previous file versions saved too , so if you want to access a past revision of a document months after you deleted it , then it 'll be available at the click of a button .

Check out their website and sign up today by following the link below ! <h> Syncplicity <h> 4/5 <p> Online data archiving is seamlessly integrated into Syncplicity 's Cloud storage , which gives you the option to keep files in the Cloud only , without also having to sync them to your local device . Designed to minimise the storage space used on your computer , archiving your data with Syncplicity means you wo n't have to worry about hunting for archived files in out of the way recycle bins they 're just as easy to find and retrieve as anything else . <p> On top of this , you can also remove entire devices from your Syncplicity account , so that they no longer sync to the Cloud , whilst still retaining all of the files and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also choose to wipe ' these devices deleting all of their data from Syncplicity forever . <p> Syncplicity storage is fairly limited , with a single paid plan for personal users offering 100GB for $5 per month making it a good choice for those looking to backup or archive smaller amounts of data . There 's also a good free subscription , giving access to 10GB and full features . If Syncplicity sounds like the provider for you , use the button below to give it a try ! <h> Zoolz <h> 3.7/5 <p> Archiving is one of Zoolz ' greatest strengths , and is particularly useful given the fact that storage plans limit the number of devices that can be backed up to a single account . The option to retain files from a device no longer connected to your account , then , is extremely useful for long-term storage as well as for maximising the potential of your subscription . <p> Zoolz ' archiving primarily works on a whole-computer basis , allowing you to retire devices but hang on to their files avoiding some of the perils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced computer . Archiving is more complicated to do on a file or folder level , however , so this may be a solution best suited to those looking for larger-scale storage . <p> You 'll get the advantage of some seriously low prices with Zoolz too with storage plans ranging from 100GB of storage for one device for approximately $1.20 per month to 4TB for up to five devices for around $23 /month . <h> Public Cloud Storage <p> Another popular trend in online data archiving today is public Cloud storage , provided by companies including Amazon AWS , and Microsoft Azure . Offering large quantities of space and pay-for-what-you-use pricing , these are a great choice for tech-savvy users wanting to hang on to large quantities of data , and happy to put up with minimal user interfaces and waiting a few hours for file retrieval . <p> If you like the sound of the pricing but are n't too sure about navigating the somewhat sparse software , then there are plenty of user interface tools designed to make the process more user-friendly our personal recommendation goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your money . You 'll need to pay extra for these services , but with Public Storage pricing starting at just $0.005 per GB per month ( for Backblaze 's B2 service ) , it 'll hardly break the bank ! <h> 3-2-1 backups <p> As well as keeping your archived data in the Cloud , industry experts recommend also storing your files locally on external hard drives , disks , or even magnetic tapes , depending on the scale of your data . In fact , they advise on keeping not just one , but three backups one online , one locally , and a third on a network-attached storage device , or a removable hard drive stored in a different geographical location . <p> By doing this , you can ensure that no matter whether your hard drive fails , your Cloud storage provider goes bust , or your locally stored device is damaged by fire or flood , there 'll still be a copy of your data that 's secure and easy to retrieve . <h> Conclusion <p> If you want to store files for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go about it . While it 's great to have a local copy ( or two ) of these files in reserve , Cloud storage is an essential part of ensuring that they stay secure and easy to access and the services listed above are the best online archiving services on the market .

@@26492027 @192027/ <h> Review <h> Local Backups : How to Protect Your Data <p> Editor Review <p> Our main " raison detre " here at BestBackups is to review online backup services , however , - I 'm strongly of the belief that local backups are still an important part of protecting your valuable data . They 're also cheap and easy to set up , as I 'm going to explain now . <p> As you 'll see from my backup plans guide , the most sensible way to back up your computer(s) is to implement a 3-2-1 backup system to ensure you have multiple restoration options if the worst happens . The simplest way to do this is to use an online backup service like CrashPlan , - AND perform regular local backups to an external hard drive or NAS ( Network Attached Storage ) device . <h> Local Backups and External Hard Drives <p> External hard drives- make local backups simple and economical all you have to do is remember to actually plug them in and run a backup on a regular basis ! <p> On the most simplistic level , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to keep safe over to an external hard drive . This is the same way that you would copy documents to a USB key for transportation . <p> However , this method quickly becomes a hassle for regular backups , typically ending up with you storing multiple backups of the same files , or in uncertainty when you come to overwrite an older backup . <p> Thankfully there 's a far better way , with both Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X coming with backup and restore functionality built in . <p> Well move on to how that functionality works on the two platforms in a moment , but first I should emphasise that , by default , these systems will back up everything on your computer . While its possible to exclude files and folders to be more specific about what you want included in your backups , I 'd be inclined to encourage you to back up everything . <p> Why is this ? Because there 's often data tucked away all over your computers filesystem that you could miss - and- because external hard drives- for local backups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can buy 1TB of external storage for around $60 so you really might as well back up everything . <h> Local Backups for Mac : Time Machine <p> Apple users have the very user-friendly Time Machine software built into OS X for local backups . Despite being incredibly simple to set up ( it even walks you through it when you first plug in an external hard drive ) , Time Machine is surprisingly sophisticated . It automatically keeps hourly snapshots and daily and weekly backups of your whole system while an external drive is connected . It will also prompt you to plug in and backup regularly if you prefer to keep your Mac and backup device separate . <p> Furthermore , Time Machine local backups are very simple and intuitive to restore whether you need to retrieve an individual file , or even restore your entire system to new hardware . <p> Unless you 're a real technophobe , you probably wont need any help setting up Time Machine backups on a Mac . However , you 'll find detailed instructions from Apple here if you require further information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since Windows 7 , Microsoft has included user-friendly backup and restore functionality with the Windows operating system . Now , with the release of Windows 10 this functionality has evolved with the release of a " File History " feature which , dare we say , works a little more like Time Machine for local backups . <p> None of its quite as user-friendly as the Apple approach , but its still very easy to set up local backups with this inbuilt functionality . <p> The exact functionality available to you will depend on your Windows version . You 'll find handy guides here for Windows 7 and here for Windows 10 . <h> Local Backups with Network Attached Storage ( NAS ) <p> Using a network attached storage ( NAS ) device for local backups is better suited to those of a more technical persuasion , but can prove really useful especially if you want to back up multiple computers on a home network . <p> NAS devices are stand-alone devices containing one or more hard drives , and connect directly to your home network via an Ethernet cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an external drive , you send the backup across your network to this device . <p> Some NAS devices come with proprietary software , or you can also use the in-built software for Mac and Windows described above . ( It is , however , important to note that some " Home " versions of Windows do not natively support NAS backup ) . <p> One of the most well-known NAS devices on the market is the AirPort Time Capsule from Apple , pictured above . This is specifically for Macs but there are plenty of options out there for other operating systems too . <h> Remember : Local backups are just part of the picture <p> Getting your local backups sorted is a very important part of getting an effective regime in place for protecting your data , but its only part of the story . <p> If you 're going to abide by the recommended " 3-2-1 " backup strategy , there should be another copy of your files somewhere , and that 's where online backup comes in . <p> If you think this sounds like overkill , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to your computer , it could burn in the same fire as your computer , flood in the same flood , or be stolen in the same burglary ! The same could happen to a NAS device so you really need an offsite backup too . <p> With that in mind , I 'll point you in the direction of the following articles : <p> Written by Ben TaylorBen was a geek long before " geek chic , " learning the ropes on BBC Micros , before moving on to Atari STs and IBM compatibles .

@@26492028 @192028/ <p> While this means a cheaper service for customers using 50GB or less , all other subscribers ( both old and new ) will be getting less for more , as the $7.99 per month that would previously have bought them unlimited storage space now buys just 100GB , and larger plans have become significantly more expensive . <p> While there 's a strong argument for these account changes on the basis that the majority of SOS subscribers are paying for space that they do n't need , they 're still an undeniable blow to users that originally chose SOS unlimited backup precisely because of its uncapped storage capacity . <p> Although there 's still a generous amount of storage space available in the new plans ( up to 10TB ) , larger data allowances have been given rather hefty price tags the most expensive of which will set you back $299.99 per month a far cry from the service that many people originally signed up for . <h> So why has this happened ? <p> SOS unlimited backup- is n't the first service to fall as providers change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mozy making high-profile alterations in recent years .

@@26492057 @192057/ <h> Review <h> BackupGenie Review <p> Dead simple , and has good reviews from customers around the internet . If you need advanced features this is not for you , but for backing up photos and music , we highly recommend it . Try it now . <p> Online cloud backup services are a dime a dozen these days , and in the midst of all these competitions , standing out is n't really easy . BackupGenie actually plays a different game by providing really simple and easy to use software , and bright graphics adorning its website. - You can actually see " simple " and " easy " words for several times on its home page and other pages . Do they really offer such simplicity ? <p> Seems so . The signup process is dead simple . They only ask for your name , email and password . Then the software itself is really simple and straightforward to use . <p> Currently , BackupGenie offers 3 Personal plans and 4 Business plans . How do they fare against each other and other offerings in the industry ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BackupGenie has three plans for personal users , and the plans are pretty straightforward . You can just take a look at the pricing page and then sign up anyone you like . There is also a 30-day moneyback guarantee , but we do n't  see any free-trial offered . <p> As you can see , the plans are pretty simple . <p> 75GB $4.49/month <p> 250GB $6.95/month <p> Unlimited $9.95/month <p> Business plans get a bit more interesting . Feature-wise , not so much difference except storage and users limit . They currently have 4 business plans but seems like you can not sign-up yet . No words from BackupGenie about ETA of their business plans launch date either . <p> Start Up 100GB. 3 Users . $199/Year <p> Pro 250GB. 10 Users . $349/Year <p> Premium 500GB. 3 Users . $499/Year <p> Enterprise 1TB. 50 Users . $749/Year <p> It is interesting to see that Premium account offers 500GB but only for 3 users . Perhaps they want to push Pro plan more than Premium . Nevertheless , it seems like pretty good plans for small businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have a free trial . However , 30 days moneyback guarantee seems not a bad deal and we can still get back our cash if we decided not to use it anymore . Once you signup , it will ask you to choose payment terms . Available ones are monthly , 6 months , 1 year and 2 years . 6 months plan offers 10% discount , 1 year plan gives you 25% discount , and 2 years plan will save you 35% . You can make payment by both Paypal or your credit card . <h> Features <p> BackupGenie has all the standard features you would expect from a cloud backup service , if you are not a power user . If you are an experienced cloud backup expert and have more advanced backup requirements , then you might feel disappointed with what BackupGenie has to offer . It has all the basic features , but lack fine-tuning and advanced controls . We believe this is intentional because it is simply intended to be simple ( no pun intended ) . We reckon their target market to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to bother with advanced settings but still want all their important data on the cloud for safety reasons . Let 's take a look at their features . <p> Unlimited syncing with multiple devices . 20GB sync space maximum <p> 100% automated <p> Simple scheduling options <p> Mobile access from iOS and Android devices , as well as mobile website <p> Private or public sharing options on social networks and emails <p> Works on both Windows and Mac <p> If you are looking for a " wow " factor , then you will have to look elsewhere . BackupGenie is n't going to wow you with its features . However , if you are like us who sometimes wish a service to just work without too much hassles , then you will fall in love with BackupGenie . Even for Business accounts , the only additional feature is ability to back up for additional users . <p> There is no news for Linux users yet , so we are n't  sure if it will work . However , BackupGenie software works pretty fine with WINE on Linux . It wont backup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazon S3 servers are their choice for storage , and they have servers in grid architecture in multiple locations in Virginia , USA. 256-bit AES encryption is used for data encryption and as it is financial industry standard encryption , we figure it is pretty safe affair to store our data on BackupGenie . However , you will have to give a strong password to your BackupGenie account though . Security stars with users . If you just give a password like " 123456 " , then you are going to be doomed . <h> Customer Service <p> It is a mystery for us to see that BackupGenie , like ZipCloud and JustCloud , wo n't offer live chat or telephone support . Perhaps it is due to their simple offerings and effort to keep costs low , or it maybe due to the fact that most customers do n't  need more than what BackupGenie already provides on their website . You can find a lot of video tutorials , a decent knowledgebase and a user forum where you can ask your questions . If you still have questions unanswered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an email or submit a support ticket . The claim is 24/7 customer support , however we have n't tested how true it is though . 75370 @qwx275370 <p> You just have to choose a plan and sign up using nothing more than your email , name and password . Yes , it is that simple . Then it will bring you to payment page. - After you make payments , you will be brought to the Dashboard and BackupGenie will immediately prompt you to download their software . The size is only about 20MB so it is pretty small . Kudos for not having a huge size of software ! <p> Dashboard is pretty simple affair . You can control most aspects of your account , as well as view your backed up files . You can upgrade your account to higher paying plan if necessary , but we do n't  see any option to downgrade . You can also monitor your account usage here . <p> Overall , we would say that the Dashboard also lives up to what BackupGenie promises : simplicity and ease of use . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your username and password . Then the rest is super simple and easy . You can change some settings like schedule , filtering file types and sizes , and so on . But you can only do one backup routine so you ca n't schedule your photos to be backed up every hour and the rest once a day . It is a bit limiting , in our honest opinion . But it will work for those who just want a simple backup solution safer than an external hard drive . <p> You can even drag and drop files into the software to backup , in case you want to upload specific files . <p> If you want to browse your backed up files , you can just use the software to browse them . It looks like Windows Explorer and you will be in a familiar environment . Alternatively , you can use their Dashboard online in a web browser for that purpose . <p> There is a sync folder which acts just like Dropbox folder . You just have to copy files you want to sync across other devices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space is 1GB free for all paid accounts , and you can upgrade up to 20GB for an additional cost ( which is not revealed on their site ) . <h> Conclusion <p> Yet another dead simple backup service . However , reviews around the Web and customers comments seem like they are pretty happy with the service . If you are looking for something simple , hassles-free and wont give you any headache , then BackupGenie is made just for you . However , if you are looking for something more sophisticated with better versioning , scheduling options , and other details , then you will be better off with other software like Mozy or Carbonite. 75371 @qwx275371

Their main selling point is a zero-knowledge policy , which means that your files are encrypted using a 256-bit AES key not generated by SpiderOak , but based on a password that 's only ever known by you . <p> This password will never be saved in plaintext form on SpiderOak servers , so if anyone were to access their data storage , they would n't be able to make sense of your files because they 'd have no way to get hold of the decryption key .

In order to avoid any nasty surprises , we 've only included providers that we think perform well overall , offering decent features and good value for money . If we 're aware of any problems , we promise that we 'll let you know about them and we always appreciate your feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerations <p> We 've tried to cover the most important points when it comes to security , but there are a few other things- that you can research if you want to find out more : <h> RAID <p> RAID is- a method used by backup providers to protect your files while they 're stored on their servers . RAID works by making multiple copies of your data and spreading it out- across several drives , so that if one piece of hardware fails , your files wont be lost for good . <p> Its a complicated topic , but all you need to know for the purpose of picking a backup provider is that- different RAID levels correspond to different- degrees of protection RAID 0 , for example , makes just one copy of your files , but saves them across multiple hard drives . This speeds up processing times , but also means that if one of those drives fails , the data on it will be gone . <p> Most backup providers use RAID 5 , which uses three drives , to keep things secure ; so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your providers hands , take a look at whether they 've got RAID on offer . <h> Transparency <p> If you 're researching- a provider that 's ( gasp ! ) not on our list , beware of sites that do n't  tell you anything about their security measures , or that use very vague language . After all , " we protect your data with the newest technology " could mean anything at all ( an iPhone 6 Plus on lookout duty wont make much of a difference if someones after your files ) so look for specifics . <p> Chances are , if a provider takes security seriously , they wont be shy about advertising the fact . However , if you cant find all of the information you 're looking for , you can always ask either by contacting the company directly , or by dropping us a message , so that we can do some poking around for you . <h> Data security laws <p> Different countries have different data security laws , which dictate how companies are allowed to use the information that you put online , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resource on this ( watch this space ! ) , but in the meantime , if you 're particularly concerned about security , take a look at where your backup provider is located and what they are legally bound to do with your data . <h> Third-party encryption <p> If you really like the look of a backup or Cloud storage service but security is letting it down , then there are third-party services such as BitLocker , Symantec and VeraCrypt that will encrypt your files before you send them to the Cloud . Not all backup providers accept encrypted files , so be sure to check this in advance , but if they do , its a good way to get around a lack of encryption offered by your provider of choice . <h> Understanding the jargon <p> If any of the terminology here has left you feeling confused , - check out the Ultimate Privacy Guide from our sister site BestVPN for more information. - <h> Conclusion <p> You 've got to hand it to these providers they really do think about your data privacy , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your files stay secure . As is always the case , different providers excel in different areas , so we 've tried to cover all the bases . That way , whether you 're looking for a way to share a few important files , or want to keep the contents of your hard drive safe in the Cloud , you can find a solution that suits you .

Hopefully , I can help you avoid those same mistakes . <h> Where small business backup goes wrong <p> Its really easy to have an effective small business backup regime in place when you 're a " one man band . " You can check out my Backup Plan Guide- for more on this , but in brief , complementing an online backup service like CrashPlan- with a regular local backup to a NAS device or external hard drive- should see you right . <p> Where it starts to go awry , in my experience , is when small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously , without enough thought given to how small business data is being managed throughout the expanding organisation . Before you know it , its easy to end up with five or more users all doing their own thing in terms of backup , with no central organisation in place . <p> What often happens next is someone leaves the company , or leaves a laptop on a train , and suddenly the business realises that they should have done more to consider company data as a whole , and introduce a business-wide plan to ensure data is kept safe . <p> So , with that in mind , here follow my five tips to stop this happening to you : <h> Step One : Inventory your company data <p> Once your company brings in staff other than you , its time to think about all the places your business data is spread across . <p> Let 's think about what this means in reality ; A typical small business could have important data spread across- some or all of the following places : <p> Emails ( often documenting key business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile devices . <p> Document files these often end up stored on the desktops of individual PCs and laptops . <p> Contact lists individuals often have their own way of maintaining these , and its rarely seen as a priority to make sure everyone is doing things in the same way . <p> Corporate databases often these are in the cloud nowadays , but if they 're stored locally they need to be considered as part of your small business backup plan . <p> The purpose of doing a data inventory like this is two-fold : <p> It ensures you consider all the places your business data can end up being stored . <p> It ensures you build a plan that not only keeps data backed up consistently , but also keeps access to data available to you as the business owner in the event of someone leaving . <h> Step Two : Choose your backup systems <p> Once you have a clear idea of all the company data " out there , " you can start to work out what systems you need in place to ensure everything is backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like Microsofts Office 365 or Google Apps for Work- and use it for email and document storage . This ensures all your company documents are already stored in the cloud and remain accessible if people leave . Some small businesses use Dropbox- for the same purpose , but this is n't quite the same , and does n't  facilitate the same collaborative way of working , nor the same way of storing emails which for many companies contain some really valuable business data . <p> Storing data in the cloud using one of these services should n't be viewed as " problem solved . " Best practice dictates that everyone should have more than one backup , so the use of a cloud solution should be complemented by one or both of an online backup solution such as CrashPlan , - and- backups to local data backup devices . <p> Youll notice I 'm not providing you with a definitive way to come up with your small business backup plan . This would be impossible , as every company is different , with different staff working in different places doing different work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the types of data you have out there , and then choose solutions that ensure you all of that data is consistently stored in a minimum of two places . <h> Step Three : Educate staff <p> The best small business backup plan can fall flat on its face if details of it are poorly communicated to staff . Its essential that they understand how important it is , and are aware of any responsibilities that they have to ensure it works correctly . <p> What can go wrong ? <p> Staff having access to a collaborative working system such as Office 365 , but continuing to store data locally instead of uploading it . <p> Staff using personal email accounts for some of their work , bypassing systems where email is properly stored and backed up . <p> Individuals using their own methods to share files , and bypassing authorised systems . ( The use of personal Dropbox accounts is a really common problem here ) . <p> As you can see , its not as simple as just putting the systems in place . Staff also need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may wish to consider formalising staff compliance with these procedures . <h> Step Four : Keep the plan under review and consider new systems <p> Just as a lack of staff training can undermine your small business backup procedure , so can failing to evolve it as the company grows . <p> As such , its essential to remember to adapt the plan if your start to use new software and systems . <p> For example , if you bring in a designer and they use Adobe Creative Cloud , will you start to store files there , or insist that they are uploaded to Office 365 , Google Drive , Dropbox , or whatever other system(s) you have standardised on ? <p> This example should illustrate how easily your backup plan can become outdated if it does n't  continually evolve . <h> Step Five : Test your restore capabilities <p> Once or twice a year , its worth simulating some kind of disaster and making sure you can still access all the data you need to . <p> For example , you can " pretend " that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laptop . Can you get to all of their data and restore it , or are you suddenly left without access to crucial files ? <p> Similarly , you could pretend that a key spreadsheet has been inadvertently deleted . How quickly can you get this file back and restore normal working patterns ? <p> If a test like this goes badly , you know you need to put some more work into your small business backup plan ! <p> Backup plans are n't  sexy or exciting , but tidying up the aftermath of an incident of data loss is n't much fun either , especially if you are forced to " fess up " to your customers . The reputational damage can be significant . The sooner you devise your small business backup plan the better and its best done before the company grows- to the point where its impossible to unravel where all the data is . <p> Written by Ben TaylorBen was a geek long before " geek chic , " learning the ropes on BBC Micros , before moving on to Atari STs and IBM compatibles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet was even a thing . Now , after two decades in the industry , he writes about technology for various publications , operates a few websites of his own , and runs a bespoke IT consultancy based in London . <p> I am a small company owner .

@@26492086 @192086/ <h> Review <h> PhotoKeeper " an automatic backup service for professional photographers <p> Editor Review <p> A new automatic backup service designed for experienced and professional photographers has been launched by Mumbai-based IT services company Uconomix . <p> PhotoKeeper is a cloud-based service , which allows photographers to store and sort through their photos online . Unlike other backup services , such as DropBox and iDrive , it includes an advanced search function that helps users to find photos in seconds , as well as an extensive range of cataloguing features . It also offers a long-term storage option , which is absent from the majority of online photo gallery services . <p> With many photographers accumulating a large back-catalogue of images over time , storage has traditionally been limited to removable hard-drives and general-purpose cloud storage . While these platforms are suitable for use by casual photographers , professionals often find they fall short , as locating specific images can be a time-consuming and complicated process . PhotoKeeper aims to avoid this problem , with searches based on EXIF data ( for example lens , shutter speed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also be made using tags , file names and the date that the photos were taken . It is also able to back up and provide thumbnail images of RAW files . <p> PhotoKeeper also removes the need for manual backup , by automatically uploading images from multiple devices to the user 's account . Compatible with Windows , Mac , Android and iOS devices , it 's a versatile option designed to reach a broad range of customers . It also makes sharing and communication easy , as images can be posted on social media sites in seconds , and clients can leave feedback and comments on shared items . <p> As well as photographers , PhotoKeeper also has applications for businesses who want to share large numbers of images , as the cataloguing and search functions save time spent trawling through a sprawling database of files . <p> PhotoKeeper offers a maximum of 1 TB of storage for $6.99 per month , with smaller amounts available for as little as $3.99 , and is available for purchase on their website , at https : //www.photokeeper.net/
