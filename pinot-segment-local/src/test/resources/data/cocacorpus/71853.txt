@@96874031 @1074031/ <h> What Is PAX ? <h> Table of Contents <p> In 2004 , the folks at Penny Arcade decided they wanted a show exclusively for gaming . Sure , comics , anime , and other nerd hobbies were cool , and those activities all had their own shows so what about games ? From that idea spawned a small 4,500 person event in Bellevue , Washington , focused on the culture and community that is gaming . <p> Since then , the show has n't  looked back . Doubling in size each year until venue capacities were reached , in 2010 the show expanded into Boston for PAX East , drawing tens of thousands of attendees in the inaugural year . The shows in Seattle and Boston represent the two largest gaming events in North America ! <p> When the first PAX was birthed in 2004 , live music was one of the core pillars to the show . We were fans of the Minibosses and MC Frontalot , and from there we expanded both our knowledge and lineup of the genre . At the time , having that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a thing . " In fact , nerdcore music was barely " a thing . " <p> Fast forward a decade later , and were excited to see the genre grow along with the sizes of our main theatre crowd , always filled to capacity with thousands of fans listening to and participating in these acts . A big part of PAX is connection , and were proud to say were a niche show with fans that treat these niche acts like the rockstars they are . <p> here 's the problem with your gaming setup at home : One , your living room is a mess . Two , you do n't  have every game or console at your disposal . Three , you are n't  high on the PAX experience , so everything is n't nearly as awesome or fun there . <p> In the Console Freeplay area , we bring hundreds of the latest gen ( and classic ! ) consoles along with all the titles you may have missed throughout the year . Utilizing the ShoatEngine5000 , we 've created a free , easy-to-use checkout system for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best foot forward with unreleased games and hardware ? What more could you ask for ? <p> Before PAX existed , the only place in North America you could see an E3 style exhibition floor was well , it was E3 . Since that show was for industry insiders only , PAX has been the only place the public could see , hear and experience the insanity that is a game industry expo hall . With over a hundred thousand square feet of show floor and all genres , platforms and styles of games represented , this area makes for one of the highlights to the PAX experience . <p> It started with an open area that fire marshals would n't let us setup a booth in and slowly became one of the mainstays to PAX . With each show offering hundreds of beanbags for your use , these organically created meetup areas allow those with 3DS , PSPs and Vitas to congregate and play to their hearts content . Heck , weve even seen some Nomads in there . Grab a beanbag , occupy a corner and look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six rounds later a single survivor travels together to Japan as their grand prize . This is the PAX Omegathon ! <p> The tournament comprised of randomly selected preregistrants takes place across the three days of PAX . Each of the games played are publicly announced weeks before the show , but the secret final round is always a surprise . <p> Will it be an unreleased , never-before-seen title ? How about a game you have n't thought about since the 80s ? What about a giant claw machine ? Perhaps a combination of them all ? You never know with the Omegathon , but if you attend all the elimination rounds throughout the weekend and the final round on Sunday , you 'll see history be made ! <p> Wow ! That photo up there is really not a great representation of your average panel at PAX . Its true that 's a main theatre panel , and that photo is from PAX but still , most of the sessions we run are between 400 and 500 attendees . Whether its your favorite webseries or a lecture from the developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment for gamers of all types . Do you have a panel you want to put together capable of entertaining a few hundred people ? Submit it here ! <p> For those that cant stand the closed system of the console world , we 've set up huge areas with hundreds of high-end PCs for your enjoyment . Laugh at those poor developers struggling to squeeze everything they can from console hardware made years ago , as were catering to you- the PC gamer that is satisfied with nothing but the MOST gigs and the HIGHEST resomolutions . <p> Ranging from as hardcore to D&amp;D to as casual as Bananagrams , the PAX Tabletop area has games for all gamer types and skill levels . With hundreds of freeplay tables and the ability to checkout games like you would books at a library , this area could easily keep you occupied for the entire weekend . Forget all those digimal beep boops - rolling a twenty and looking your opponent in the eye is where its at !

When looking over the data , we saw that people were buying 3-Day badges but not using them for the full weekend . By switching exclusively to single days , we can help ensure that every sold badge actually gets used by fans who want them and increase the individual number of fans who get to experience the show . <p> Also if you are interested in PAX-ing before PAX East , we still have PAX South tickets available for San Antonio right here : https : **31;0;TOOLONG and Enforcer applications are running as well : http : **29;33;TOOLONG <p> Whew .
