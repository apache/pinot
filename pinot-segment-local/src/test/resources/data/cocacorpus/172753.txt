I started as an apprentice at Matteworld Digital , and joined ILMs Matte department in 1999 . The first project I worked on here was Star Wars Episode 1 . At that time we were already mixing 2D and 3D stuff for our environments . I am now a digital matte supervisor at ILM , and I most recently worked on Pirates of the Caribbean 2 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you let us know what was the selection process for Vue ? <p> SY : The VFX supervisor John Knoll first came to me asking if there were any solutions for Cannibal Island to be done in complete CG instead of traditional 2D Matte paintings or miniature . We wondered how wed do it since creating organic environments has always been difficult . We were looking at all sorts of options over the Internet and we tested Vue ( trial version for a few weeks ) . We were pretty happy with the results that came out of it . It was the closest to what we wanted to achieve , so we added Vue to our pipeline and got going ! <p> Was it complicated for you to add Vue to your pipeline ? <p> SY : Not really . It was great in that a lot of the team started using Vue and within a week , they were putting out work . <h> On the Workflow <p> Could you explain the few steps that lead from the concept art to the final shot ? What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First we receive a shot from the studio , from which we kind of have to do a sketch phase . It can take about a week or less , then we send this back to Gore Verbinsky THE director . He s the one approving all the shots , and giving us the directions and updates he wants . <p> If this is 2D painting , the next step is to do the final painting and send that to the compositing department . There the compositors blend everything together . <p> Or if the shot requires 3D work ( for instance if the camera moves into the scene ) we do the 3D matte painting . Then we start splitting layers from the painting and project that onto rough geometry so that if there is a camera motion the animation keeps the parallax and the " 3Dness " . Then we have to render the scene and do the compositing stuff ourselves . <p> If we do 2D paintings only and project that onto the cards it can sometimes look too flat , so doing it all in 3D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matte . This gives us a lot more freedom as well . For instance , if we need let 's say more 3 dimensional trees , we can render trees only out of Vue with the camera motion so that we still get the " 3Dness " were after , then we finally composite all together and its done . <p> What was Vues place in the production pipeline ? Did you start using Vue at the beginning of production , or did you start with rough sketches and then re-create everything in Vue ? <p> SY : Actually , it was kind of both ways . Sometimes we started to draw really quick sketches and then render something out of Vue . But Vue also does actually really quick rendering so it was easy and simple to come up with rock , trees , mountains and all that kind of stuff without the preliminary sketches . So yes , we did do both actually . <p> How did you add the smoke and clouds to the flythrough scene ( just before discovering the cannibal bridge ) ? <p> Matte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were painted , and then projected onto flat cards , and all were layered to give the image a sense of Volume . For middle and background they were only flat cards . There were like 4 or 5 layers in the foreground , and sometimes more . Since we wanted to give a sense of dimensionality , we cheated with a lot of cards with cloud textures to give that a volumetric look . Back then we did not have any solid Volumetric cloud solution that was photoreal enough . So that 's the method we 've always used and it always looks fine . <p> How did you match the local vegetation inside of Vue ? Did you use stock Vue trees or create your own species ? <p> It was kind of both . The flickering was still a problem with Vue 5 , and for some shots , John ( Knoll ) wanted to have some wind reacting trees , so it was kind of difficult to achieve that right out of Vue . For most of the shots it was ok but for one really big shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was get a static plant mesh and bring it into our proprietary tool called Zeno , then used RenderMan to render the full sequence . The new plant anti-flickering technology in Vue 6 is something were looking into seriously . <p> How did you match the lighting between the original shots and the 3D stuff created in Vue ? <p> SY : What helped us a lot was being able to render out with separate passes ( like diffuse pass and ambient occlusion ) in Vue , as you get a lot of control afterwards . We never render as a single pass and use it straight . All of the renders were done in several passes and adjusted in Photoshop for shadows touch ups and all that , or just adjusting the color to blend that in the original plate . Sometimes the scene was rendered in pieces and later composited . <p> How did you match the camera moves ? <p> SY : Camera movement matching was done outside of Vue . This was the most challenging aspect actually . We tried to not do that much because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular shot where we really wanted wind animated trees , so we 've brought in the camera move , but the camera was pretty static so we did n't  have to worry about flickering . But that 's something I 'm hoping to be able to test in Vue 6 . <p> Original Shot <p> Matte Painting from the shot <p> What was the creation process for textures and materials ? ( photo based , procedural ? ) <p> SY : We had thousands of great pictures from the Caribbean . So one thing we always do is to go for the real stuff first , so we started with photographs . If we could n't find what we were after , then we had to go for another method . What was beautiful is that when we wanted specific mountains textures or tree edges , instead of having to extract that from photographs we just had to render some tree edges right out of Vue , and also use the alpha channel as well to cut out that part using the same alpha and that technique worked really well . Some artists even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . <h> On the Benefits of Using Vue <p> What did Vue bring to your team in comparison with the first episode ? <p> SY : Between episode 1 and 2 , the environments are really different . For instance , episode 1 did not have any " Cannibal Island-ish " landscape , so the comparison between the two can be difficult . <p> But the thing we really wanted to achieve was to give the second episode some extra details like wind reacting trees , and something like that was always really difficult to do unless we have the good toolset to do it . So with Vue , we could simply put in some trees , and add some wind and we got really nice motion . Something like that alone I think was a huge benefit between the 2 episodes . <p> And then also of course using Ecosystem to spread millions of trees on simple geometry and just render it is really a quick method to come up with really nice photoreal mountains and so . So that really added to the Cannibal Island look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time by using Vue , over having to do the same job the traditional way ? <p> SY : Let 's say for instance you do your painting in a traditional way . You have to paint a mountain using a specific lighting for one shot , and in another shot , you might see the exact same mountain but under a different angle and different lighting condition . Then you have to start all over again . <p> We did not have to do that because we could just re-render it in Vue . Vue saved us at least a week or 2 per shot depending on the shot , so this was a huge time saver . Now we could have gone with a miniature , but the problem with that kind of work is that creating the miniature asset takes a while , and then you have to take pictures of these and you still have to find the perfect angle , otherwise you have to shoot it again ; with Vue we could apply little changes and just re-render and that 's all . <p> What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SY : What we did is to crank up Vues render quality to the highest level possible . It was not a luxury to be able to have a renderfarm to render everything . <p> One of the reasons we pushed the settings to the maximum was that we wanted to get rid of the flickering as much as we could , and we almost succeeded with that . I can truly see the difference between rendering something at medium level versus really heavy duty render setups but to get a graving look always take a while to render and we were dealing with billions and billions of polygons so that 's really understandable . <p> You always can add a lot of touch up on top of everything but we wanted to minimize that to spare some time afterwards , so if we could afford pushing everything to max to get a great quality render to begin with , we always wanted to try that . But still , we had to be realistic with rendering vs time . <p> How many computers were used to render the Vue scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use a renderfarm of 20 machines , and that was really helpful . <p> Are there any feature you would n't be without ? What 's your favorite part of Vue ? <p> SY : Ecosystems . Without that we probably would n't have picked up the software . That was alone a huge force for us in order to do what we wanted . And the wind effects were very helpful as well . <p> How long did you work on Pirates 2 ? How long did the project take from concept to finished art ? <p> SY : We worked on Pirates 2 for 10 months . <h> What 's Cooking at ILM ? <p> What are the next movies where well be able to spot some Vue stuff ? <p> SY : None that we can talk about right now . <p> Finally , what do you expect from Vue 6 , did you start using it in production ? ( Pirates 3 ? ) <p> SY : I 'm really looking forward to using the new Clouds in Vue 6 and seeing how we can vitalize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be looking into seriously . Unfortunately , I 'm not able to talk about our use of Vue for upcoming releases , so

If the 3DS Max rigged mesh being imported does not have a skeleton , it will be imported as a standard mesh . <p> Just load a rigged mesh into VUE - you can use Dave which comes with the VUE Extra Contents and can be found in the Objects Browser under Characters . Click on the figure and the Skeleton Editor displays . The bones should also be displayed in wireframe if you have that option checked ( from the VUE menu , Display Rigged Meshes ) . <p> To select a bone , click on it .

IK does affect a chain of bones ( for example two bones in an arm , two in a leg , or several in the neck or tail of a dinosaur ) . The bones that belong to an IK chain are specified in 3ds Max , when creating the rigged mesh . When the model is exported to VUE , a helper is visible at the end of the chain , allowing to control it . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> The MaxToVue exporter also supports the ' swivel angle ' and ' swivel target ' features from 3ds Max . The swivel angle is defined relatively to the parent bone of an IK chain , and define a plane in which the chain will be contained . The swivel target is an helper , exported with the skeleton , that also define a plane ( with 2 other points : the origin and the end of the chain ) in which the bones of the IK chain will be contained ( for example , if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the chain located on the wrist , using a swivel target allows to control the elbow position ) . <p> The Enable IK box can only be checked when a helper representing the goal of an IK chain is selected . When this checkbox is unchecked , the bones belonging to the IK chain are not constrained so they can be transformed separately . <p> Click to change some options like Double-sided and , in VUE Pro versions , to modify Turbo Smooth settings which can be applied to all meshes rigged to the skeleton . The other options on this dialog are disabled as they do not apply to rigged meshes . <p> Bones can be modified two ways : <p> Manual method : Bones can be modified like any other object using the Gizmos . Changing the position of a bone leads to the rotation of its parent ( except if it 's a helper ) . <p> Numeric method : Numeric values can be entered into the Skeleton Editor , in the Bone parameters fields . Just select the bone in the editor or by clicking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as needed . Unlike moving the bones manually , using the numeric method will not affect its parent 's rotation . Morphers can also be accessed in the Skeleton Editor . After selecting a morpher in the Skeleton hierarchy , its list of target geometries appears on the right and an up/down button with a numeric field allows you to change the weight of each target . <p> Keep also in mind that the coordinates are always defined in the local space of the selected bone , and that the rotation is the composition of 3 separate rotations ( around XYZ axes ) . Depending on the angles composition , changing one value around a specific axis may rotate the bone in an unexpected ' way , which is normal . <p> Poser imports can not be modified using these techniques . You need to use the reposing techniques described in the previous section . <h> Animation Creation <p> In Auto-Keyframing mode , animation is created after modifying a bone at a non-zero time .

Suggested number of passes is 3-5 for an average scene and 10-15 for a scene with a very shallow DOF . <p> As you will see , the way the render in progress is displayed is different than for distributed ray-tracing . It is a good way of detecting the use of Hybrid 2.5D blurring effects . <p> If your scene does not contain any animation or any depth of field , the distributed ray-tracing method will be used regardless of whether you selected Hybrid 2.5D .

@@74102042 @2802042/ <h> Vue in Spartacus : " Vengeance " &amp; " War of the Damned " <p> Production of Spartacus posed unprecedented challenges ; indeed , the logistics of successfully tracking and producing thousands of shots in less than twelve months were quite an achievement . In this spotlight we will see how Vue was an essential component of the solution . <p> We had the privilege of discussing the production of Spartacus with the show 's VFX Art Director Peter Baustaedter , and Jean-Baptiste Verdier , the team 's VFX Matte Painter . <h> Production Background <p> Over the 39-episode , four-season series of Spartacus 13,255 VFX shots were created . In the final season there were 4,350 VFX shots , and the epic 53-minute series finale featured 935 VFX shots . <p> The TV series follows the story of Spartacus , a Thracian gladiator , who was one of the slave leaders in the Third Servile War , a major slave uprising against the Roman Republic . <p> While the visual effects shots were by far not as complex as in the average summer tent pole movie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing thousands of shots in less than twelve months were quite a challenge . <p> Where , in a feature production there is ample time for R&amp;D , the Spartacus VFX team was thrown into the project head first . Since time was so limited , picking the correct methodology was of the essence . Even a seemingly insignificant wrong choice had the potential to snowball into a major headache through the course of a season . <p> Watch the full Vue in Spartacus making-of <h> Missions Given and Workflow <p> The main tasks of the VFX art department were the following : creating concepts for environments and effects , creating environment assets like matte paintings or 2.5D , 360 degree layered environments . Another important part was to come up with look development key art for all VFX sequences of an episode . <p> Additionally , the VFX art director was involved in color grading and look continuity of the VFX shots . Peter also accompanied the VFX supervisor to different vendors for shot reviews and was the artistic liaison to other departments of the production . <p> Next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for gathering environment reference - one of the few cases where a camera actually ventured outside the studio . <p> During the entire production of Seasons 2 and 3 , Vue was used in many capacities - from creating quick concepts and lighting studies to fully fledged 360 degree , multi-layered environments . Vue 's great looking synthetic water was also used for one or the other shot . <h> Season 2 " Vengeance " <p> Peter Baustaedter : In pre-production , I used Vue to quickly design environment concepts to be presented to the production designer and executive producer . <p> For example , I imported geo from the art department so I had their set design as a base . I then quickly whipped up a landscape , vegetation and a nice atmosphere to give the concept an appropriate dimension . The render is refined and nudged into the final direction by a few Photoshop manipulations . <p> These two images are early concepts for a forest featured in episode 3 and 4 . <p> This is one of the earliest concepts that were created in Vue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here we see a later concept of the forest , closer to what we see in episodes 3 and 4 of season 2 . <p> For the forest , the production designer wanted a very stylized look . That 's why you ca n't see any real branches in the second image - which was one of his requirements . Vue was a great tool for me to quickly realize different ideas for environments with realistic lighting . This quick turnaround allowed me to run through many iterations . <p> The other example is an early version of " The Road " environment from the beginning of episode 1 . This was the first time that the show ventured " outside " and left the walled in sets of the Ludus and the city of Capua behind . <p> We quickly needed to come up with a design for a 360 environment that fit the set and worked in all directions . The background was to be mostly sky with some mountains in one direction , so the audience had an easier time knowing where they were looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , simplified look . <p> I rendered out a spherical image , mapped it onto a sphere and created a quicktime with a 360 degree camera move . Very simple , but during the design meetings I could just point the animation in the right direction to illustrate our discussions . <p> Road spherical 21mm <p> Season 2 Episode 1 - Road Sequence <p> In general , Season 2 was a challenge for the newly assembled team , since there were several legacy issues that carried over from the previous seasons . <p> Because of the pace , there were no real opportunities to change a lot of approaches from scratch . ' Field modifications ' during the production took care of the most pressing issues to satisfy the new demands of season 2 . <p> For this reason " Vengeance " mostly employs matte paintings - but some of them are severely oversized , projected and extensively layered to accommodate multiple shots and views in a scene . <p> Jean-Baptiste Verdier : At the beginning , I was mainly doing look development , using assets and other approved elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pretty soon I was assigned my first matte painting which was an establishing shot of the Ludus at night , occupied by Roman soldiers . <p> Vue render / Matte painting . <p> The geometry of the Ludus and the terrain was provided by the art department , but there were no 3d tents available , so we decided to create them using simple geometry and cloth simulation . <p> The animation of the wind on the cloths allowed us to generate variations in the models . <p> The scene was set up externally and then imported to Vue for rendering . It was really easy to get the mood of the scene in Vue just by playing with light , atmosphere and materials from the collections . <p> Once the render was approved , I started the painting using the lighting established in Vue as a guide . The final matte painting is the result of the combination of many textures and photographs merged with the initial render . <p> During the painting work , it was important to keep the different elements layered , so that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move or to insert any other elements . <p> In terms of productivity , it 's really important to always think 3d when you create a matte painting , even if the final shot is supposed to be static because you never know if someone is going to change their mind . The different layers and passes were also necessary for the compositor to integrate live elements in the shot like torches , soldiers and horses . <p> Ludus - Final shot <p> The next shot I would like to talk about is part of the opening sequence of the last episode of the season 2 . Spartacus and his friends have escaped from the temple to the top of Vesuvius and Roman troops have established their camp at the bottom of the volcano , blocking the only existing exit . Spartacus is trying to find a way to escape again and climbs halfway down the volcano to observe the Roman camp . <p> The point of view for this sequence is located quite high , looking down . It was important for this view that everything was very recognizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catapults since they are locations where action is going to happen later in the episode . <p> Opening sequence of the final episode of season 2 <p> We did a basic track of the shot . Then we created a camera covering the visible area and we started to import the various basic elements of the environment provided by the art department . As most of those elements were low poly , we spent some time to improve the geometry of some of the objects . <p> Then , once the scene was correctly established , we exported everything to Vue , the geometry and the cameras . <p> I started working on the lighting and atmosphere first to match the lighting and mood of the plate . Our executive producer wanted to see the whole landscape up to the horizon , there was no way to hide things in the darkness or in haze . Even during a night shot , important elements must be visible and easy to spot for the audience to get story points across . What good is a nice matte painting if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matte painting <p> The second task in this scene was to create the forest where the Romans had established their camp . <p> The camp had to keep this very strict shape and organisation but it also had to show some variations due to the topology of the natural environment . The ecosystem painter in Vue was a great help for that and the perfect tool for this task . It was easy to paint a lot of trees with variations and shape the camp grounds to exactly meet the requirements of this scene . <p> Once the forest was completed , I created all the lights in the camp , small camp fires and torches , using Vue point lights . <p> They worked great even if I would have loved more settings to tweak them individually . <p> The re-lighting feature in the version of Vue that we used was very helpful , I was able to export several versions of the render with various colors and intensities for the lights . Then it became very easy in Photoshop to superimpose the renders as layers and create diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Final matte painting <p> I applied simple procedural materials from the Vue library to the rest of the geo because I knew that I was going to be covering those areas with photographic material . <p> We know that Vue can do a great job using procedural materials , but in this case we did n't have the time to experiment and to render more detailed and time-intensive images . That 's where matte painting comes in . <p> The matte painting in Photoshop was the last part of the process for this sequence . Vue provided us the base of the environment and then photographs were mainly used to cover the CG aspect of the render . The photos were taken by our VFX Art Director Peter Baustaedter who went on an helicopter trip in several locations in New Zealand so that we could build a complete photo library for the season . <h> Season 3 " War of the Damned " <p> The VFX team started working on the final season of Spartacus : War of the Damned in February 2012 and the production allowed 5 weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now even more challenging environments . <p> Since we had to deliver our assets to different vendors , that had different internal pipelines , we also needed to come up with a standardized way of delivering our setups . The issue to be careful about was to keep our environments flexible enough , without overcomplicating things . <p> Pre-production research in Vue to get convincing rock shaders for the Sinuessa harbour and coastal environment <p> Pre-production research in Vue to get a convincing ocean/water shader and animation for the Sinuessa harbour and coastal environment <p> Water shader rendered in Vue <p> Pre-production time was also used to start working on key environments from the early episodes of the season . This was important not only to get an early start , but also to troubleshoot our proposed technical solutions . <p> Vue was used a lot during this period to find the appropriate look for rocks , cliffs , trees , terrains , light and atmosphere . We created a lot of scenes and presets to use during the VFX production later in the season . This also helped getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the ' Spartacus ' pine tree that we would use in our environments for the season <p> Peter Baustaedter : Being essentially the same crew as season 2 , we could build on all of our experiences of the previous season and learn from our mistakes . We also had time to integrate some new solutions in order to tackle the new challenges posed to us . <p> Season 3 had many more locations and much more demanding setups than season 2 . We had to create the city of Sinuessa , it 's harbour , villages , camps , amphitheaters , snowed in mountain passes and a giant battlefield amongst many other environments . <p> We created a simple but effective pipeline that would help us tackle all of these tasks . It allowed us a standardized environment delivery to all the different vendors and to distribute a change in assets quickly and without too many headaches . <p> We would model our environment geometry around the converted CAD files we got from the set designers . This geo would go into Vue and the artist created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We then rendered this through a cubic camera setup and passed the geo , render and cameras on to Nuke . There we would render out a layered , spherical image . Onto Photoshop afterwards to do our painting . <p> Once the painting was done , the image would go back to Nuke , be converted back into our cubic maps and being projected onto either layered spheres , or if necessary , onto simplified geometry . <p> This image shows a 4 pack cameras render from Vue , converted into a latlong and projected onto a sphere in Nuke <p> After the environment asset was created , the setup was cleaned up and packaged for delivery to our vendors who created the final VFX shots with our assets . <p> By sticking with this method for our 180 , 270 and 360 environments and never abandoning this approach mid stream , we could always go back into our setups and quickly react to changes . One time it was necessary to lower our environment origin by a 150 meters - we could easily re-project the existing painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new environment with a changed POV was ready to go . <p> Jean-Baptiste Verdier : The first example is the establishing shot of Sinuessa . Sinuessa is a fortified city that Spartacus will take to protect and rest his people . <p> We have created several variations of the same environment , night , dawn , including extension for some other sequences to serve . <p> Original Sinuessa establishing shot <p> For this environment , we received concepts and low poly geometry from the art department . It included rough topography for the surroundings of Sinuessa and buildings from the city . <p> Those models were initially created in Sketchup as plans for building the set and were much too detailed for us . <p> My first assignment was to increase the level of detail of the terrain itself , to create clean , low poly versions of the buildings and to create the UVs and apply textures . Simple building models were really important , since they would be duplicated hundreds of times to create the city . <p> To populate the entire city and to follow the terrain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different positions and orientation . Then I dropped all the blocks on the terrain and I fixed the holes manually by adding terraces , walls and other accessories . <p> Here you can see how I built the city of Sinuessa and the library of buildings that I have prepared for it : <p> Sinuessa terrain and Sinuessa city in construction <p> We quickly needed a first version of the shot for the Comic-Con trailer of the final season : <p> Spartacus : War of the Damned Trailer <p> This shot would eventually be improved for the integration in the final episode . <p> For the Comic-Con version , the production allowed me a very short time of painting once the base render was finished . The idea was to get a good render to start with . <p> The scene was also built with sculpted elements from Sculptris . Once the camera position was established by the director of the episode , it was then synchronised in Vue thanks to the Vue Synchro plugin . The light , the atmosphere , the vegetation were added in Vue which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere and the right mood requested by the art director . <p> The rest of the work is completed in Photoshop , removing the CG aspect and then adding some natural details like irregularities , paths , light breaks and highlights . <p> Eventually , the matte painting is separated in several layers and passed to the compositor so that he can re-project it onto the geometry to add a camera move and to animate the sky and add some additional sweeteners like ocean waves , foreground vegetation plate elements and birds . <p> For some later episodes , improvements and variations of this painting have been done by John Walters . He did an amazing job with the buildings of Sinuessa . They are shown below . <p> a . Vue render - b . Matte painting Day version <p> c . Matte painting Night version - d. 3D geometry , ready to export into Vue - e . Matte painting Dawn version with extension on the left side <p> Compilation of the variations of the Sinuessa establishing shot <p> The next shot introduces the harbor of Sinuessa in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two critical environments for the story . It required a lot of time in preproduction and in production to create the all the 3D assets and to create the different setups , required by the different sequences that happen in the harbor <p> Episode 4 did n't need a complete 360 yet so we focused on the visible area of the harbor . This allowed us to test our setup , before we went into a full 360 degree environment in episode 5 . <p> The shot shows the camera tracking by the boat and ending up on the quay , finding two main characters . <p> This shot shows the integration of a specific matte-painting of the Sinuessa Harbor cliff face . The initial render was done in Vue and then painted to match the set <p> Berrin Moody , our Nuke compositing artist did a great job tracking the camera , which was a bit tricky . The resulting 3D track gave us the initial position of the camera . From there , we synchronized the camera in Vue . The projection camera had a wide field of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera move . <p> We rendered this first frame in Vue as a base for the matte painting . A lot of time was saved thanks to the initial work done in pre-production , sculpted details on the rock cliff and most of the Vue materials were already created . Some tweaks were needed to match the lighting of the shot . <p> We then painted textures and integrated photographs from set in the Vue render . <p> The matte painting was finally projected in Nuke onto a simplified geometry of the scene . You can see the result below . <p> The original plate was tracked and then composited with the matte painting in the background by Berrin Moody <p> Episode 5 revealed the complete harbor at different time of the day and needed to have 360 degrees of coverage . We again used the cubic " sixpack " method described above by Peter . <p> We had to position our camera sixpack in the 3D environment to match the location on set , where the photographic reference was shot from . <p> We synchronised everything in Vue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Below , you can see the Vue render and then the final matte painting . <p> This image shows the 360 Vue render converted as a latlong image and below is the final matte painting ready to be projected onto concentric spheres in Nuke <p> Those 360 environments were projected onto spheres in Nuke . This required good preparation during the creation of the matte paintings . Using Vue was also very helpful getting different render passes via the ' multi pass ' option . Quite often we had to do a day and a night version of the same background . The schedule was so tight that we could n't afford to re-render a night version , so all the different passes made a " day for night " post treatment much quicker and easier . <p> Many of Vue 's other render features were helpful too , one for instance was the fact that you can turn off light , atmosphere , shadows , etc. on each material of each object of the scene . This allowed us to render flat shaded environments to make easy selections in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements which were going to be projected onto different geometry from the beginning . <p> Sequence showing the 360 Sinuessa harbour in the background <h> Challenges / Technical Difficulties <h> The Difference Between Feature Film and TV VFX <p> Peter Baustaedter : First of all I think one major distinction has to be made between Spartacus and other VFX heavy TV shows like " Game of Thrones " . It is the enormous shot count ! We did 10 episodes in a year and none of our episodes had a shot count under 350 shots . Episode 7 had over 700 shots and episode 10 over 900 . It 's my understanding that other shows have an average shot count of 150-300 shots per episode . <p> When looking at those numbers , at our not bottomless budget and the schedule , you realize that compromises had to be made every step of the way . I think our team did an excellent job of keeping the visual quality as high as possible given these circumstances . <p> We had to simplify everything . I kept reminding myself that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " - meaning not to be realistic about our limitations and heading towards grand solutions that would get us into big trouble because they were either unreliable or took too much time to finish . <p> As general rule we would go for the most simple solution first , leaving a path open to ' escalate ' to a more complex approach should circumstances require and the schedule allow it . <p> Certain shots , like establishing shots or key events would then be pushed even further to be " money shots " . <p> We approached all of our challenges that way . I have to say we never really got into trouble . Of course there were a couple of ugly shots here and there , a couple of close calls , but we always delivered and kept to a minimum standard which we never really broke . <p> Vue render <p> Final matte-painting <p> VFX producer , Romola Lang and our VFX supervisor , Charlie McClellan , always understood investing in something that gave us great visual bang for the buck . Like buying a Vue license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both seasons . Especially season 3 where we shot over ten thousand photos of environment reference . <p> Not only did the reference help us in creating all the landscape . Since it was all shot the same way , it gave us a visual continuity that would have been hard to achieve with ' borrowed ' reference . <p> The last , most important factor is that we were blessed with a great team . At the peak of production our visual effects art department consisted of 8 talented artists , which had their head in the game and great enthusiasm . A great combination . <p> We had a few long nights here and there but nothing like your typical three month long crunch time on your average tent-pole feature movie . That was thanks to our VFX producer and VFX supervisor . Rom and Charlie always planned as far ahead as possible and had a lot of contingency plans at the ready . <p> At this point it 's also necessary to mention our great production coordinators . With so many assets to keep track of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast forward schedule , they did an awesome job keeping everything on track . It would have been impossible without them . <p> This matte-painting was created to show the city of Rome viewed from the field of Mars where Crassus army is prepared to fight the rebellion of Roman slaves under the leadership of Spartacus . On the left , the Vue render and on the right , the final matte painting <p> Final shot of the field of Mars <h> General Successes , Personal Satisfaction <p> Peter Baustaedter : I joined Spartacus when it was already a well-established , successful series . The two previous seasons had each a different VFX art director . I inherited somewhat of a mix of visual styles , a jumble of assets and solutions their different approaches had left behind . In the VFX art department , no real 3D was used in design and asset creation . <p> I think I did pretty well in introducing Vue - version 9 by the way , Nuke and other software , to establish a pipeline that did not only yield good results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly be turned into final assets and a standardized workflow minimized mistakes . <p> I also introduced a color pipeline . Previously , the vendors themselves graded the raw plates , which , quite often , led to unpredictable results . At the end we shipped pre-graded plates to the vendors , which made life a lot easier for us and them . <p> Overall my personal satisfaction is to have gone through both seasons without any major hiccups and with my boss , VFX supervisor Charlie McClellan and the executive producer Rob Tapert being happy with the results my team delivered . <p> Speaking of team , I consider myself very lucky to have been able to work with such a professional and talented team . That is actually the real secret behind those two successful seasons . <p> Jean-Baptiste Verdier : I arrived in the middle of the production of Spartacus : Vengeance and I started working on episode 5 which was one of the tentpole episodes of that season because of the burning arena sequences . <p> At the end of season 2 I signed up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cool project and we had a great team of people . <p> I 'm very pleased with the entire series of shots that we have provided for the 2 last seasons of Spartacus . The quality was always increasing as our processes and workflow were improved from episode to episode . We were a fairly small team but this allowed us to use all our skills to achieve the final result . There was a big part of the work time for discussion and creativity but we were also very flexible and on the ball when the production needed something very quickly . <h> Failures , Regrets <p> Peter Baustaedter : Thinking about the technical challenges as it pertains to Vue , one thing to mention is the , naturally occurring , long render times . It is really important to choose the right quality levels , lighting model , filtering and resolution . Even more important is , to know how far to push Vue and when to move things over into photoshop . If not careful , one can get caught tweaking things for days while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass renders , one should make sure , only to activate the channels one really needs . Being frugal is important - otherwise you end up with your render 23% done in the morning and finding that it has n't even reached the " hard part " yet . Not everything needs to be in radiosity . <p> The other issue we had to tackle was the challenge of getting geo and cameras into and out of Vue . I wish we could have had Vue 2014 already back then , because with an FBX import and export capability , life all of a sudden becomes a lot easier . <p> The reason for that is : For a lot of professional environment artists , whether they are freelance or work at big , renowned VFX facilities , Vue is a part of their pipeline . A very important part that enables them to create things that other packages ca n't , but it is never being used as a standalone ' do it all ' package . <p> To integrate Vue in a full workflow , or collaborate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and as scalable as it can be . So , looking at it from the point of view of an environment artist working in a large production , FBX import / export is a huge step and gets me as excited as the latest additions to it 's creative functionality . <p> Generating EXR files is a great step forward too , a feature which would have been invaluable to have had on Spartacus . <p> Looking back , I have to say that in general I do not have any real regrets . We tried to tackle things as well as we could . There might be some moments where I wish we I could have gone back and decided differently . But , I think we always tried to make the best decisions by looking at everything we knew at that time . <p> I 'm still surprised how well things went , not only visually , but how we worked together , how good the communication was , the cohesivity of the team and how much everyone learned and grew during that time . I consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project like this and to have the opportunity to learn so much and hopefully grow myself . <p> This series of 360 renders show how it was easy and quick to setup several ambiences of the same environment in Vue . This was very useful to get the approval of the art director and the VFX supervisor during our daily meetings <h> Conclusion - What 's Coming Next <p> Those two seasons on the production Spartacus were a crazy , challenging satisfying ride . We all took a bit of a break to recover , only to find when returning that film production in New Zealand , outside of Peter Jackson 's productions , had pretty much seized . A combination of a high NZ dollar and a lack of attractive rebates and incentives , have left us in the dust of the international productions moving to other places . <p> As alarming as this sounds , this is the nature of contemporary VFX business . Some members of the VFX art team have moved abroad to follow big productions , some have left the business , and some successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopefully circumstances will change , so Spartacus veterans can come together once more , to tackle the next insane visual effects challenge posed to them . <h> Studio and Team Background <p> Pacific Renaissance Spartacus Ltd and Starz Entertainment LLC crew had built an impressively successful series of " Spartacus : Blood and Sand " and " Spartacus : Gods of the Arena " , but wanted to raise the bar of the VFX for the next series " Spartacus : Vengeance " and " Spartacus : War of the Damned " . <p> Executive produced by industry veteran Rob Tapert ( Hercules , Xena , Evil Dead , 30 Days of Night ) and produced by Chloe Smith , Spartacus was shot entirely on green screen stages in Auckland , New Zealand . <p> Rick Jacobson was the producing director on the final season . He also directed several episodes in the series , including the final one . <p> Charlie McClellan led the the visual effects effort as supervisor on all seasons . Charlie is an experienced VFX supervisor and has worked on projects including The Frighteners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under the Mountain . <p> The VFX Art Director , Peter Baustaedter , came on board at the beginning of season 2 - " Vengeance " . <p> Peter started his career in visual effects in 1995 at Digital Domain in Venice , California , working on the movie Apollo 13 . <p> Ever since then Peter has been involved in high end projects like Titanic , Final Fantasy The Spirits Within , LOTR The Two Towers , Kong , Avatar and many more . <p> Before he joined Spartacus as a VFX Art director , Peter spent several years at Weta Digital as a senior matte painter . Peter received a VES award in 2009 for his work on James Cameron 's Avatar . <p> Vue has been part of Peters tool set as far back as 2006 and has , over the years , become an integral part of his workflow . <p> The VFX Matte Painter , Jean-Baptiste Verdier , graduated in computer science , started his career as a multimedia engineer at e-on software , working on various projects related to software and websites . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became a matte painter and worked on the movie Upside Down at La Maison VFX in Paris before joining the VFX team in the middle of season 2 - " Vengeance " . <p> His technical background helps him to solve production problems and gives him a pragmatic approach to create 3D matte paintings / environments . Vue has always been one of his key software since he started in the VFX industry . <p> Nevertheless , all his technical prowess is equally matched by his artistic sensibilities and instinct for natural lighting .

EcoSystem materials behave as standard materials . They can be mixed together using the Mixed Materials option , and will react to the environment just as other materials would ( see Vue 's EcoSystem technology ) . <p> EcoSystems can be layered like simple materials , and you can define the affinity between the different EcoSystem layers . <p> When you create an EcoSystem material , it will always appear as a multi-layer material , with the underlying material being the lowest layer on the stack , and the EcoSystem immediately above . <p> Just above the tab control , there are three buttons that are used to populate , paint or clear the EcoSystem population . The Populate and Clear buttons will also appear on mixed materials , if one or several materials in the material hierarchy is an EcoSystem : <p> Populate : press this button to generate the instances of the EcoSystem population according to the EcoSystem material settings and the geometry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Dynamic population option is checked . <p> Clear : press this button to remove all EcoSystem population instances . <p> Paint : press this button to display the EcoSystem Painter tool . You can now use the Paint tool to apply the EcoSystem , or selected items from the EcoSystem , to the selected surfaces . <p> Dynamic population : when you select the Dynamic population box , Vue will generate a few instances to let you preview the population close to the camera . Dynamic population actually takes place at render time . But it can be previewed at any time by selecting the Preview button next to the Dynamic population checkbox . The maximum number of instances and the minimum size in pixels previewed can be set in the Display tab of the Options panel . This option is extremely useful if you want to populate vast expanses of land ( or even infinite planes ) . Vue features a number of very elaborate algorithms to automatically distribute a potentially infinite number of instances only on the areas that are really seen ' by the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large EcoSystem populations . <p> Alongside these buttons is an indication of the current number of instances in the population . <p> Note : <p> Populating an EcoSystem usually involves a fair amount of randomness . This randomness ' is controlled in such a way as to avoid radical changes in the placement of the EcoSystem population after small changes in the material settings : pressing Populate after slight changes in the material settings will only cause slight changes in the actual population . If you are not happy with the way the EcoSystem population is distributed and would like to see another distribution for that EcoSystem , press Clear followed by Populate . This new ' population will still follow the rules of the EcoSystem material , but with a different distribution of the EcoSystem population . <p> EcoSystem materials are controlled through 6 tabs : <p> General : this tab is used to define the EcoSystem population ( objects that are placed at the surface of the underlying object ) , as well as the aspect of the surface of the underlying object . <p> Density : this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface of the object . <p> Scaling &amp; Orientation : this tab controls the size of the EcoSystem population and how this population is oriented relative to the underlying object 's geometry . <p> Color : this tab is used to define the variations in color of the EcoSystem population . <p> Presence : this tab let 's you control how the environment affects the presence of the current layer . <p> Animation : this tab has setting to allow you to control the phasing of animated EcoSystem instances . <h> Temporary Global Settings for Quality Display of EcoSystems <p> If you notice a slowdown when further editing your scene , you can quickly uncheck the option to Allow Full Quality Near Camera which will override all settings made in the EcoSystems used in this scene .

Dark started in the VFX industry when he was only 17 , and learned all the secrets of floor effects ( rain , wind , fire ... ) , props and miniatures . After several years spent on the " Babylon 5 " TV show , Dark turned to production art and matte painting . He started this new career with Digital Domain . <p> Although completely swamped in the production of " Prince of Persia " and " Robin Hood " , Dark takes the time to share with us his passion for Vue . <p> Dark tells us how he got to use Vue in feature films such as " 2012 " , " Fantastic Four 2 " , " GI Joe " , " The Wolf Man " , " Alien vs Predator 2 : Requiem " , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dantes Inferno " and many , many more projects ! <p> Dark has been a Vue evangelist for many years , working at Digital Domain , Hydraulx , Framestore , Animal Logic , Asylum , Rhythm &amp; Hues to name a few . <h> About Dark Hoffman <p> E-on : Tell us a little about yourself ? <p> Dark Hoffman : I started in the film industry at the age of 17 , working on films like " Dreamscape " and " Splash " , learning the ropes and doing special effects like wind , rain , snow , pyro and miniatures on set . After 5 years of floor effects , I moved on to props and miniatures . Working in such prop houses as Neotech and Hand Prop Room as builder and designer . <p> I then moved onto the hit show , " Babylon 5 " , as prop builder , designer and propmaster for 5 years . From there I designed all the props on the computer using Photoshop , Painter , and Lightwave . I also was a partner in a graphic design company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went back to building and designing miniatures at New Deal Studios . Still designing and creating my own art on the computer , I ventured into matte painting and concept art , starting at Digital Domain and working for many visual effects companies , building up my portfolio and working on amazing shows up to this day . <p> I now love doing production art , art direction , concept art and matte painting . I have worked in places such as London and Australia and look forward to traveling to other countries . <p> I also taught matte painting at Gnomon School of Visual Effects and it was a great experience . My love for films at a young age helped propel me into the world of visual effects . <p> You have a long history with visual effects and a very interesting and diverse background . Can you fill us in on some of the highlights of your career , some of the different areas of the industry you have worked in , and some of the studios you 've worked for ? <p> DH : I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great experience for me . Building and designing such strange props was a good way for me to start getting to know what the computer can do . Before Vue , I started working with Photoshop , Painter and various other tools to help with my design work . After that I could take my knowledge with me to work in such effects houses as Digital Domain , Rhythm and Hues , Asylum and go overseas to Animal Logic and Framestore . <p> What lead you to using Vue ? What spurred your interest in Vue and when did you become involved in it ? <p> DH : I found Vue when I was working at Hydraulx on projects like " Fantastic Four 2 " , " Invasion " and " 300 " and I needed a good program to do quick renders of landscapes and props for most of my concepts at first and then turn them into elements for my matte paintings . I was using Poser a lot but I found Vue to do quick renders and turnarounds where I could change the lighting and materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> DH : I have been using Vue since Hydraulx Visual Effects and have introduced it to all the companies I have worked at . When I found it can do fantastic skies , I really pushed it to see what I could get for " Benjamin Button " at Asylum FX . Most of the Mississippi sequence had Vue backgrounds and skies . <p> As an artist , how does CG art fit into your work ? What is its role ? <p> DH : Most matte painting is done with CG now , meaning it 's mostly 3D and projections now . I am kind of an old school artist and still love 2D but love using 3D elements in my artwork . I can render out props in Vue so I can match the lighting and add it to my paintings . The Ecosystem is an incredible addition to my paintings since I can use it in so many forms from background trees to foreground bushes , palm trees , as in " Australia " and " Prince of Persia " , and grass . <p> Dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " The Curious Case of Benjamin Button " <p> You seem to have carved a very interesting path through the industry doing production work as well as designing some very cool projects . What has been the most important skill for you as an artist ? <p> DH : I would say my love for films and art . I was always interested in visual effects as a kid and grew up on films like " 2001 " , " Forbidden Planet " , " Star Wars " , " Blade Runner " and you can probably ask any effects artist what films influenced them and they would give you the same list . As an artist , honing your skills on any project is a great way to learn and find your path . <p> Some of the movies on which Dark used Vue <p> How does Vue , in general , contribute to your artwork ? <p> DH : I try to incorporate it in every project I work on . Either in production art or a concept or a matte painting . When I have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which very soon , I will have on my website , including a Vue gallery . <p> The list of movies and commercials you 've worked on is pretty impressive , could you name some of the projects you 've used Vue on ? <p> For the Burger King ads , the interior of the kitchen that the robot comes out of was built in Vue with Cornucopia items , but I admit it 's tough to see with all the smoke ! : ) <p> Las Vegas Runaway Concept for " 2012 " <p> The above image is one of the concepts I did for " 2012 " . I laid out a few of the Las Vegas airport scenes in Vue and built it up with buildings from Cornucopia3d.com where the Antonov is taking off . <p> Once the concepts were validated , it was fairly easy to re-use what I already did in Vue for the final shots ! <p> You work for MPC right now . Can you tell us a little about what your day contains ? <p> DH : Dailies , deadlines and getting the paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my schedule and see what is due that week and get the painting to a point where we can give it to the 3D artist and/or compositor and see what it looks like in dailies , where we can see on the big screen how it is looking in the shot . <p> More movies Vue-empowered <h> About Vue <p> One of " Dantes Inferno " levels <p> Where does Vue fit into this ? Tell us a bit about your pipeline . <p> DH : I mainly use Vue on my own for my own elements to include in my paintings . The way I can do skies in Vue is a major advantage to something very dramatic to something you would n't look at twice , because it can render out so realistically , I do n't have to do much post work . Also elements like in " Wolf Man " , I can render out barrels , crates and all sorts of props and details in Vue with the right lighting . <p> What was the most powerful part of using Vue in your workflow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The easy render time and work flow . For both concept and matte painting work , it has become such a powerful and much needed tool in the industry and it is being introduced to more companies . The artists here at MPC are really getting into what it can really do . Especially the skies , which we are doing tests for the new feature coming up . <p> Vue level concept for " Dantes Inferno " <p> What do you consider to be the most fundamental difference between Vue and traditional 3d programs ? <p> DH : Probably the easy and intuitive interface and render times . Also the plant and EcoSystems are a much needed and highly applauded addition to any DMP ( Digital Matte Painting ) team that most 3D software do n't give you . <p> What is your favorite new feature or features of Vue ? <p> DH : The Metablobs and Hypertextures are a great new feature as well as the new Spectral atmosphere settings . <p> Dark used Vue and Photoshop to create the sky matte painting from " The Curious Case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vue ( and do you need training ? ) And what would you like to learn next ? <p> DH:A long time ago , I used to use another landscape program for prop design and my own art , so the Vue interface was a next step up and it is very intuitive and easy to learn . The first time I used Vue I used it basically for props and elements for my concepts and matte paintings but now I have dug even further into what it is really capable of and love it even more . <p> I read that you have taught " Matte Painting " at Gnomon , was Vue part of the course ? <p> DH : I would have loved to but we did n't have it included in the software that I was teaching . I did tell them about it and highly recommended that they look into it . <p> Would you recommend Vue to other artists , and why ? <p> DH : I have and they are using it . I 'm not sure how many artists I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased the full package . It did n't take much to sell them on what it can do for the industry .

When a new node is created , it has no connections defined . The connection tab name is then Add Children and tab is empty , featuring just one button . Add Children Clicking on the Add Children button the this tab opens a menu with geometry nodes as well as Add influencing children . Selecting one of these creates a new Connections tab with parameters defining connection points to which child instances are connected . In connection tab you can define how many connections points should be on segment , how they should be arranged , in which directions they should point etc ... You can imagine connection points as virtual ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected . <p> Connection points are like socket plugs <p> Those plugs have their position , direction , and they can also control how much sap is delivered to connected objects . <h> Distribution <p> Manages the number of connections , and how they are distributed over the segment length . <p> Number : Defines the quantity of connections . <p> Per length : The quantity of connections can be absolute , or relative to segment length if Per length is checked . <p> Number of connections : Absolute &amp; Relative <p> ( Notice that final amount of connections can be also influenced by parameters in parent nodes like sap or density . ) <p> Soft insert : Controls the children distribution behavior in case the child instances number has a fractional part . To some point this can simulate the growth of child branches on parent branch . <p> None , use rounded number : the child instances number fractional part is removed . <p> Offset fractional part : an extra child instance is generated and it is placed according to the fractional part of the child instances number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance is generated and its dimensions ( length , radius , scale ... ) are scaled down according to the fractional part of the child instances number . <p> Random : an extra child instance is generated randomly according to the fractional part of the child instances number . <p> Start mode : specifies how the value Start parameter ( below ) should be interpreted . <p> Relative : the value is a ratio between 0 ( the root ) and 1 ( the end ) ; <p> Absolute from start : the value is a raw distance , starting from the root of the segment ; <p> Absolute from end : the value is a raw distance , starting from the end of the segment . <p> Start : Lower limit to where connections should be created . <p> End mode : specifies how the value End parameter ( below ) should be interpreted . <p> Relative : the value is a ratio between 0 ( the root ) and 1 ( the end ) ; <p> Absolute from start : the value is a raw distance , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end : the value is a raw distance , starting from the end of the segment . <p> End : Upper limit to where the connections should be created . <p> The Start - End parameters define the limits of the range where connections should be created , in segment axis coordinates . This is handy to create branches only on top part of tree trunk , and leave lower part without branches : <p> Start-End parameters <p> Here some examples : <p> Examples <p> Obviously you have to define Start value larger than End value . <p> Values lower than 0 and higher than 1 are possible . <p> Such values outside of 0 ; 1 range will force and aggregate connections at bottom or top of segment . The higher the value , the more connections will aggregate at at top . Same for bottom , if negative values are used . <p> The Start - End parameters also define the domain for further parameters in connection tab . The domain of the x-axis of the first filter of the parameters with two filters corresponds to the start-end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections distribution along the start-end domain . <p> The higher the value defined on the curve graph , the more connections will aggregate in this area . <p> Distribution curve effect <p> Here some examples : <p> Examples <p> Example : With density curve you can define dense foliage at top and sparse at bottom . <p> Pruning : Defines probability of connection removal . <p> The higher the value , the more probable it is that a connection will be removed . However Pruning is a random effect , so in rare cases it may happen that you can get the opposite - at high pruning values few or even no connection removed or at low pruning values many connections are removed . Usually moderate values of pruning should be used . If you want to remove all connections , it is wiser to define proper start-end range or appropriate distribution curve . When whorl effect is defined ( multiple instances per connection ) , then pruning acts per instance - ex. it may prune two instances from 5 present in one connection . <p> Pruning removes connections <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original position . <p> The effect is random , so despite high randomness should shift more , it may happen that in some rare cases the opposite happens . <p> Randomness shifts connections <h> Placement <p> These parameters describe how the child primitive instances should be starting and in which way . Here you define where connections should be placed : on axis , side or top of segment , and how they should be arranged . <p> Arrangement : Defines how connections are arranged if placed on segment axis or segment skin . <p> Arrangement has no effect if top placement is selected . <p> Explanation <p> Here the different arrangement types : <p> Types <p> Start from : Defines placement of connections on segment . <p> Connections can be placed on : <p> on top ( Tip of the segment ) <p> on axis ( Axis of the segment ) <p> on skin ( Surface of the segment ) <p> dummy connections can be created just to influence segment . ( Only influence , no children ) . <p> Tytpes of connections placements <p> Since what is selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , this parameter should be considered as most important , and it should be defined before any other parameters in connections tab . <p> If " tip " option is selected , most of parameters will become inactivated , as they have no meaning for top position . <p> Move out : Shifts the connection in/out along the connection orientation vector . This is useful for precise adjustment of connected items placement on segment surface . This parameter works for axis and surface placement and has no effect for tip placement . <h> Blending <p> This section is used to create smooth transitions from the parent to the offspring segments . <p> Bending : Allows to obtain a zig-zagging shape of segment if the connections are in alternate arrangement . Such effect occurs in nature and is mainly visible on smaller plants or twigs with leaves . <p> Smoothness : Smoothes the angles between zig-zagging sections . Obviously bending effect must be also defined . <h> Orientation <p> These parameters control how the child primitive instances should be turned with respect to the segment . <p> Angle , Rotation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive instances up and down towards the segment by the given angle in degrees . <p> At 0- the segment is orthogonal to its parent primitive instance , at -90- or 90- it is parallel to it . The angle needs to be defined almost in every case . By default it is 30 deg . <p> If the connection is on the segment tip , and you need a straight segment there , then you have to set angle to 0- . <p> Rotation : Rotates the child primitive instances around their local Z axis by an angle in degrees . If the child primitives are just straight cylinders , you wo n't notice any effect , as cylinders look the same if rotated around their axis . But when you have a segment with blades or other segments connected to it , the effect of rotation will be perfectly visible . <p> Roll : Rolls child primitive instances around the segment by an angle in degrees . If child primitives are arranged in pairs or alternate , then primitives on opposite sides will roll in opposite directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Roll , but acting step by step , from one connection to another . <p> While roll rolls all branches by the same angle , coil rolls the next branch by the coil angle from previous one , and so on . Coil should be rather used with branches with simple arrangement , as if branches are arranged in pairs or alternate , then branches on opposite sides will roll in opposite directions , and result may quickly become chaotic . If you need opposite branches to roll in same direction , then consider using simple arrangement and whorl section with 2 instances per connection . <p> With Coil you can easily get an effect of spiraling branches , or phyllotaxis arrangement if a 137.5- angle is used . <p> Avoid mesh : In case an object to grow on has been defined and the segment is near this object , enabling this parameter results in children not growing straight into the object . <h> Horizontropism <p> Parameters that turn children in an horizontal direction . Plant leaves often tend to position themselves horizontally . This Horizontropism section aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this section you can define which should be the preferred way for the connection to try to become horizontal . <p> Angle : Tilts the child primitive instances up and down towards the segment to make them as horizontal as possible . <p> Rotation : Rotates the child primitive instances around their local Z axis to make them as horizontal as possible . <p> Roll : Rolls child primitive instances around the segment to make them as horizontal as possible . <h> Whorl <p> Defines multiple instances growing from one connection point . Such effect is typical to conifers , when multiple branches grow at the same height of the bark . Imagine it like an adaptor socket allowing to connect multiple cables to one wall socket . <p> Whorl number , Spread , Randomness <p> Here some examples : <p> Examples <p> Per whorl : Defines the number of instances growing from one connection point . <p> Soft insert : Controls the children distribution behavior in case the per whorl number has a fractional part . To some point this can simulate the growth of child branches on parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per whorl number fractional part is removed . <p> Scale down fractional part : an extra child instance is generated and its dimensions ( length , radius , scale ... ) are scaled down according to the fractional part of the per whorl number . <p> Random : an extra child instance is generated randomly according to the fractional part of the per whorl number . <p> Spread : Radial spread of instances around the segment section . By default it is 360- , which means that instances will grow all around the segment , but you can limit this value to have instances growing in a more directional range . <p> Randomness : Randomness of the radial position . <h> Inherited properties <p> The properties in this section are passed to child nodes : child nodes inherit those properties from parent node . <p> Density , Scale , Sap <p> Density : Manages the number of connections on the offspring . It can only reduce the number originally defined , not boost it . <p> Scale : Scales the offspring up or down . Their shape is maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to simulate plant growth . It manages the length of the offspring and their density . On shorter offspring there will be less connections . Like density , it can only make offspring shorter , not boost their length .

This tab is not available in Simple materials that are layers of multi-layer materials ( unless it is the bottom-most layer ) . <p> Note : <p> Alpha transparency and refraction are different in that transparency does not affect the direction of light , whereas refraction indicates that the direction of light is modified by the index of refraction of the material . <p> Incident light arriving on the surface of a material divides into 3 different lights : <p> diffused light , sent by the surface in all directions , more intensely in the highlight direction ; this makes the color of the surface , <p> reflected light that bounces off the surface of the material , and <p> refracted light ( or transmitted ) ; it is the light that goes through the surface and penetrates the material . <p> Some of the parameters in this tab can be driven independently with functions by pressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global transparency and blur , this can also be achieved using the Variable transparencies option described below . However , by extracting the parameters , you can drive the two parameters each one by a function that is in no way correlated to the other . See here for further details on driving material parameters with functions . <h> Global Transparency <p> The quantity of light diffused is equal to the quantity of incident light less the quantity of refracted and reflected light . <p> Indicate the amount of light that penetrates the surface of the object using the Global transparency control . <p> If you would like objects seen through the material to be blurred ( because the material is impure or distorted ) , raise the value of Blurred transparencies up to non zero . <h> Refraction Index <p> Light subdivides as it hits the surface of a material <p> The refraction index ( a.k.a . Index of Refraction ) identifies the optical density of the material . It bends rays of light that cross the surface of the material , thus creating the magnifying glass effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is broken . Common refraction indexes are : <p> Air : Index of Refraction = 1.00 . This is the reference IOR . <p> Water : Index of Refraction = 1.33 . <p> Glass : Index of Refraction = 1.52 . <p> You can modify the Refraction index of the material using the Refraction index control . <p> Note : <p> refraction indexes less than 1 are seldom observed , and would correspond to materials less dense than air <h> Flare <p> When light is seen from behind a partially transparent material , it will cause the surface of the material to become very bright . This is called flaring . Flaring is a bit to transparency what highlights are to reflectivity . It will not occur at the surface of perfectly transparent materials . It is maximum for a transparency amount of 50% . Flaring is particularly useful for clouds . <p> You control flaring through two settings : Intensity and Span . Flare span is the area around the light that will flare-up . Larger values yield bigger flares . <h> Turn Reflective with Angle <p> When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen at a low angle of incidence , it sometimes happens that it becomes reflective . Take a piece of glass , and look at it from the side . You will notice it acts as a mirror . The same thing happens with water : looking vertically , you see through it , but in the distance , it becomes reflective . <p> This behavior can be captured by VUE , using the Turn reflective with angle control . You can even fine-tune that effect using the slider . Zero cancels it . Values around 40% yield good results . <h> Effects <p> Fuzzy : selecting this option will make the edges of the object become fuzzy ( blurred ) instead of being sharp . The Fade out control changes into a Fuzziness control , letting you adjust the strength of the effect . This , combined with variable transparencies , is the key to making realistic clouds ( see tutorial on making clouds ) . <p> Additive : When this option is selected , the color of the material is added to that of the background , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect for making light rays ( see tutorial on making light beams ) . <p> Physical transparency : this option allows for a physical simulation of light volumetric scattering and absorption through transparent media . It is particularly suited for realistic glass and water simulation . <p> Thin surface : This setting is used to render thin , one-sided surfaces such as a window , with no refraction . You still have the reflectivity effect , but there no refraction , with distortion . To use , the material must be one-sided . The refraction index can not equal ' 1 ' and Turn reflective with angle must be activated . <p> Variable transparency : if you want transparency to be dependent on position , select the Variable transparency option . <p> VUE generates variable transparency from a function and a filter that indicates the amount of transparency depending on the value of the function . <p> This is the way it works : for each point on the surface , the function generates a number in the range of -1 to 1 ( -1 is black on the preview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number is then transformed by the filter into a transparency value . The maximum variable transparency is equal to the overall transparency . <p> To change the function , double-click on the preview of the function . This will open the Function Visual Browser . Use the scaling controls to scale the function along the X , Y and Z axes . <p> Indicate the values of the transparency using the filter ( double-click on the filter ) . <h> Absorption &amp; Scattering <p> Mode : specifies the desired accuracy of the water simulation . Three modes are available : <p> Fast ocean : an analytical model suitable for ocean simulation and should be used only for sea rendering . It is really fast but will only consider sun lighting and with no volumetric shadowing calculations . Using it over other objects might lead to unpredictable results . <p> Direct volumetric light ( default ) : ambient lighting is roughly approximated within the medium , but direct lighting calculations are fully raytraced , allowing for the simulation of volumetric shadowing through the medium . It is therefore slower than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object . <p> Indirect volumetric light : all lighting is fully raytraced , thus faithfully simulating direct and indirect shadowing through the medium . However , it is slower than the other two modes . It should only be used when necessary , since volumetric ambient shadowing is generally subtle . Most often , Direct volumetric light mode should work fine , and will be faster to compute . <p> Depth : specifies the distance beyond which objects are n't visible anymore through the medium . It therefore drives the overall optical thickness of the medium . <p> Absorption : specifies the remaining fraction of light after absorption by the medium particles . It corresponds to the overall coloring of objects seen in the distance through the medium . <p> Scattering : specifies the remaining fraction of light after being scattered in another direction through the medium . It corresponds to the coloring of light while being diffused through the medium . <p> Anisotropy : specifies how light is statistically scattered through the medium . A forward anisotropy will mostly scatter light ahead , while a backward anisotropy will mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost : specifies the simulation quality . A higher value will lower noise at render , but will take longer to compute . <h> Fading Out <p> When light travels through a material , it progressively fades out with distance . This is why deep water always looks blue . VUE captures such effects : indicate a Fade out rate , that is the depth at which light has completely disappeared and the color becomes that of the fade out color . If the value is small , the material will be clear , and you will see deep into it . If it is zero , no fading out will ever occur . <p> Indicate the Fade out color ( double click on it ) , that is the color of the material when light has traveled deep into it . <p> Objects placed behind a transparent material , receive light of a color depending on the distance traveled through the transparent material . As light travels further through the material , it takes on a particular color that can be defined using the Light color control . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets close to the surface . <h> Enable Dispersion <p> Dispersion simulates the spectral decomposition of light through refractive media , like when light gets refracted through a prism . It corresponds to a physical law which tells that the index of refraction actually varies with incident light wavelength . To make this option work , Compute physically accurate caustics render option must be enabled . <p> The dispersion value drives the amount of spectral dispersion when photons get refracted . Small values will tend to keep light quite concentrated , showing only a slight spectral decomposition , while large values will separate the spectrum more clearly .

Right click on the effect and a dialog displays with a slider to set the Iteration count and the effect will be applied that number of times . <h> Contents <h> Erosion Effects <p> Using the controls of this section you can generate within seconds the effects of erosion that are achieved by nature in millions of years ! <p> The Rock hardness slider influences all of the erosive processes . Unlike real rock hardness , this one may be modified at any time between successive applications of erosion . <p> There are 8 types of erosion to choose from : <p> Effects Tab - Terrain Editor <p> Diffusive : erosion is the result of the application of numerous types of erosion ( including vegetal growth , grazing animals ) over millions of years . It results in the rounding off of any sharp features on the terrain . Harder rocks are less subject to diffusive erosion than softer ones . <p> Thermal : erosion results in the loosening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bottom of an incline . Thermal erosion creates scree slopes of a constant angle . It is caused by rocks bursting because of strong exposure to heat , or ice . Although this is not geologically correct , the Rock hardness slider here controls the angle of scree slopes : the harder the rock , the steeper the scree . <p> Glaciation : is caused by glaciers tearing away parts of the terrain that are at low altitudes , resulting in the typical smooth valleys with rounded profiles . Harder rocks are less subject to this type of erosion than soft ones . <p> Wind : erosion rounds off features of the terrain that are directly exposed to the wind . In VUE , this wind blows horizontally from left to right . Features that are sheltered by other parts of the terrain will not be eroded as much as ones that are fully exposed to the wind . Harder rocks are less subject to wind erosion than softer ones . You can change the direction of the wind by rotating the terrain in another 2D app ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by rainwater infiltrating the terrain and dissolving or flushing away parts of the terrain . The effect is particularly strong at low altitudes . As a result , numerous streams will appear at the surface of the terrain . If the rock is hard , the streams will remain narrow , but if the rock is soft , the streams will be wide and the entire surface of the terrain smoothed down . <p> Alluvium : is the same as dissolve , except that the matter that gets torn off the surface of the terrain is moved down by the water streams onto flat areas where the stream slows down on and creates sediment deposits . <p> Fluvial : erosion is caused by streams of rainwater . As rain falls over the terrain , it gathers in streams of increasing strength , tearing away pieces of rock as it goes by . When the rock surface is hard , streams tend to remain parallel longer , and slowly dig furrows with vertical sides . When the rock surface is soft , they join up more rapidly , and earth collapses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently sloping furrows . <p> River Valley : erosion is a more accurate , geologically based erosion filter .

Holding any one of these buttons down will keep applying the effect until the button is released . <p> Grit : adds random noise all over the surface of the terrain , resulting in a surface covered by little bumps and holes . Maintaining this button down creates higher bumps and deeper holes . <p> Gravel : same as grit , except gravel concentrates on sloping areas of the terrain . <p> Pebbles : adds randomly distributed pebbles all over the surface of the terrain . Useful for modeling pebble beaches Maintaining this button down creates thicker pebbles . <p> Stones : adds randomly distributed round , bulging stones all over the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Maintaining this button down creates thicker stones . <p> Peaks : filters the altitude to emphasize high areas , while digging deeper valleys .

This parameter will then be available on a Published Parameters tab in the Terrain Editor for easy access . <h> Clipping Terrain Altitudes <p> The idea behind clipping altitudes is simple : anything beyond the clipping altitude will be left out of the terrain when it is rendered . This means you can make lower parts of the terrain actually become holes in the terrain , and higher parts become perfectly flat . The creative power behind this is incredible . Please refer to the tutorial on making stone arches for an example using this feature . The result of clipping altitudes is the same as using a Boolean operation to remove low or high parts of the terrain ( only much more efficient ) . <p> The clip slider has two entries , one at each end . Drag the lower end of the slider to adjust low clipping , and drag the upper end of the slider to adjust high clipping ( you can also enter numerical values for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its center , both low and high clip values will be modified together . As you adjust the clipping slider , parts of the terrain that are clipped out disappear or become flat in the terrain map .

Please note that enabling this option will limit the maximum density of the EcoSystem population , and does not mean that you will never have any overlapping instances . It does however minimize the number of occurrences of such overlaps .

If you need to closely follow a density profile ( e.g. when using a bitmap to create an EcoSystem logo ) , you may need to increase this setting . Higher values will produce an EcoSystem population that follows the density profile more accurately , but population will be slower . <h> Offset from Surface <p> This frame let 's you control how the EcoSystem population is placed relative to the surface of the underlying object . <p> Use the slider to adjust the offset between the base of the EcoSystem instances and the surface of the underlying object .

If the ray hits the surface from the inside , the return value will be negative . <p> Ray Direction World : this input node returns a vector that indicates the direction of the incoming ray expressed in world coordinates . <p> Ray Direction Object : this is the same as the Ray Direction World input described above , except that the incoming ray direction vector is expressed in object coordinates instead of world coordinates . This is useful if you want to create a function that depends on the direction of the incoming ray , but is not affected by the orientation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this input node returns a vector representing the position of the point in the final picture . The X and Y components of this vector respectively indicate the horizontal and vertical position of the point in the picture , where -1 is the left/top edge and +1 is the right/bottom edge of the picture . The Z component of the vector is always 0 . <p> Distance to Camera : this input node returns the distance between the point where the function is being evaluated and the camera , whatever the ray recursion depth . The distance to the camera is at most equal to the actual distance traveled along the ray . You can specify the Distance unit in TPF units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance on Ray : this input node returns the total distance traveled by the ray from it 's origin , including all recursions . This means that if the point where the function is being evaluated was hit by a reflected ray , the distance on ray would include the distance traveled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's origin to the point where it was reflected . You can specify the Distance unit in TPF units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance to Object Center : this input node returns the distance between the point where the function is being evaluated and the actual center of the object that was hit by the ray . This would yield a constant value on a sphere , since , by definition , all points of the sphere 's surface are at the same distance from the sphere 's center . This is however not true for other geometries , and can also be useful when evaluating volumetric materials . You can specify the Distance unit in TPF units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance to Object Below : this input node traces a ray downwards from the point where the function is being evaluated and returns the distance to the first object encountered . This could be useful for instance to evaluate the depth of an ocean and create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : because this input requires the actual tracing of a ray , it is very slow to process . You can specify the Distance unit in TPF units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance to Surface : this input node returns the distance to the surface of the object . It is only defined for primitives and Metablob objects and is only really useful when computing volumetric effects ( because it returns the distance to the surface , this input node will always return 0 when evaluating a standard material ) . You can specify the Distance unit in TPF units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Object Center : this input node returns the coordinates of the center of the object that was hit by the ray . Obviously , this value is constant over the entire surface of the object , but it can be particularly useful to switch textures in an EcoSystem population . <p> Object specific : This function is used when building materials using plant geometry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primitive axis , ranging from 0 ( primitive bottom ) to 1 ( primitive top ) . <p> Primitive section angle parameter : Yields the angular position of the point in the plane orthogonal to the primitive axis . It ranges from 0 to 1 . <p> Primitive radius : Yields the distance from the primitive axis . <p> Primitive age : Yields the age of the primitive . <p> Primitive depth : Yields the number of ancestors in the plant hierarchy of the primitive . <p> Parent primitive parameter : Yields the position of the current primitive instance on the axis of an ancestor primitive instance . <p> Parent primitive section angle parameter : Yields the angular position of the current primitive instance in the plane orthogonal to the axis of an ancestor primitive instance . <p> Parent primitive radius : Yields the distance of the current primitive instance from the axis of an ancestor primitive instance . <p> Child distance : Yields the distance from the nearest child of the primitive <p> Maturity : Yields the current age of the plant as a ratio of the maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in 0 , 1 which has then to be interpreted as the current position in the course of the year . <p> Health : Yields the health value for the plant ranging in 0 , 1 . 0 means the plant is dying , 1 means it is thriving . <p> Incident Light Angle : this input node returns the angle of incidence between incoming light rays and the surface of the object . If the light hits the object 's surface perpendicularly , the value returned by the input node is 1 . If the light hits the object 's surface at a very low angle of incidence , the value will be close to 0 . This is useful e.g. if you want to create a custom BRDF ( Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function ) for your materials . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . This input is only valid when evaluating the specular contribution . <p> Specular Light Angle : this input node returns the dot product between the direction of incident light and the direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for create custom specular reflection effects . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . <p> Light Direction : this input node returns the direction of the incoming light expressed in world coordinates . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . <p> Light Color : this input node returns the color and intensity of the incoming light . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . <p> Reflected Direction : this input node returns the direction of reflection of the viewing ray , expressed in world coordinates . <p> Anisotropic Direction : this input node returns the direction of the scratches ' used to compute anisotropic reflections , expressed in world coordinates . <p> Transformed Z Vector : this input node returns the direction of the upwards vector transformed by the object 's transformation matrix , expressed in world coordinates . This basically tells you which direction is up ' on an object , taking into account the rotation of the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily of length 1 . <p> Transformed Left Vector : this input node returns the direction of the left vector transformed by the object 's transformation matrix , expressed in world coordinates . This basically tells you which direction is up ' on an object , taking into account the rotation of the object . Please note that the resulting vector is not necessarily of length 1 . This , together with the ' Transformed Z Vector ' provides all information about the object 's transformation matrix .

@@74102068 @2802068/ <h> Advanced Camera Options <p> If you have several cameras in your scene , you can have a different aspect ration for each camera . <p> This dialog also let 's you adjust the post processing effects . <p> Current Display Gamma : This field displays the current gamma setting . To change this setting , click on the Edit button to display the Gamma Options panel . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> Changes made to the gamma settings here affect only the current image . To change the global gamma settings , access the Gamma Options button in the Options panel , General Preferences tab . <p> This dialog also let 's you adjust the post processing effects . <h> Aspect Ratio <p> You can choose the format of your picture by picking a pre-defined Aspect-ratio from the drop-down list . Notice how the preview of the scene is updated when you change the picture 's aspect ratio . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> If you have several cameras in your scene , you can have a different aspect ratio for each camera , as long as the camera is n't used in animation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the same aspect ratio . <p> You can also adjust the picture 's aspect ratio using the Render Options dialog . <p> The default value of 1 means that the pixels are square . For systems that display images stretched , it is necessary to use non-square pixel ratios in order to avoid any deformation in the final image . Pixel aspect ratios smaller than 1 will result in an image that is squashed vertically ( for projection using devices that stretch images vertically when displaying them ) . <p> Focal length : this setting controls the focal length of the camera . It is identical to the value displayed in the Object Properties panel ( see here ) . <p> Horizontal FoV ( Field of View ) : this setting controls the horizontal viewing angle of the camera . It is connected to the focal length . Larger focal lengths result in smaller viewing angles . If you are more familiar with camera FoV rather than focal length , VUE can display the camera 's horizontal FoV instead of its focal length in the Object Properties panel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Options dialog . If you modify the value of the Horizontal FoV , the camera 's focal length will be adjusted accordingly , as well as the Vertical FoV . <p> Vertical FoV ( Field of View ) : this setting controls the vertical viewing angle of the camera . It is connected to the focal length parameter , as well as the pixel aspect ratio ( see above ) . Larger focal lengths result in smaller viewing angles . If you modify the value of the Vertical FoV , the camera 's focal length will be adjusted accordingly , as well as the Horizontal FoV . If you modify the pixel aspect ratio , the Vertical FoV will be changed accordingly . <p> Lens aberrations : this setting controls the percentage of lens aberration in the camera . In an ideal optical system , all rays of light from a point in the object plane would converge to the same point in the image plane , forming a clear image . The influences which cause different rays to converge to different points are called aberrations . Negative values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into barrel distortions . <p> Barrel distortion ( +80% ) <p> no aberration ( 0% ) <p> pin cushion distortion ( -80% ) <p> Lens aberrations 25709 @qwx645709 <p> Horizontal and Vertical Film offset : These settings controls the Film offset of the camera . Use the sliders to set the film offsets vertically and horizontally . Vertical file offset positive shifts the image down . Horizontal film offset positive shifts the image left . This movement can be animated . <h> Panoramic View <p> Real panoramic cameras are fixed to a handle that you have to hold when you take the shot . As it takes the shot , the camera rotates around the handle , thus embracing any required angle of view . Panoramic views can yield beautiful results . <p> This option is a numerical equivalent to the real panoramic camera . Here also , the camera is rotated as the render engine makes progress . All-around panoramas can be achieved this way , but beware : if the camera is not perfectly horizontal when you take the shot , the horizon will undulate . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real world ! <p> Undulating horizon due to an unlevel panoramic camera <p> When you select this option , the panoramic H Angle slider becomes available , letting you decide on the horizontal angle swept by the camera as it rotates . <p> The Spherical render option also becomes available when you activate Panoramic rendering . When you select this option , the scene will be rendered on a sphere ( instead of being rendered on a cylinder ) . You can adjust the vertical angle swept by the camera using the V Angle setting . Spherical renders can be used , for example , for the rendering of an environment map . When this option is activated , the picture 's aspect ratio is determined by the ratio of horizontal vs. vertical angles . <p> Because this option is only available when rendering to screen or to disk ( see Render Options dialog - Panoramic View ) , activating panoramic rendering will automatically activate rendering to screen if it is n't already the case . You can also adjust the picture 's panoramic settings using the Render Options dialog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny crystals of silver salt that react to light . When light reaches the surface of the film , it hits these crystals and triggers a chemical reaction that switches the state of the crystal ( it becomes dark " this process is then inverted to result in a bright point ) . Once switched , a crystal will not be switched any further by more light hitting it ( it ca n't be more black than black ) . It is the proportion of switched crystals that increases as light keeps on flooding in , making the point appear darker and darker . But , as more and more crystals have been switched by the incoming light , the chances of hitting an unswitched ' crystal go down . As a result , while points on the film will initially get dark very quickly , it will take more and more light to get them that much darker , resulting in a non-linear reaction to light . This non-linear reaction means that bright areas in the image will appear less bright , and dark areas less dark , resulting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final image . <p> Auto-exposure : the difference in luminosity between noon and dusk is enormous , but we are not necessarily aware of this fact , because the human eye automatically adjusts to the amount of ambient light . Auto-exposure simulates this behavior by automatically adapting the exposure of the camera to the amount of light in the scene . If this option is enabled , your images will be correctly exposed , even if you drag the sun from noon down to dusk . When the auto-exposure option is enabled , the camera re-evaluates its exposure continuously during the rendering process . This is why , when tile rendering mode is enabled , the overall exposure of the image may be adjusted as rendering progresses . <p> Exposure filters : VUE has several filters you can use to change the effect of your images . <p> Vue exposure filter : this is the filter used in all previous VUE versions . <p> Exposure : slider controls the general exposure for the filter . <p> Natural film response : select this option to enable the non-linear reaction to light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how intermediate intensities will be mapped ( lower values will tend to flatten the response curve , effectively producing darker and less contrasted colors , higher values will make the curve steeper , increasing intermediate colors contrast and overall brightness ) <p> Highlights : control how bright intensities are mapped ( lower values will flatten them to avoid saturation , while higher values will produce saturated bright areas ) . <p> Linear Exposure filter : this is the simplest of all of the filters . <p> Exposure : exposure can be manually adjusted by this slider . If no contrast transformation is performed , the tone curve is flat , and the user can control how steep the line is . Either Map entire range is selected and the brightest rendered color will be mapped to full white , scaling all other colors accordingly or a custom linear coefficient can be specified to control the scaling of colors ( 1 meaning no scaling at all : raw colors are preserved ) . <p> False colors : this can be used to visualize output HDR range of intensities of the rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall exposure of the camera . Positive values will result in brighter images , whereas negative values will result in darker images . The value is expressed in diaphragms . If the auto-exposure option is enabled , this setting is relative to the automatic exposure value ( think of it as a way of ' touching up ' the auto-exposure ) . <p> When using the OpenGL shader engine ( set on the Options panel , Display tab ) , you can preview the results of the camera auto exposure factor and the scene exposure factor . The auto exposure is automatically updated at each refinements pass of the mini scene preview . The Exposure is only active in the camera view , and is altered by the camera exposure factor . This feature is not available for OpenGL ( fixed hardware pipeline ) . <h> Lens Glare <p> Lens glare is caused by imperfections in the lenses of real-world cameras . Instead of being perfectly refracted by the lenses of the camera , part of the light becomes diffused by little defects in the glass . This results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image . <p> Lens glare gives a soft , realistic look to the final images . The effect , sometimes also referred to as ' specular bloom ' , is particularly strong when the camera lenses are a little dirty ( because light becomes diffused by the layer of dirt at the surface of the lens ) . <p> Lens glare is controlled via the following settings : <p> Radius : this controls the average size of the halos of light that appear around bright points in the image . <p> Amount : this controls the intensity of the glare effect . <p> Warning : the larger the radius , the slower it becomes to compute the effect of the glare . When previewing glare on the full size image , a much faster approximation of the glare effect is used . This approximation can sometimes result is slight visual artifacts . These artifacts will disappear when the full-blown glare algorithms are applied to the image before saving . <h> Motion Blur Length <p> This simple control let 's you adjust the amount of motion blur displayed in your render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on the speed of the moving objects , but this setting let 's you adjust the overall amount of motion blur . It is somewhat similar to the shutter speed ( because the length of the motion blur depends on the distance traveled by the moving objects over the duration of the exposure ) . <h> Post Processing <p> Post processing is a special processing pass that takes place once the picture is completely rendered . Using this feature , you can adjust the colors and brightness of the final picture without having to use another specialized application . By post processing pictures inside VUE rather than using an external application , you ensure that the resulting colors retain all of their subtlety ( when you save a picture , the colors in the picture are limited to 8 bits per pixel ; artifacts and color banding can appear rapidly as soon as you affect anything but minor post-processing ) . In VUE , colors are computed and processed with a resolution that is literally several million times more refined than in an exported picture . <p> Post processing settings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> To enable post processing of your picture , check the option . The post processing controls become available : <p> Color correction : select this option to apply color correction to your picture . Hue shifts the color tones according to the angle indicated . Brightness will increase or reduce the overall brightness of the picture , while Saturation modifies the overall saturation of the picture . The Gain setting applies a smooth contrast to the picture . Density adds uniform density to all colors in the picture . <p> Color filtering : this option let 's you apply a color filter to the picture , as if it were seen through a colored gel . When you check this option , you can adjust the corresponding color by double-clicking on the color control . <p> Color perspective : if you select this option , dark colors will be replaced by the indicated color . Black will be replaced with this exact color , while brighter colors will be blended according to the brightness of the color . When you check this option , you can adjust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Input/Output Function : this allows a very accurate tuning of contrasts and luminosity of each color channel ( directly on the 32-bit float RGB components ) . Check the function to enable it . Right-click on the small function preview next to it and select Edit Filter in the pop-up menu . The Color Input/Output Function Filter Editor displays for changing the settings . See the Editing Filters section for more information about working with filters . <p> This editor has two tabs , Profile and Channel . The Profile tab is used to create key points . To create a new key point , you can either : <p> double-click in the area where the curve is drawn . The new key point is created at the point you clicked . The curve is redrawn to use the new key point . <p> click on the curve where you want the new key point ; the coordinates of the clicked point appear in the Position boxes ; you can edit them if required . <p> press the Add key point button . The curve is redrawn . <p> type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes , then press the Add key point button . The curve is redrawn . <p> You ca n't create two key points at the same horizontal position . <p> The Channel tab contains the basic color channels . Right-click on the filter image to make changes . This way you can adjust each color channel separately . <p> If this function is enabled , it is recommended disabling Natural film response since it reduces the range of colors . This will give you better control over the final image . <p> Click the Reset button to reset all post-processing settings to zero . <p> The Post processing applies to all cameras option is checked by default , meaning that all cameras in the scene will use the same post-processing settings . If you deselect this option , you can assign different post processing settings to all your cameras . This can yield particularly interesting results when used in conjunction with the Camera Switcher.

While this is time consuming when selected , it will save time later during the animation phase . This opens the Physics bake dialog which has the following parameters : <p> Start time : set the start time for baking <p> End time : set the end time for baking <p> Frames per second : set the rate of frames per second . <p> Edit : clicking on this button displays the Global Particle Configuration dialog . This sets the general configuration for the actual EcoParticle . <h> Global Particle Configuration Dialog <h> General <p> Global Particle Configuration dialog <p> Animation range : Automatic is checked by default . If unchecked , the default values are from 0 to 10 . <p> Domain Length : the defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate : this value is used to control strange or unstable behavior of the EcoParticle system . Raising the value will increase frequency of calculations and stablize the EcoParticle system . <p> OpenGL preview quality : the higher the quality , the longer the preview times <p> Do n't update preview when scrubbing : this allows you to render out a preview without all of the physics calculations which speeds up your EcoParticles preview . <h> Collision <p> With objects : this is collision with other objects in the scene that have collision enabled . <p> Tolerance : the maximum amount of interpenetration ; the precision of the collisions <p> Collisions with transparent surface : defines the amount of collision with transparent objects <p> Collisions with displacement in OpenGL : when colliding with an object , takes into account any displacement of the object . <p> Collisions with static EcoSystems : allows collisions with EcoSystem instances in a scene . This only applies to static EcoSystems . Collisions are not available for dynamic and EcoParticle systems . <p> With other particles : defines the amount of collision among the EcoParticles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grid : this is a world 3D grid encompassing the scene , storing collision density <p> Resolution : the size of the individual cells in the grid <p> Fade rate : the amount of gradual loss of intensity <p> Maximum impact : this is the maximum force of an EcoParticle collision . <p> Store impact energies : when selected , the collision grid will store energy instead of collision count . For energy , the more the particle is fast and heavy , the more energy will be stored at collision . <p> Smooth : the smoothness of EcoParticle motion <h> Forces <p> Gravity : the amount of gravity affecting the EcoParticles. -9.81 is the default value <p> Drag force : the amount of drag on the EcoParticles . Default is 1.2 <p> Turbulence : the amount of turbulence applied to the forces of gravity and drag . <p> Ventilators influence : the amount of influence the ventilators have . Directional ventilators are set from the icon ( ) on the left toolbar . This feature requires the Zephyr module . <p> Influenced by effectors : check to have influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ) on the left toolbar in the user interface . Once selected , the Particle Effector appears in the World Browser . When you click on it , it displays the Effector Editor , discussed a bit later in this section . <h> Rendering <p> Motion Blur : check to enable motion blur . <p> Blur amount : set the amount of blur . <p> Minimum pixel size : the smallest an EcoParticle can be <p> Render as metablob : used for effects such as flowing water <p> Threshold : this is used to inflate or deflate the surface that is being rendered by blobbing ' the EcoParticles together . This smoothing allows more control on the final shape . The higher the threshold , the less transition between the individual spheres inside the blob . <p> Tolerance : you can increase this value to speed up render but may cause errors . <p> Smoothness : the smoothness of EcoParticle motion . <h> Density Tab of the Material Editor <p> Density tab - Particles <p> The first field on this tab is for EcoParticle systems . <p> Emission flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , setting from Sparse to Dense . There are two icons to the left of this field : <p> Populate once only : ( ) : the EcoParticles are only populated once when checked , not continuously flowing . <p> Drive with a function : ( ) : click to open the Function Graph and set up a function to control emission flow . <p> These fields are basic EcoSystem fields , but have special considerations for EcoParticle systems . <p> Decay near foreign objects : while this works for EcoParticle systems the same as it would for other EcoSystems , it is a good idea to turn this off for EcoParticle systems as it will speed up the population of the EcoParticles . Of course if it 's necessary for an effect , it can be used . <h> Scaling &amp; Orientation Tab of the Material Editor <p> Direction from surface : to get a correct orientation on instances , one should set this to 100% perpendicular to the surface ( vertical gives strange , unrealistic results ) . <p> Maximum rotation : with EcoParticle systems , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds up rendering for simple EcoParticle geometries . <p> For information on any other EcoSystem fields , please refer to the EcoSystems section of the Material Editor beginning here . <h> The Particles Effector <p> The Particles Effector quite simply effects EcoParticles . It is not necessary to use it but by choosing different effects or combinations of effects , you can force your EcoParticles to behave quite differently . If you do use the Effector , be sure to click that option in the Global Particle Configuration dialog . <p> The Particle Effector is created by clicking on its icon ( ) in the left toolbar of the user interface . This creates an invisible proxy object in your scene and an entry in the World Browser . Click on either to display the Effector Editor . <h> Effector Editor <p> Effector Editor <p> Effects : use the Add a new effector ... icon ( ) on the right side of this dialog to display the list of available effectors .

Left-click to open the Filter Browser to select a particular filter . <h> Animating an EcoParticle System <p> Animating a EcoParticle system is really no different than creating other animations , except for the computations . <p> On the Global Particle Configuration dialog , be sure to check the Do n't update preview when scrubbing field . This will prevent physics calculations being made during the preview which will save a lot of time . However , it also makes the Recompute button unavailable . So if you want to make changes to your EcoParticle system , untick this box so the population can be recomputed . <p> If rendering another preview , check that box again . Leave in unchecked for final renders . <h> Limitations of the EcoParticle System <p> The following are limitations of the current EcoParticle system : <p> Physical attributes are computed on the EcoParticle center ( no way to rotate an EcoParticle at collision time ) and collision takes only the spherical radius into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There is no spring system for cloth simulation . <p> There is no fluid simulation for realistic smoke or fluid movement computation .

@@74102073 @2802073/ <p> The VUE EcoSystem module is an optional module for VUE Pioneer and VUE Esprit . It is part of VUE Studio and VUE Complete . <p> To use EcoParticles in VUE , this EcoSystem module is required along with the KronosFX module . <h> Redefining Natural Scenery Creation <h> Massive Polygon Count Handling <p> There is almost no such word as " too much " when populating your scene . <p> EcoSystems are designed to handle millions of objects , billions of polygons , yet keep VUE 's performance and display running smoothly . <h> Beyond Simple Duplicates <p> The EcoSystem works hand in hand with e-on 's acclaimed SolidGrowthG technology . <p> Select a single plant type and the EcoSystem will populate your scene with numerous variations of that plant , every single one will be unique ! <h> Unlimited Number of Items <p> Of course , an EcoSystem can contain more than one plant type . <p> Add an unlimited number of plant species , rocks and other objects to the population list , and control each item 's relative presence and size within the EcoSystem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely scatter the objects randomly across the surface , but actually decides where to place them according to the relief of the terrain . <p> So just like in nature , more trees will grow on flat areas than on steep slopes , and no objects will be placed where they are likely to " fall down " . <p> In addition , VUE will automatically recognize foreign objects , and reduce the presence of EcoSystem items around them . <h> Using Other Types of Objects <p> The EcoSystem is by no means limited to plants and stones . In fact , every type of object , including imported meshes , can be used . You can create sprawling cities , huge crowds , giant ship armadas ... the possibilities are limitless ! <h> Density Control <p> Controlling millions of EcoSystem instances altogether can be tough , especially if you need to work only on specific parts . <p> To ease up your control over EcoSystems , use group or individual layers , and create layers affinities to get the perfect homogeneity . <h> Dynamic EcoSystem Population <p> The Dynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that extend way beyond the horizon , without concern over the number of instances ! <p> This revolutionary technology is capable of handling the near-infinite number of instances required to populate terrains in the far distance . To maximize efficiency , it will also dynamically populate areas of your scene , only as they become visible to the camera . <h> The EcoSystem Material " A Breakthrough Concept <h> The EcoSystem behaves just like a regular material ! <p> You can save it as a material and create a whole library of EcoSystems , which can be used later for other scenes and objects . <p> It also means that , just like mixed materials , you can mix two or more EcoSystems , with environment influences such as altitude , slope and orientation ! <h> Unprecedented Control <p> The fact that the EcoSystem is treated like a material means that you can take advantage of VUE 's powerful Function Graph to control almost every aspect . <p> For example , use a fractal noise generator to control the distribution of EcoSystem objects , or use a bitmap to limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the EcoSystem for even greater detail and realism . <h> Layered EcoSystem Materials <p> A single EcoSystem material can have any number of layers , each layer with its own population list and full set of controls . This means you can effectively mix different EcoSystems together , and still have complete independent control over each part of the EcoSystem . In addition , each layer can have its own independent reaction to altitude , slope and orientation . <p> Layered EcoSystem materials give you precise control over the EcoSystem 's characteristics , and let you use functions or bitmaps to define any parameter , from density and size to color variations . In addition , all the tools available in the EcoSystem Painter and the instance selector can be used to interactively paint and modify layers inside an EcoSystem material . <h> Affinity and Repulsion <p> Layers in an EcoSystem material can also influence one another .

You can still select them there . Infinite planes are created Locked . <p> Hidden : the object wo n't be displayed in the 3D views . It wo n't be possible to select it either . Hidden objects are displayed in pale gray and italic inside the World Browser .

When this option is set , the object will not appear in rendered pictures or animations . It will however still appear in the 3D Views ( unless you explicitly hide the object from the views as well ) .

You can also force the rendering of all occluded regions using the option in the G-Buffer and Multi-Pass Options dialog . This is the same as enabling the Render occluded option on all objects in the scene . Make sure this option is not selected if you only want to render occluded information for certain objects . <p> Ignore object(s) when populating EcoSystems : when this option is selected , the object will have no influence on the population of EcoSystems that are sensitive to the presence of foreign objects , even if they are placed right in the middle of an EcoSystem . <p> Ignore indirect lighting : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Global Radiosity lighting models . In some cases , you may decide that the benefit of computing indirect lighting on certain objects may not be worth the investment in rendering time . This option is designed for such cases : indirect lighting will not be evaluated on objects that have this option set . The objects will however still participate in the illumination of other surrounding objects ( e.g. by generating a dark halo around their bases ) . <p> Do n't cast shadows : when this option is selected , the object will cast no shadow on other objects . <p> Do n't receive shadows : when this option is selected , the object will receive no shadows from other objects in the scene . <p> Only shadows : when this option is selected , the object will not render . Only it 's shadow will render . <p> Enable collisions : select this option to enable EcoParticle collision with the selected object . <h> Numerics Tab <p> Object Properties panel - Numerics tab <p> This tab let 's you enter precise numerical values for position , rotation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fields are color-coded to correspond to the 3D axes in the viewports . <p> This tab is divided into 5 sub-tabs : Position , Orientation , Size , Twist and Pivot position each represented by an icon in the panel 's left icon bar . Press the required icon to display the corresponding numerical values . Drag the mouse over the axes to get visual feedback on the type of modification the object will undertake . Click-drag the controls to adjust the values , or type values in the corresponding fields . <p> Position : numerical values given for position are relative to the World origin , which is the center point of the orthogonal 3D Views when you create a new scene . Clicking in between axes let 's you move the object inside a plane . <p> Orientation : numerical rotation angles relate to the object for Pitch and Roll , but relate to the World for Yaw . <p> Size : numerical values for size relate to the object . They are independent of the object rotation . Consequently , using Numerics to size an object that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clicking in between axes let 's you resize the object along both axes simultaneously . Clicking in the middle of the control let 's you resize the object globally . The Lock sizing proportions ( ) is a toggle button that locks the proportions of the object ; meaning that , when you change the size along one axis , the sizes of the other two axes are adjusted in such a way that the proportions of the object are maintained . The Show actual object sizes ( ) is a toggle button that will display the real size of the object when selected ( otherwise , internal dimensions will be displayed instead " usually not very useful , but provided for compatibility with previous versions ) . The Resize around opposite corner button ( ) is also a toggle that indicates whether the object is resized around its center , or around the opposite corner ( as when resizing objects inside the views ) . <p> Twist : Numerical values for twisting are less straightforward . Basically , they will twist one axis of the object towards another axis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to try it out . However , please understand that , due to complex matrix operations , twisting and untwisting objects in several directions may not restore the initial object conformation . <p> Pivot position : use the Pivot position sub-tab to display the location of the object 's pivot point . The pivot point is the point around which the object will be rotated or scaled ( e.g. the pivot point of a window would be at the windows hinge ) . Press the Show pivot toggle button ( ) to show/hide the pivot in the 3D views . The pivot point is displayed by a green handle that you can grab and drag to a new location using the mouse . Alternatively , you can enter numerical values for the location of the pivot point . You can elect to display the position of the pivot in world coordinates , or in object coordinates by using the Relative coordinates toggle button ( ) . <p> Note : <p> If expressed in world coordinates , the position of the pivot point is modified when you move the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object remains the same . Press the Reset pivot button ( ) to reset the pivot to the center of the object . <h> Animation Tab <p> This tab deals with object animation and forward dynamic hierarchy ( linking and tracking ) . <h> Animation <p> Object Properties panel - Animation tab <p> To animate an object , select a type of Motion other than Not animated . Basically , types of motion let you specify how the object will react to its motion ( e.g. airplanes bank as they turn , automobiles follow the surface of the ground ) . If you do n't know which to pick , select Standard , which is the standard type of animation found in usual 3D packages . <p> When you select a type of motion other than Not animated , the Animation Wizard pops-up to help you setup your animation easily . The instructions that appear on screen are relatively straightforward , but it is recommended that you read the section on the Animation Wizard to fully understand each setting . <p> To destroy an objects animation , select Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icon ( see below ) . <p> Whenever an animated object is selected ( or the selected object tracks another one " see below ) , the Main Axis drop down list becomes active . This list let 's you select which axis of the object should be pointing in the direction of travel ( useful only for objects that have the Look Ahead property , or which axis of the object should be pointing at the tracked object . <p> Forbid animation : the forbid animation icon ( ) is the topmost icon in the icon bar . As long as this icon is selected , the object will never become animated . If you click this icon and the object is currently animated , a warning will appear informing you that all animation data will be lost . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> Non switchable camera : there is an additional icon ( ) that appears just below the Pick link object icon when the selected object is a camera . When selected , this icon forbids animation of the camera ( as above ) and also prevents camera switcher keyframes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera . If the camera is already being used in the camera switcher , selecting this option will remove all switches to this camera . <p> Click the icon in the icon bar to display the Animation Toolbox for the selected object . This toolbox let 's you adjust the global behavior of animated objects . <h> Forward Dynamics ( Linking and Tracking ) <p> Forward dynamics is a hierarchical animation feature that greatly simplifies the animation of complex structures . Basically , it let 's you link some objects to others ( the link parents ) , thus building a hierarchy of objects . When an object is linked , modifying the link parent will automatically affect the linked object . <p> To link an object to another one , you may either : <p> select the parent object from the Link drop-down list , <p> press the icon or select the menu command Object Pick link parent , then click on the parent object in the 3D views ( objects will be highlighted as the mouse passes over them ) , or <p> press the icon or select the menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent object inside the World Browser . This last method is the only one that let 's you link to objects that are inside groups or Boolean objects . <p> You can decide how the linked object will be affected by modifications made to the link parent by checking or unchecking the link options boxes ( Position , Rotation , Size , Join ) . <p> Object tracking let 's you decide that the selected object will always point in the direction of the tracked object . To select which object is tracked by the selected object , use any of the following methods : <p> select the parent object from the Track drop-down list , <p> press the icon or select the menu command Object Pick tracked parent , then click on the parent object in the 3D views ( objects will be highlighted as the mouse passes over them ) , <p> press the icon or select the menu command Object Pick tracked parent , then click on the parent object inside the World Browser . This last method is the only one that let 's you track to objects that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track is defined for the selected object , the Main axis drop-down list becomes active . This let 's you define which axis of the object will be pointing in the direction of the tracked object ( e.g. a camera that tracks an object should have a +Z main axis so that it looks straight at the object it tracks ; selecting +X will make the camera look straight up ( 90 upwards from the tracked object direction ) . <p> While standard forward-dynamic linking or tracking produces exact motion , this motion usually looks unnatural and jolty . This is because computers perform linking and tracking in a much too perfect manner , whereas a real operator would have a hard time following a rapidly moving target ( he would always be catching up or compensating overshoots ) . <p> VUE is now able to simulate this ' human behavior ' by introducing loose tracking and linking algorithms with the Response slider . You can very easily customize the reactivity of the forward dynamics engine for each object , from standard ( i.e. perfect reactivity ) to slack responsiveness.

@@74102089 @2802089/ <p> Michael Koch , CG Supervisor and Head of 3D Animation Department at Acht Frankfurt , shares with us how they introduced Vue to their pipeline . <p> Acht Frankfurt created the intro trailer for Terra X broadcasted on the public-service German television channel ZDF , Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen ( " Second German Television " ) based in Mainz . This spotlight appears by courtesy of ZDF . <h> About Michael Koch <p> Michael Koch is the CG supervisor and head of the 3D animation department at Acht Frankfurt . He studied physics , started working for games companies in 1994 and quickly set up his own company Mindworx . Today his portfolio covers the whole range of CG visual effects , from digital set extensions to character animation for film and tv commercials . Michael Koch is the author of many articles on 3D animation techniques , co-authored the book inside 3D Studio Max 2 and worked as a guest advisor at the Filmakademie Baden-Wnrttemberg . Before he joined Acht Frankfurt he was lead artist and CG supervisor at ARRI Digital Film , Ogilvy &amp; Mather Miami and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into 3D ? <p> Michael Koch : Back in 1994 I got a contract from a German record label for a CD featuring my club music project ' Mind Evolutions ' . The record company gave me a small budget for the design of the CD cover . I liked the idea to do that myself , so I started playing with a shareware raytracer called ' Vivid ' . Everything was commandline , there was no graphic user interface at all . I rendered the cover image on my Pentium 90mhz computer - that was my first paid 3D job ! After that I got infected with 3D animation . <p> Was this the first time you got to use Vue on a project ? How long did you work on it ? <p> MK : It was the first time we used Vue for a project . A team of two 3D artists worked on that project - Bernd Nalbach and me . From initial boards to final trailer it took us about 3 months , including the film shoot of various elements . <h> Technical Aspects <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application ? <p> MK : Besides Vue xStream we used Autodesk 's 3Ds Max in combination with Vray , Ivy Generator and Xfrog . Compositing was done on Autodesk Flame . <p> Could you explain the different steps of your project creation ? <p> MK : Frank Schneider , director and CEO of Filmstyler Pictures , approached us with this very interesting board for the new Terra X trailer for ZDF in 2008 . We immediately wanted to work on that project . The initial idea was to use existing footage and creative compositing . But we all realized quickly , that this would be too time-consuming . <p> So Filmstyler Pictures worked out a new concept based on the idea that the viewer sees and ' feels ' the passing of the entire history of earth and mankind . The pretended camera angle always stays in the same position and in the end it even offers a sight into the future . Filmstyler Pictures shot specific additional material and elements on film that we needed for compositing . <p> Compositing on Autodesk Flame was done by Senior Artist Heiko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the Compositing Artists as much flexibility as possible . They also supervised the film shoot of various elements , like the fighting knights and the Romans . The trailer is produced in HD format . <p> In the end , the result of this concept was a mix between footage , compositing and 3D . In a permanent and close collaboration between Filmstyler and Acht Frankfurt we generated the Terra X trailer by using real- and postproduction generated elements . Together we evaluated various tools for the task at hand , but quickly found that Vue 's EcoSystem features will be very useful for wide landscapes covered with vegetation . <p> We also used Vue for timelapse skies . A number of growing foreground hero plants were animated with Xfrog , some Ivy vegetation was created directly in 3Ds Max with the Ivy Generator plugin . <p> The project was a pleasure to work on , during the workprocess we had so much freedom to come up with our own ideas . Over the past years we established a trustworthy relationship with Filmstyler Pictures , which I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most difficult part of your project ? <p> MK : The most difficult part was the timelapse landscape morph , to find seamless transitions from one landscape to another . We created various layouts first , and discussed them with the director until we found the solution we felt works best . <h> Official Trailer Terra X <h> About Vue <p> What are your favorite Vue features or options ? <p> MK : The EcoSystem tools are fantastic ! No other software gave us the flexibility to populate landscapes with realistic vegetation in such an easy way . The ability to paint EcoSystem vegetation is just brilliant . <p> Will you be using Vue in other projects ? <p> MK : I am very curious to use the new Vue 7 features on one of our next projects . The Spectral II Cloud Technology looks very promising , also the interesting additions to terrain modeling and EcoSystem generation . <h> About Acht Frankfurt <p> Acht Frankfurt was founded in 2003 in Frankfurt/Germany .

It is used to add or remove instances one by one . <h> Influencing the EcoSystem Population <p> These brushes are used to change or influence the current EcoSystem population . <p> Color : this shifts instances ' color closer to the chosen color . <p> Scale : this let 's you change the size of the instances <p> Lean : bends an instance so that its up ' ( Z ) axis aligns with the reference axis . <p> Drag : this drags the instances under the brush along with the brush movement . <p> Move : this moves a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this randomizes instances ' position . <p> Jitter Orientation : this randomizes instances ' orientation <p> Attract : this attracts instances towards the center of the brush . <p> Magnet : aligns an instance 's X axis along the reference axis . <p> Grid Align : this aligns instances in a grid pattern to the base 's X and Y vectors . <p> Rake : aligns instances along lines parallel to the reference axis <p> Ripple : aligns instances in widening circular lines <p> Lower : this lowers instances in relation to the underlying object . <p> Raise : this raises instances in relation to the underlying object <p> Tornado : this moves instances upwards and in a spiral around the brush center . <p> Color &amp; Scale : this combines the features of the Color and Scale brushes into one brush . <p> Save brush preset : if you have made changes to a brush preset , click this icon to save your changes to that brush if you wish . <p> Add brush to presets : if you have made changes to a brush preset , but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save your changes by creating a new brush . Use this icon to save and create a new brush preset . <p> Remove brush from presets : use this icon to delete any brushes . <h> Global Settings <p> Airbrush style : when this option is selected , the number of instances added to a given area is proportional to the time spent painting on that area . <p> Invert : Not available for all tools . When activated , it inverts the action taken on the instances . <p> Brush radius : this setting controls the area around the mouse cursor onto which instances are randomly distributed . If you are using a pressure-sensitive tablet , you can connect this setting to the tablet pressure by clicking the Drive with pressure icon ( ) . This will result in instances being scattered around further from the mouse when you press harder on the tablet . <p> Brush flow : this setting controls the number of instances added to the EcoSystem per unit of time ( this setting is only available if you are using the airbrush style of brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can connect this setting to the tablet pressure by clicking the Drive with pressure icon ( ) . This will result in instances being added more rapidly when you press harder on the tablet . <p> Falloff : this is the rate of diminishing effect moving away from the center of the brush . This can also be defined on the Brush Editor for this brush using a Falloff Filter . <p> Selections : This allows you to select EcoSystem instances for manipulation . Selection is done in all views . When the view is active , a circle appears around the mouse pointer to indicate the area where the selection will take place . When using the Selection Tools , selected EcoSystem instances are depicted using a red dot . This dot always appears , even if the billboard preview of the instance is not displayed . The dots disappear when you close the Selection Tools . <p> Click Select all to select all EcoSystem instances and Deselect all to deselect all selected EcoSystem instances . <h> EcoSystem Population <p> The EcoSystem population list displays a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painter . You can add new items to this list using any of the buttons beneath the list . If you select to add a plant ( ) , the Visual Plant Browser opens . Use drag and drop to select a plant from the browser and place it in the EcoSystem Painter dialog . The browser will remain open for you to select another plant . Click OK in the Visual Plant Browser when finished adding plants . If you select to add an object ( ) , use the same method to select objects for your EcoSystem . If you select to add a rock ( ) , the Rock Template Browser opens . Rocks are added the same way plants are . <p> You are also able to select any object or plant from the World Browser and drag it into the population list to use when painting . <p> To the right of the EcoSystem item you will see two icons that let you choose how you wish your EcoSystem population to display in OpenGL . <p> Quality : for Plant Factory plants only , use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The quality ranges from -4 to 4 , the higher the quality value the more detailed the specimens . <p> Instance previewing mode ( ) : right-click to select the preview quality for this item in the EcoSystem . If you are not in OpenGL Shader mode , the Shaded Billboard option will be grayed out . <p> Full Quality Near Camera ( ) : click on this icon to allow full display quality of this item near the camera . If you are not painting a global EcoSystem , Allow full quality near camera must be selected in the Material Editor for this option to be available . <p> You can remove items from the list by selecting them and pressing Remove . If some instances of this item are already in the scene , they will be removed together . <h> Paint What ? <p> When using the EcoSystem Painter tools , you can either act upon all items of the EcoSystem population , or on only a subset of these items . This is controlled using the Paint what ? options : <p> A bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the population of the EcoSystem will be affected . If you use the Brush ' or ' Single instance ' tools , the instances added will be randomly picked from the entire population . Likewise , the Eraser ' and Color/Scaling ' tools will erase or modify all the types of elements in the EcoSystem . <p> Only selected items : when this option is selected , only the items that are selected on the EcoSystem population list will be used when painting . For instance , the Brush ' and ' Single instance ' tools will only add instances of the selected type . The Eraser ' and Color/Scaling ' tools will erase or modify only the types of elements that are selected on the list . This way , you could have an EcoSystem of rocks and trees , and decide to erase only the trees in some areas . <p> Once you have set up the EcoSystem Painter , you can reduce the screen size clicking the Minimize button to keep it out of the way while painting . <p> If you want to paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EcoSystem Object <p> When you have painted the first instance of a Global EcoSystem , be it a single instance or using the brush , a Global EcoSystem object appears in the list of objects in the World Browser . <p> These objects have some of the options available that regular objects do , such as Hide from render , Replace by , and layer manipulation ( Hide Current Layer , Lock Current Layer , and so on ) . <p> This object can be deleted , which will delete all instances of the Global EcoSystem as well . When this object is selected , all instances of the Global EcoSystems are selected and can be manipulated ( only when the EcoSystem Painter and manipulate dialogs are not open ) . <p> If all instances of the Global EcoSystem are deleted from within the EcoSystem Painter dialog , the Global EcoSystem object is removed from the object list . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> This Global EcoSystem can also be rendered like a mask in the Multi-Pass rendering option . To do so , you must enable the Global EcoSystem object mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two Global EcoSystems <p> You can now create multiple Global EcoSystems in your scene . If you have already created a global EcoSystem in the EcoPainter , from the VUE menu , select **26;100;TOOLONG EcoSystem . This will open the EcoPainter with no EcoSystem population . While other EcoSystems you have created still exist and show up in the World Browser and in renders , you have a chance to create a new one . <p> Add the objects you need for your EcoSystem , and the first time you paint with it you will see another entry in the World Browser for that new Global EcoSystem . <p> Each EcoSystem can be manipulated separately . You can see the contents of each EcoSystem listed in the browser . <h> Using the Paint Function to Modify EcoSystem Materials <p> You can use the EcoPaint function to modify an EcoSystem Material . This is typically used when you have populated an EcoSystem material , but would like to touch up the way it was populated . <p> To modify an EcoSystem material , click the Paint button inside the Material Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Painter panel will appear . <p> Any modifications made to the EcoSystem population will be limited to instances that belong to that EcoSystem . This way , you do not risk to affect other EcoSystem populations . Modified EcoSystem populations are still bound to the object they are attached to . Moving that object will move the instances along with it . <p> You can constrain the painting to the object that the EcoSystem is attached to , using the Restrict to underlying object option . This avoids adding instances outside ' of the object they are attached to . <p> If you click on the Use EcoSystem population rules , what you paint will correspond to the settings you made for the original EcoSystem . <p> If the painted EcoSystem is part of a complex material hierarchy ( materials with layers , mixed materials ) , the individual density of the EcoSystem 's layer is computed so that the EcoSystem Painter behaves like the Populate button . You can easily restrict your EcoSystem painting to a given area by creating a material layer and editing the alpha or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Display Options <p> Because EcoSystem instances can easily become numerous in a scene , you need to be careful about how they are previewed in the OpenGL displays . On the other hand , if the instances are displayed too crudely , you may have difficulties adjusting your scene . <p> In order to let you find the optimal balance between display quality and previewing speed , you can adjust the way EcoSystem instances are displayed on a per-EcoSystem basis . <p> If you want to adjust the preview quality of an EcoSystem material , go to the General tab in the EcoSystem Material Editor and use the Display options group . <p> If you want to adjust the preview quality of the Global EcoSystem , click on the Display options button in the EcoSystem Painter . The EcoSystem Display Options dialog will appear . The controls in this dialog are identical to the EcoSystem material display options found in the Material Editor , except for the option Hide EcoSystem from render . When this option is selected , the global EcoSystem will be hidden from the render .

These tools , or brushes , let you modify manually the shape of your terrain by adding to or digging from it , and selectively applying given effects . The effect that the brush has on the terrain is defined in the Brush Presets group of controls ( see below ) . <h> Contents <h> Using a Pressure-Sensitive Tablet <p> If you are using a pressure-sensitive tablet , the pressure will be used to control the amount of effect applied with each stroke . This makes for a much more natural and precise way of carving terrains . <h> Brush Presets <p> You now have the option of selecting either 3D or 2D brush settings . The 3D settings are for terrain sculpting ; the 2D settings are for building and lowering the terrain .

The extrusion will follow the direction that the brush is pointing . This direction does n't change while you are brushing . Use the Sculpt brush to move the terrain in a precise direction . <p> Freeform : This option picks the Normal during the mouse movement and so the extrusion direction changes while the mouse moves . The extrusion will follow the direction that the bush is pointing " this direction may change while you are painting . <p> Pinch : This option pulls the vertices together . <p> Inflate : With this option , the vertices are pushed along their normal , so the shape in the brush inflates . The polygons in the brush move away from each other creating a balloon effect . <p> Smear : this option puts the geometry under the brush into the brush and moves it along with the brush . <p> Note : <p> With these 3D options , you can not paint a material on just a portion of the extrusion , for example , a dot on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the terrain as a whole . <h> 2D <p> Raise : This raises the terrain altitude where it is brushed . <p> Plateaus : With this option , all of the vertices in the brush are placed onto a horizontal plane . This plane is recomputed when you move the brush and is defined by the brush direction and position . <p> Altitude : The brush brushes the terrain to the altitude set by the Altitude Brush dialog . <p> Smooth : This smoothes the terrain geometry by adding 3D displacements . The smooth brush relaxes the underlying polygon geometry in order to remove any distortions in the polygon mesh that might have occurred following painting and automatic subdivision . You can easily observe the effect of the Smooth brush by switching to wireframe mode . <p> Flatten : With this option , all of the vertices in the brush are placed onto a plane . This plane is recomputed when you move the brush and is defined by the brush direction and position . The brush position is a point of the plane ; the brush direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works like Flatten , except that the plane is computed at the first mouse click . <h> Mode <p> The first two icons in this section , Sculpt and Material , define what you are doing with the brush . If you are sculpting your terrain with either 3D or 2D brushes , you should have the Sculpt icon selected . If you are painting the terrain with a material , you need to have the Material icon selected . If you are painting with a material and sculpting at the same time , both icons should be selected . <p> The Freeze option locks a material layer to disable any further brush effects on that part of the terrain . The Clear Freeze option unlocks the layer . Inverse Freeze unlocks the currently frozen area and freezes the part of the terrain that was previously unfrozen . <h> Global Settings <p> You can set your brush using the settings in the Global section . These settings will be applied to the brush for any brush you might choose . These settings may be overwritten for a particular brush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more information . <p> Airbrush : This controls whether the brush operates like a pen or like an airbrush . If the brush operates like a pen , passing over the same point several times in the same stroke has no additional effect , unlike the airbrush style . The airbrush style brush keeps adding effect as long as the mouse button is down . Non-airbrush mode for 3D painting works like 2D effects . <p> Invert : Select this icon to subtract from the terrain , lowering altitude . <p> Radius : Drag the slider to the right to increase the size of the brush .

They asked him to create a series of 3D scenery illustrations for the boxes of the Origins collection , which included specialty teas from China , Sri Lanka , India and South Africa . <h> Pre Production <p> All of the illustrations had to share some common characteristics : A noticeable feeling of sunrise/sunset with the sunlight coming in at a low angle , a dark , almost silhouetted outline of the mountains and hills , a strong sense of depth and distance , and a misty atmosphere with low clouds and/or fog . In addition , each illustration had to depict the unique geographical area where the tea originates , from Himalayan foothills ( Darjeeling ) to African Savannah ( Rooibos ) . <p> All the illustrations needed to be converted to duotone images , each with its own pair of Pantone colors + black . Pi Global provided me with a layout design , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They also supplied reference photos to get a better idea of how each region looks like . <p> Box template <p> Because the box design was already finalized , the renders had to conform to tight limitations . Areas where text would be placed had to be dark and not too detailed , mountain peaks had to reach a predefined height , and the overall composition had to fit the layout . This required careful placement of each terrain , and a lot of re-checking of the render against the design template . In addition , I had to work with a single image format that will fit both the vertical and horizontal sides of the box , which was n't easy . <p> To get the final duotone output I first converted each render to black and white . This meant I could n't rely much on colors and textures for detail , and had to focus primarily on lighting and outlines . <p> Although the goal was not to achieve 100% realistic renders , I still had to come up with ways to create the distinctive look of each specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most characteristic terrain features and plant species for that region , and recreating them in the illustration . <h> 5 O'Clock ... it 's Vue Time ! <p> This was a great opportunity for me to use Vue as the main ( and only ) 3D software on a commercial project . I worked with Vue 5 Infinite ( version 6 was not yet out at the time ) , and some of its capabilities were especially helpful on this project : <p> Darjeeling closeup <h> Terrains : <p> I used either standard or procedural , depending on the style of each particular illustration . For example , in Darjeeling , I used procedural terrains to get that sharp-ridged look on the distant Himalayan peaks . For the characteristic Chinese hills In Lapsang Suchong I used standard terrains with a custom altitude filter . <h> EcoSystem : <p> I wish I had , at the time , the great new EcoSystem features of Vue 6 , but even without them , EcoSystems came in tremendously handy . Because of the silhouetted look of the illustrations , I needed to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrains . With EcoSystems , I could do that really fast , and get the work done in a very tight schedule . <h> Plant Editor : <p> In Rooibos I needed to add scatter some Acacia trees in the Savannah . I used the preset ones that come with Vue , but the client thought they look too wispy . I created new Acacias with the plant editor , based on the Cherry tree preset . The result might not be botanically correct , but it was exactly what the client was after . <h> Atmosphere : <p> I used both standard and volumetric models . I relied heavily on fog and haze to get a misty feel and a pronounced sense of depth . I also used my own cloud planes to create low-lying fog ( that was , of course before the new volumetric clouds of Vue 6 ) . <h> About Eran Dinur <p> Eran studied Composition at the Julliard School of Music and wrote music for theater and films for 15 years before he embarked on a career shift in digital arts .

Ive been doing this for almost 20 years , and some of my work can be seen in Die Hard 2 , Ghostbusters 2 , Jurassic Park , Forrest Gump , Star Wars episodes I , II and III , The Day After Tomorrow , Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban , and many others . I also won an Emmy for my work on The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles , back in 1990 . <p> I just completed working on The Spiderwick Chronicles and I am currently part of the Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull Digital Matte Artist team . <p> Is this the first time you used Vue on a project yourself ? <p> YU : Yes its the first time I used Vue for real shots . In Spiderwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sequence , where you see the landing zone from above . <p> Can you tell us exactly what you were using Vue for ? <p> YU : My job was to get some trees to populate a specific area . Vue has a great interface to interactively edit predefined tree subsets and leaves . It allowed me to mix all variables to create ideal looking trees really quick . So I created probably over a dozen new tree species and exported them . <p> The only thing moving in this scene was the camera , the trees did not have to react to wind or breeze . If this had been required , I would have used Vue more intensively in the process . But as it was not , it was easier for me to export the trees from Vue and to render them in our standard renderer . <p> The scene layout was already done by someone else , which included the camera moves and the scale of important elements in the scene ( the icicle for instance ) . Starting from this , I had to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> There are other shots that use Vue in Spiderwick , particularly spectral atmospheres . I cant tell you more about these shots , as they are not mine . <h> Technical Aspects <p> What problem were you facing for Spiderwick that Vue solved ? <p> YU : It was going to take me weeks to create high quality trees with 3ds Max , until I heard of Vue . <p> I talked pretty much to everyone I could think of at ILM , and all recommended Vue . So it was pretty clear that Vue was the best solution to create good looking trees without spending an enormous amount of time . <p> I did not have the chance to work on other ILM projects that use Vue , but I was amazed by what I saw done with it . I was looking for any opportunity to use Vue myself at some point . Among all solutions available , Vue was the best choice ! <p> Can you give us more technical details on how you setup the Vue scene for this Spiderwick shot ? <p> YU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot frame-by-frame and to keep everything in 3D , I would have needed to compromise on a lot of things . So I used a trick we use a lot , as 3ds Max has a way to render in slices by limiting the camera clipping planes . Each plane is a render of 3D stuff used as a textured 2D plane , with an alpha map applied . <p> The whole shot is more 2.5D than true 3D . So all I needed was a set of high quality still images and thanks to this technique I did not have to compromise on any of the important subtlety . <p> How long did the whole process last ? <p> YU : Vue is really easy to use , so it allowed me to do everything I needed within a day or so . It would have taken me weeks with any other solution ! <h> About Vue <p> What was your overall impression of Vue ? <p> YU : From the small Vue experience I have , it 's a really powerful tool . <p> I hope to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think could be improved ? <p> YU : The only thing I 'd like in a future release would be to have more choice in the libraries , and more control over the editing of tree subsets . <h> Official Movie Trailer and Synopsis <p> Movie Trailer ( can you spot Vue ? ) <p> Synopsis : <p> From the beloved best-selling series of books comes " The Spiderwick Chronicles " , a fantasy adventure for the child in all of us .

Wind and breeze can be applied globally , per-plant , or by using one of the new wind generators . <h> Global Wind and Breeze <p> Global wind is controlled from the atmosphere editor , and is applied to all SolidGrowth plants and EcoSystems within a scene . Since each SolidGrowth species reacts to wind in its own unique way ( i.e. thick trees move less than thin grass ) , global wind can add a tremendous amount of realistic movement to natural scenery , ranging from delicate fluttering of leaves to strong bending in violent gusts . <h> Individual per-Plant Wind <p> Each SolidGrowth plant ( or group of plants ) can have its own individual wind animation . The wind arrow let 's you interactively control wind direction and intensity , and view the plants reaction in real time .

Select the one that is the closest to that which you want to achieve . You may load another atmosphere into your scene later , as work progresses . <p> How your atmosphere is previewed in the Main camera view can be controlled by options on the Display menu . On the Display menu , select Atmosphere Preview and the submenu gives you the options to preview the following : <p> OpenGL Atmosphere <p> OpenGL Clouds <p> OpenGL Lens Flares <p> OpenGL Planets <p> These options can be toggled on and off . <p> After having worked on your scene for a while , you may suddenly realize that the atmosphere you chose at the beginning is no longer suitable .

It has been widely used for a multitude of stills and animation projects . This model let 's you control sky appearance through the use of color gradients . You can create an unlimited number of fully editable cloud layers , control fog and haze densities , or add special effects like twinkling stars , rainbows and ice rings . All atmospheric elements can be fully animated . The standard model 's main advantages are ease of use and fast rendering . <p> Volumetric atmosphere model : this model offers a good compromise between the standard and spectral models , giving you a higher level of realism , yet rendering faster than spectral atmospheres . Unlike the standard atmosphere , the appearance of the sky and sun is not defined by color gradients . It 's directly affected by haze and fog settings and by the sun 's position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially suited for animations : simply moving the sun around produces beautiful color and lighting shifts . <p> Standard Spectral atmosphere model : this is VUE 's hyper-realistic model that accurately simulates the behavior of real-world atmosphere and lighting according to weather conditions . The appearance of sky , sun and clouds ( both standard and spectral ) , as well as the character of direct and ambient light are all affected by the delicate balance between the elements that constitute the atmosphere : air , dust and water particles . The Spectral model provides its own set of controls that let you adjust each element 's density and height and rendering quality . Using the Spectral model ensures a complete coherence of all the elements of a scene . <p> Environment mapping : Especially suited for architectural visualization , this model let 's you easily set up an environment based on panoramic photographs . By using VUE 's Image Based Lighting , HDRI support and global reflection mapping you can create a seamless integration between your scene and the background plates . <p> Standard Photometric : Photometric lighting ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically correct . The absolute intensity is also heavily affected , leading to much brighter daylight renders than before , thus the need for different exposure and natural film response settings that can be handled automatically by VUE internally . If you are changing between a photometric atmosphere and another type of atmosphere model , you are given the option via a popup to let VUE change your current settings to those more appropriate for this atmosphere model automatically . Or you can make adjustments yourself . <p> The Atmosphere Editor can stay open all the time without blocking access to other parts of the software . Modifications are taken into account immediately . You can reset , load and save an atmosphere by using the icons in the dialog bar ( the icon bar on the lower right edge of the editor ) . <p> The following is a description of each of the tabs of the Atmosphere Editor . 
@@74102112 @2802112/ <h> Photometric atmospheres in xStream <p> Because photometric atmospheres use a brighter sun ( with an intensity matching the real sun ) , it is necessary to use exposure controls in the host applications to avoid overexposed renders . They allow the control of 3 parameters that define the exposure : shutter speed , film speed ( iso ) and f-number . <p> The default exposure value for a sunny exterior scene , recommended for the default VUE atmosphere , is 15 EV which is obtained with : <p> a shutter speed of 1/500s <p> a film speed of 100 ISO <p> an f-number of 8 <p> You can then adjust the exposure by changing one of these parameters . For instance , you can add 1EV by dividing the shutter speed by 2 thus making the render darker , or subtract 1EV by multiplying the shutter-speed by 2 thus making the render brighter . <p> Note : <p> This exposure value must not be confused with the exposure compensation of recent cameras , that works in the opposite way than exposure scale , and is relative to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a short description of how to activate exposure controls in the various host applications : <h> 3dsMax <h> V-Ray <p> With the V-Ray renderer , you have to use an Exposure Control that let 's you change the parameters defined above .

@@74102124 @2802124/ <h> Troubleshooting <p> The first part of this second appendix gives a list of common problems you may have using the software . The second part may help you find what is wrong in a picture that , for some unknown reason , does n't look quite right . <h> Scenes Take Ages to Render <p> You must keep in mind that some of the effects created by VUE are extremely long to render . If you find that your scene is taking too long to render , go through it and check out for any of the following effects that are not absolutely required ( listed by order of importance ) : <p> Global Illumination and Radiosity . <p> Volumetric lights ( especially directional lights such as the sun , and point lights ) , godrays . If you absolutely need the volumetric effect , make sure the Quality boost setting is n't exaggerated . Check if you can remove the Cast shadows in volume option , <p> Depth of field ( this requires a large amount of anti-aliasing to produce smooth results ) , <p> Displacement mapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low average depth settings , <p> Camera is placed in the middle of spectral clouds , <p> Mixed materials that mix several transparent materials together , <p> Glowing materials ( slightly glowing materials that do n't show up in the final render ) , <p> Volumetric materials used on large objects ( can you use fuzzy materials instead ? ) , volumetric atmospheres , <p> Blurred reflections and refractions , soft shadows ( even if the blurring/softness amount is very low , it 's still going to slow down the render dramatically ) . Do you need soft shadows on all lights ? <p> Shadows ( do all lights/materials have to cast shadows , do all materials have to receive shadows ? ) , etc . <p> A good understanding of all the advanced rendering features of VUE is required if you want to keep render times optimal . By getting rid of unnecessary effects you can easily accelerate the rendering speed by an order of magnitude . <p> Last , you should keep in mind that the rendering technique used by VUE ( i.e. ray-tracing ) is an inherently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its vastly superior quality . Since VUE was first released we never stopped optimizing its render engine to make it ever faster , producing one of the fastest ray-tracing engines currently available . <h> Camera Moves by Itself <p> If you notice the camera changes position for no apparent reason , check that the height of the camera above ground is not set to be locked ( see the Lock Height option in the camera 's Object Properties panel , see here ) . This may cause the camera to move following changes in the scene . <h> Bright Fringes Appear at Wall Base in Radiosity <p> Sometimes , when rendering with radiosity , it may happen that you see bright areas of light appear in corners or near the floor where there should n't be any . This phenomenon is known as " light leak " and is an artifact caused by the photon rendering technology . <p> This problem occurs when the photon gathering radius is greater than the thickness of the walls . To correct this problem , either increase the Lighting model Quality boost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering radius using the Photon Maps tab of the Advanced Effects Options dialog . <h> Render Time Estimation Is Pessimistic <p> You may notice that the render time estimation displayed at the beginning of rendering certain scenes is extremely pessimistic . The reason for this is that , in order to avoid useless computation , a lot of preparation tasks are fragmented in such a way that only those fragments that are indeed required are computed ( e.g. displacement mapping , subsurface scattering , etc . ) . The usefulness of each fragment is determined at render time : each time the renderer needs an uncomputed fragment , it is computed dynamically . This typically happens during the early stages of rendering , when none of the fragments are yet computed . This is especially the case when rendering in preview mode , where the entire surface of the image is evaluated at the first render pass . The render time estimation should rapidly converge to a more realistic evaluation . <h> Long Preparation Time for Small Image <p> Preparation time is long , even for small render-areas . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to the scene ( an object that is not visible in the final image may nonetheless have an influence on the lighting of the scene ) . Such effects require the same amount of preparation , whatever the portion of the final image that is rendered . That is why this preparation time is not reduced by reducing the rendered area . <h> Program Crashes Randomly <p> If you are experiencing frequent random crashes when working with VUE , chances are something is wrong with your video board driver . <p> Obviously , you might want to enable Compatibility Mode ( see here ) , but before doing this , visit the website of your video board manufacturer and check if there are any recent driver updates available . Depending on the manufacturer , OpenGL drivers in particular will tend to be updated and fixed for a while after the board is released . Also , because VUE uses several threads of OpenGL rendering , it can happen that some drivers that perform well with other applications will not perform correctly with VUE . Obviously , you should point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . <p> In the mean time , here are a number of steps that you can take to improve compatibility ( listed by order of importance ) : <p> Switch to the software implementation of OpenGL by selecting the OpenGL ( software ) option . You will have to restart VUE . The next time you restart the program , the 3D Views will be drawn using a custom , in-house preview technology . <p> You should try these options until you find the configuration that works best for your system . <h> Noise Appears in Volumetric Effects <p> Grainy Volumetric Lights and Materials . <p> The reason for this is exactly the same as for getting noise in the sky : the Preview render setting is optimized for speed and only produces a rough fake of what the result will finally be . Although you can increase the Quality boost setting for the volumetric lights and materials , switching to Final render quality ( or better ) is generally enough . <h> Atmosphere Is Different in Preview and Final <p> When you have finished designing your scene ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may notice that the colors of the atmosphere change slightly . Generally , this is n't noticeable , but it may be a problem in certain occasions . The reason is that , just like the noise problem discussed above , the Preview render quality is n't optimized the same as the Final ( or better ) render quality . As you switch to Final , VUE automatically refines the processing of the atmosphere , resulting in the slight changes you may have noticed . <p> If colors of the atmosphere are an important issue , you should switch to Final render quality before you start fine-tuning it . <h> Undesired Lens Flares Appear on Lights <p> If you have unwanted lens flares appearing on your lights ( sun , spotlights ) , double-click on the light in the World Browser and uncheck the setting . <p> The default for this setting " on or off " can be set on this panel . <h> Missing Details <p> Some parts of the picture do n't look as detailed as they should . It seems as if some fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ render quality setting you are using . For speedy renders , Preview quality optimizes the last render pass , sometimes skipping very fine details . <p> Preview is fine when you are working on the picture , just to make sure you 're going the right way . But for final renderings of a picture , you have to use Final render quality . <h> Vector Graphics Do n't Load in Text Editor <p> When loading vector graphics data , it may happen that nothing is loaded ( the text preview remains blank ) . This typically happens when the Postscript processor was unable to process the vector graphics file . You should use a simpler version of Postscript that does n't make reference to any external libraries ( sometimes the case with Adobe Illustrator documents ) . <h> Invisible Objects <p> Although some objects appear correctly when rendered , they are not visible in the 3D views . <p> These objects are most certainly placed inside a Hidden layer , or have the Hidden attribute . To show all objects inside the scene , select Show All Layers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can use the layer status control to activate the hidden layers . You can reset the Hidden attribute of the object by using the popup menu of the Preview Options in the Object Properties panel . <h> Unable to Select Objects <p> Objects that are placed inside a Locked layer , or have the Locked attribute , can not be selected using the 3D Views . These objects are displayed in gray . Toggle the layer status back to Active , or use the World Browser to select them . You can reset the Locked attribute of the object by using the popup menu of the Preview Options in the Object Properties panel . <p> If you are trying to select an object that is placed behind another one , you can either use another view , or the World Browser to select it . Alternately , you can select all the objects under the cursor by Control " clicking , and then walking through the selection using Tab until the requested object is selected . <h> Objects Do n't Render <p> Some objects that appear in the 3D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these objects are n't made from a totally transparent material . Maybe they are so fuzzy that you ca n't see them . Or they are black and Additive together , which yields invisible results . <p> Alternately , make sure the Render everything option is selected in the Render Options dialog . <h> Close-up Materials Look Like Tiles <p> Color steps appear when a material made from a mapped picture is seen from close , and when no interpolation has been specified . The pixels of the mapped picture are creating this effect . <p> Open the Material Editor by double clicking on the preview of the material that you want to modify ( or select Edit Material from the preview 's popup menu ) . Go to the Colors tab , and select a Bilinear , Bicubic or Normalized interpolation method . <h> Look Ahead Objects <p> Look Ahead Objects Do n't Point in the Right Direction <p> When you animate an object with the Look ahead property , the orientation of the object is automatically processed to make it point in the direction of travel . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may find out that your object is in fact pointing at right angles with the direction of travel . This is because the Main axis of the object is not correct . Use the Main axis drop down list in the Animation Properties panel to select the correct axis . <p> If none of the available options proves satisfactory , this means that the initial orientation of your object is not aligned with one of the axes of VUE . This happens when you import objects . <p> You must align the object with one of the axes . First try zeroing all rotations in the Rotation sub-tab of the Numeric Properties panel . If the object is still not aligned , then rotate it manually until it is aligned . Now ungroup the object and regroup it . You will have to rename it to its old name . The object is now ready for Look ahead animation ( if the object is not a group/Boolean object , it is necessarily an imported object . You will have to align it in the application that was used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Or do n't seem to react sufficiently <p> The algorithms used by VUE to compute the reaction of objects to motion are based on physical rules . While this ensures the most realistic motion , it has the drawback of being sensitive to the scale of your scene ( because the speed at which objects travel depends on the scale of the scene ) . <p> You will notice this when objects do n't seem to react naturally to their motion . You can fix the problem by modifying the sensitivity of objects using the Motion Options dialog ( press Options in the Animation Toolbox ) . Read more on this dialog here . <h> Materials Do n't Move With Objects <p> Objects seem to move " through " the material <p> If you notice that the material of an animated object is n't following the object , then it is probably because you are using a World space material . To ensure that the material follows the objects , you should always select an Object based space mapping in the Material Editor ( read here ) . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should also check the Object orientation option in the Influence of environment tab . <h> Objects Keep Getting Animated <p> If you modify a non animated object at a different time than the time it was created at , it automatically becomes animated . To avoid this problem , you should always modify objects at the time they were created at , or at zero time . All objects can be modified at zero time without becoming animated . <p> You can remove object animation by selecting Not animated from the Motion type drop-down list in the Animation tab , or by selecting the object in the Timeline and pressing Delete . <p> You can definitively prevent an object from becoming animated by selecting the Forbid animation option in the Animation tab of the Object Properties panel . <h> Animations Flicker <p> If you notice that rendered animations tend to flicker when played back , check the following : <p> First of all , please make sure that the problem is not caused by the playback software or video compression options you have selected . Also , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your computer has sufficient bandwidth to playback the animation smoothly . <p> In the Advanced Animation Options dialog , check the Flicker reduction options and make sure the frame rate is adequate . <p> Avoid using high frequency procedural textures , that is textures that have very fine details . The fine details probably wo n't be visible in the animation anyway ... <p> Turn on texture anti-aliasing . <p> Avoid using soft shadows and blurred effects . <p> Increase the render quality by using the User settings should be your last resort . In the Animation Render Options dialog , make sure that you are rendering at a sufficiently high render quality setting ( Broadcast render quality is designed for acceptable quality ) . If render quality is n't sufficient in Broadcast , you 'll probably want to switch to User settings and select a very high anti-aliasing quality ( 25 rays per pixel ) . Make sure the Motion blur option is checked . <p> Keep in mind that there is no limit to the quality of the animations generated , except the time allocated for rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will increase accordingly . So it 's all a question of finding the ideal compromise . <h> Texture Filtering <p> Texture Filtering is an essential render setting to reduce noise and flickering that can arise because of high frequency textures ( components of materials that exhibit very fine detail , usually finer than the size of a pixel ) . When used properly , it will lower the needs for strong object anti-aliasing ( thus speeding up the render ) , and greatly reduce texture flickering . <p> Texture Filtering can be accessed via the anti-aliasing options dialog , just above texture anti-aliasing options . Its value is editable through a slider that ranges from 0 to 100% . <h> How It Works <p> This value corresponds to the size of the filter applied over textures during render . Ideally , this filter should always have the size of a pixel , so that all texture detail contained in each pixel is properly taken into account during texture evaluation . This corresponds to a value of 50% for Texture Filtering . If you specify a lower value , textures will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you specify a higher value , noise will be smoothed out but textures will appear blurred . <h> In Practice <p> You should tweak the value regarding your specific needs . In practice , the smallest value that yields good enough results should be used . From our own experience , a default value of 33% usually does the trick . <h> Texture Filtering Will Influence 2 Components at Render <p> Bitmaps : for each bitmap used in materials , if you edit its Texture Map node via the Function Graph , you will see a flag named Allow mip-mapping , which is checked by default . When this flag is checked , and if Texture Filtering has a non-zero value , corresponding bitmaps will be pre-filtered just before rendering . Thus , at render time , distant bitmaps wo n't exhibit any noise or flickering . This is particularly useful when rendering animated plants , especially for distant ones . You will enjoy much smoother results , and a great reduction in flickering . As specified above , a value for Texture Filtering of 33% will generally produce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-aliasing is enabled , the Texture Filtering value will drive the size of the filter used by the texture anti-aliasing process , just like for bitmaps . This is very important because if texture anti-aliasing is enabled but Texture Filtering is set to 0% , you wo n't notice any improvement . Just like for bitmaps , a value of 33% is generally ideal for Texture Filtering used along with Texture anti-aliasing . <h> Animations Pulsate <p> This happens when rendering global illumination or radiosity ; it is caused by the way rendering of these effects is optimized and is a common problem to all renderers . Unfortunately , the only way to reduce this effect is to increase the quality boost setting of the global illumination render . <h> Dark Triangles Appear on Terrains <p> This is probably an indication that the terrain with the problem does n't have a high enough resolution . To correct it , double-click on the faulty terrain to open the Terrain Editor , and press the x2 button once . This doubles terrain resolution . Now go to the Erosion tab , select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erosion once to round off the angles in the terrain . This should solve the problem . If it is not the case , try adding more diffusive erosion . If the problem still remains , and especially if the terrain spreads out over a large area , you 'll probably need to split it up into smaller terrains . <p> Another option would be to use a procedural terrain instead of a heightfield terrain . <h> Wrong Material Scale <p> If you have different items in your scene that somehow do n't seem to fit together correctly , it may be that you have a problem with material scales . It is important that the objects of a scene look in proportion to one another ( this does n't mean the Scale control of the material has to be the same ... ) . <p> This problem often occurs with water ( see picture to the right ) : the scale of the waves on the surface of the water does n't fit with the scale of the rest of your scene , so particular attention should go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When rendering soft shadows , depth of field or blurred transparencies and reflections , the lower preset render qualities ( OpenGL and Preview ) approximate the effect by adding noise . This enables you to get an idea of the final result , while not slowing down render . <p> To render all of these effects properly , super-sampling is needed . This is why they render correctly only under Final , Broadcast or Ultra preset render qualities . <h> VUE Objects Lose Relative Positions <p> When you import a set of 3D VUE objects ( . VOB ) it may happen that the relative positions of the different objects get lost . This is because VUE automatically centers objects that you load , so that they fit snugly into the viewports . To get rid of this option , open the Options dialog ( by selecting the menu command File Options ) and uncheck the option called Center Vue objects when loading . A similar option is also available when importing objects created with other 3D applications . <p> Load all the models one after the other by using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now be positioned as it was when it was saved . If the objects appear too small or too large , select them all ( using extended selection ) and move/resize them together . <h> RenderCow Not Responding <p> If , after having setup and launched a RenderCow on a remote computer , you can not manage to add it in the HyperVue Network Rendering Manager , you should check the following : <p> Check that no Firewall is blocking access to the RenderCow either on the remote host , or on the computer running HyperVue . If you are not sure , contact your system administrator for help . <p> Check that no other application is using the same port number on the remote host , or on the computer running HyperVue . If so , change port number . <p> Check that communication on the selected port number is allowed on your network . <h> Unable to Export Object <p> If you are unable to export an object it may be because the object has been forbidden from export . This is often the case with polygon mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of VUE , and all Poser objects imported as PZ3 . When you try to export such an object , a message will appear informing you that the object can not be exported . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> To forbid exporting a polygon mesh , double-click on it to open the Polygon Mesh Options dialog and click the Forbid Export button . Be advised , however , that you can not remove the Forbid from export tag once it has been set . <h> Maya Mental Ray Renders Black <p> This probably means that VUE was not properly linked to the Mental Ray renderer . Try reloading the VUE scene to re-initialize VUE for Mental Ray . <p> To avoid this problem , please ensure that the Mental Ray for Maya plug-in ( Mayatomr.mll ) is loaded before you use VUE , lest VUE wo n't be correctly linked to Mental Ray when creating the scene . We suggest that you setup Maya to automatically load the Mental Ray extension upon startup ( from Maya 's Plug-in manager ) . You can check that Mental Ray has finished loading by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will display the Mental Ray version ) . Mental Ray state is also displayed in the Maya Script Editor . <h> Native Objects Do n't Reflect VUE Objects <p> This is probably caused by a low ray-tracing depth in either the renderer settings or in the shader settings . You need to set the ray-tracing depth to a value greater than 1 to allow VUE-to-Native and Native-to-VUE reflections and refractions . <p> For Maya Software , you can increase the Reflections slider in the Render Global Settings dialog ( Raytracing Quality tab ) . <p> For Mental Ray ( Maya , 3DS Max and Softimage ) , you can increase it in the Mental Ray Settings dialog . <h> Volumetric Plugin Conflict <p> VUE is considered by V-Ray to be a volumetric plugin . Therefore , if using VUW with another V-Ray volumetric plugin , there may be conflicts . For example , if using a VUE sky in the same scene with a hair creating plugin , the hair may take on the color of the sky . It is probably best to limit the use of other plugins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of problems and strange effects .

It just seemed like the right tool ! <p> Can you let us know what the typical workflow was ? <p> Some of the Cornucopia3D city modelsbefore they were destroyed <p> JC : I flew down to LA and took a lot of photo references , just to get an accurate idea of the geography , the landscape and the skyline and the 2 mountains that are Mount Lee and Mount Hollywood . <p> I came back to Whiskytree and started to use Vue to mimic the shape of the mountains and the surrounding areas . The terrain editor was really helpful ! <p> We mainly painted on the final render . You know the benefit from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its just a lot of dirt and grime , and its less specific . And because wed also gone down to LA , and taken a lot of photo references , we actually used photos of the actual buildings that you would see from that point of view , and layered that on and mixed that in the CG buildings . <p> With regards to re-creating the city , we realized that there were loads of great stuff at Cornucopia3D , and we decided to use Cornucopia3D models as a base . We then started destroying the geometry to create the kind of destroyed , blown up effect we were looking for . <p> The Cornucopia3D guys will be really glad to hear what you did to their models ! <p> JC : Indeed , we took all their hard work and shredded it into pieces , which was actually a lot of fun ! <p> We got the meshes as OBJs and loaded them in XSI where we started to delete parts and faces and mess things up a bit before bringing them back into Vue . <p> Move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content <p> Did you have to stick to something that was looking like LA or did you make up the city completely ? <p> JC : We were pretty true to the geography , but we indeed took a bit of liberty with the actual position of the buildings to give a little bit more of a dramatic look to the shot . We added a few more freeways in places I know there are none . And if you 've ever been to LA and gone upon that hike , youd know that what we did is not 100% accurate . But for the most part yes , I think we were pretty true to the environment . In the end we had a little bit more of an accurate portrayal of what youd actually see on top of Mount Lee . <p> Can you give us more details on the Hollywood sign shot ? <p> Screengrab of the Vue interface <p> JC : The Hollywood sign itself was modeled in XSI , and we used Vue to recreate the landscape and mountain side around it . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very barren , burnt , destroyed sort of landscape . A lot of the photography I took was really green and vegetated as obviously there has n't  been any fire up there in several years ! So there was n't much reference we could use from the photos other than the mountains . Vue came in pretty handy in creating the burnt , destroyed , grindy hillside , basically replacing the mountain to add a more dead and destroyed look to it . <h> Technical Aspects <p> Since you were mixing XSI and Vue , did you use Vue in integrated mode ( xStream ) or as 2 separate applications ? <p> JC : Back then , we were still only using Vue 6 which did not have full integration yet . Now were on 7.5 , and I know others on our team have been using it a lot . They seem to be enjoying the new cloud simulations alongside rendering out of XSI really much ! <p> So it was pure Vue 6 Infinite ? <p> JC : Yes , mainly . I was rendering out single frames and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of XSI for final render . <p> Did you animate the shots inside of Vue or only in XSI ? <p> Details of the destroyed LA <p> JC : Actually both . We were using still images for the mountain side but one of the other elements we wanted in the shot was to add animated grass and wind blowing dust . We were able to render out grass blowing in the wind out of Vue . We locked up the camera and rendered a couple hundred frames . We then mapped those frames onto cards and placed them into our 3D scene and rendered out using the XSI camera . <p> This workflow worked great , its really neat . A lot of times before , we had to go out and shoot our own elements , but then it required a cumbersome process just for the extraction . Its a lot easier now to render with the alpha and place that exactly wherever you want in the 3D space . <p> Since everything was shot on blue screen , how did you manage to match the lighting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were able to move our key light wherever we wanted , and we rendered out multi passes . This allowed us to fine tune and adjust each layer within Photoshop to match the plate or other rendered elements we had created . So it was pretty easy to keep the lighting consistent that way . Its a good tool , really helpful . <p> Hollywood sign <p> How would you have done these shots without Vue ? <p> JC : Without Vue ? ! I imagine it would have taken a lot longer ! Probably a lot more trial and error and a lot more experimenting with textures . We would have had to search for a location where there may have been a recent fire or even set a fire ourselves which would have probably gotten me into trouble ! ! ; - ) <p> So you say Vue saved you a lot of time then ? <p> JC : Big time ! Definitely ! <p> What was the resolution at which you 've rendered the frames ? <p> JC : We rendered the still images at a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean image and enabling multi pass to get even more control for each channel in Photoshop . <p> What I did was to set everything up and launch the render on one machine , just before I left for the night , so that when I came back the next day it was all done . <p> And how were the render times like ? <p> JC : It was pretty straightforward , rarely over a night . There was one shot where I came in the next day and it was still rendering maybe for another hour or so , but generally speaking , all went well . <h> About Vue <p> What did Vue bring to the team ? <p> JC : I think the animation feature was a big help to add a little more life to the matte paintings . The ability to combine different materials to create a unique look was definitely very beneficial as well . For me these were the 2 strong points in using Vue ! <p> What do you think could be improved ? <p> JC:Since we were using Vue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interact with other software like XSI would have been pretty awesome - but you 've already done it ! <p> What was your biggest headache with Vue ? <p> JC : The biggest headache ? Let 's see The software hardly ever crashed , so I guess it was probably the render times because I knew I had to plan my day to set the renders at night just before I left in order to get the frames the next day . So maybe if there were ways to get faster renders out ... <p> Are there any features you would n't be without ? <p> JC : The Terrain editor is pretty cool , because like I said I went to town , took a couple of pictures of the terrain I needed to re-create , and based on those photos I was able to simply sculpt out a similar looking mountain fairly easily using the terrain editor . So that 's pretty awesome ! <h> Conclusion <p> What are the next projects where well be able to spot some Vue stuff ? <p> On a personal side , we saw you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sometimes use Vue to help you for your own artwork ? <p> " LA2 " Oil painting by Joe Ceballos <p> JC : You know a lot of the personal paintings I do are from life , going out and studying nature first hand . But I definitely could move on to mixing and matching techniques that I use at work into my personal art . So potentially , I could see a crossover that way . I mean Vue is so helpful in creating works from nothing , just from scratch I guess the main difference with my personal work is that I 'm painting things that are in front of me , whereas what I do at work is all made up . So once I start painting things that are made up in my personal art , I definitely would use tools like Vue to help achieve that . Its a long winded answer , hope it makes sense . : ) <p> Finally , do you you have any expectations for Vue 8 ? <p> JC : What do I expect from Vue 8 ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ! That would be pretty cool ! If I could just press that and go home it would be great ! <p> Seriously , I think that just improving render times and integration with other software like XSI would be the 2 main things . <h> About Whiskytree <h> About Joe Ceballos <p> Joe Ceballos was born and raised in the Los Angeles area .

" <p> Emmanuel Blasset , CG Supervisor , Animal Logic . <p> As the lead VFX company on Baz Luhrmann 's " Australia " , the renowned Sydney-based studio Animal Logic was awarded the task of designing and creating the key VFX shots that take place in the port town of Darwin . <p> The challenge of Darwin was to create a full CG environment , including terrain , period buildings , vegetation and a wharf full of ships of all shapes and sizes . <p> Emmanuel Blasset , CG Supervisor on " Australia " shares with us an insight on how they introduced Vue to their pipeline , for the creation of over 20 shots of the movie . <h> About The Crew at Animal Logic <p> Emmanuel Blasset : I have been working at Animal Logic for over 8 years on projects such as " Farscape " , " Matrix Reloaded " , " Happy Feet " ... More recently as a CG supervisor , I have been responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Australia " . <p> Was this the first time you got to use Vue on a project ? <p> EB : Yes it was . We knew we had a challenge when we were first approached to create large tropical digital sets for " Australia " . Our lead matte painter Tim Warnock proposed Vue as part of the solution for the vegetation . After some initial yet very promising tests , we decided to integrate Vue into our VFX film pipeline . <p> For how long did you work on Australia ? How many people worked on the movie ? And how many of these worked with Vue ? <p> EB : Animal Logic has been on the project for 18 months using a crew of about 80 people to create 185 shots . Vue was used by 3 matte painters and 2 TDs across 20 shots . I was lucky enough to be involved from preproduction until the end of project . <h> Technical Aspects <p> Can you tell us exactly what you were using Vue for ? Did you use Vue in combination with any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively for vegetation across our Darwin digital sets . It was a key component of our senior matte painters ' toolset . <p> Darwin Harbor - Original Shot <p> On more complex CG shots , Vue xStream was used in combination with our main 3D application , Maya . <p> Because of our rendering pipeline using primarily Mayaman and Renderman , some additional integration was required . <p> We first explored using the geometric exporter but we quickly recognized that a lot of Vue 's strength lay within its shading , lighting , rendering engine . In order to keep those qualities without compromising our own rendering approach we opted for a 3D baking solution . <p> Darwin Harbor - Final Shot with Vue elements added <p> How did you manage to integrate the Vue plants with local vegetation ? <p> EB : We had a very clear target in terms of vegetation defined by the art department . Using 3rd party trees and shrubs from www.cornucopia3d.com proved to be a very cost effective solution as all of our library requirements were met , and required very few tweaks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match the camera moves ? <p> EB : Every single shot went through the tracking department producing a usable tracked camera and locators suitable for all 3D and compositing applications supported by our pipeline . For simple matte painting shots , the tracking information was reintroduced at compositing stage . For more complex moves with obvious parallax , trees were rendered directly from the 3D package with the moving camera . <p> How many computers were used to render the Vue scenes ? <p> EB : Thanks to the baking approach we only needed 5 machines to render our Vue scenes . <p> The Wharf - Final Shot with Vue elements added <p> Did you save time using Vue over doing the same job in a traditional way ? <p> Downtown Darwin - Original Shot <p> EB : In a typical matte painting situation , a traditional technique based on photographs requires a lot of research , placement , and corrections to integrate within a shot . <p> As soon as another shot uses a different angle or time of day , all that work has to be redone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another . Ultimately this translates into quicker turnaround across multiple shots . <p> Downtown Darwin - Final Shot with Vue elements added <h> About Vue <p> What was your overall impression of Vue ? <p> EB : Photorealistic organic moving environments are very challenging .

In fact , every type of object , including imported meshes , can be used . You can create sprawling cities , huge crowds , giant ship armadas ... the possibilities are limitless ! <h> Density Control <p> Controlling millions of Ecosystem instances altogether can be tough , especially if you need to work only on specific parts . <p> To ease up your control over EcoSystems , use group or individual layers , and create layers affinities to get the perfect homogeneity . <h> Dynamic EcoSystem Population <p> The Dynamic Population Technology featured in Vue 8 let 's you create dense EcoSystems that extend way beyond the horizon , without concern over the number of instances ! <p> This revolutionary technology is capable of handling the near-infinite number of instances required to populate terrains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also dynamically populate areas of your scene , only as they become visible to the camera . <h> The EcoSystem Material A Breakthrough Concept <p> The EcoSystem behaves just like a regular material ! <p> You can save it as a material and create a whole library of EcoSystems , which can be used later for other scenes and objects . <p> It also means that , just like mixed materials , you can mix two or more EcoSystems , with environment influences such as altitude , slope and orientation ! <h> Unprecedented Control <p> The fact that the EcoSystem is treated like a material means that you can take advantage of Vues powerful function editor to control almost every aspect . <p> For example , use a fractal noise generator to control the distribution of EcoSystem objects , or use a bitmap to limit distribution to specific areas . You can add color variations to the EcoSystem for even greater detail and realism . <h> Layered EcoSystem Materials <p> EcoSystems behave just like regular materials .

If you activate the alternate action of this icon ( ) , the Advanced Animation Options dialog will appear instead . See below for a description of these dialogs . <h> Animation Render Options <p> Motion Blur is only rendered with Broadcast or higher render settings . If you select User settings , you can fully customize the render engine by pressing the Edit button . <p> Use the Frame resolution group to indicate the resolution of the frames in the animation ( Horizontal x Vertical ) . The horizontal and vertical resolutions are linked by the aspect ratio of the scene . <p> The Animation limits group let 's you indicate the part of the animation that you want to render . <p> Render complete animation : if this option is selected , the complete animation will be rendered , starting at the beginning of the active part , and ending at the end of the active part ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 0 and ending at the last keyframe ) . <p> Render sequence : if this option is selected , you can enter manually the limits of the animation . You can either enter the limits using Frame numbers , or using Time . The time or frame counterpart is automatically updated . The values in these fields are initialized with the values of the start and end of the active animation part , as defined by the yellow line in the Timeline duration bar . <p> Frame increment : this setting let 's you skip frames in an animation to reduce render time without affecting the frame rate . By default , the Frame increment is one , which means that all the frames in the animation are rendered . Entering 2 will render every other second frame ; entering 5 will skip 4 frames after each frame rendered ( rendered frames will thus be : 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ) . <h> Channel Files <p> VUE can generate and save the three channels ( Color , Alpha and Depth ) of an animation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other animations using an external compositing application . You can also generate full G-Buffer information for each frame , for maximum compositing information . <p> The Channel files group of controls let you select the destination files for the channel animations . By default , only the Color channel is saved ( Alpha , Depth , G-Buffer and Multi-Pass channel files are disabled ) . <h> Animation File Formats <p> Use the Browse buttons to select you want to save the channel animations to , or to change the selected file format . VUE supports the following animation file formats : <p> AVI : Audio Video Interleaved file format , compressed or uncompressed . Press the File format options button to display a standard Codec selection dialog . Using this dialog , you can control how the AVI animation file is compressed . <p> M1V : Mpeg 1 file format , compressed . Press the File format options button to display a standard options dialog .

Using this dialog , you can control how the Mpeg 2 animation file is compressed . <p> RLA , RPF : set of stand alone Run-Length Encoded ( RLA ) or Rich Picture Format ( RPF ) files that contain all the channels of information stored in the G-Buffer ( you need to enable G-Buffer rendering to use this option ) . <p> Press the File format options button to display the standard VUE Picture Format Options dialog . The frames of the animation are named after the filename you indicate , with the number of the frame appended to it ( e.g. if you save to file Anim.bmp , frames will be named Anim000000.bmp , Anim000001.bmp , Anim000002.bmp , etc . ) . <p> Frame padding : click this button to bring up the Frame Name Options dialog . Using this dialog , you can change the zero-padding of the frame file names . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> G-Buffer / Multi-pass options : click this button to configure the creation and gathering of G-Buffer and Multi-pass rendering information while rendering the animation . This option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Render Options dialog is deselected ( see here ) . If you click this button , the Multi-Pass Options ( G-Buffer ) dialog will appear , letting you select which rendering components and masks to render . <p> Note : <p> Selecting this option does n't mean the G-Buffer or Multi-Pass information will be saved in the animation file . You need to select the RLA or RPF file formats ( for G-Buffer information ) , or multi-layer PSD file format ( for Multi-Pass information ) for this to happen . <h> Frame Rate <p> This group controls the number of frames that will be rendered for every second of animation . The higher this number , the more smoothly the animation will play back . But the longer it will take to render ( and the larger the resulting file ) . <p> Bear in mind that the human eye is unable to isolate more than 24 frames per second . So there is no real point in rendering more than 24 frames per second ( unless you are rendering for TV video , where there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The default is 15 frames per second , and produces reasonable smoothness at a reasonable expense . <h> Frame Resolution <p> This provides a list of typical animation frame resolutions as well as the ability to define custom frame sizes . If the Other frame resolution option is selected , entering a resolution in one of the fields will automatically recompute the corresponding resolution for the other field ( according to picture aspect ratio , provided that this aspect ratio has n't been set to Free ( user defined ) ) . If you want to change the aspect ratio of your frames , press the Edit button in the Preset Render Quality frame to access the Render Options dialog . 25709 @qwx645709 <h> Timecode <p> Timecode Marking Options dialog <p> The Show timecode on frames option will automatically add the frame 's timecode on the rendered animation frames . If you are saving the frames as multi-layer PSD files , the timecode will be placed on a separate layer , so that it can be hidden in post work . The format of the timecode will be the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This can be changed by using the Timeline menu ( Show Time As menu options ) . <p> Whenever this option is selected , the Edit button becomes active . Clicking on this button will display the Timecode Marking Options dialog , letting you configure the color and location of the timecode on the frames . <p> Use the Text frame of the Timecode Marking Options dialog to select the size and color of the text that displays the timecode . Available text sizes are : <p> Small : very small text , approximately 10 pixels high . <p> Medium : this is the same as the typical text used in the application 's interface . Approximately 13 pixels high . <p> Large : this is bold text ( the same as the dialog captions in the application interface ) . Approximately 14 pixels high . <p> Extra-Large : this is very large text . Approximately 20 pixels high . <p> Double-click on the color control to change the color of the timecode text . <p> Use the Background controls to configure the background of the timecode text . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background . This is useful to ensure that the timecode text is readable , whatever the frame colors . <p> Finally , use the Position on frame buttons to select the placement of the timecode text on the frame . <p> Disable automatically for Final or better render modes : when this option is checked , the timecode will be automatically removed when performing the final rendering ( Final or better render quality ) . This can avoid wasting an entire final-render batch just because you forgot to remove the timecodes . <p> If you have this setting checked , the Timecode fields will be grayed out and unavailable when you select a render setting of Final or higher . If you wish to make changes to the Timecode stamp settings , perhaps have it render on a Final or higher quality render , switch your render mode back to Preview or OpenGL to enable the Timecode stamp , then the Show timecode on frames field becomes available so that you can edit it . <h> Renderer <p> This option let 's you select the renderer to be used for rendering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this option to use VUE 's internal renderer . This is the best for quick renders that require interactive feedback ( e.g. when rendering a quick preview ) . <p> External renderer : when this option is selected , VUE will invoke a standalone rendering application that is installed together with VUE . This application will take care of the rendering . Because it is a separate application that is entirely dedicated to rendering , it does n't have to deal with all the overhead of a graphical interface , and can consequently dedicate more memory to the actual rendering process . The caveat is that the scene has to be sent over to the standalone renderer so the time it takes to actually start rendering is longer than when using the internal renderer , and also , because rendering is done by a separate application , you do not see the picture appear gradually on screen as it renders . You can configure the external renderer to either render on your computer , or on a network of RenderCows . This option is particularly useful to speed up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load across all available nodes on your network . <p> Note : <p> Network rendering is only available when you render to screen or to disk . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> RenderNode network : select this option to use a separate render farm administration tool and split the render load across a network of RenderNodes . Please turn here for details on the difference between RenderCows and RenderNodes and the Network Rendering Options dialog . <p> If you configured your external renderer to use network rendering , the picture will automatically be chopped up into tiny fragments . The HyperVue Network Rendering Manager will then assign each fragment to a RenderCow . The network manager collects the resulting picture fragments and reassembles them into the final picture . When you press OK to begin rendering , the scene is added to the list of queued jobs . If it is the first time you render across a network , the HyperVue Network Rendering Manager will appear , letting you configure network rendering . <p> Note : <p> Avoid using network rendering for quick renders , because the overhead of managing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in longer render times . <h> Miscellaneous <p> Auto-play animation when done : select this option to automatically begin playing the animation in an external player when the rendering completes . This option is only available when rendering to an AVI file on Windows systems , and to a QuickTime MOV file on Macintosh . <p> Resume rendering animation : if this button is active , press it to resume rendering an animation that was stopped before it completed . VUE restarts rendering from the exact point where it was stopped ( thus avoiding any loss of render time ) and appends the new frames to the previous animation files ( with the exception of compressed AVI files , because AVI does n't support appending frames to a compressed video stream ; the animation will be saved as Part2 ) . To resume rendering an animation , you must use the same filenames as the ones used during the interrupted render . All render options are stored in the resume enabler files , so you do n't need to worry about them . <h> Closing the Dialog <p> Click OK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cancel to cancel the changes . <p> To accept the changes and render the animation with the new settings , click the Render animation button . <p> If you have interrupted a render , the Resume rendering animation button will be active . Click on this button to resume rendering the animation . <p> Note : <p> Any changes to the render quality will make resuming a render impossible . <h> Advanced Animation Options <p> Advanced Animation Options dialog <p> Using this dialog you can control advanced animation settings , such as flicker reduction , interlacing , pixel aspect ratios as well as illumination baking . <h> Flicker Reduction <p> The options in this group let you activate special algorithms to attempt to reduce the dreaded flickering that is so typical of computer graphics animations . While the ultimate solution to eliminate flickering is simply to increase anti-aliasing settings sufficiently , this has a tremendous impact on render times . The methods described below are hacks that will attempt to reduce flickering without having such a dramatic impact on render times : <p> Deterministic anti-aliasing : when this option is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in random patterns that are repeatable from one frame to the next . This almost totally eliminates static noise , but may , under certain very specific circumstances , create patterns that would be noticeable to the eye . However , the impact on image quality is , at worst , barely noticeable . This is why it is recommended that you leave this option on by default . <p> Multi-frame anti-aliasing : when this option is enabled , VUE will compare the current frame to the previous and the next frame , and try to detect areas of strong flickering to concentrate more rendering samples specifically on those areas . This option requires that the last 3 frames be cached before actual completion of each new frame , and hence only works when rendering an animation . It may also produce a slight blurring of the frames . <p> Distance blurring : this option let 's you artificially blur the frames in the animation . Because flickering appears oftentimes on parts of the scene that are far away from the camera " especially with the new EcoSystem technology where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blurring option let 's you control the amount of blur according to distance : <p> The Intensity setting controls the influence of the distance on the amount of blur . Low settings will blur only objects that are very far from the camera , while high settings will blur all objects in the scene equally . <p> The Max. radius setting controls the maximum radius of the blurring that is applied to the pixels in the frame ( in pixels ) . You can use this setting in combination with the Intensity setting to fine tune the blurring of the frames . <p> In the end , the amount of flicker reduction you apply to your frames should be the result of a compromise between the amount of blur or flickering you can tolerate in your renders , and the amount of time you are willing to spend on the rendering of a particular project . <h> Field Interlacing <p> Field Interlacing turned on for a sphere rapidly moving left to right <p> Turn this option on to activate field interlacing . Field interlacing will render every other half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way video is played back on TV where the screen is refreshed by halves 60 times per second ( 50 times for PAL ) . Use this option to ensure perfect playback on TV " and only when rendering for TV . You can select which field will be the first using the Upper field first or Lower field first options . Do not use this setting if you are not rendering for playback on TV . Default is off . <h> Pixel Aspect Ratio <p> Unlike computer monitors , digital edition systems do n't always work with square pixels . You can modify the pixel aspect ratio to render animations that will be compatible with these systems . When played back on a computer monitor , the animation will look squashed or stretched . <p> Square pixels : this is the default setting , e.g. for computer monitors . <p> D1 NTSC pixels : select this option if you are rendering for D1 NTSC media . <p> D1 PAL pixels : select this option if you are rendering for D1 PAL media . <p> Other aspect ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio . Enter the desired x/y pixel ratio in the corresponding field . 25709 @qwx645709 <h> Automatic Illumination Baking <p> Select this option to automatically bake the indirect lighting of all the meshes in the scene prior to rendering the animation . Turn here for details on the concept of illumination baking . <p> When this option is selected , all meshes that have not forbidden illumination baking will be baked ( according to the options of this group and the per-object baking options " see here ) before rendering the animation . This usually results in dramatic reductions of render times , at the expense of potentially very long preparation times . <p> You can adjust the way automatic illumination baking is handled using the options in this group : <p> Bake every time : when this option is selected , the illumination will be baked again each time you begin rendering the animation " whatever the current baking status . <p> Smart baking : when this option is selected , VUE will check the baking quality of all the meshes in the scene and compare them to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baking quality is greater than required , and if the lighting conditions have not changed , the illumination is not baked for that mesh . If the current baking quality is insufficient , or if VUE determines that lighting conditions have changed , a message will appear asking whether you wish to recompute illumination baking before starting the animation rendering . <p> Force baking this time : this option is only available when the Smart baking option above is selected . If you check this option , the illumination of all the meshes in the scene will be recomputed this time ( the check is automatically removed after completing the baking ) . <p> Map resolution boost : this setting controls the overall quality of the baking process . The higher the resolution of the illumination maps , the greater the quality of the baking , and the more detailed the illumination . You can define a base illumination map resolution for each mesh in the scene . This base resolution should be such that , at any time during the animation , the illumination map 's resolution will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution of the illumination maps of all the objects in the scene by a given boost ratio . This is particularly useful if you decide to increase the output resolution of your animation , because all you have to do is increase the boost factor accordingly . The boost factor works along the principle of octaves ( +1 means double resolution , -1 means half resolution ) . <h> Animation Preview Options <p> Animation Preview Options <p> This dialog let 's you customize the quality of the animation preview that is rendered when you press the icon in the Timeline . <p> To open this dialog you must activate the alternate action of the aforementioned icon . <p> Use the Preset render quality group to select the render setting that will be used to render the preview ( read here for details ) . Bear in mind that a preview render should be something fast , so you might want to avoid using high quality settings such as Broadcast or Ultra . The default is Preview . <p> Select the Preview frame rate of the animation preview . Default is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase it to get smoother playback . <p> Select the Preview size which can be 1x , 2x or 4x . <p> You can loop the preview if you check the Loop animation preview box . When this is checked , the animation preview will start again at time 0 at the end of the preview . Stop the preview by using the Stop button in the animation control bar . <p> Press the Discard current preview button to get rid of the current preview without having to render another one . <h> Recovering TMP Files from an Aborted Render <p> If you are rendering an animation to individual frames and it is interrupted for any reason leaving . tmp files in your target directory , there is a way to recover these files . VUE now generates a recovery.cfg file containing the necessary information for the recovery . <p> Just start VUE from the Run dialog in Windows or the terminal window on the Mac using this command line :

When a cloud layer is added , a picture displays of the clouds being generated . If you wish to change the material and density of this cloud layer , click on the picture and the Advanced Cloud Material Editor displays . <h> Color &amp; Density Tab <p> Color &amp; Density Tab <p> Volumetric materials are based on a density production that indicates the local density of the material over a cloud layer . <h> Density Production <p> This is how Density production works : for each point of the volume , the function returns a number in the range of 0 to 1 ( 0 appears black on the preview and 1 white ) . The number is then transformed by the filter into a density at this point ( 0 if the material does n't exist , 1 if the material is solid ) . When rendering the material , VUE accumulates the density of material all along the ray of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting color of the material . <p> To modify the function , double-click on the picture of the function . This will open the Visual Function Browser . <p> Use the scaling controls to scale the function along the X , Y and Z axes . The same for the filter . <h> Cloud layer detail <p> If the edited material is used for a Spectral cloud layer or a MetaCloud , the detail settings are available ; these settings control the amount of detail that is visible in the cloud . <p> Scaling : this parameter controls the overall scale of the details . Higher values will produce more elaborate cloud shapes . <p> Roughness : this parameter controls the feathering ' in the cloud shape . Typical values should be below 0.5 . Higher values will produce a lot of feathering around the cloud . <p> Variations : this parameter controls how much the roughness effect varies throughout an entire cloudscape . The effect of this setting is not visible at small scales , but will add large-scale variety to your cloudscapes . <p> Uniformity : this parameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud . High values mean that the cloud will be uniformly rough , whereas low values will create clouds that are rounder and less feathered underneath . <h> Cloud Modulation <p> Functions are available to adjust the properties of the layer . Contrary to Density production function which takes a local position impossible to translate to world , these functions could take a world position or a local position in entry . When you choose to link these function to the graph , you have a checkbox that allows you to choose between global or local coordinates . <p> Simple atitude offset over a terrain ; x is the altitude variations value between 0 and 1 <p> Atitude offset and height modulation over a terrain ; x is the altitude variations value between 0 and 1 ; h(pos) is the local height modulation between 0 and 1 <p> There are five functions available : <p> Altitude offset : The entry point in the cloud layer is offset by this function . If the altitude variation value is x , we divide the height H of the layer in two parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which the offset factor is applied and which gives the offset , and one of height H / ( 1 + x ) which defines the real height of the layer . The summary diagrams illustrate this . <p> Altitude offset effect on Z : The position inside the layer has the form ( x , y , z + altOffset ) . Effect on Z is a slider affecting the altOffset so as to replace the position by ( x , y , z + altOffset * effectOnZ ) . The use of this slider is to negate the effect of the deformation given by offset , this way clouds will look as if they gently slide over the deformation when EffectOnZ is 0% . When it 's 100% clouds will look as if appearing from the contour of the deformation . <p> Height modulation : The height of the layer is modulated by a 0,1 factor . <p> Density modulation : This modulation can act as a helper for the density production . When the value is at 100% the cloud aspect matches the parameter entered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft and feathered cloud . It can help make the clouds realistically disappear when you want them to fade out . <p> Sharpness modulation : This modulation can vary the sharpness of the cloud . Moving toward 1 gives you a sharper edged cloud . <p> Improve Low Quality Consistency : This option allows the cloud layer to have a better consistency between low resolution render and FullHD renders . Unchecking this option will give you the old render . Every new scene will have this option activated by default on each layer . The option is here not to break the rendering of old scene . This option works on spectral atmospheres , both Photometric and Standard . <h> Other settings <p> Custom layer profile : When selected , this graph shows the profile of the cloud layer . Click on the graph to open the graph editor to make any changes you need . <p> Volumetric color : Volumetric color of clouds can be linked to a graph instead of using a constant color . This works with the Ambient color contribution from sky and sun found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can drive this volumetric color with a function . If you want a constant color , click the color square to pick the desired color . <h> Large scale density Tab <p> Large Scale Density Tab <p> The cloud settings on this tab are for use with planetary terrains to give the desired effects whether viewing the entire from space or closer to the surface of the terrain . <p> Use planetary cloud density map : Check the option and use the Load button to to load a planetary cloud density map .

Balance this with Influence on height . <p> Influence on height : This is used to drive altitude variations of the cloud layer using the planetary map , bright regions being higher than dark ones . This works along with the base altitude variations setting of the cloud layer , both effects being blended according to the influence amount . <p> Limit wall effect : A wall effect can happen when you use a map to define the density of clouds . When you go from a density of 0 to a density of 1 , this results in a ' wall of clouds ' suddenly appearing at the transition . The setting allows to limit this effect by automatically detecting such transitions and recreating a more realistic occurrence of clouds . <h> Lighting &amp; Effects Tab <p> Lighting &amp; Effects Tab <h> Lighting <p> The controls in this group let you customize the way the material reacts to light . <p> Lighting model : use this drop-down list to select the lighting model used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting model is the simplest . The color of the material is uniform , and only depends on the density . Light is not taken into account when computing the color .

The color of the volumetric material is added <p> Volumetric layer ( v.2.0 ) : this is similar to the Volumetric ( v.1.0 ) model , <p> If the selected lighting model is the Volumetric layer , the following checkboxes become available . <p> Internal shadows : when this option is selected , the shadows inside the cloud will be computed , meaning that some parts of the cloud will cast shadows on other parts of the cloud . This option produces much more realistic clouds , but increases render times significantly . <p> Cast shadows : when this option is selected , the cloud layer casts shadows in the atmosphere that can result in the appearance of Godrays if conditions are favorable . This option also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it does not necessarily produce a noticeable improvement in picture quality . In order for Godrays to be visible , you must also enable Godrays in the Atmosphere Editor . <p> GI ambient color : This turns on the GI ambient lighting . <p> Force ambient color : Checking this option activates Sky Ambient Color and Sun Ambient Color . These colors can be set in the color squares next to the field . These also can be driven by a function . Be sure to set the Volumetric color on the Color and Density Tab . The actual color of the cloud is a result of complex light filtering , based on Volumetric color and Ambient colors . Sky Ambient Color and Sun Ambient Color settings modify the contribution of the sky and sun to the final color . <h> Flare <p> The controls in this group are only active in Flat Layer models . <p> When light is seen from behind a thin volumetric material , it will cause the material to become very bright . This is called flaring . Flaring does n't occur when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You control flaring through two settings : Intensity and Span .

These controls let you automatically define how cloud layers react to the proximity of other objects in the scene " for instance to let high mountains peak through the clouds . <p> Dissolve near objects : select this option to have the density of volumetric cloud layers drop automatically near the objects in the scene . <p> Accuracy : this setting controls the precision with which the proximity to other objects in the scene is evaluated . <p> Softness : this setting controls how gradually the cloud dissolves near foreign objects . Low values mean the clouds will vanish abruptly near objects . <p> Distance : this setting controls how far away from the objects the clouds are influenced . You can control the amount of dissolving using a combination of both this and the Softness setting .

When the distribution is controlled by a function , the Presence setting on the EcoSystem population list indicates an interval for each item . To decide which item should be placed where , the EcoSystem populator evaluates the result of the function at the current point and finds the interval that contains the function output . The corresponding item is created . Values outside the valid range of -1 ; 1 are clamped . <p> Connecting the distribution parameter to a function is one of the rare cases that immediately affects the way the material behaves : by default , the function outputs 0 , so only the item whose presence range contains 0 will appear in the population . <p> Affinity with layer : this setting controls how strongly instances from this layer are attracted ' to instances from other EcoSystems below it on the layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trees and want to have primroses around the trees , you 'd add a layer of primroses on top of the tree layer , and enter a positive value for affinity .

This setting is only available if there is another EcoSystem below this one on the layer stack . <p> Repulsion from layer : this setting controls how close new instances can be added to instances from underlying EcoSystems . The effect of repulsion is a lot more sudden ' than that of affinity . For instance , if you have a layer of trees and want to have grass everywhere except around the trees , you 'd add a layer of grass on top of the tree layer , and add some repulsion . Higher values will make the grass stay further away from the trees . If you enter a negative value for repulsion , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and repulsion simultaneously , you could , for instance , have the grass appear near the trees , but not underneath them .

However , one can not specify different distribution settings for these images ( like density , rotation , scale etc ) . <p> To map the picture ( 2D by definition ) onto a 3D volume , VUE must use one of the available mapping modes . Each of these mapping modes is best suited for some types of objects ( e.g. spherical for Spheres ) . <p> Select one of the following : <p> Automatic : The mapping technique is chosen automatically , depending on the object onto which the material is applied ( e.g. Spherical for a sphere , cylindrical for a cylinder ) . <p> Automatic UV : This mapping technique is used for a 3D displaced textured terrain to allow for the generated mesh of the terrain at render time . <p> Flat : Vertical projection / @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture on the ground ; values do n't depend on altitude . <p> Faces : Slide projector type of projection oriented along one of the three world axes . For each point , the projection axis is the closest axis to the normal vector of the object . <p> Cylindrical : Mercator projection : the picture is wrapped around a cylinder around the vertical axis before being projected . <p> Spherical : The picture is projected so that it covers exactly a sphere . Since the picture wraps around 180 vertically , and 360 horizontally , the scale seems to double vertically . <p> Torical : The picture is projected so that it covers exactly a torus . A strange , and not very useful mapping mode , hum <p> If you do n't know which to use , select Automatic . <p> Note : <p> The shape of the object on which you project the picture does not have to be the same as the type of projection you choose . <p> You can control the way the picture is repeated along both axes using the Tiling drop-down boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the default . The image is repeated indefinitely along this axis . <p> Mirror : in this mode , the image is also repeated indefinitely , however , it is mirrored each time so that the repetitions join seamlessly . <p> You can position the picture precisely on the object by using the Image offset commands . This will move the picture around by increments of one pixel . <p> The Color blend group let 's you blend the colors of the picture with a solid color .

It supports standard terrains and meshes . For Projected Texture Maps only , there is a field for Image Rotation which allows you to rotate the material on the object . <p> Click on the Gizmo icon to display the Texture Placement Editor . This dialog displays the selected object with a gizmo representing the scale/rotation center . You can show the isolated object by un-toggling the Show Scene button . <p> The gizmo you see is a representation of the scale/rotation center of your image on the edited object . Use Alt to move the pivot center . <p> Note : <p> Edition mode is only accessible in Flat and Faces mapping mode . <p> In Faces , the gizmo will position itself on the nearest mapping face regarding your view orientation . In Flat , the gizmo will be positioned in the top plane of the object 's parametrical space . <p> Be careful to slow object 's reconstructions . Changing the mapping necessitates that the UV are re-baked for the OpenGL display at every interaction frame . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We recommend lowering the quality settings when editing mapping to improve the interactivity on the Display tab of the Options panel ( Instant draw and Background draw faster instead of better ) . <h> The Pivot <p> The pivot is the rotation center for your manipulation . But it is also the position at which the manipulator will be displayed and reset after each movement . You can edit the pivot position using the Alt key , or the Edit pivot toggle button . <p> You can position your pivot in 3 dimensions in order to place the manipulator exactly at the location you are looking at . To simplify this task you can use the Pick pivot position toggle button . Just click that icon and click inside the editor window to select the position of the pivot on the object you are editing . <h> How It Works <p> There are two proxy objects , the Mapping manipulator ( a little plane ) and the Rotation center . When you manipulate the plane proxy , its movement is read and translated into change in the image mapping parameters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirrored in the top of the editor . When you manipulate the pivot proxy , it only changes an internal position that is used to recalculate offsets when you are doing rotations with the plane . This is used to create the sensation of free rotation center . In reality , the rotation center is always at the ( 0.0 ) in UV space , but you will notice the offsets ' changing after each rotation to simulate the displaced center . <h> Limitations <p> There are inherent limitations of the above mentioned points . This is not an UV editor tool , it is only a mapping parameters editor . As such , for example , if you are in Faces mapping projection , you can not edit independently the mapping parameters of each 6 sides . <p> The manipulator proxy object is trying to match at best the texture speed and movement , but in certain circumstances movement of the gizmo can very well be unrelated to the movement of the texture . Notably , when editing the mapping of a mesh with UV , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the mapping is changed . <p> To avoid problems like this , avoid slants in object transformations , and use linear projections rather than UV mapping , like Faces and Flat . <p> There are also limitations in the previsualization . The VUE OpenGL is used to preview the modifications in conjunction with the small render scene preview at the right of the application main panel . <p> The limitations of VUE 's standard viewports OpenGL also applies in the editor . It is impossible to preview multiple layer materials at once . On the performance side , it is impossible to change the mapping without reconstructing the entire object . ( We plan to develop improvements in future versions ) . This limitation , however , does not prevent you from editing the mapping of an intermediate layer , in a multi-layer material . You can use the Function Graph for that . From the Material Editor , select the layer you want to edit , then in the Color Tab , right click on your image and choose Edit Function . Then , in the Function Graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then access the Show Manipulation Gizmo . The editor 's OpenGL will show a temporary material featuring only the layer you selected . You can do the same for any Projected Texture Map node in your graph . <h> Procedural Colors <p> Color &amp; Alpha tab - Simple Material - Procedural colors <p> VUE can produce the colors of the material algorithmically , using a function , a filter and a color map . <p> This is how it works : for each point of the surface , the function calculates a value in the range of 0 to 1 ( 0 appears black on the preview of the function , 1 appears white ) . This value is then transformed by the filter into another value in the range of 0 to 1 . The filter can be added in the Function Graph . From this last value , the color map produces the color of the surface ( if this value is 0 , the color will be the one at the left end of the map , if it is 1 , it will be the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function , double-click on the picture of the function . This will open the Visual Function Browser . <p> Use the scaling controls to scale the function along the X and Y and Z axes . If necessary , use the filter to modify how function values are transformed into colors ( Control-click on the filter ) . <p> Finally , indicate which colors are assigned to the values of the function by editing the color map ( Control-click on the map ) . <p> Note : <p> If the color map is solid ( only one color ) , whatever the function and filter values might be , the material will always yield a uniform color . <h> Alpha Values <p> As well as colors , this tab can be used to control the alpha value of the material . Alpha is the same as non-refractive transparency . It can be used to ' cut out ' parts of a material , and is especially useful when working with layers . For instance , if you wanted to create a label using a bitmap , you would create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer is completely transparent outside of the label . Alpha can also be used in conjunction with refractive transparency to ' cut out ' parts of glass materials . <p> If the surface of the material is colored by a bitmap , the alpha output is automatically connected to the alpha value of the image ( fully opaque by default ) . Outside the image ( if the image is not tiled ) , the alpha value is automatically set to 0 ( fully transparent ) . <p> If the surface of the material is colored using procedural colors , the alpha output is connected to the alpha value of the color map . <p> You can access the Function Graph by right-clicking on the sphere under Alpha production . Right click on the graph to the right of the alpha image to edit the filter . <p> Alpha values are especially useful to control the presence of a layer in a multi-layer material ( see here ) . <h> Animated Texture Options <p> Animated Texture Options <p> The Animated Texture Options dialog can be accessed by clicking the Animated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears below the texture map previews , when a sequence of pictures or an animation has been loaded . <p> This dialog let 's you customize the way animated texture maps are displayed . <p> Image sequence : this is the list of pictures to use in the animation .

To remove images from the list , select them and then press the Remove icon ( ) . <p> Frame rate : this defines the playback rate of the pictures on the list . Ideally , this should at least be equal to the global animation frame rate . <p> Interpolate frames : when this option is selected , in-between frames are interpolated by gradually blending the previous and the next frames .

Changes made to these settings will be immediately reflected in the Advanced Material Editor . <p> Origin : defines the point of origin of the projection " e.g. , when mapping in spherical coordinates , defines the center of the sphere . <h> Natural Grain <p> Natural Grain Texture Options <p> The aim of this feature is to produce more natural or realistic color variations for terrains , ground , or any natural element in the scene , and provide an easy access to settings such as contrast , balance or roughness . <p> Coloring Mode : Natural grain is selected . <p> First you must indicate what is the basic color .

EcoPainter is everything you need to accurately and interactively spread and control your EcoSystem populations using your mouse or pressure sensitive tablet . <p> The EcoSystem painter let 's you interactively paint Ecosystems over any surface ( or group of surfaces ) . It can be used for editing EcoSystem materials , or as a stand-alone tool . The latter option means you can paint EcoSystems on the fly , without the need to create an EcoSystem material first . Painting can be performed with a mouse or with a tablet , which gives you the ability to control additional parameters through pressure . <p> You can paint over any number of selected objects , even the entire scene . While you paint in any view , the instances are automatically dropped and aligned to the surface . You can paint a mix of all the items in your population list , or paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at any time , or you can clear the whole EcoSystem for a fresh start . <p> The EcoSystem painter features 4 different painting tools : <h> The Single Instance Tool <p> This tool turbo-charges the process of placing individual plants , rocks or other objects in your scene . There 's no more need to add a tree to the scene , move it to the desired place , then drop it to the ground . Simply point and click , and a new tree is created in that spot , and is automatically dropped to the surface . Of course , when using SolidGrowth plants , each new click generates a different instance . <h> The Brush Tool <p> The brush tool let 's you paint complete EcoSystems over the surface , in an intuitive and precise way . You can set the brush radius , size and density parameters , or use a pressure-sensitive tablet to control them as you paint ( e.g. press harder to create larger instances ) . The brush tool can also be used in paintbrush mode ( holding the mouse button down adds more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of the brush tool , the eraser tool let 's you paint-remove instances to create forest or jungle clearings , or to modify the placement of instances .

Like the brush and eraser tools , you can choose to affect only specific items or everything together . All changes you make are updated in real time in the display windows . <h> The Instance Selector <p> The instance selector let 's you select or deselect instances by painting over the EcoSystem with a brush . Multiple selection sets can be saved and re-loaded at any time . Selected instances can be manipulated directly using the standard tools . <p> You can also convert instances into real objects , modify them , and then put them back into the EcoSystem later if required . <h> The New EcoPainter <p> The EcoSystem Painter ( EcoPainter ) is completely redesigned to allow even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own brushes using a combination of effectors . For instance , brushes that will resize and align instances at the same time . <p> There are a number of new brush effects to boot , including the ability to lean or rotate instances , raise or lower them , move them around , etc . <h> Customizable EcoPainter Brushes <p> Like the brushes in the Terrain Editor , each EcoPainter brush now has its own dialog that displays all of the parameters that can be adjusted . <p> If you want to display a specific brush parameter directly in the main EcoPainter dialog , you can do so with a click on the corresponding Publish icon . <h> Integrated Selection Tool <p> The EcoSystem Selection tool is now part of the EcoPainter .

The editor can stay open without stopping other parts of the software from being accessible . <h> The Basics <h> What Is a Graph ? <p> A graph displays a set of interconnected nodes that are used to generate output values based on the values of a given set of inputs . <h> Input and Output Nodes <p> The graph inputs sit on the left side of the graph . The graph outputs are placed at the right side of the graph . Input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and output nodes are the points where the data exits the graph . Output nodes represent the value that is computed by the function . <p> Data enters the graph at the input nodes , flows through the different nodes and links in the graph , and exits at the output node . You can not delete input or output nodes , and you can not place other nodes to the left of the input nodes or to the right of the output nodes . <p> The default types of input are : <p> Position : this input node produces a vector value representing the position of the point where the function is being evaluated . Obviously , the value of this input node depends on the mapping mode selected for the object 's material . <p> Normal : this input node produces a vector value representing the direction in which is pointing the surface at the point of evaluation of the function . <p> Altitude : this input node produces a signal whose value is proportional to the altitude of the point where the function is being evaluated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can vary beyond the range -1 through 1 . <p> Slope : this input node produces a signal whose value is proportional to the local slope at the point where the function is being evaluated . If the surface is horizontal , the value of the input will be 1 . If the surface is vertical , it will be 0 . And if the surface is horizontal , only facing down , the value will be -1 . <p> Orientation : this input node produces a signal whose value varies between -1 and 1 according to the azimuth of direction in which is pointing the surface at the point where the function is being evaluated . If the surface is pointing up along the Y axis , the input value will be 0 . The signal jumps from -1 to 1 as the normal turns from south-west to south-east . <p> You can create additional input nodes by clicking the Input Node icon ( ) in the left toolbar of the Function Graph .

For instance , if you are editing the terrain altitude function of a procedural terrain , the output will be labeled Altitude ' , and the value generated by the function will be used to generate the altitudes of the procedural terrain . <p> Usually , the type of data output by a function is a number ( a floating point value ) , but there are some cases where functions can also export colors ( e.g. when editing the color function of a procedural material ) . If you try to use a function that outputs a color where a number is expected , SmartGraph ( see below for details ) will automatically add a node to convert the color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In some cases , functions can output multiple channels of data . This is for instance the case when you edit a function from a simple procedural material . In that case , the Function Graph will display output nodes for all the different channels in the material ( color , bump , transparency , etc . ) . You can reuse portions of the graph to generate outputs for several channels simultaneously instead of having to duplicate portions of the graph ( e.g. you could plug the color and bump outputs to the same node ) . <p> You can create additional output nodes by clicking the Output Node icon ( ) in the left toolbar of the Function Graph . The number and nature of additional output nodes that can be created depends on the context of the function . For instance , settings in the Material Editor that are exportable ' ( they are identified by the icon " see here ) will have a corresponding optional output node in the corresponding Function Graph . <p> If there are several output nodes in the Function Graph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known as the master output . There can only be one master output in a function graph . The master output is the output that corresponds to the channel from where the Function Graph was accessed . For instance , if you entered the Function Graph by editing the color channel production function , the master output will be the color output . But if you enter the Function Graph by editing the bump production function , then the master output will be the bump output instead of the color output . <p> The master output is displayed with a stronger contrast than the other output nodes " even when it is not selected ( or a node connected to this output is not selected ) . If you press the Save icon ( ) in the dialog bar , only the part of the graph that is connected to the master output will be saved . Saved functions will appear in the Visual Function Browser like any other of the predefined functions . By default , functions are placed in the Functions subfolder . This means that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Browser . In the same way , if you load a new function into the Function Graph using the Load icon ( ) , or reset it by pressing the New icon ( ) , only the part of the graph connected to the master output will be replaced ( or removed ) . <h> Nodes <p> Nodes are represented by little boxes on the graph . A node receives a flow of data on its entries , affects a certain processing on that data according to its type and the values of optional parameters , and generates one or several flows of outgoing data . This outgoing data can be of the same type as the incoming data , or it can be of a different type . <p> There are 10 different categories of nodes : noise nodes , fractal nodes , color nodes , texture map nodes , filter nodes , constant nodes , turbulence nodes , combiner nodes , math nodes and dynamics nodes . For your convenience , the category of a node is identified by the shape of the box that represents the node @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph in two different sizes : <p> a small version with a symbol that identifies the node category ( on top of the shape of the box ) , or <p> a large version with a preview of the node in it ( the shape of the box still indicates the node category ) . <p> The size of the nodes is defined automatically according to the settings in the Graph Options menu ( see here ) , but you can force any of the two versions using the Show in graph option in the node details section of the Function Graph ( see here ) . That way you can make important nodes stand out by making them larger than the other ones . <p> It is possible to change the display color of any node ( or groups of nodes ) on the graph to improve readability . Just select the node ; under the preview of the node there is a color box . Click on it to open the Color Selection and select a display color for that node . <h> Types of Data <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of data : <p> Number : this is a floating point value . It is the typical output of a function graph . Noise nodes and Fractal nodes ( among others ) produce numbers . <p> Color : this is the typical output of the color nodes . If you are editing the Color channel of a material , the function may either output a number ( in which case the number will be converted into a color outside of the function using a color map ) , or directly output a color . <p> Texture Coordinates : this is a two-dimensional vector that typically indicates the texture coordinates of the point where the function is being evaluated . This is the typical output from the Projection node . <p> Vector : this is a set of 3 numbers that indicate a position or a direction in space . Typically , the position and normal inputs are both vectors , where position indicates the position of the point where the function is being evaluated ( converted into the appropriate coordinate system depending on the selected mapping mode ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object is pointing , at the point where the function is being evaluated . <h> Links <p> Links are the lines that connect different nodes together . Links represent the flow of data through the graph . The data always flows down , from top ( inputs ) to bottom ( outputs ) . If a node is higher than another one , you know it is being processed before . <p> The color of the link indicates the type of data that is being transported by the link : <p> Blue link : number ( e.g. noise output ) , <p> Green link : color information , <p> Purple link : texture coordinates , <p> Red link : vector data ( e.g. position ) , <p> Gray link : undefined data type . <p> When a link is selected ( e.g. by clicking on it ) , it is drawn with a thicker line , and the two nodes that the link connects are displayed in the link properties part of the Function Graph . <h> SmartGraph <p> SmartGraph is a collection of unique and extremely clever technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole purpose of SmartGraph is to make the creation and edition of VUE function graphs both easy and fun . <p> As you add , replace or remove nodes or links , SmartGraph determines what can be done to simplify your task . For instance , if you delete a node , SmartGraph will attempt to reconnect the link that was broken . When you add a node from a given category behind another one , SmartGraph will try to find a type of node in that category that is compatible with the data generated by the previous node " and if the previous node was connected to another node , SmartGraph will look for a type of node that can be placed in between the two ( compatible data types on entry and exit ) .

What seemed utterly impossible became easily feasible . Nightmarish tasks became a pleasant ride . With this third generation of EcoSystem , this ground-breaking technology has been improved again : the revolution marches on ! <p> Real world natural environments are extremely complex . Just think of the millions of plants , trees and rocks that make up the landscape around you . <p> Creating such highly detailed scenes in 3D is an exhausting task , both in terms of hard work and computer resources .

This setting can also be controlled using a function graph . <p> When painting EcoSystems , you can paint with the underlying EcoSystem material rules applied , so that , for instance , the influence of slope and altitude or the coloring rules are taken into account when painting instances . <p> When painting in the Global EcoSystem , you can accurately control the way instances are added by directly accessing the underlying material and customizing all the population rules . <h> The Instance Selector <p> The instance selector tool let 's you select or deselect instances and move them around in the scene to a precise location . <p> You can also convert instances into real objects , modify them , and then put them back into the EcoSystem later if required . <h> Powerful Layered EcoSystem Materials <p> EcoSystems behave just like regular materials . You can save them as a material and create a whole library of EcoSystems , which can be used later for other scenes and objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of layers , each layer with its own population list and full set of controls . <p> The fact that the EcoSystem are treated like a material means that you can take advantage of Vues powerful material and function editor to control almost every aspect . <p> For example , use a fractal noise generator to control the distribution of EcoSystem objects , or use a bitmap to limit distribution to specific areas . <p> Using the material layer environmental parmeters tab , EcoSystems can be influenced by altitude , slope and orientation . <h> Affinity and Repulsion <p> Layers in an EcoSystem material can also influence one another . By using the affinity and repulsion parameters , its possible to define a relationship between two layers . <p> For instance , using affinity , trees in the first layer can affect the distribution of grass in the second layer , so that the grass grows only around the trees . <p> Display quality can be linked to the camera . Instances in a user-defined radius around the camera will be displayed at full quality , while the rest will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOD automatically updates as the camera is moved around , making camera placement inside EcoSystems much easier . <h> EcoSystem Display Improvements <p> The rendering of shaded EcoSystem billboards is improved to provide a more accurate coloring and reduce flickering when moving around the scene . <p> You can change the display quality of EcoSystem instances on individual population elements ( e.g. hide grass instances but show trees ) . <p> You can also decide which population elements will appear in full 3D near the camera ( Full Quality Near Camera option ) . <p> You can also instantly limit the display quality of all EcoSystem instances in your scene using a single menu command or keyboard shortcut , for swifter navigation inside complex projects . <p> You can refresh dynamic EcoSystem previews anytime by clicking the Preview button in the EcoSystem material . <h> Colored EcoSystem Billboards <p> Changes made to EcoSystem instance color , size and position are displayed in the Vue OpenGL viewports . This way , you immediately get a better idea of what the final render will look like .

Effective resolution attempts to generate texture maps where the resolution of the texture once it has been mapped on the supporting geometry is roughly the one indicated in the Resolution setting , and is more or less constant over all objects . Although this mode results in texture maps of varying resolutions , it is the one that will result in the most consistent texture mapping .

This can be useful in addition to the previous feature for extremely accurate object removals in the post-processing phase . <h> Channels <p> The G-Buffer is organized in a potentially unlimited number of layers . Each layer contains a number of channels of information . <p> All G-Buffer channels are supported in VUE . Here is the list of the different channels available : <p> Z Depth : a floating point value representing the distance to the fragment . <p> Material I 'd : an integer value that uniquely identifies the material assigned to the object hit in this fragment . <p> Layer I 'd : an integer value that identifies the VUE layer that the object belongs to ( see the description of Layers in the World Browser for details ) . <p> Normals : an integer value representing the compressed normal vector to the surface of the fragment . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd : an integer value that uniquely identifies the object hit in this fragment . <p> Color : 3 bytes representing the RGB color values of the fragment ( after it is clamped to the visible spectrum ) . <p> Velocity : two floating point values representing the velocity vector of the fragment in screen coordinates . <p> UV coordinates : a pair of floating point values in the range of 0 through 1 representing the U and V coordinates of the textures mapped on the fragment . <p> Non clamped colors : 4 bytes representing a Ward 's Shared Exponent Format encoded color . This is the color that was actually rendered before it was clamped to the visible spectrum . <p> Sub-pixel coverage : a byte representing the percentage of the pixel covered by this fragment ( 255 meaning 100% coverage ) . <p> Transparency : 3 bytes representing the RGB color values of the filtering applied to all fragments behind this fragment . <p> Sub-pixel weight : 3 bytes representing the actual contribution of this fragment to the final pixel color ( it takes transparency of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

When this option is selected , the controls in the Multi-Pass frame become active . Simply add a check along each one of the layers/masks you would like VUE to generate . If you select a category , all the layers/masks of this category will be generated .

When enabled , render exposure will be dynamically applied to multi-pass render components upon display and saving to disk . This is useful with HDR pictures , especially in photometric lighting mode . <h> Rendering Components <p> VUE 's multi-pass rendering engine is capable of separating the following render information : <p> Diffuse : this component contains the colors caused by light diffused by the surface of the object in all directions ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Specular : this component contains the light reflected by the surface of objects ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Shadows : this component contains the shadows cast by objects ; it is saved as a product layer in Photoshop documents . This corresponds to shadow applied onto geometry visible in the Diffuse pass , which does n't include clouds . If cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the full render would n't be possible , because multiplying diffuse pass by shadow pass would add wrong shadows onto geometry visible through those clouds . <p> Ambient : this component contains the light created by the ambient lighting term ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Refractions : this component contains the colors refracted through objects ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Reflections : this component contains the colors reflected by objects ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Background : this component contains the background colors ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Indirect lighting : this component contains the lighting caused by other objects in the scene ( when rendering with Global Radiosity ) ; it is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Atmosphere filter : this component , together with the Atmosphere gain component contains the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to hold this information on two layers , because of a limitation in the Photoshop layer handling ( no true additive mode ) ; this component is saved as a normal ( i.e. additive ) layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Atmosphere gain : this is the second half of the atmosphere effect ; it is saved as a product layer in Photoshop documents . <p> Additionally , if you render an animation with the Show timecode on frames option enabled , a Timecode layer will be added at the top of the list of layers in the Photoshop document ( normal layer ) . <h> Extra Components <p> On top of the above rendering components , VUE can also produce the following additional rendering information ( not part of the actual picture per se , but potentially useful when post-processing ) grouped in the Extra components category : <p> Z Depth : indicates the distance to the object at this point , <p> XY Normal : indicates the direction of the normal vector to the surface of the object at this point , the X component of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component being stored in the Green byte , <p> XYZ Normal : indicates the direction of the normal vector to the surface of the object at this point in world coordinates , the X component of the vector being stored in the Red byte , the Y component being stored in the Green byte , and the Z component being stored in the Blue byte , <p> UVW coordinates : indicates the value of the UVW texturing coordinates at this point in world coordinates , the U coordinate being stored in the Red byte , the V coordinate being stored in the Green byte , and the W coordinate being stored in the Blue byte , <p> Diffuse lighting : indicates the amount of diffuse lighting arriving at the surface of objects at this point , unaffected by object colors , <p> Specular lighting : indicates the amount of specular lighting hitting the surface of objects at this point , unaffected by object colors , <p> Material color : indicates the color of the object that was hit at this point , unaffected by light , <p> Object I 'd : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the objects at each point in the final image ( this information is not anti-aliased ) , <p> Material I 'd : produces a color coded picture that indicates the I 'd of the material at each point in the final image ( this information is not anti-aliased ) . <p> Global alpha mask : produces a picture that is black where no object was found , white if an object was hit at this point . <p> Distance to camera plane : renders the distance from the camera to the main intersection point , but as if the intersection point is a plane perpendicular to the camera direction . <p> Screen space velocity : <p> World Point Position : represents the position ( in the world ) of the point seen under each pixel .

Thanks to this technology , connecting nodes and creating custom shaders is much more intuitive and fast . <h> Scene Graph <p> Vue let 's you manipulate the elements of your scene in the standard , straightforward way . With AdvancedGraph , you gain access to a new way of handling your scene that let 's you focus on the interactions between the elements of the scene . This is known as the scene graph approach . <p> Each object , each material in your scene has an associated graph that displays the item 's properties as graph outputs . This graph is easily accessed by clicking the graph icon in the World Browser .

@@74102187 @2802187/ <h> Vue 8.5 xStream - Materials <p> When run in stand-alone mode , Vue 8 xStream performs exactly like Vue 8 Infinite . The features described in this page are identical to Vue 8 Infinite . <p> The creation of natural 3D environments requires highly complex shaders that respond to altitude or slope , seamlessly cover any terrain , and exhibit enough detail whether seen from distance or from close-up . <p> Vue features a shader system that is fully optimized for the challenges of Digital Nature . By using three types of material editors , you can effectively create anything from simple bitmapped textures to elaborate multi-layered procedural terrain materials that dynamically respond to the environment . <h> The Basic Material Editor <p> The basic editor is designed to let you quickly create bitmapped textures and easily customize existing procedural materials . <p> Its no-hassle interface offers slots for color , bump and alpha maps , as well as highlight and reflection sliders . You can also choose one of the eight mapping modes . <h> The Advanced Material Editor <p> This full-featured editor gives you control over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to displacement mapping , from variable reflections to translucency . <h> Mixed and Layered Materials <p> Vues material editor offers extended control over the creation of complex materials through a material mixing and layering system : <p> Add , delete , and rename layers on the fly <p> Move layers up and down in the stack <p> Each layer has its own alpha channel <p> Each layer has its own independent reaction to altitude , slope and orientation <p> Create mixed materials with any number of sub-materials <p> Easily navigate even the most complex layered/mixed/nested materials <h> Bump , Displacement and Normal Mapping <p> The micro-polygon displacement engine is fully tailored for natural scenery creation allowing the render of millions of polygons with full level of detail optimization based on camera location and distance . <p> Displacement can be adjusted in any direction ( vertical , horizontal , normal ) and contains a smoothing slider to smooth out high frequency details if desired . Large amplitude displacement allows for extreme displacement effects without artifacts or torn meshes <p> The combination of these two aspects perfectly reproduces all the subtleties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials . <h> Rotoscoping <p> Vue can use any image sequence , AVI or Quicktime animations as a texture map . These animated texture maps can be used in any texture channel , as light gels or as SmartGraph function nodes . <h> The SmartGraph Function Editor <p> Almost all the parameters in the material editor can be controlled by a function ( or set of functions ) . The function editor is where the true power of material editing lies . <p> E-on developed the SmartGraph technology ( inspired by artificial intelligence systems ) , to help overcome the sheer number of possibilities presented by the function editor . Thanks to this technology , connecting nodes and creating custom shaders is much easier and more intuitive . <p> There are hundreds of available nodes to choose from , ranging from numerous types of noises and procedural functions to mathematical nodes , mixers , combiners and filters . <p> Almost any node can be connected to any other , allowing the creation of highly elaborate materials or special shaders such X-ray , velvet , or cartoon . Reaction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object below or angle of incidence . <h> Time Dependent Nodes <p> Using time-dependent noise functions , you can animate not only materials but also procedural terrains . For instance , Vue 8 comes with a dedicated Open Ocean procedural function , which makes it easy to create rolling ocean waves with adjustable wind parameters . <p> Time dependent node <h> Controlling Materials from the " Outside " <p> With the " Scene Graph " approach of Vue 8 , it is now possible to control internal material properties based on external parameters , such as the position of an object in the scene . This could be used to create a rim of foam around an object , or to color one object according to the orientation of another object ... <p> With the " Relative to sea " option you can create materials that appear at certain altitudes , either relative to the sea , or absolute in world coordinates . <p> The input node , " Sea level " , is also directly accessible from the Function Graphs . <p> The External Dependency nodes of the Function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units ( meters , feet , etc ) . This is also the case for other nodes that express real world dimensions , such as Distance to object below , distance from camera , etc . <p> Also , real world dimensions can be fed into the Position and Size outputs . <h> MetaNodes <p> MetaNodes let you group several nodes or links into a single node . <p> MetaNodes greatly simplify the readability of your graphs by letting you organize your graph into functional modules and then " publishing " the relevant internal parameters so that they are accessible in the Function Graph . <p> Vue ships with a library of preset MetaNodes to help you build your own graphs . You can complete this library by saving your own MetaNodes for future use .

They live in an isolated valley where every day they work the land together , but when Piccolo discovers a trick to make his favourite treat grow in plenty , he is overcome by something that threatens their very existence . " <p> The story started to be developed in 2003 by Adam Walker and the writer Briony Kidd .

" The design of Piccolo 's head and basic skeletal make-up was developed with the help of a plasticine maquette conjunction with a relatively primitive CG model . This enabled the team to better visualize how this fictional creature would move and what the limitations of his facial expressions and physiology were .

The storyboards took us about six weeks and the layouts took about another six weeks . " <h> Discovering Vue <p> The fact that there are millions of trees in the valley where Sam and Piccolo lived posed a huge problem with rendering to the Adam Walker Film team .

" We were very excited , but more than a little miffed about the amount of time wasted on a second rate alternative !

Of course , since the display quality options are defined independently for each view , you can have a view in Wireframe and another one Shaded . <p> The second set of options are relative to the view 's fog settings : <p> Show Fog in View : this option turns OpenGL fog on for the view . Fog is useful to give an additional information on the distance to objects . When this option is selected , the fog density options become available . <p> Density From Atmosphere : when this option is selected , the density of the OpenGL fog is automatically matched as closely as possible to that of the fog in the scene . <p> Adjust Fog Density : this option is only available when the Density From Atmosphere options is n't selected . It let 's you adjust the density of the fog manually . If you select this option , the mouse cursor will turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag the mouse up or down to increase/reduce fog density . <p> Refresh sky : this option refreshes the sky if you 've made any changes . <p> The next group contains one or 2 options depending on whether the current view is the main view or one of the orthogonal views : 25709 @qwx645709 <p> Show Only Objects From Active Layer : this option will hide all objects from the view that are not in the currently active layer . Although the objects do n't appear in the view , they are still in the scene and will be rendered ( unless they are disabled from rendering ) as any other object . This option is handy when your scene becomes complex because it enables you to only display in the views those objects that are part of the layer you 're working on at a given time . Using different preview options helps keep your scene sorted by hiding or displaying items differently . <p> Frame Guides : this option is only available in the Main camera view . If you select this option , the Frame Guides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guides . <p> Zoom Extents Selected : this option is for use with the Space Navigator . <p> After these options are the lighting opions : <p> Light From Scene : if this option is selected , the first 8 lights in the scene are used to light-up the 3D view . If it is n't selected , the 3D view gets its light from a source placed on top of the viewer 's left shoulder . <p> Shadows : this option is only available in the Main camera view . If this option is selected , objects placed above the ground cast a vertical shadow onto it . This is useful because it gives a better idea of the altitude of the objects above the ground . <p> The Display options menu of the main view offers a few additional options : <p> Show Last Render in Back : this is a truly fantastic option when it comes to finding/placing an object precisely . What it does is draw the objects in the view on top of the last rendered picture . So you get the OpenGL preview of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option can significantly slow down the 3D display on computers that are not equipped with an OpenGL optimized video board <p> Show Only Selected Objects : this option is only available when the above option is enabled . Because objects are usually displayed in OpenGL as smooth shaded , they will cover-up the picture that is in the background . In order to see the background , you 'd have to turn all objects to wireframe , or hide them manually . What this option does is hide all objects that are not selected from the Main View so you can see the render in the background without having to do the above . <p> Display 3D View : select this option to display the OpenGL 3D view . <p> Display Color Channel : select this option to display the color channel of the last rendered picture . <p> Display Alpha Channel : select this option to display the alpha information in the last rendered picture . <p> Display Depth Channel : select this option to display the depth information in the last rendered picture . <p> Display Multi-Pass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different Multi-Pass render components , masks , or the contents of the G-Buffer ( this option is only available if you have enabled rendering of Multi-pass , mask or G-Buffer information . <h> Quick Render <p> Click the Quick Render icon ( ) in the title bar of a view to do a quick render of the view . The rendering will always take place inside the view , and will always be performed using the internal renderer . If the view is an orthogonal view , an orthogonal camera will be used and all atmosphere effects will be disabled . <p> By default , the quick render is done using the Previewpreset render quality . However , if you long-click on the icon , a menu will appear letting you select the preset render quality to be used for the quick renders . <h> Saving Pictures <p> When you have finished rendering a picture you can save it to disk by clicking the small Save Displayed Picture icon ( ) in the view 's title bar , or use any of the other methods to save renders . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three different types of information for each pixel in the picture : the color of the pixel ( Color channel ) , whether an object is visible in that pixel ( Alpha channel ) , and the distance to the closest object at that pixel ( Depth channel , also known as Z-Buffer ) . <p> This information is known as channels . All three channels of information are available when the rendering of the picture is complete . This extra information is extremely useful when you want to do some post-processing on your pictures ( e.g. compositing , or applying Photoshop filters that are distance sensitive , such as blur ) . <p> To display each channel after rendering a picture , use the group of buttons that are at the right hand end of the Main view 's title bar ( ) , or select the corresponding menu option from the View Display Options menu : <p> Color channel : click this button to display the color information in the picture . Long-clicking changes the button to and opens the Render Display window . <p> Alpha channel : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . <p> Depth channel : click this button to display the depth information in the picture . <p> These buttons are not available until you have rendered a picture . To switch back to 3D view , click once on the title bar . 25709 @qwx645709 <h> Multi-Pass , Mask and G-Buffer <p> The Multi-Pass , Mask and G-Buffer icon ( ) expands into a menu that let 's you display the different render passes , object or material masks as well as G-Buffer channels . <p> These Multi-Pass , Mask and G-Buffer viewing options are only available if you have rendered a picture with the Multi-Pass or G-Buffer data collection options enabled . <p> If you select a G-Buffer channel , you can change the G-Buffer layer using the arrow icons . The number in between the arrows indicates the rank of the currently displayed layer . Because there is only one layer of information defined in Multi-Pass and Mask renders , these options are not available when displaying multi-pass render components of masks . <p> This icon is also used to display the Diagnosis Render Buffer information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this on the Render Options panel ( within the Render What section ) . Unlike the other buffers , this information is available for all renders , even Preview quality . <p> To the top and to the left of these views are two toolbars . Before taking a closer look at these , we would like to introduce you to two special types of icons available in Vue . 
@@74102210 @2802210/ <h> EcoSystem Generation III <h> Revolutionary EcoSystem Generation III <p> The EcoSystem revolution has redefined the way CG artists create landscape images . What seemed utterly impossible became easily feasible . Nightmarish tasks became a pleasant ride . With this third generation of EcoSystem , this ground-breaking technology has been improved again : the revolution marches on ! <p> Real world natural environments are extremely complex . Just think of the millions of plants , trees and rocks that make up the landscape around you . <p> Creating such highly detailed scenes in 3D is an exhausting task , both in terms of hard work and computer resources . Most 3D programs , in fact , are unable to deal with the huge polygon count required to create , say , a realistic forest scene with millions of trees . <p> With e-ons patented EcoSystem technology , you can easily populate your scenes with millions of plants , trees , stones and other objects , to achieve a totally new level of natural complexity and detail while keeping Vues performance and display running smoothly . <p> Select a SolidGrowth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variations of that plant , not just " hard copies " . These plants are automatically animated with breeze . <p> Of course , an EcoSystem can contain more than one plant type : add an unlimited number of plants , rocks and other objects to the population list , and control each items relative presence and size within the EcoSystem . <h> Automated Smart Scattering <p> The EcoSystem does not merely scatter the objects randomly across the surface , but actually decides where to place them according to the relief of the terrain . <p> So just like in nature , more trees will grow on flat areas than on steep slopes , and no objects will be placed where they are likely to " fall down " . You can control the influence of this effect easily . <p> In addition , Vue will automatically recognize foreign objects , and reduce the presence of EcoSystem items around them . <h> Dynamic EcoSystem Population <p> EcoSystem Dynamic Population technology let 's you create dense EcoSystems that extend way beyond the horizon , without concern over the number of instances ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of instances required to populate terrains in the far distance . <p> To maximize efficiency , it will also dynamically populate areas of your scene , only as they become visible to the camera . <h> Animated EcoSystem Populations <p> On top of creating EcoSystems with populations of animated elements , it is now possible to create populations that evolve over time . <p> This way , you can create such effects as a forest expanding to gradually cover a mountain , or the receding of vegetation at the border of a desert . <h> Paint Plants and Objects with EcoSystem Painting <p> The EcoSystem painter let 's you interactively paint Ecosystems over any surface ( or group of surfaces ) . It can be used for editing EcoSystem materials , or as a stand-alone tool . <p> The latter option allows you to paint EcoSystems on the fly on any object in the scene . <p> Painting can be performed with a mouse or with a tablet , which gives you the ability to control additional parameters through pressure . <h> Free Paint <p> You can paint over any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While you paint in any view , the instances are automatically dropped and aligned to the surface . <p> You can paint a mix of all the items in your population list , or paint any single item separately . Brush strokes can be undone at any time , or you can clear the whole EcoSystem for a fresh start . <h> 4 Painting Tools <p> Using the Ecosystem painter brush tools , instances can be applied individually or painted on in airbrush fashion . <p> The coloring and scaling brush interactively modifies the size and/or colors of an EcoSystem while the eraser tool allows instances to be removed . <h> Advanced EcoSystem Control <p> You can drag multiple objects or plants from a browser into the EcoSystem population list , making the preparation of complex EcoSystems a lot quicker . <p> You can easily populate your global EcoSystem by dragging objects from the World Browser directly into the EcoPainter list . <p> The intensity of the color changes applied to EcoSystem populations can be controlled through the use of a new material setting .

You can save them as a material and create a whole library of EcoSystems , which can be used later for other scenes and objects . <p> A single EcoSystem material can have any number of layers , each layer with its own population list and full set of controls . <p> The fact that the EcoSystem are treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vues powerful material and function editor to control almost every aspect . <p> For example , use a fractal noise generator to control the distribution of EcoSystem objects , or use a bitmap to limit distribution to specific areas . <p> Using the material layer environmental parmeters tab , EcoSystems can be influenced by altitude , slope and orientation . <h> Affinity and Repulsion <p> Layers in an EcoSystem material can also influence one another . By using the affinity and repulsion parameters , its possible to define a relationship between two layers . <p> For instance , using affinity , trees in the first layer can affect the distribution of grass in the second layer , so that the grass grows only around the trees . <p> Display quality can be linked to the camera . Instances in a user-defined radius around the camera will be displayed at full quality , while the rest will fall back to the specified display mode . The camera-controlled LOD automatically updates as the camera is moved around , making camera placement inside EcoSystems much easier . <h> EcoSystem Display Improvements <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more accurate coloring and reduce flickering when moving around the scene . <p> You can change the display quality of EcoSystem instances on individual population elements ( e.g. hide grass instances but show trees ) . <p> You can also decide which population elements will appear in full 3D near the camera ( Full Quality Near Camera option ) . <p> You can also instantly limit the display quality of all EcoSystem instances in your scene using a single menu command or keyboard shortcut , for swifter navigation inside complex projects . <p> You can refresh dynamic EcoSystem previews anytime by clicking the Preview button in the EcoSystem material . <h> Colored EcoSystem Billboards <p> Changes made to EcoSystem instance color , size and position are displayed in the Vue OpenGL viewports .

You can read the full interview here , which includes a brief introduction to Vue by Wayne Robson , trainer at www.fxphd.com . <p> With credits on such films as Thor , Captain America , TRON : Legacy , Terminator : Salvation and several others since its inception in 2007 , Whiskytree has developed an enviable reputation in the field of created environments . One of the tools making up Whiskytree 's arsenal in order to create natural landscapes and fantastical environments is Vue . <h> Whiskytree <p> To see how a user actually incorporates the software in production we spoke to three senior members of Whiskytree , an award-winning visual effects company , as part of our ' For Example ' series . <p> fxg : Could you give a brief account of the work Whiskytree was set up to do ? <p> Jonathan Harb ( CEO and Creative Director ) : Whiskytree creates visual effects for feature film projects . While our bread and butter is visual effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up on the web and in other digital mediums . We are also adept with art department and design skills , and our clients frequently rely on us for these skillsets . <p> Thor cyclorama <p> fxg : Could you explain the approximate set of tools you use ? <p> Votch Levi ( computer graphics supervisor ) : Our lighting and rendering pipeline is based on XSI and Arnold . Vue assets are rendered in XSI/mental ray using the Vue xStream plugin . All renders are then output as OpenEXR and sent off to Nuke for compositing . <p> fxg : Could you outline an example of a shot you used Vue ? <p> Susumu Yukuhiro ( matte painting supervisor ) : For the last few years Vue has been an important part of our concept work . Vue increases our ability to quickly create multiple environmental design concepts with a photo-real sense of atmosphere and lighting . Unfortunately , our current list of projects utilizing Vue are still confidential and have not been announced to the public , but we can say that Vue has given us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of time for each of our clients . <p> For the production of Thor we were able to conceptualize a cyclorama of Asgard using Vue ( click here to download a 3.5mb version of the cyclorama ) . This allowed the client to see the general look of the city , and atmosphere . The artist rendered the mountains and the ground in Vue , combined rendered buildings from XSI , and finalized the painting with the additional touch ups on top . Normally this kind of work , even in the concept phase , could take quite a long time to produce but utilizing these great tools enabled us to work a lot faster than before . <p> A render from Whiskytree 's work for Thor <p> fxg : It seems these days the concept of a ' matte painting ' is nearly fully been replaced by digital environment . Would you agree ? Or does the technique of a matte painting projected over geo mean that a ' traditional digital matte painting ' has as much relevance today as 10 or 15 years ago ? <p> Yukuhiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed dramatically these days . If it was a 2D matte painting , it used to be mostly image-based and done almost entirely in Photoshop . For the last few years we have even started doing 2D locked off camera shots in 3D so that we have a lot more flexibility than we normally would have if we did it with a traditional matte painting . <p> We still do some additional touch-up in Photoshop on top of the 3D render , but thanks to the technological advancements the necessity for touch-up work is even becoming less and less nowadays . Image-based projection is definitely one of the quickest ways to achieve the photo-real environment and yet due to the high demand of the changes from the client , which we often receive , we use this technique much less than we used to . <p> CG elements in Salvation <p> fxg : We think of Vue as great for Pirates 2 style green mountains/jungle , but you guys used it extensively on Terminator : Salvation , including the desert but also looking at a destroyed LA . Could you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-green jungle ' style shot use ? <p> Yukuhiro : In T4 , we did n't have enough resources and time to build hundreds of the destroyed buildings , but Cornucopia3D ( the site that sells hundreds of Vue assets ) had extensive building libraries that we could use as the starting point . We modified those buildings and applied the grimy texture detail that made them appear as a part of the destruction aftermath . <p> Vue also was helpful to us when creating the look of the burned ground . It always takes some time to find the right look , or inspirational image to begin with , but instead of going through hours of reference hunting , we had a control with lighting and output size from Vue . That element gave us 80% of what we needed and we did additional touch-up painting on top . <p> Final shot <p> fxg : How do you find yourself using Vue assets ? Do you use Vue xStream in conjunction with another app or solo for matte production ? <p> Yukuhiro : There are so many great assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our production . Since we do so much more full 3D shots that are tied with the Arnold renderer now , it unfortunately makes them very difficult to use . <p> fxg : Vue 's fractals provide a lot of power , do you find yourself using , for example , the rocky terrain fractal a lot or do you vary their use by project ? <p> Yukuhiro : We 'd love to explore that function but we have n't had a chance just yet . I see many beautiful images being done using that feature and I can see how powerful it is . <p> fxg : Do you find yourself using more procedural textures in Vue or standard textures for non-terrain assets ? <p> Yukuhiro : Both . Some artists use more standard but some artists use the procedural and came up with pretty nice result . <p> CG building elements for ' Salvation ' <p> fxg : Now the vegetation controls for ecosystems in Vue can populate an entire shot very quickly , for example with trees or plants . How do you ensure that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as real and not CGI ? Do you find yourselves using the plant editor a lot ? <p> Yukuhiro : When we do this kind of work , we make many varieties of assets , but when you are duplicating millions of them , you would still start seeing some duplicated patterns . We would normally render mattes for the tree leaves and color correct them in the comp to give a more subtle variety to the look . <p> Scene render <p> fxg : Atmosphere in Vue can add quite a bit to render times , how do you cut down on this and do you use external apps to help with the main atmosphere for Vue shots . <p> Yukuhiro : We love how Vue renders a beautiful atmosphere , though we use the Arnold renderer for any moving camera shots and use Vue atmosphere for a still frame . <p> fxg : When matching the terrain of a reallocation are you using for example DEM ( digital elevation maps ) to help with this or some other data ? <p> Yukuhiro : Yes , DEM is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Final shot <p> fxg : When you 're importing or exporting , what formats do you find the most reliable for your pipeline ? <p> Yukuhiro : OBJ is the format we use the most . <p> fxg : How are you handling the assets and shots at a composite level ? What passes do you render out for compositing , and normally at what resolution ? <p> Yukuhiro : The resolution depends on the shots . We normally render between 3-4k so that we have enough pixels to paint on top of . We always render with EXR format and we tend to render many separate passes for flexibility . <p> fxg : If you could have any new feature added to Vue from purely a production point of view what would it be ? <p> Yukuhiro : Arnold support ! ( I know it 's not that easy though ) <p> fxg : Did you initially find yourself having any problems integrating Vue into your pipeline ? Or was it a matter of rendering out bases upon which to paint over and build on ? <p> Yukuhiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could seamlessly render the Vue assets in our current pipeline but since we use the Arnold renderer now , we need to treat the Vue assets separate from the others . <h> About Whiskytree <h> FxGuide.com <p> fxguide is a community for people who are interested in visual effects and great imagery .

His model consists of a computer terrain generated from information on a local contour map , overlayed with an aerial photograph of the region he lives in , Derby-England . <h> Creating Archeological Landscapes with Vue d'Esprit ! <p> For the last couple of years I have been using Vue D'esprit to build models of the local landscape . These are overlayed with aerial photographs . I use these models in my search for unknown archaeological features . Vertical aerials are invaluable in landscape archaeology , but adding the third dimension , with the ability to view the images from any angle , greatly enhances my ability to spot features . <p> Some months ago I was asked to create a Vue image of the junction of several Roman roads in a park in Derby , overlaid on the modern landscape , for a local museum . This led to many hours in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail of the junction . One morning , on one of these rambles , my dad mentioned that it had been proposed that a road may lead directly north from this junction , but that no evidence for it had ever been found , and so it was just speculation . The area to the north of the park is now heavily built on , and before that the fields had all been enclosed in the mid eighteenth century , destroying the old field patterns . <p> That evening , I was back in the park , sitting on a bank which could have been the beginnings of this hypothetical road , just before it all vanished under housing . It was a nice evening , and I sat there for some time thinking about where such a road might go . I realised , quite suddenly , that in my bag was an image , a piece of data , that no-one had ever had access to before . It was a Vue image of the valley to the north of the park , overlaid with a field plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I took it out the bag and had a look just to see . I was astounded to see a line of field boundaries marching north from the park , right to the edge of the image . This line is marked by the three yellow and green dots on the attached picture . This was evidence , but only slight , so I headed home . I wanted to look at the existing fields to the north of my picture . Expecting nothing , I started up the computer and had a look . I nearly fell off my chair . There was the line , marching across the landscape to Duffield , some miles north of Derby . I have spent the last few months surveying this route and examining old documents . Many many pieces of evidence have turned up , a great deal of information has been gathered , and this is still ongoing . A report will be published in the near future , when a few other leads have been checked . However , it is virtually certain that the road exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself spent time walking the route and examining every bit of ground . Except for one field . Just one field .

In this last field , the very last field , it was there , clear as day , the Roman road actually survived in the ground . Standing in this field it can be seen clearly . It only remained to put a trench to finally confirm this road . <p> Here 's a picture of the actual road : It runs directly away from the camera , the cyclist is in the centre of the camber .

Large amplitude displacement allows for extreme displacement effects without artifacts or torn meshes <p> The combination of these two aspects perfectly reproduces all the subtleties and unique " soft " look of all types of semi-absorbent materials . <h> Natural Grain <p> VUE Infinite 2016 introduces a new color production mode called Natural Grain . <p> This new mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , or any natural elements of your scene . <p> Great results , no brain squash : Ideal for quick results , the Natural Grain option provides high level access to settings such as contrast , balance and roughness , directly from the Material Editor without having to delve into the intricacies of the Function Editor ( of course , you can always customize the look further using the Function Editor ) . <h> Rotoscoping <p> VUE can use any image sequence , AVI or Quicktime animations as a texture map . These animated texture maps can be used in any texture channel , as light gels or as SmartGraph function nodes . <h> The SmartGraph Function Editor <p> Almost all the parameters in the material editor can be controlled by a function ( or set of functions ) . The function editor is where the true power of material editing lies . <p> E-on developed the SmartGraph technology ( inspired by artificial intelligence systems ) , to help overcome the sheer number of possibilities presented by the function editor . Thanks to this technology , connecting nodes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are hundreds of available nodes to choose from , ranging from numerous types of noises and procedural functions to mathematical nodes , mixers , combiners and filters . <p> Almost any node can be connected to any other , allowing the creation of highly elaborate materials or special shaders such X-ray , velvet , or cartoon . Reaction to the environment is further enhanced with nodes such as distance to object below or angle of incidence . <p> Time Dependent Node <h> Time Dependent Nodes <p> Using time-dependent noise functions , you can animate not only materials but also procedural terrains . For instance , VUE comes with a dedicated Open Ocean procedural function , which makes it easy to create rolling ocean waves with adjustable wind parameters . <h> Controlling Materials from the " Outside " <p> With the " Scene Graph " approach , it is possible to control internal material properties based on external parameters , such as the position of an object in the scene . This could be used to create a rim of foam around an object , or to color one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the " Relative to sea " option you can create materials that appear at certain altitudes , either relative to the sea , or absolute in world coordinates . <p> The input node , " Sea level " , is also directly accessible from the Function Graphs . <p> The External Dependency nodes of the Function Graph can express object positions and dimensions in user-definable real-world units ( meters , feet , etc ) . This is also the case for other nodes that express real world dimensions , such as Distance to object below , distance from camera , etc . <p> Also , real world dimensions can be fed into the Position and Size outputs . <h> MetaNodes <p> MetaNodes let you group several nodes or links into a single node . <p> MetaNodes greatly simplify the readability of your graphs by letting you organize your graph into functional modules and then " publishing " the relevant internal parameters so that they are accessible in the Function Graph . <p> VUE ships with a library of preset MetaNodes to help you build your own graphs .

@@74102215 @2802215/ <h> About Ronen <p> E-on : Tell us a bit about yourself , your company , and your blog . <p> Ronen Bekerman : I started with 3D visualization as part of my architecture degree studies during 2002 . I also started to work soon after in an architecture firm , doing 3D Design Exploration using SketchUp and 3D Studio Max for modeling and Lightscape or V-Ray for rendering . I kept working part time during my studies , mostly on medium to large public projects and after 3 years I decided to go solo and opened my own architectural visualization studio - Polytown , providing 3D Design Exploration &amp; Photo-Real Visualization services for Architecture firms and Real-Estate Developers , as well as distributing related software that we use in the studio . <p> I 've always been fascinated with the web and ways of sharing and getting information online worldwide -- the ronenbekerman.com blog was born out of this inspiration . It started as a test but quickly turned into more than that and it is now a very popular website amongst architectural visualization artists worldwide . Ronenbekerman.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3d architectural visualization with dedicated forums and challenges to push the artists beyond their daily routine . It really hones their skills , allowing all the followers to view , respond and learn in the process . <p> E-on : Explain a bit about the type of projects you typically get involved with . <p> RB : Polytown is a small scale studio and so I try to focus on interesting projects -- the type I would enjoy working on and be part of the design process as much as possible . Project scale varies a lot and ranges from small private houses to high-rise residential or commercial buildings to urban planning projects . We do only still images , and recently got into animation via the use of Real Time tools . We are most interested in such tools for the Design Exploration of the 3d models with higher visual fidelity then the usual SketchUp look and feel . <p> E-on : What are your initial reactions about LumenRT ? Where do you think it will be useful in your workflow ? <p> RB : What I liked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with -- plug and play really . It did n't take much more then exporting the model as is and getting a very good and workable result - I did not expect that ! <p> LumenRT is a very useful presentation tool for designs done within SketchUp . It takes the model to the next level with added material properties that respond to light and reflects the environment too . The fact that one can easily navigate the scene in a game like fashion is super important for the client to really use it and benefit from it . With capable video adapters becoming more and more a standard these days , it is very accessible to all our clients . <p> E-on : Besides LumenRT , what other tools do you use in your workflow ? <p> RB : SketchUp is the main tool that we use . I call it the " Little engine that could " . It amazes me how easy it is to model things in SketchUp compared to other more expensive platforms . When asked if I can pull something off with SketchUp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I can ! " <p> While SketchUp is our main 3d modeler , 3D Studio Max is the main hub for the final visualization creation - That one ring the rules them all ! We get the model inside , render it with V-Ray along with many other plug-ins we use , depending on the task , like Forest Pro , MulltiScatter , RailClone , BRIX , GrowFX , Vue xStream , Ozone , etc ... <p> E-on : What is your feeling about the idea of using LumenRT Live Cubes to allow your customers to navigate and explore designs ? <p> RB : I like it very much that the model can be contained within a self executable file that can be sent to the client for review . I do n't like sending the actual SketchUp model file though sometimes it was necessary . LumenRT offers a solution that is better looking , simpler to navigate , and protects the work file . This is very good for us and our clients . <p> E-on : Do you think Immersive Collaboration ( sharing interactive designs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think so , yes . Any method of cutting the communication gap of the design will be embraced by all those involved in the process , especially if it is cutting turn over times too . <p> E-on : Any other ideas/thoughts on how you plan to use LumenRT in the future ? <p> RB : I believe that once we get our SketchUp models done in a way that takes full advantage of what LumenRT can offer , we will use it as the main way to share models for review alongside still images too as we do today . <p> E-on : What kinds of improvements/additions would you like to see in LumenRT ? <p> RB : The first thing would be dynamic lighting within the exported cubes . Currently it is fixed to the sun position in the SketchUp file at export time and I ca n't stress enough how important it is to allow for lighting changes on the fly ... not just the sun , but artificial lighting too . Walkthrough recording would be a gladly accepted feature as well . I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporate many new things in the following updates . <h> About LumenRT <p> With LumenRT , architects no longer have to choose between high-quality images and real-time visualization : they can walk or fly through their designs and experience the true quality of light in fully immersive 3D ! <p> Designed to provide high fidelity visualization with accurately simulated lighting including Global Illumination , shadows and reflections , LumenRT is the ideal solution for : <p> Creating exciting virtual interactive showrooms <p> Demonstrating and sharing design concepts with associates and customers <p> Creating attention-grabbing client presentations <p> Exposing projects in fully real-time photo-realistic 3D <p> LumenRT provides a number of revolutionary capabilities to breathe life into 3D designs including : <p> A More Engaging User Experience which allow clients and co-workers to interact with designs in a much more immersive and exciting manner . <p> No Need for Specialized Viewing Software since LumenRT LiveCubes are shared as self running files that play on PC and Mac platforms .

Check online documentation for more information . <h> Advanced Rendering Features and Controls <p> VUE 's rendering technology is fully instrumented , providing precise artistic control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexibility . <p> Depth of field is fully user controllable and provides smooth , progressive results . <h> Edge-Based Anti-Aliasing <p> An edge-based anti-aliasing algorithm was added to complement color-based anti-aliasing scheme . You can fine tune both anti-aliasing schemes using their respective Quality sliders , and you can also activate both of them independently . <h> Flicker-Free Plant Rendering Technology <p> One of the most challenging aspects of rendering natural scenery is the notorious flickering associated with distant vegetation . <p> VUE 's ability to create scenery containing millions of plants means that for every pixel of every frame , the render engine must handle a large number of overlapping polygons , requiring high anti-aliasing settings in order to get rid of animation flickering . <p> SolidGrowth 4 technology let 's you render even the most densely populated , animated scenes with a minimum amount of flickering using techniques such as texture filtering and proprietary anti-flickering algorithms . <h> Rendering Effects and Image Adjustments <p> VUE features a variety of rendering effects and image adjustments to tailor final output to your liking . <p> Natural film response adds a cinematic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automatically adjusts and balances under-lit and over-exposed areas based on the amount of light in the scene . <p> Image adjustments such as gamma , saturation , gain , and hue shifting allow you to fine-tune the final output without ever leaving VUE . <h> Tone Mapping <p> VUE Studio 2016 let 's you select different tone mapping filters to specify how raw HDR colors are transformed into the final picture . These filters typically simulate the response of the human eye or chemical photographic film : <p> The Photographic Exposure filter provides the typical response of photographic film , and gives you control over the response curve ( such as Shadows , Mid-tones or Highlights ) . <p> The Linear Exposure filter is the simplest of all : no contrast transformation is performed , the tone curve is flat , and the user can control the steepness of the response . <p> The two Reinhard Exposure filters provide control over contrast enhancement , as well as Brightness , Chromatic and Light adaptation . <p> The False Colors filter can be used to visualize the HDR range of intensities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legacy response curve , with or without natural film response . <h> Flexible Rendering Options <p> 360 Degrees Render <p> The render control panel offers precise control over every single render parameter , giving you the flexibility you need to complete rendering on schedule without sacrificing quality . <p> Rendering can be performed in any viewport ( including orthogonal views ) . Viewport rendering can be set to its own quality level , different from the main render settings . This let 's you instantly switch between draft and production render qualities . <h> Fast Stand-Alone Renderer <p> The VUE stand-alone renderer saves you a considerable amount of time by rendering images in the background while you continue working on the scene . This is a perfect solution for any single-computer work situation . Since the stand-alone renderer does n't need to carry the overhead of a visual interface , it is able to dedicate more memory to the rendering . <h> Batch Rendering Interface <p> Render jobs can be easily batched from within VUE using the Batch Rendering interface . <h> Interactive Network Rendering <p> When using this mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , while VUE is rendering , the Interactive Network Rendering controller silently contacts all the render nodes on your network and puts them to work on your scene .

@@74102218 @2802218/ <h> Render Animation <p> The most basic type of animation to render in TPF is wind effects . Wind effects are set in several places to ensure that the correct parts of the plant are acted upon . Also , if you are using animated materials , you need to render animation to show off the effects . <p> Animation Render Options <h> Animation Render Options <p> This dialog let 's you control the rendering of your animation . <p> The Preset render quality group let 's you select a Preset Render Setting . Please note that Motion Blur is only rendered with Broadcast or higher render settings . If you select User settings , you can fully customize the render engine by pressing the Edit button . See page Render Options for more information . <p> Use the Frame resolution group to indicate the Animation Render Options dialog resolution of the frames in the animation ( Horizontal + Vertical ) . The horizontal and vertical resolutions are linked by the aspect ratio of the scene . You can modify this using the Render Options . <p> The Animation limits group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to render . You can either enter the limits using Frame numbers , or using Time . The time or frame counterpart is automatically updated . The values in these fields are initialized with the values of the start and end of the active animation part , as defined by the yellow line in the Timeline duration bar . <p> Frame increment : this setting let 's you skip frames in an animation to reduce render time without affecting the frame rate . By default , the Frame increment is one , which means that all the frames in the animation are rendered . Entering 2 will render every other second frame ; entering 5 will skip 4 frames after each frame rendered ( rendered frames will thus be : 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 ) . <h> Channel Files <p> TPF can generate and save the three channels ( Color , Alpha and Depth ) of an animation . Using channels , you can easily composite TPF animations with other animations using an external compositing application . You can also generate full G-Buffer information for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel files group of controls let you select the destination files for the channel animations . By default , only the Color channel is saved ( Alpha , Depth , G-Buffer and Multi-Pass channel files are disabled ) . <h> Animation File Formats <p> Use the Browse buttons to select you want to save the channel animations to , or to change the selected file format . PlantFactory supports the following animation file formats : <p> AVI : Audio Video Interleaved file format , compressed or uncompressed . Press the File format options button to display a standard Codec selection dialog . Using this dialog , you can control how the AVI animation file is compressed . <p> RLA , RPF : set of stand alone Run-Length Encoded ( RLA ) or Rich Picture Format ( RPF ) files that contain all the channels of information stored in the G-Buffer ( you need to enable G-Buffer rendering to use this option ) . <p> Press the File format options button to display the standard Picture Format Options dialog . The frames of the animation are named after the filename you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ( e.g. if you save to file Anim.bmp , frames will be named Anim000000.bmp , Anim000001.bmp , Anim000002.bmp , etc . ) . <p> Frame padding : click this button to bring up the Frame Name Options dialog . Using this dialog , you can change the zero-padding of the frame file names . <p> G-Buffer / Multi-pass options : click this button to configure the creation and gathering of G-Buffer and Multi-pass rendering information while rendering the animation . This option is only available when the Optimize last render pass option in the Render Options dialog is deselected . If you click this button , the Multi-Pass Options ( G-Buffer ) dialog will appear , letting you select which rendering components and masks to render . <p> Note : selecting this option does n't mean the G-Buffer or Multi-Pass information will be saved in the animation file . You need to select the RLA or RPF file formats ( for G-Buffer information ) , or multi-layer PSD file format ( for Multi-Pass information ) for this to happen . <h> Frame Rate <p> This group controls the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation . The higher this number , the more smoothly the animation will play back . But the longer it will take to render ( and the larger the resulting file ) . <p> Bear in mind that the human eye is unable to isolate more than 24 frames per second . So there is no real point in rendering more than 24 frames per second ( unless you are rendering for TV video , where there are synchronization concerns requiring and increased frame rate ) . <p> The default is 15 frames per second , and produces reasonable smoothness at a reasonable expense . <h> Frame Resolution <p> This provides a list of typical animation frame resolutions as well as the ability to define custom frame sizes . If the Other frame resolution option is selected , entering a resolution in one of the fields will automatically recompute the corresponding resolution for the other field ( according to picture aspect ratio , provided that this aspect ratio has n't been set to Free ( user defined ) ) .

" <p> Rabih Haddad , CEO , BlackSmith Studios <p> Rabih Haddad , CEO of BlackSmith Studios , shares with us how they introduced Vue to their pipeline . <p> BlackSmith Studios created one of the largest architectural visualization projects in Beirut , Lebanon for Emaar , one of the largest real estate developers in the Middle East and the world . <h> About Rabih Haddad <p> Rabih grew up in Toronto , Canada , and moved several times between Canada , the US and Lebanon growing up . But , since he lived more or less across the street from Alias in Toronto , it was kind of natural for him to learn 3D . After a short tenure at MIT and the University of Michigan , he went to AUB , in Beirut , Lebanon . He graduated with a degree in Computer Science , and audited practically every course in the business department . Before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company BlackSmith Studios is now a leading architectural visualization firm and his new VFX division is quickly becoming quite popular ! <p> E-on : How did you get into 3D ? <p> Rabih Haddad : I started working in 3D when I was about 15 years old , and quickly realized although I was okay at it , I did not have the patience or dedication required to be an artist , so I taught ! I gave masterclasses to several studios in Toronto , London , Beirut etc , but eventually decided it would be wisest to turn my energy to opening my own studio . <p> Was this the first time you got to use Vue on a project ? How long did you work on it ? <p> RH : We started out of necessity . It was a huge project that we could n't render on time and efficiently with Maya , and needed a third party program to step in . After some research we chose Vue xStream . It took us a total of 3 months to complete the project from planning , storyboarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is your Vue using level ? <p> RH : I am good , but the artists at my company are the real masters . Most of the work comes from Cindy Hussami ( artistically ) and Majd Akar ( technically ) . <h> Technical Aspects <p> Did you use Vue in combination with any other 3D application ? <p> RH : We use a suite of tools to generate our final film . In this project we used Maya for most of the work . We then used AfterEffects for motion graphics and Shake for compositing . Editing was done with Final Cut Pro and final output was through Compressor . Audio was done in FCP , although we usually use Pro-Tools . <p> Could you explain the different steps of your project creation ? <p> RH : We started with a storyboard with script . We then moved on to a full fledged animatic showing the individual shots . From there we modeled and animated the scenes and then texturing and lighting ( which includes the landscaping , where Vue comes in ) . Finally , we render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any additional post . <p> The scenes were split into Maya based ( with Vue trees ) and pure Vue shots ( the simulated helicopter shots ) and the live-action composited shots ( which also include Vue ) . <p> What was the importance of nature in your show and what do you believe it adds to the piece ? <p> RH : Nature played an essential part in the BeitMisk film . First of all , since the project is based in the Metn area of Beirut , Lebanon , the beautiful Mediterranean weather is one of the key selling points of the project . Vue allowed us to showcase the sprawling green environment in its full glory . BeitMisk is so heavily landscaped , that the building actually are surrounded by trees and greenery of various species and sizes . <p> We even developed a " season-change " shot for the client . This shot cycled through all four seasons demonstrating how pleasant the environment is year-round . Using Vue we were able to have a 100% continuous shot with four separate environments without any harsh cuts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your project ? <p> RH : BeitMisk film 's landmark shot is without a doubt the season change shot , where we go through all four seasons seamlessly . This was quite difficult as we had to go through four different lighting set-ups , skies while the plants all moved continuously throughout . The challenge was solved by setting up four identical scenes , making sure they had the same animation seed and blending the shots in post . <p> Another major issue we had was moving from Vue 6 to Vue 8 , mid-project . The change was n't as straightforward as you might imagine , as there was clear quality differences between the two renders . So we had to re-setup everything and re-render all the shots . In the end it was more than worth it , as we increased quality dramatically , and seriously reduced flicker . The most difficult part was the timelapse landscape morph , to find seamless transitions from one landscape to another . We created various layouts first , and discussed them with the director until we found the solution we felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are your favorite Vue features or options ? <p> RH : Many features , but my personal favorites are ' drop to terrain ' , the ' terrain sculpting tool ' , ' EcoSystem painting ' and the ability to render huge data-sets relatively quickly ! Vue really helped me to deliver an architectural film which for the first time has virtual environments equal to nature , on a huge scale . <p> Will you be using Vue in other projects ? <p> RH : Most of our projects are new real-estate launches and new products , which are all highly confidential . What I can say is this : <p> Having two sides to our business , architectural visualization and VFX for TV &amp; Film , simulating and manipulating nature plays a major role in both sectors . That 's why Vue will definitely play a huge role in delivering realistic landscapes that our clients demand . You can no longer get away with duplicated trees that do not move . Vue is the only solution available that is able to take our vision of how we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our artists the power to realize that vision . <p> So wether its a new golf course or a funky new TV commercial , BlackSmith Studios will be using Vue to solve our next nature-based challenges . <h> About BlackSmith Studios <p> BlackSmith Studios has been around for the past decade , servicing several sectors of the 3D industry . These sectors included architectural visualization , music video clip postproduction , broadcast 3D ( Commercials ) and film VFX . The main regions of operation generally are Canada , US , Europe and the Middle East . In late 2006 , BlackSmith Studios moved its headquarters to Manama , Bahrain in order to capitalize on the industrial and economic boom in the region .

I also create the 3d blockouts at the beginning of a job as well as doing a lot of the special effects works like explosions . <p> Peter Kolus : I work at RealtimeUK as a Digital Artist . My main tasks are modeling and texturing but I also work on lighting and rendering on some projects . I started my career in 2005 at a small company in Poland where I come from . In 2007 I moved to UK where I now live and work . <p> How long have you been working on the StormBirds Cinematic ? And what were the general guidelines you had to follow ? <p> IJ : Stormbirds was a 3 month production for 8 artists . Our reference for cinematics tends to be game design documents , pre-viz &amp; some game assets depending on how far along development is . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art which was pretty inspiring and outlined ideas for missions &amp; plane designs . It was our remit to digest all this information and create a cinematic version of the game with the emphasis being on cool camera work , exciting animation and awesome FX . <p> When did you see Vue for the first time ? Is this the first project you 've worked with Vue on ? <p> IJ : Were always on the look out for new tools to add into our workflow . Much of our current production pipeline was developed while working on a number of intro movies for Sonys " Buzz " series . On both " Jungle Party " and " Buzz Hollywood " we used Vue on a small scale to create scenes and backgrounds . We were very happy with the results and could already see that is was a powerful tool . <p> Can you let us know what was the selection process for Vue for this project ? <p> IJ : Working on Stormbirds , we quickly realized that we would n't be able to achieve the complex jungle scene within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 3dsMax using Vray proxy objects , but this time we wanted to push things further both in terms of efficiency &amp; creativity . <p> IJ : From our experience with the Buzz projects , we were confident that Vue could deliver . <p> PK : I knew Vue from some smaller personal projects and I was eager to work with it on this scale . <h> Technical Aspects <p> What 's Vues place in the production pipeline ? Could you explain us the few steps that leads from the concept art to the final shot ? <p> Concept art for the jungle scene <p> IJ : We used a rough 3d blockout to pin down the overall layout of the scene along with planes motion and camera moves . It was also important to establish the look and feel of the shots with our concept artist because it was very difficult to visualize such a complex and atmospheric shot with just the primitive geometry in out blockout . <p> IJ : One of our initial concerns was that the scene created in Vue would look different to the other scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created some of the scene assets within max . The jungle floor , cliff faces and the entire military campsite were modeled and texture within Max and then exported to Vue . We had a rather complex camera animation rig which allows us to recreate the look and feel of a physical camera . We baked the entire rig down to just the cameras coordinates and brought that to Vue . <p> PK : We used the VueSync plugin for 3dsMax to export all camera animations . We populated the majority of the scene with an ecosystem and then manually placed some trees to fine tune the areas around the camp . <p> Most of the scenery for the other shots was done in Max , so what did Vue bring to your team for these specific shots ? <p> IJ : Vues Ecosystem allowed us to control and tweak an entire scene with relative ease . It was also able to render anything we threw at it . Vue gave us the ability to create realistic and natural detail which we could n't have generated in any other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of Vue . <p> How did you match the lighting between the rest of the cinematic shots and the scenes created in Vue ? <p> IJ : This was never really going to be a problem . Luckily Stormbirds was made up of four very different environments . This meant that the lighting and overall look of the single Vue scene would never be directly comparable with other scenes created in Max . However , as many of the 3dsMax scenes used matte paintings to extend the 3d environments , we chose to do the same with Vue scene . <p> How did you create the atmosphere effects for the non-Vue shots ? <p> IJ : Many of the 3dsMax environments made good use of matte paintings for skies and smoke . Any 3d volumes of clouds or smoke were created with a particle system and rendered with Sitni Satis Afterburn within Max . <p> Do you remember the quality settings you 've used in Vue ? How large did you render the animation ? <p> PK : There is so many options to set-up when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I spent a lot of time reading forums like CGsociety or e-on forum to help find the best settings . The key is to find a compromise between speed and quality , set-up good AA and do n't get crazy when it comes to rendering the layers , you really do n't need masks for all the leaves in the scene . The final render size was 1280x720 . <p> How did you render everything , did you render the whole Vue animation and then composited with max animations afterwards ? <p> IJ : The environments , including the imported floors and cliff faces , were rendered along with the trees in Vue using the render cow distribution rendering . We had a masked area around the military camp to allow us to composite in a Max render . We did n't  create motion blur within Vue as we could n't generate velocity passes when rendering with the render cows . However , we were able to generate pixel velocity data from the original Max scene ( without trees ) and used it to apply motion blur to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant the entire scene had the same type of motion blur . This helped integrate the plane , explosions and campsite into the Vue render for the final composite . <p> I read that you have used some camera mapping techniques for the A10-like shot , can you tell us a bit more about this ? <p> IJ : The shots where the A10 strafes the village were blocked out with buildings , vehicles and props in Max , they were then moved over to Vue to have the trees added . Still renders from Max and Vue were composited together in Photoshop and worked up into a layered digital matte . These mattes were then camera projected back onto the original Max scene and rendered from the scenes camera . <p> How did you add the explosion effects ? I know that you 've used AfterBurn to create them , but how did you match these with the Vue environments ? <p> IJ : The Afterburn explosions had to be illuminated and rendered completely independent of the Vue trees and environment . The lighting was matched up by eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and used in place of the Vue environment to receive shadows and mask out any trees which appear in front of the effect . <h> About Vue <p> Are there any features you would n't be without ? ( What 's your favorite part of Vue ? ) <p> PK : Vue is the easiest way to create environments like rainforests . <p> The best part of Vue is obviously the Ecosystem , because its easy to control , it allows you totally freedom with the creation process . <p> I 'm also impressed with options like layered ecosystem materials , wind generation and the shear amount of layers you can render . <p> Will you be switching sooner or later to Vue 7 , and if yes , what do you expect from it ? <p> PK : I 'd really love to use Vue again , as it is nice piece of software . Especially now with it 's full integration with 3ds max . Personally I would like to see it work with Vray as well .

Palmwood is a new Interior Design firm based in Singapore catering to residential interior design and renovation . Check out JRs personal portfolio here . <h> About Jose Reynaldo <p> E-on : Tell us a bit about yourself and your company . <p> JR : I studied architecture at the University of San Carlos , Cebu City Philippines . I was already oriented in 3d modeling ( specifically in 3DS max ) since it was taught at the University . When I was working at an architectural firm , I got interested in Sketchup right after I was asked to research for a software that would run in a minimum pc-spec at that time . Since then I tried several add-ons , plug-ins and third party softwares that would enhance the power of the Sketchup including Vray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main toolset until I was hired by Palmwood . <p> Palmwood is a promising new Interior Design firm in Singapore catering mostly to residential interior design and renovation . My boss at Palmwood , Vincent Chiam shared a common interest with me as he also favors Sketchup and its plug-ins as our main toolset . He introduced me to Vue which later led us to the discovery of LumenRT . <p> E-on : Explain the type of projects you typically get involved with . <p> JR : Typically we focus on residential interior design and renovations . Residential projects are quite challenging since home-owners ( the clients ) are constantly changing the design direction . They often find interesting ideas in magazines and the internet and then they want to make design changes right away and to see the results of these changes . Hence , we searched for faster , high-fidelity 3d-rendering software that would allow us to generate imagery with a much faster turnaround time . This key requirement led us to LumenRT . <h> Using LumenRT <p> E-on : How did you learn about LumenRT ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road show in Singapore . At first , I was skeptical thinking that the output of LumenRT would take a lot of time to generate . I was really impressed at its visual presentation but not quite sure about the rendering time until I actually got my hands on it . I was fascinated at its ease of use and the high-quality end-result . After my initial tests , I have high hopes for LumenRT even at this early stage of its development . It already provides a better solution than most software we examined . <p> E-on : Besides LumenRT , what other tools do you use in your workflow ? <p> JR : Sketchup is the main tool we use . I like its combined speed and power and the wide array of useful plugins and supporting applications such as Vray , Podium , and of course LumenRT . I use Vray to producing photo-realistic output while my boss uses Podium . LumenRT is used to deliver walkthroughs and easy to produce , yet very presentable animations . <p> E-on : What are your initial reactions about LumenRT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your workflow ? <p> JR : The most amazing feature of LumenRT is the ability to generate 3D LiveCubes and then distribute them to clients without having to install anything on their computers . With LumenRT , it is much easier for clients to understand your design . <p> It is wonderful to automatically give reflections to glass materials and add animations to water materials . <p> I really like the fact that LumenRT is very simple and easy to use for producing a high quality output . I was able to generate presentable output hours after the software was delivered to the companys door without any training . <p> E-on : What is your feeling about the idea of using LumenRT LiveCubes to allow your clients to navigate and explore designs ? <p> JR : Its a very key factor for us since it provides a positive impression to our clients . Giving our clients the 3D LiveCube thrills them since they can navigate through their dream house instantly without the week or more time in waiting for traditional canned animations and renders . <h> The Future <p> E-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with clients ) will become a sizeable opportunity ? <p> JR : Yes , I like the idea very much . It helps to bridge the communication gap between designers and clients . <p> E-on : Any other ideas/thoughts on how you plan to use LumenRT in the future ? <p> JR : We have high expectations for LumenRT . We will continue to exploit its LiveCube sharing and animation capabilities for client presentations . <p> E-on : What kinds of improvements/additions would you like to see in LumenRT ? <p> JR : I 'm looking forward to having artificial lighting and the ability to adjust the solar orientation interactively . I would like to see emissive materials , mirror or chrome materials , and translucent or cloth materials . It would be handy if there was a wider range of backgrounds to choose from such as cityscapes and seascapes . Finally , I think 3D is the future with the coming of 3D TVs and 3D computers . It would be an added advantage if LumenRT could produce stereoscopic 3D LiveCubes . <h> About LumenRT <p> With LumenRT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real-time visualization : they can walk or fly through their designs and experience the true quality of light in fully immersive 3D ! <p> Designed to provide high fidelity visualization with accurately simulated lighting including Global Illumination , shadows and reflections , LumenRT is the ideal solution for : <p> Creating exciting virtual interactive showrooms <p> Demonstrating and sharing design concepts with associates and customers <p> Creating attention-grabbing client presentations <p> Exposing projects in fully real-time photo-realistic 3D <p> LumenRT provides a number of revolutionary capabilities to breathe life into 3D designs including : <p> A More Engaging User Experience which allow clients and co-workers to interact with designs in a much more immersive and exciting manner . <p> No Need for Specialized Viewing Software since LumenRT LiveCubes are shared as self running files that play on PC and Mac platforms .

Insert a Texture Map . Connect it to the Composer 2 node and to the Altitude offset output , then load your heightmap previously saved ( in step 1 ) . Close the Function Graph by clicking OK . <p> Back in the Atmosphere Editor , set the Altitude and Height of your cloud layer to match your terrain . You need to adjust the Height parameter functions of your heightmap : i.e. if your heightmap contains pure black ( 0 0 0 ) and pure white ( 255 255 255 ) , you will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud layer . If for instance your heightmap does not go up to pure white but is limited to mid grey ( 128 128 128 ) , your cloud layer will be modulated within half of the cloud layer height , and you will have to adapt the height parameter of the cloud layer or modify your heightmap consequently . <p> Play with the Altitude variations parameters to adjust the thickness of your modulated cloud layer . Setting Altitude variations to 100% will result in an infinitely thin cloud layer . Setting it to 75% will result in a modulated cloud layer thickness of 25% of the cloud layer total height . <p> Now , when you 're finished , you will have a great cloud layer that follows your terrain geometry . <p> For even better looking results , you can follow the same steps above to drive the 3 other modulation parameters : Altitude offset effect on Z , Height modulation and Density modulation , or use any type of other functions ( instead of the metanode ) to add more variation effects to your cloud layer .

Please understand that such a terrain involves over 2 million polygons . Few 3D packages would even survive this . Making even larger terrains is possible but is usually unnecessary . <p> Resample Terrain dialog <p> Resample Terrain : is used to resample the terrain directly to any resolution . The Resample Terrain dialog pops-up , letting you select the new terrain resolution .

@@74102270 @2802270/ <h> Interface &amp; Workflow <p> The Vue design is based on the same paradigm that characterizes all of e-ons products : a clean , uncluttered user interface , designed from the user 's standpoint . All the power and control is there , hidden in deeper layers , easily reachable whenever you need it . <p> This combination of power and ease of use provides faster workflow , increased productivity , and a smoother transition from other applications . <h> Advanced OpenGL Engine <p> Vue 's OpenGL preview engine maximizes efficiency on high-end GPUs as well as multi-core systems . It is built around a robust multi-threaded architecture which takes advantage of higher-end graphics cards to produce high visual quality and performance . <p> The OpenGL preview engine can operate in one of 3 modes : <p> Software : previews are generated by the CPU , maximizing compatibility with old video boards , <h> Display Options <p> These options can be set individually for each object , and for each display window .

This way , you immediately get a better idea of what the final render will look like . <h> Sample Scripts <p> Vue includes dozens of sample scripts that add new functionality and illustrate some of the potential of python scripts . All are copiously documented and can serve as a starting base for your custom scripts . <h> Playback Repetitive Tasks with Macro Automation <p> Macros easily automate repetitive tasks by recording the actual user interaction dialog and saving it as an xml file . <p> Press the Record Macro button to start recording a set of operations , and save it to disk as a macro .

Here are some of his tips and tricks ! <h> Behind The Hazyness Of Nature ! <p> " I usually think of a specific ' place ' when I start conceiving a new image .

When I get a good idea of how the scene will look like , I start adding detail . I usually make my own models , and import them into Vue . Finishing an image can take me several days , sometimes a week or more , because I create several drafts before I make up my mind . I am fascinated by light . In my work in the theatre I love watching lighting sessions . I spend a major part of making an image on getting the light right . I also like using fog and haze to create mystery and mood .

" <p> Eran shares with us some of his secrets ! <p> " My goal was to create a strong contrast between a brightly lit foreground and a dark background . For this I used three " suns " , each lighting a specific element in the picture : Rice field , jungle and background mountains .

" <p> " Rice field sun " <p> " The rice field sun is positioned in the opposite direction ( front ) . This , of course , is against nature laws , but that was the only way the field looked good " <p> Using alpha planes for the clouds and haze : <p> " Creating The Mood " <p> " The fog is made with the same groups of alpha planes I have used in previous images . There would be many other possibilities to do so in Vue 4 Professional , like using volumetric atmosphere clouds , but this was the way I wanted to do it . They are not lit by any of the suns .

He also used high amounts of haze and fog to get more depth . <p> " Ascending Clouds " <p> This image started as an experiment in using groups of alpha planes to create a volumetric fog effect . He has since used the same technique in " Dolpo Village " and " Bali " ! <p> " Dolpo Village " <p> As a globe Trotter , Eran has very strong memories of his treks worldwide , in particular the Nepal Himalayas .

They can be purchased separately . Depending on which version of VUE you are using , some of these modules may or may not be part of your product . As a result , some features described in this manual may require the purchase of an additional module . We have tried to identify such requirements alongside the feature description , but this may not always be the case . VUE Complete includes all optional modules natively . <p> Once you have downloaded a module from your Cornucopia3D account , double-click on the installer to start the module installation program . The installation process for modules is the same as the process of an update for VUE .

Doing this in another 3D package is much more involved . " <p> Alex Jenyon <p> Please meet Alex Jenyon , a Vue artist currently working in the visual effects industry in London . <p> Alex studied Design for Performance at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London . His background is in theater design . <p> Since he began his career , Alex 's work includes freelance matte painting , concept design , storyboarding , pre-visualisation , and texture work on commercials , TV and feature film . Projects included ' Human Body : Pushing the Limits ' ( Emmy nominated for outstanding VFX ) , ' Stardust ' , ' Telstar ' , ' Rock'n'Rolla ' and ' Lesbian Vampire Killers ' . <h> About Alex <p> E-on : Tell us a little about yourself ? <p> Alex Jenyon : I am a matte painter and concept artist currently working in the visual effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VFX artist , though - my background is in theatre design , and I 've worked on computer games , architectural visualisations , commercials , music videos and for a stop-motion animation studio . <p> I started freelancing as a digital artist and set designer in 2004 , and expanded my skills to include matte painting at ' The Mill ' in London in 2006 . Over the next couple of years I started getting work on bigger and bigger projects , and am now working full time on high profile feature films such as ' Leap Year ' , ' Clash of the Titans ' , ' Prince of Persia ' , ' Narnia ' and ' John Carter of Mars ' . <p> What lead you to using Vue ? What spurred your interest in Vue and when did you become involved in it ? <p> AJ : In 2008 I was working as a matte painter as Rushes Postproduction when they won the position of sole VFX vendor on the film ' Lesbian Vampire Killers ' . One of the shots that was required was described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest at night ' , and I was given the job of producing it . <p> It was immediately obvious that a normal matte painting approach ( using photos and painted elements ) was n't going to work , and neither was a traditional 3D approach ( there was just too much geometry ) . I therefore researched the options available to me , and found Vue . I downloaded the PLE on Friday night , spent the weekend learning it , and turned up to work on Monday morning to produce the shot . This is the very first piece of work I ever produced using Vue . <p> Original <p> Vue render and final matte painting <p> As an artist , how does CG art fit into your work ? What is its role ? <p> AJ : I use CG to help me visualise my paintings , and to produce rendered elements for me to use in larger paintings . I never finish a shot in CG , but use it to get me about half the way , and finish the rest by hand . Tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are quicker to produce in CG than they are to paint - so I use CG for what it is best at , and do the rest in photoshop or painter . <p> What has been the most important skill for you as an artist ? <p> AJ : My versatility . My work can require me , on very short notice , to suddenly become an expert at something . I might need to visualise what a particular medical condition would look like at a microscopic level , I might need to learn a new piece of software in only a few days , or I might suddenly need to know everything I can about a certain kind of cloud ( all of these have happened ! ) . The ability to constantly learn and adapt to new projects is therefore my most important skill , closely followed by good old fashioned painting , which can solve most problems if you are good enough . <p> Tell us a bit about your pipeline ! <p> AJ : A VFX studio will usually base their pipeline around Autodesk 's Maya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's no secret that it 's not very user friendly as a 3D modeling package . <p> I personally prefer the speed and simplicity of Google 's ' SketchUp ' 3D modeller , and I 've used it for all kinds of projects it was never really designed for ! SketchUp does n't produce very nice geometry , but Vue seems to deal with it very well indeed . I therefore wanted a way to get a Vue scene to match what I could see in SketchUp , and use Vue as my rendering solution for SketchUp . <p> SketchUp Model <p> Simple Global Radiosity render from Vue <p> After a lot of research , it turned out the only way this was going to happen was if I sat down and wrote one ! I 'm really not a very good coder , but I slowly worked my way through a script , with lots of help from the nice guys at the sketchucation.com forums . <p> This script now forms an important part of my workflow - my modeling will be done in SketchUp , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and render the model in a convincing manner . <p> The two images overlaid <h> About Vue <p> How does Vue , in general , contribute to your artwork ? <p> AJ : I have tended to use Vue as a rendering solution for all kinds of models , even more than it 's landscape and EcoSystem capabilities . With only a few clicks , Vue can give me a global radiosity render with a believable atmosphere and real-world materials . Doing this in another 3D package in much more involved . <p> I will also use Vue to produce specific elements for a painting that would be tricky source from anywhere else ( or shoot myself ) . A tree seen from above , and lit from a particular direction , for example . The image might be available on the internet somewhere , but even if I could find one ( after hours of searching ) , it could well be under copyright , and I would n't be able to use it anyway . With Vue , I can quickly source the exact element I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the right way , with no problems of image attribution or licensing . <p> The list of projects you 've worked on is pretty impressive , could you name some of the projects you 've used Vue on ? <p> AJ : I 've already talked about ' Lesbian Vampire Killers ' , which was the first project I used Vue for . I then used it on a number of commercials and promotions , including the UEFA Champions League and Co-op foods . This is the opening shot for a series of commercials aired in 2009 for the Co-op , produced for ' nice biscuits ' , a boutique post-production facility in Soho . The brief was to extend the crossroads shot out to about double it 's original size , and to create the shape of a ' union jack ' , but in a believable , realistic manner . <p> SketchUp Model <p> Vue render , with the original plate overlaid <p> Final Matte Painting <p> I also used Vue to help me produce matte paintings for the reboot of ' The Day of the Triffids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was provided with renders of set elements , but felt that I needed a few extra elements to push the realism and feel of the shot . The fence , control gates , cars and surveillance cameras were all modeled in Google SketchUp , and rendered in Vue , all within the space of a few hours . <p> Original <p> Final Matte Painting <p> What was the most powerful part of using Vue in your workflow ? <p> AJ : The speed - Vue deals with my messy geometry without any tweaking , and produces great looking renders without having to do any tedious setup . <p> What do you consider to be the most fundamental difference between Vue and traditional 3d programs ? <p> AJ : It 's focus on real-world situations - i.e. built-in atmospheric perspective for distant objects , rock textures with real-world scales , realistic cloud types . A traditional 3D model does n't assume you are going to be doing anything in particular . It gives you a blank scene , and let 's you work out the rest . Vue assumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ( most of the time ) it is ! <p> What is your favorite new feature or features of Vue ? <p> AJ : I love using EcoSystems with custom models , rather than plants . Feed a couple of city blocks , a few skyscrapers and an apartment or two into an EcoSystem , and voila ! Instant city background ! Here is one of my early tests - blank scene to this render in 30 minutes , ( including modeling and 10 min render time ) - that really sold me on the power of EcoSystems . <p> Vue render before painting <p> Final MattePainting <p> How do you train yourself to Vue ( and do you need training ? ) And what would you like to learn next ? <p> AJ : I do n't have much trouble learning new packages , so I 'm probably not the right person to ask . I had the manual , and most of Vue 's menus are reasonably intuitive . As soon as I found out that you could right click in the texture editor to ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do need to learn more about tweaking atmospheres , though . I 've worked out how to tweak almost everything else ( custom cloud shapes , custom plants , etc. ) , but I do n't have an intuitive grasp of how to tweak haze , fog and decay without a lot of trial and error . <p> Would you recommend Vue to other artists , and why ? <p> AJ : For environment artist and matte painters , I certainly would , for all of the reasons I have talked about in this interview . It can really push your work to another level , if used in the right way , and at the right times .

@@74102281 @2802281/ <h> Erosion nodes <p> These nodes simulate hydrological and thermal erosions of a landscape . Several pre-configured erosion presets are supplied as distinct nodes , and a fully customizable Erosion node is also available when it is necessary to precisely adjust all parameters . All nodes expose the same outputs and some of the parameters , but only the customizable node exposes the full parameter set . <p> The Erosion nodes in the Function Graph 's contextual menu . <h> Available ouputs <p> Several outputs are available , some more useful like the actual terrain altitude , while others are more suited to control material distributions or even to apply a 2D perturbation to some other nodes in the function graph . <p> Altitude : ground altitude after the simulation . <p> Flow Surface : when using this output , the terrain is " filled " to show the depth of the flow running over it . The flow surface is not horizontal because the flow simulation never really reaches an equilibrium . <p> Flow Speed : this output shows the flow speed over the terrain at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flow Speed , but a 2D vector is output which direction and strength represent the actual flow over the terrain at the end of the simulation . <p> Flow Depth : this output shows the flow depth ( or humidity factor ) over the terrain at the end of the simulation . <p> Transported Sediment : this output shows the amount of sediment currently transported by the flow at the end of the simulation . <p> Displaced Soil : this output shows the total amount of displaced soil at the end of the simulation . <h> Presets <p> The Erosion algorithm uses an extensive set of parameters in order to achieve a wide range of possible results . As a consequence , configuring the node has a somewhat steep learning curve . Presets help apprehending the roles and interactions of the parameters by supplying sets of parameters that work well together and produce distinctive results . You can either use the pre-configured Erosion nodes corresponding to each preset , or use a fully customizable Erosion node and apply the preset on it . <p> Note that when applying a preset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the node are changed to match the preset parameters , overriding any changes you may have made since the last preset applied ! You can then tweak the parameters as you like as long as you do not apply another preset . <p> Note : <p> " Vertical Scale " , " Quality Boost " and " Evaporation Amount " are not modified by a change of preset . <p> Note : <p> A message will warn you when the node parameters are about to be overwritten by a change of preset . <p> Here are examples of the presets , applied on the following generic mountain flank with basic fractal detail : <p> Non-eroded terrain <p> Mountains : This preset leaves peaks and distinctly rougher areas on the terrain . <p> Mountain erosion <p> Old Mountains : Simulates how mountains are eroded after the passing of geological times . <p> Old mountains <p> Scattered Rock : This preset yields isolated rocks in the middle of smooth hill slopes made of sand/soil . <p> Scattered rocks <p> Generic : This generic preset applies to a wide range of terrains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this preset digs rivers into a terrain made of soil and rocks . <p> River-like Erosion <p> Gorges : Much more contrasted , this preset digs deeply into a terrain made of harder rocks . <p> Gorges-like Erosion <p> Very Eroded : This preset applies a heavy erosion on the terrain , erasing most of the rougher parts . <p> Very eroded terrain <p> Flow Channels : This preset applies moderate erosion and can also be used to determine where water would flow over the terrain . <p> Erosion channels <p> Furrows : A variant of " Flow Channels " where the erosion is allowed to apply more thoroughly , so that the terrain is more eroded along the water channels . <p> Furrows <h> Global Parameters <p> Vertical Scale ( meters ) : this parameter is expressed in physical units . The erosion processes simulate actual laws of physics , which rely among other physical quantities on the altitude variations over the heightfield . Obviously , the resulting terrain height can not be automatically determined and used , since it itself depends on the result of this node . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be configured . <p> It is also a way to tweak the effect of the simulation without changing the height of the resulting terrain in the scene . <p> The horizontal dimensions are also an important physical quantity on which the simulation depends . They are automatically determined by using the actual terrain dimensions in the scene , so take care to first scale your terrain before tweaking the erosion parameters . <p> Timescale : this is a measure of the duration of the simulation . Raising or lowering this parameter will greatly change the aspect of the resulting terrain , but will also impact the duration of the computations proportionately . <p> Smallest Feature ( meters ) : this parameter is also expressed in physical units in order to be comparable with the Vertical Scale parameter . It is used to prevent the simulation process from caring about small details on the input heightfield . This parameter is important when you want to use the Erosion node on very high-resolution heightfields but you do n't need to erode pixel-level details . With a low Smallest Feature parameter , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heightfield , which can lead to very long computing times . <p> Favor Larger Features : this parameter has no particular unit . It influences the simulation algorithm in order to apply the erosion processes more at larger scales when the parameter value is higher . At or below a value of 1. , on the other hand , smaller scale details are privileged . <p> Quality Boost : as with all physical simulations , artifacts can appear because of the performance-realism trade-off taken in the algorithm . This parameter is a way to boost the quality of the simulation , by using values higher than 0. , or on the contrary to speed-up the computation by using values lower than 0. , when the simulation quality is not a limiting factor . <h> Terrain Properties <p> The hydrological part of the algorithm simulates dissolution , transport and deposition of soil along the water flow over the terrain . These parameters control the physical properties of the terrain . <p> Rock Hardness : harder rocks are less eroded then softer ones . <p> Sediment Deposition : this parameter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it is being transported over the terrain , ie. it is a way to tweak the actual physical process at work . <p> Erosion Strength : this is another non-realistic parameter to influence the speed of erosion . This can lead to unwanted artifacts though , so keep in mind that another way to erode your terrain more is to raise the Timescale parameter , at the expense of longer computing times . <h> Flow Parameters <p> The hydrological simulation is a compromise between physical realism and computation times . Simulating actual rain and the whole water cycle over the terrain is of course impossible , so the parameters below tweak the simulation using intuitive concepts : <p> Flow Level : this is a measure of the minimum amount of water present over the terrain . <p> Channeling Threshold : this parameter controls at which water level the terrain will begin to be affected by thermal and bank weathering ( see Weathering Parameters below ) , digging river beds into the terrain . Though it can be seen as a weathering parameter more than a flow parameter , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the Flow Level . See how the various presets set up those two values to create different effects on the terrain . <p> Flow Depth Limit : as a consequence of the performance-quality compromise , the simulation sometimes digs unrealistically deep into the terrain , as if an infinite height of soil was available to transport . This parameter can limit the digging depth and should be set up in relation with the Vertical Scale of your terrain . <p> Dampen Flow , Clamp Flow : these non-realistic parameters are used to slow down the simulated flows in order to produce various effects on the terrain . Dampen Flow slows down the flows continually over the whole simulation , while Clamp Flow is an upper limit to the flow speed . See how the various presets set up those two values to create different effects on the terrain . <p> Erosion Emphasis : this non-realistic parameter can be used to emphasize the effect of the hydrological erosion process without resorting to a longer Timescale . <p> Emphasis Threshold : this parameter is used to adjust the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emphasized features are more spiky while at higher values the features are more rounded . <h> Weathering Parameters <p> Thermal Weathering : some amount of thermal weathering can be added to the simulation . Thermal weathering is a physical process due to the alternating periods of colder and warmer weather . It erodes the steeper slopes by detaching little bits of rocks which roll down and accumulate to form conical talus . The actual amount of thermal weathering effective on your terrain will greatly depend on the steepness of its slopes and hence , on the ratio of its Vertical Scale to its horizontal dimensions . <p> Bank Erosion : when streams and rivers form over a terrain , its bank tends to erode quite fast because of the forces exerted by the running flows . This is a prominent effect in our simulation in order to create actual valleys on the terrain , whereas hydrological erosion alone would tend to create gorges instead . <p> Bank Transition : this parameter blurs the boundary between the drier areas of the terrains and those affected by Bank Erosion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the roughness of the input terrain even over eroded areas . Less eroded areas will still preserve more roughness than more eroded ones . <h> Flow Surface Output <p> Evaporation Amount : when using the Flow Surface output , this parameter can be used to adjust water depth considered by the algorithm to compute the output . <h> Slope node <p> This node computes the mean slope of the heightfield . The parameter " Account for larger features " hints at the prominent scale at which the heightfield slope is computed . Close to 0 , the slope is computed by mostly considering small-scale detail , ie. using the full resolution of the heightfield . Closer to 1 , the smaller-scale perturbation is smoothed out to leave only the overall slope of the heightfield . <h> Convexity node <p> This node computes the convexity of the terrain . <p> The parameter " Account for larger features " hints at the prominent scale at which the heightfield convexity is computed : close to 0 , the convexity is computed by mostly considering small-scale detail , ie. using the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller-scale perturbation is smoothed out to leave only the overall convexity of the heightfield . <h> Blur node <p> This node smooths out the heightfield depending on a radius . <h> Terraces node <p> Levelled terraces <p> Irregular terraces <p> Rounded terraces <p> Square-ish terraces <p> This node uses an advanced algorithm to create customizable terraces on a heightfield terrain . <p> In addition to the usual altitude input , the node can take a special " Locate Terraces " input into which can be fed a noise which prominent features will influence the shape of the terraces . For example , a round noise will yield round terraces , a Voronoi noise will tend to yield Voronoi-cell shaped terraces , etc. which opens a lot of possibilities for customization . <p> The other parameters controlling the terraces are : <p> Strength : overall strength of the terracing effect . <p> Smooth contours : how much to try and smooth the terraces contours . <p> Note : using a high smoothing value will noticeably raise the node 's computing times . <p> Slope Width : terraces are linked to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitude changes . This parameter is the width a these slopes : the narrower the slopes are , the steeper they get . <p> Max . Size : limits the dimensions of the terraces , to avoid having terraces spanning the whole terrain ( depending on the " Locate Terraces " input ) . <p> Max . Height : limits the altitude difference between two adjacent terraces . <p> This node has a secondary output named Slope which will typically allow you to apply different effects on the terraces ' flatter areas than on the slopes between distinct terraces . <h> Auto-mapping node <p> This node will linearly map the input range of the heightfield being fed into it into the desired output range . This is a real helper since thanks to it you no longer need to worry about the output range of a set of nodes ( even noises and fractals , which are notably hard to predict ) . Whatever it is , you just have to insert an auto-mapping node to " normalize " the range to suit your needs . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a weighing factor , you will set your auto-mapper to output in the 0 ; 1 range . Or if you need to output to a custom dependency for later reuse in a material graph , you will auto-map to -1 ; 1 in order to exploit the full range of values and no longer need to adjust the material graph filters each time you make changes in the terrain graph . <p> Compare to a similar situation in a procedural graph , where such a node is not available : you would have to evaluate yourself the range of values at a given node in the graph and manually tweak various filters to adjust the range to suit your needs , which usually takes some trial and error . <p> Apart from the output range parameters , the node takes an additional parameter named " Input Range Rounding " : this prevents the mapping from changing by a slight factor when the input range varies slightly . For example , if you set " 0.1 " in this parameter , the mapping factor will be the same whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0.0 ; 1.0 . <p> This can be useful to maintain some stability in the output of a graph , for example to compare the overall effect of slightly different parameters in some other nodes . On the other hand , using a non-zero value here means the output range may not be exactly matched .

This is generally the case , and keeping this option selected is recommended . However , if you are sure that your mesh will support tracing with one sided polygons , unchecking it can slightly improve render speed . If it is not the case , you will notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is selected , the surface of the polygon mesh object is smoothed by averaging the normal vectors of all polygon faces , giving a less rough , polygonal ' aspect to the object . Sharp angles will be rubbed from the surface . You can adjust the maximum angle between polygons where smoothing should take place by using the Max smoothing angle box . For instance , a value less than 90 ( e.g. 80 ) would preserve right angles inside a cube , while still smoothing other , less angular features . <h> Mesh Information <p> This group displays information about the currently selected mesh(es) , such as the total number of vertices , of polygons , as well as the number of materials used throughout the object(s) . <p> This group also provides a set of buttons to modify the architecture of the selected object(s) : 25709 @qwx645709 <p> Decimate : press this button to display the Mesh Decimation Options dialog .

You have three options for turbo smoothing : Catmull-Clark ( for quads ) , Loop ( for triangles ) and Dynamic ( for stretched polygons only ) . This option can also be used for animated mesh in order to improve the rendering quality . <p> Iterations : Since Catmull-Clark and the Loop algorithm subdivide all of the polygons , this setting is used to limit the level of subdivisions applied . <p> If you select Dynamic , a Quality Boost slider displays for you to set the smoothing quality . 25709 @qwx645709 <p> Low poly in OpenGL and in the preview : check this option to display the non-subdivided mesh in OpenGL display and in the preview renders which will speed up these rendering operations . 25709 @qwx645709 <h> Illumination Baking <p> Illumination baking is only available when you have activated one of the lighting models that takes indirect lighting into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation of indirect lighting over the entire surface of the object , and the creation of a separate texture channel to hold that illumination information . Only indirect lighting is taken into account in the baking process . Direct lighting ( light received directly from light sources , or shadows cast by other objects ) is computed separately at render time . For full details on illumination baking , please turn here . <p> The controls in this frame let you customize the illumination baking process for that particular object . <p> Allow automatic baking for animations : when this option is selected ( the default ) , this object will be candidate for automatic illumination baking when rendering an animation . Uncheck this option to prevent the object 's illumination from being baked when rendering an animation ( e.g. for objects that move a lot ) . <p> Animated mesh imports : If you imported a mesh with an accompanying MDD animation file , this will show up here . You have the option of not refreshing meshes while moving the timeline . <p> Force double sided baking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analyze the geometry of the object in order to determine if the illumination needs to be computed only on one side , or on both sides of an object . For instance , if the object is a single polygon , VUE will bake the illumination on the two sides of this polygon , as the polygon may be seen from one side or the other . Selecting the ' Force double sided baking ' option forces VUE to bake the illumination on the two sides of the object , even if it determines that illumination is only really needed on one side . This is typically useful when you need to travel inside ' a closed mesh . <p> The ' Current baking information ' group displays information about the current baking status of the object : the overall quality ' and ' map accuracy ' used at the time of last baking , as well as the total size occupied in memory by the illumination map . <p> Note : <p> Saving an object with illumination baking will save the illumination information together with the object . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of the indirect lighting during baking . This setting is relative to the current Advanced Effects Qualityrender setting and the quality boost setting of the Atmosphere Editor 's lighting model controls . <p> Map accuracy : use this setting to vary the size of the illumination map . Larger values will mean more detailed illumination , but at the expense of longer baking times and higher memory requirements . You should adjust the accuracy of the map according to the largest size on screen of the object during the entire animation . <p> Hint : <p> If you are baking the illumination on a mesh that has a complex geometry , the maximum setting for map accuracy may not be enough to achieve perfect results . In such cases , you should not hesitate to go beyond the maximum value by entering values larger than 100% . <p> Estimated size in memory : this displays an estimate of the amount of memory that will be occupied by the illumination map after baking is completed .

The baking of the illumination requires takes place in two steps : first the construction of the illumination map , and then the actual processing of the indirect lighting . The total time required to bake the object depends on the object 's complexity as well as the desired quality . This process can last several hours ( but it 's an investment for the rendering of the animation ) . A progress bar will appear in the status bar to let you know the progress of the baking process . When an object has an illumination baking map , it appears yellow in the World Browser . <p> Save scene after baking : select this option if you want VUE to automatically save the current scene after completing a bake operation . Because quality baking of objects can take a lot of time , this option is useful to ensure that you do n't lose the result of the baking . <p> Note : <p> Although baking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ( several times the actual rendering time of a single frame in the animation ) , subsequent rendering of the animation frames can be accelerated in such a considerable manner that this investment ' in baking time will be recouped significantly . In some tests we ran ( involving a flythrough of the Sponza atrium model ) , baking of the Sponza mesh took one day ( at a very high quality setting ) , but subsequent rendering of the animation only took 2 additional days whereas the rendering of the unbaked ' animation would have required over one month ! <h> Published Parameters <p> The Published Parameters feature copies specific settings from the Object Graph that you may need to change often and places them in a more convenient location for easier manipulation . With objects , these parameters display with the Polygon Mesh Options dialog . <p> Parameters available for publishing show as underlined when the cursor is moved over the field name . Click the underlined field name to select . A parameter name is supplied and a group name is asked to improve the display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Objects <p> From left to right : 29120 , 13570 , and 1895 polygons frogs ! <p> Polygon mesh decimation , also known as polygon reduction , is a very powerful feature that will attempt to reduce the number of polygons in an object while maintaining as much as possible the original object geometry . The resulting geometry will be lighter than the original , and will render more rapidly . This feature is useful for example when you want to render a large object that is seen from a long distance " in such a case , you may not need to maintain all the details in the object geometry , and a decimated version may suffice . Another situation where mesh decimation is useful is when you want to do some quick test renders of very large objects ( e.g. buildings ) . You can do the test with a decimated version , and then restore the full geometry for the final rendering . <p> Mesh decimation is controlled using the Mesh Decimation Options dialog . There are two ways of accessing this dialog : <p> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polygon Mesh Options dialog ( see above ) , or <p> At the time of importing the object , select the Decimate on import option in the Import Options dialog . The Mesh Decimation Options dialog will appear once the import is complete . <p> There is a single parameter in the Mesh Decimation Options dialog . This parameter , called Level of decimation is used to control the number of polygons in the resulting , decimated version of the object . If you choose no decimation , the object will be unaffected . The stronger the level of decimation , the less polygons in the resulting object , but also the stronger the distortion of the geometry . This parameter is somewhat similar in its behavior to say , the quality setting of JPEG compression . <p> Note : <p> Mesh decimation is a complex process that can take a long time to complete . A progress bar displays the progress of the decimation process in the Status Bar . <p> An estimate of the number of polygons and vertices in the mesh version of the object is displayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have decimated a polygon mesh , you can not regenerate the polygons that have been removed . The only way to restore the full object geometry is to re-import the object without decimation . See here for details about re-importing polygon meshes. 25709 @qwx645709 <h> Baking Objects to Polygons <p> This is also a powerful feature that will convert any object in a VUE scene into a polygon mesh approximation . The word approximation ' is important here , as some objects used in VUE simply do n't have a polygonal equivalent ( for instance , this is the case with spheres , plants ... ) . <p> There are various reasons why you might want to convert an object into a polygon mesh . For instance , if you have a very complex Boolean object , converting it into polygons may speed up rendering considerably . <p> Note : <p> materials are not directly affected by the conversion . However , the slight modifications in the object 's geometry may cause some differences in the rendering of the material . <p> If the object uses displacement mapping , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Note : <p> Lights and cameras can not be converted to polygons . <p> Baking to polygons is controlled via the Mesh Baking Options dialog . This dialog can be accessed by selecting the menu command Object Bake To Polygons . <p> Note : <p> Once you have converted ( baked ) an object to polygons , you can not revert later to the initial , unbaked ' version of the object . <p> The Mesh Baking Options dialog has a unique parameter called Bake quality . This parameter controls the accuracy of the conversion process . The higher the quality , the more precisely the polygon version of the object will match the initial object . But also the higher the number of polygons used in the object , and thus the longer it will take to render and the higher the memory requirements to handle this object . The default value for this quality setting corresponds to the Background draw thread 's preview quality setting ( see here for details on adjusting this preview quality ) . Please note that baking to polygons is a complex process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress bar displays the progress of the baking process in the Status Bar . <p> An estimate of the number of polygons and vertices in the mesh version of the object is displayed below the Bake quality slider . <p> Note : <p> You can optimize the conversion of objects to polygon meshes by baking at a higher quality setting , and then applying some amount of decimation to the resulting mesh .

Translucent materials react to light in a very different way than regular ' materials . <p> With a regular material , incident light is either diffused , reflected , or refracted .

I probably spend more time editing my materials and lights than any other aspect of using Vue . " <p> A graduate of DePauw University , Pat Garrahy also known as Ojo Caliente has had a varied career that started off working for Marvel and DC Comics . He has taught at the college level , worked as an art director for an Off-Broadway production and been involved in the advertising field . <h> See the light <p> " I first started using Vue d'Esprit 4 . I was really impressed with the quality of atmospherics in the renders and the plant editor . I also felt as though the materials editor was really easy to understand and yet so amazingly deep and complex . Of course the introduction of EcoSystems and EcoSystem Materials in Vue 5 Infinite blew me away . Each Vue upgrades introduce a lot of significant additions . Vue 6 Infinite offers so many new features , and although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am currently obsessed with the object-based area lights . " <h> Scene 's Construction <p> " I started with several interior models created by Stonemason . There are only about twelve conventional lights in this scene , whereas , there are hundreds of multi-shape area lights . <p> I wanted to create color with light . Since cool colors have a tendency to recede and warm colors advance in composition , I wanted to reverse this conventional approach to color space . Blue , green , yellow , orange , and red were used front to back to define an opposing recession of color , reversing the conventional approach . <p> The actual physical space is fairly short , so I adjusted the focal length of the camera to try and balance any advancement of the warm hues used in the background . I also tried to reinforce the figure ground by using darker values in the foreground , and regressing tones and tints of color into the background . " <p> " After I finished setting up the interior , I printed a few copies and sketched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharpie . I then started to add figures one at a time . I would start a figure in Poser . <p> I would then bring the Poser figures into a new or blank Vue file , saving the figure as a . vob . Later I just saved the Vue file and merged it with my main file version . I was very pleasantly surprised to find Vue gave me the option to auto update my Poser imports , very cool little option . " <p> " I think there are thirty-eight figures in total . I used the color scheme to indicate action . Figures in the cool foreground are more relaxed . As the figures regress into the warmer color space , they become more active . Eye contact of each of the figures played a strong role in the overall composition . I wanted to create a theme of suspicion . " <p> " I use my second monitor to track my progress . Whenever I see something I want to change , I write down a note and stick it on the second monitor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I remove the corresponding Post It . I know a piece is moving towards conclusion when the Post It notes disappear from the monitor . " <h> Compositing <p> " To render , I split the file into five separate documents . I did decimate objects according to position in the figure ground . I created a certain amount of overlap in each of the files , and was very dependent on the merge feature to make additional elements , figures , and lights consistent in each of the five files . Ultimately I was also VERY dependent on the creation of rendered alpha maps for each of my five files . <p> I rendered many of these alpha maps separately from my final renders by using the " render only selected objects " render setting with my lighting turned off by deselecting the " always render lights " function . These alpha maps were then easily copied and pasted into alpha channels and masks for each of the five final renders thereby making the final image a breeze to fit together . " <h> Tips from making this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I open the final renders in Photoshop I paste the depth map in as an alpha channel . I like to use this depth selection to adjust color , for example . Since color tends to desaturate according to distance and atmospheric perspective in nature , I can adjust the saturation of a render according to the distance of my depth map . " <p> " I have also found the depth map selection is invaluable when used with small increments of Gaussian Blur . Although Vue does render depth effects , I do like to control the amount of distance blur in post with this technique . I 've also used depth maps as blending layers . By pasting a depth map into the layers palette in Photoshop you can apply rather unique color adjustments to a final render using blending modes and opacity settings . Overlay , screen , and multiply are the blending modes I probably have used most often when applying a depth map as one of these layers .

I always look back at old projects and see the things I could and should have executed better . I 'm definitely my own worst critic . "

The spline curve is user-defined : it can be a spline selected from the scene 's object list , or it can be created directly from the node 's interface , using a custom Spline Editor in the Function Graph . The Spline Editor let 's you create a spline curve in world coordinates , by displaying the top view while placing the control points . <h> How to use it <p> You can either select an existing spline object from the scene 's objects list , or create a new spline curve from scratch using the VUE spline editor . <p> To create or edit the spline curve , click on the Edit button in the parameters area . The Edit function becomes available for the Internal Spline . The Spline Editor in the Function Graph will open . <p> Spline Editor <p> Inside the spline editor , you should see the current scene 's top view . To create the spline you want , you have four edition modes at your disposal : <p> Add way point : When in this mode , left clicking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way point : This mode let 's you move around control points that are already placed , by dragging them with the mouse on left click . <p> Insert way point : When this mode is selected , you can insert control points directly on the curve . This means that the curve will have the same shape as before , but with one more control point . <p> Delete way point : This mode let 's you remove control points by left clicking on them . <p> You can also choose whether the spline should be closed or not , by checking the checkbox " Closed spline " . This adds or removes the link between the first and last control points , to make the spline cyclic or acyclic . <p> If you are not using the Internal Spline option , you can either use Copy to Internal to duplicate and edit the scene spline in the Function Graph , or use VUE 's usual spline edition tools to edit the spline in the scene . Note that the terrain is not automatically updated when the spline is changed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The node has two parameters : <p> Invert Output : when unchecked , the spline curve will be a " ridge " in the output heightfield , ie. the points on the spline are actually the highest values of the output . When Invert is checked , the spline curve will instead the lowest values in the heightfield , like the bottom of a valley . <p> Invert Slope Inside Spline : when the spline is closed ( " cyclic " ) , it is possible to identify its interior , which can be useful for some terrain or material effects . Depending on your purpose , you may want to distinguish the values inside the spline from the values outside , by using a different output range . This also alters the shape of the output , hence the parameter name . For example , with a circular spline , you can check this parameter in order to have a volcano-shaped output ( the spline would be the crater 's rim ) . <p> Example : Using a spline as a valley <h> Node outputs <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simply the distance between each point at the base of the terrain and the closest position lying on the 2D or 3D spline . <p> When using a 3D spline , the output will also follow the spline 's altitude profile , which you can alter by leaving the terrain editor and moving the spline 's control points inside the scene , using the gizmos available in VUE 's four 3D views . Then go back to the terrain editor and recompute the terrain as the node output will not update automatically . <p> 2D Distance : similar to the Distance output , but only accounts for the horizontal distance ( ie. the spline is projected on the terrain plane ) . <p> When using a 2D distance , the spline itself will remain on a level line in the node 's output and , when Invert Output is checked , this level line will be the zero level . <p> Altitude Profile : altitude of the closest spline position . Discontinuities may need to be blurred with a Blur node in order to make use of this output @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heightfield which can be used as a mask to locate " foreign " objects lying over the terrain the heightfield represents . This is a powerful tool to create effects on the terrain easily , without having to design complex graphs . Examples of usage include : <p> Digging the terrain to represent how it subsides slightly under the weight of objects . <p> Proxy objects ( not visible at render time ) can be used to drive terrain effects , where several nodes would have been necessary using a traditional approach . <p> Erosion or other effects can also be made to work around scene objects thanks to this node .

You can use both PCs and Macs mixed together . <p> Each computer in your render farm will render a different frame of the animation , or part of the still . So if you have , say , three computers ( of equivalent power ) on your render farm , renders will be performed up to three times faster ! <h> Setting Up the Farm <p> You do n't  have to be a tech geek to set up and use HyperVUE .

Then , while VUE is rendering , the Interactive Network Rendering controller silently contacts all the render nodes on your network and puts them to work on your scene . This happens in the background while your main computer continues rendering . As the other computers on your network start pitching in , the rendering accelerates , but you never have to suffer any waiting or slowdown ! <p> Interactive Network Rendering <h> Advanced Caching Technology <p> Interactive Network Rendering is powered by an advanced caching technology that minimizes traffic on your network .

@@74102312 @2802312/ <h> RenderNodes <p> The RenderNode is a command line version of VUE devoid of any graphical user interface . RenderNodes are ideal for production houses that have a render farm management utility and wish to integrate VUE rendering into this render farm . <p> RenderNodes are controlled via the command line and by placing appropriate files at the appropriate location and at the appropriate time . Your render farm management utility will have to be configured to interact with the RenderNodes ( e.g. so that it launches the RenderNodes with the required command line parameters so as to perform the desired operation ) . <p> When launched , a RenderNode parses its command line to find out the operation that needs to be performed , performs the said operation and then quits automatically once the operation is completed . <p> Some examples of configuration for typical render farm management software are supplied to help you setup your own system . You will have to adapt these examples to the specificities of your setup . <h> RenderNode Licenses <p> RenderNode licenses are sold separately . There are two types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VUE to render using the RenderNode Network option , VUE will : <p> Save the current scene to a user-specified folder or to its temporary folder , then <p> Execute a custom command . <p> The RenderNode Network Options dialog let 's you specify the temporary folder and the command line that is executed when you launch a network rendering session using a render farm with RenderNodes . This dialog is accessed by pressing the Edit button alongside the RenderNode option in the Render Options dialog . <h> Temporary Folder <p> Depending on your network manager , it 's sometimes possible to attach a file to a job . If this is possible , VUE will save the current scene to a temporary file , and send the file to the network manager which will store it into its own temporary folder before sending it to the nodes . If this case , you can leave this field blank ( it 's fine for VUE to delete its own temporary file after submitting the job , so VUE can use its own temporary folder ) . <p> However , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , VUE will just tell the network manager where it can find the scene file . Because the network manager sends the path of the file to the nodes , and not the file itself , the file must exist during the entire rendering session . Also , the path to that file needs to be a valid network path accessible from all the computers taking part in the render . <p> Because the file must exist during the entire rendering session , VUE should not delete the temporary file , so it needs to be stored outside VUE 's standard temporary folder ( which is flushed at regular intervals ) . In this case , click on the Browse button and select an alternate temporary folder . <h> Command to Execute <p> This setting indicates the command that is executed each time you start a RenderNode network render . <p> As an example to illustrate what this setting does , if you entered C : /Windows/NotePad.exe in the command field , VUE would launch the NotePad each time you press the render button ( of course , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VUE to launch your network manager application , all you need to do is enter the path to the application file in the command field . Launching the network manager without any arguments will surely do nothing useful , so , basically the command should contain at least : <p> the network manager executable path and file , and <p> the scene file path . <p> It can also contain some additional information required by the network manager , like the description of the job , how to handle it , etc . <h> Arguments in the Command <p> Following is a list of arguments that can be added to the network manager command line . When running the command , VUE will dynamically replace them with the appropriate value : <p> SCENENAME : the scene name ( name of the job ) . <p> NUMFRAMES : the number of frames in the animation ( may be required by your network manager in order to distribute rendering across several nodes ) . <p> FILEPATH : path to the temporary scene file . If you specified an alternate temporary folder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to store temporary scene files . If not , the default VUE temporary folder will be used . You should specify a folder that 's accessible from all the render nodes ( e.g. a network path ) , in case your network manager does n't send the files to the nodes itself . <p> If you are using a render farm of Windows computers and the scene files need to be accessed by their paths , you can either : <p> select a folder on a network drive ( the letter of the network drive must be the same on all the render nodes ) , or <p> use the UNCFILEPATH argument so that any folder path will be automatically converted to UNC ( in which case either the folder , one of its parents , or the entire drive must be shared , lest it wo n't be possible for the system to create the UNC path " for obvious reasons ) . <p> We used both the -numTasks : NUMFRAMES and -job %tn options to distribute the rendering on several RenderNodes . Each job sent to a node @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animation . For this reason , the animation output file ca n't be a single file ( i.e. AVI or MOV ) , it needs to be a separate file for each frame . <p> If we want to render the whole animation on one single computer , we can specify -numTasks : 1 in the command line . <p> In the example above , the workpath ( the folder where the RenderNode is installed on the render node ) needs to be the same for all the nodes . This is a limitation of custom jobs with BackBurner . <p> BackBurner is used here as an example . The RenderNode system was designed to work with all the major network managers . It should be simple to configure any custom network manager to use RenderNodes , provided the application was designed to accept custom jobs . <h> Hints on Setting Up Your Network Rendering Manager <p> You should of course be familiar with how jobs are submitted to your network manager before trying to setup this feature . Here are a few recommendations before you attempt to configure your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on custom jobs , <p> Read and try to reproduce the sample commands that are usually described in the reference manual , <p> Run a few simple tests with batch files , or simple applications ( the NotePad application is perfect for that ! ) <p> Finally , try to setup VUE to use your network manager , first with simple commands , and then with more elaborate commands that include all the required options . <p> If , after several attempts , it appears that it 's impossible to use RenderNodes with your network manager , please get in touch with our tech support to try and find a solution . <h> Setting Up RenderNodes <p> Unlike RenderCows , RenderNodes are not tied to a specific VUE license , but have their own licensing system . So each RenderNode license that you purchase may be used to render scenes created with any one of your VUE seats ( RenderNodes are not controlled directly by VUE ) . <p> Installing the RenderNodes is done easily using the VUE product installer . On the screen where you select to install either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next page , select which type of RenderNode you will be installing . And continue with the rest of the installation program screens . <p> In order to operate , the RenderNode requires the installation of an e-on License Server ( see here ) . The first thing the RenderNode does when it is started is attempt to connect to the License Server and get a license . If it can not retrieve a valid license ( either because no more licenses are available , or the network connection is not functional ) , the RenderNode will not start . <h> Updating RenderNodes <p> RenderNodes are updated automatically by the e-on License Server . <h> Controlling RenderNodes via Command Line <p> If you want to build your own Network Rendering Manager , or for any other purpose , you can also control the RenderNodes directly by command line . The following options are available : <p> " file ' FILEPATH ' : specifies the scene file that will be loaded and rendered , and ( optionally ) <p> " frame X : indicates which frame to render if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene is animated ) . If you do n't use this command , if the scene is animated , the entire animation range will be rendered ( the part between the start and end frames ) , <p> using the Animation Render Options stored in the file . If no animation is defined , the picture will be rendered using the Render Options stored in the file and the " frame X option will have no effect . <p> -range X Y : indicates the range of frames that will be rendered ( from X to Y inclusive ) . <p> -step S : sets the rendered frame increment ( e.g. , if set to 10 , only frame 0 , 10 , 20 will be rendered ) . <p> -output ' FOLDERPATH ' : specifies a path to a folder where all output images should be saved ( it overwrites the output paths set in the scene , and only keeps the base names ) . <p> -tile X Y W H : specifies the tile of the image to render . ( X , Y ) will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , H ) will be its size ( in pixels ) . <p> Warning : <p> The size of the tile will be ( W+1 ) * ( H+1 ) since the first row/column is taken into account . For instance -tile 0 0 64 64 will output 1 65x65 tile . <p> -rendersize W H : where W is the width and H is the height of the rendered frame . <p> -cpu N : indicates the maximum number of processors/cores which will be used by the RenderNode to render the job . This can be useful if you want to use other applications on the same machine where the RenderNode is running ( by default , the RenderNode will run on all available processors , which can make other applications quite unusable ) . <p> -autotilesuffix : adds txtytrtb to the output images filenames ( before the extension ) , where tx is the left coordinate of the rendered tile , ty the top one , tr the right one and tb the bottom one .

I wanted to use hundreds , thousands of flowers ! Vues alpha plane feature was the best way and a great help to get what I wanted . <p> This is where it gets tricky ! <p> Step 1 : I started to create 3 different groups of poppys in Vue , rendered them to full screen and saved the images and the depth mask .

I imported her as a pz3 into Vue and placed some poppys one by one in her left arm to create the bouquet she is picking . And the final touch was adding another poppy in her right hand .

This path is cleared once the application redraws the viewport completely ( which can be forced by clicking in the view or by moving the camera slightly ) .

" <p> Peter Baustaedter , Weta Digital . <p> Please meet Peter Baustaedter , a Vue artist currently working for Weta Digital . <p> Peter entered the video production and advertising industry back in 1992 . Since then , Peter has worked for high profile studios such as Digital Domain , Universal Studio , Electronic Arts , The Orphanage , and most currently Weta Digital ! <p> Since he began his career , Peter 's work can be seen in many blockbusters such as " Apollo 13 " , " Dante 's Peak " , " The Fifth Element " , " Titanic " , " Lord of The Rings : The Two Towers " , " King Kong " , " The Day After Tomorrow " or " The Lovely Bones " to name just a few . <p> Peter and the Weta Digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Avatar " . For their work , his team received a VES award for Outstanding Matte Paintings in a Feature Motion Picture . <h> About Peter <p> E-on : Tell us a little about yourself ? <p> Peter Baustaedter : Originally , I 'm from Graz , Austria . Incidentally the same town that Arnold Schwarzenegger is from . I 'm much less bulky tho . ; ) <p> My first contact with computer graphics was when I got a Commodore 64 when I was 14 years old . After playing games became somewhat boring , I discovered that one could ' paint ' on those machines . Albeit with 16 colors only and a joystick as input device but I was hooked . <p> I then moved on to an Amiga and that 's when I really dove into cg . I was part of the European " Demo Scene " and made three games too . <p> Parallel to that I went to art school and was educated in film , photography and video . Especially my extensive education in photography is helping me to this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his work on Avatar . Based on a Vue render and a few photos . <p> You have a long history with visual effects . Can you fill us in on some of the highlights of your career , some of the different areas of the industry you have worked in , and some of the studios you 've worked for ? <p> PB : I first started out in video post production in 1992 where I worked on an ancient Quantel Video Paintbox . From that I moved onto a Quantel Graphic Paintbox - a highres paint tool where I did image manipulations for advertising . <p> Early 1995 I moved to Los Angeles to work for Digital Domain . My first movie was Apollo 13 . During my time at DD I also did my first matte paintings on Dante 's Peak , concepts for The Fifth Element and again matte paintings and color work for Titanic . <p> I also worked on my first stereo show - Terminator2/3D - a ride for Universal Studios . <p> In August 1997 I moved to Hawaii and for two years was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spirits Within " . I was a member of the art department and then matte painting supervisor . <p> I returned to LA in 1999 and mostly worked as a freelance matte artist during those days - worth a mention would be " Swordfish " and the pilot for " Firefly " . <p> 2002 was my first contact with Weta during 6 months of working as a matte and texture artist on " LOTR : The Two Towers " . I loved working on this movie . Just the things to paint I became a matte painter for . <p> Returning to Los Angeles once again I joined my old colleagues at DD to create visual effects for " The Day After Tomorrow " . I finished the show at the Orphanage in San Francisco . I painted the inside of the Hurricane amongst many other mattes . <p> After a quick for months at EA LA I returned to New Zealand to do mattes for King Kong and have stayed here at Weta ever since . <p> What lead you to using Vue ? What spurred your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? <p> PB:I read about Vue on the internet and saw different testimonials on various forums . So I bought myself a license and was amazed what I could do with it . I especially liked the eco systems and the atmospheric engine . I just love the way Vue is lighting scenes and like how it puts technicalities in the background , so one can concentrate on the artistic side of things . <p> How long have you been using Vue ? <p> PB : I 've been using Vue for about four years now . For my professional work about the same time . The first time I used it for a movie was for " 30 Days of Night " where I rendered some pack ice . <p> You seem to have carved a very interesting path through the industry working on a hefty number of blockbusters . What has been the most important skill for you as an artist ? <p> PB : Having a good eye combined with a solid understanding of the tools you are using is essential . We 're deployed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and to know when you 've arrived are in my opinion the most important skills . <p> PB : I use Vue to get a painting laid out and to get a good solid base to work from . I try to establish the lighting for the scene , which I can build upon when completing the painting . <p> I work a lot with photographic elements - but sometimes it 's impossible to shoot or obtain reference . An old favorite are tree-scapes shot top-down , in special lighting conditions . Or currently I 'm working on a desert panoramic view from helicopter altitude . <p> Before , one had to look for the right photos , never finding the perfect one , and then go about desperately stitching , color correcting and composing those together . Vue is great to put into action for all those cases and is keeping the perspective and lighting flexible . Layered rendering is a god send too - it makes the render much easier to integrate and to manipulate . <p> I also used Vue to render unwrapped sky domes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just been upgrading from version 7.5 to 8.5 and ca n't wait to put the Spectral 3 clouds to work . I think I 'll be able to create sky domes that will hold up on screen without much tweaking . Very exciting ! <p> The new terrain generator looks very cool too - I hope I get some time to really dive in and explore all the new features . <p> Click to see more Lovely Boneswork by Weta Digital <p> The list of movies you 've worked on is pretty impressive , could you name some of the projects you 've used Vue on ? <p> PB : I 've used Vue on a number of projects - schedule and nature of the work make it impossible to use Vue all the time but here we go : <p> " 30 Days of Night " - Christian Haley and me used Vue to render pack ice and Christian also used the render as the basis for his sky if I remember correctly . <p> " The Lovely Bones " - did some layouts with it on this project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came up with a pretty neat pipeline on this one . We did a total of 330 matte shots on Avatar and Vue was of great help to get them all done in the schedule . <p> Vue came into play especially when doing jungle vistas and floating islands , all enveloped in Vue 's excellent atmosphere . <p> Recently , three colleagues and I received the VES award for " Outstanding Matte Paintings in a Feature Motion Picture " for Avatar . <p> You work for Weta right now . Can you tell us a little about what your day contains ? <p> PB : My day usually starts with a strong cup of coffee . After that it 's checking if last night 's renders came out ok and submitting them for dailies . After going to dailies and getting feedback for my submission , it 's off to do the actual work . It usually involves looking for reference ( or going out and shooting some if appropriate ) , using Maya , Vue and Nuke and of course Photoshop . Throw in meetings with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> About Vue <p> Where does Vue fit into this ? Tell us a bit about your pipeline . <p> PB : Usually a shot starts with layout geo that we receive from our layout department . I prep it for my needs and generate a projection camera . That geo and camera are sent over to Vue , where the lighting layout is done and where eco systems are deployed . <p> After rendering some layers , I put it all together in Photoshop and do my work there . Once there is something to see , I 'll take those layers into nuke and do my projections there . Voila ! ( if only it was that easy ! )

In the 2D application of your choice ( e.g. PhotoShop ) , create a picture of the same resolution as the terrain , and Paste into it . <p> Now you can modify the terrain as you like . You can use filters on it to generate astounding effects . Remember that when you lighten a point of the picture it means that you are increasing the altitude of the corresponding point in the terrain . <p> When you have finished modifying the picture , Copy it back into the clipboard . In the Terrain Editor , press Paste . The modified terrain appears in the map . <p> When you are done , press OK to validate the new terrain . <p> The Canyon terrain object was created in the following way : a meandering black river was drawn on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river ; the picture was then filtered to create steps and imported into VUE ; last , the terrain was slightly eroded ( Diffusive erosion ) to smooth the steps and dig water streams ( Fluvial erosion ) . <h> Importing Multi-Part DEMs <p> Vue can import USGS DEM models that are composed of several files . However , there are a few precautions you should take when importing such multi-part DEMs . <p> In the Import Options dialog , you should uncheck the options called Resize object and Center object . If these options are checked , the models that you import will be automatically positioned at the center of the 3D views , and resized to a standard size , which means that relative positions and sizes will be lost . <p> Import the first DEM model by using the menu command File Import Object . The DEM file contains information on the geographic position of the DEM slab . Unfortunately , because you can get DEMs from anywhere in the world , chances are that this position will be out of the Vue bounds . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that you offset the DEM 's origin by a value that will make it appear at the center of the 3D views . Press OK . <p> Now import the other DEM models in the set . Each time the Terrain Offset dialog appears , be sure to press OK without modifying the values ( so as to maintain relative positions ) . <p> When you have finished importing the set of models and you want to import another set , you can press the Reset button in the Terrain Offset dialog . This will compute new values for the offset , so that the new DEM model is centered in the 3D views .

Therefore , whatever 3D tools I use needs to have the capacity to translate camera and geometry between applications . I also need the ability to generate common render passes which compositors utilize , such as z-depth , tag channels , and more . Vue was the only organic landscape generation tool with all these capabilities . " <h> Nature Projects <h> Inspiration <p> This project took form as an attempt to study Shan-Shui , the philosophy behind traditional Chinese landscape painting . The subject matter of mountains , rivers , and the " sea of clouds " , like many Chinese paintings , is inspired by Huangshan " the Yellow Mountains " , which are located in the southeastern corner of the Anhui Province , in Eastern China . <p> There is a concept in Chinese landscape painting of " idea-realms " , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . In that tradition , presented here are three " dynamic paintings " , or , " idea-realms " , each meant to reflect a fundamental idea in Taoist philosophy . <p> " I used this work as a means to study an artistic form I have been inspired by for quite awhile , and also to learn the Nuke compositing application , specifically 3D compositing techniques for large scale vfx shot creation . " <p> This project took 14 months to complete and was accepted for the Siggraph 2008 Computer Animation Festival . The three " dynamic paintings " are essentially visual effects shots which demonstrate elaborate 3D compositing techniques . What follows is a breakdown of core procedures involved in the production of these three shots . <h> Project Creation <p> Modeling and propagation in Vue <p> " For modeling , I used Vue 6 xStream to create mountains and trees through procedural propagation . Trees are placed on the mountain surface based upon organic distribution parameters of altitude and slope . The density , scale and type of foliage within regions of the terrain is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space , lower-resolution geometry can be exported as standard . obj files for reference in other software . " <p> " What makes Vue special , and particularly suited for collaborative , complex vfx shot production , is a suite of plugins which enable simultaneous camera and renderer interaction between all the primary 3d applications . What completes the effective integration of this landscape generation tool is the application 's capacity to render locally , or pass off a variety of image channel data to external renderers . " <h> Ease of Use and Difficulties <p> Compositing in Nuke <p> " The easiest part of the project was the camera and geo updating between Vue , Maya and Nuke . This worked seamlessly with each and every iteration . I had so many pre-vis variations and composition changes during the course of the project that had this been a cumbersome workflow I might have thrown in the towel very early on . " <p> " I realized that I could n't render animated sequences in Vue without noise , however I overcame this by exploring the technique of 3d camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain stills in Vue , with other passes , then exported low res versions of the mountain geo , and projected the 4k render stills onto the low res geo and rendered that with an animated camera in Nuke . These new projection passes I re-constituted and composited in Nuke ( re-combined multiple renders ( 7 different mountains ) for a variety of further editing to create atmosphere and integration with FX generated in Maya and 3dsMax . " <h> Conclusion <p> While 3D compositing creates a variety of creative options for environment creation , the specific use of projection mapping must be well planned out or the technique will become obvious , and the effect unsuccessful . Meticulous attention to camera behavior must be considered , or realistic parallax will not be achieved and the fake dimension of the environment made plain . <h> Current Projects <p> Ari Rubenstein is currently working on another side project which will make heavy use of Vue for a large 10k matte painting . He will be creating a huge forested , snow-capped mountain range vista for a sequence in a short film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a forward-thinking product . My hope is that you will steer this application towards the film production arena , continuing to create functionality for matte painters and compositors. "

@@74102340 @2802340/ <p> E-on : Can you tell us a bit about yourself and what lead you to 3G in general ? <p> Scott Brisbane : My background was in arts , I was into makeup effects and that kind of thing like Rick Baker and Stan Winston . Eventually I started making my own movies in high school . That led to me going to film school at USC here in LA . I started to focus more on film making as opposed to makeup effects and this was back in the 90s so there was n't a lot of digital film , everything was photo-chemical/optical . There was n't a lot of Visual FX classes either so I ended up focusing on cinematography and graduated with that . I worked in the industry for a bit and fell into editing , then I realized I did n't want to do that . You know you kind of just take the first job that comes along so I ended up as an assistant editor for a couple of years . <p> It all started with this image ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do , this was around 2000 when Visual FX was pretty established . I attended the Academy of Arts University in San Francisco where Ronn Brown ( a pretty well known visual matte painter ) was director of Graduate Studies and taught the first ever Digital Matte Painting class . Caroleen " Jett " Green ( " E.T . " , " Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom " , etc ) was a guest lecturer and chose one of my final projects to be featured at a Starbucks around the corner from the Academy of Art ( I later worked with Jett at Matte World and at Dreamworks when Ronn asked us to start the Matte Painting Department there in 2005 ) . Ronn brought Craig Barron , the co-founder of Matte World , to the show . Barron saw my work and loved it so he found me and gave me an interview . That 's how I got my first job ! <p> After Midnight - Personal Project <p> Scott painted this 1920 's Erie Canal shot while at Matte World <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it was meant to happen , it was n't forced it was a natural progression for me . That 's how this whole career has been , it did n't come easy I had to work hard and put a lot of effort into it . You just work with a lot of people , they like your work and it snowballs into a career . I guess I 'm just glad I ran into Ronn Brown . <p> Matte World was also an invaluable experience where I was mentored by Craig Barron and Chris Evans ( " Return of the Jedi " , " Willow " , etc ) for 3 years before moving to LA to start the Matte Painting Department with Jett and Ronn . <p> VUE environments in Croods <p> So you 've turned your hobbies into a career for yourself and you 've been pretty successful . <p> SB : Exactly its a weird dynamic because matte painting is such an interesting craft , it combines so many things . Its not just painting , there 's digital painting , photography , CG renders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera lenses , lighting , and composition . All of these things combine and then there 's the other side of having 3D skills . You have to have an understanding of nature , light and atmosphere . I had an artistic background from when I was a kid and then learning photography and cinematography lead me to the photographic side of it at USC , it all just came together over the years . <p> Some of Scott 's 3D environments made with VUE for Avatar <p> What was the highlight of your career ? <p> SB : I would say " Avatar " . At the time , I did n't know how it would all turn out . I had to go to New Zealand and work on this film everyone had been talking about . I was at Rhythm and Hues at the time and details of the film were top secret but its James Cameron and Weta Digital , how could it not be good ? So I decided to go and check it out for 6 months . It was the best experience ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nuke , and Maya ; I had to learn Nuke while I was there but having my background was a great benefit for me . Usually you never know how the movie is going to turn out , but for this movie , once you got there you knew it was going to be a great . The work we had time to do was amazing and the team was good . Cameron was very clear- he was never indecisive , always do what Cameron asks you to do haha . So that was my best experience all around , I still look back and wish I could encapsulate that moment in time . <p> Avatar environments made by Scott using VUE <p> You mentioned Rhythm And Hues . You worked on " Cabin in the Woods " and " Land of the Lost " while there . Those are very different movies from " Avatar " , so what were the differences when using VUE ? what did you enjoy working on more , animated movies or photo-real ? <p> SB : I like both actually . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me . Making sure it looks real , I think the difficulty of photo-real is what 's taken for granted . Its not as easy as everyone thinks . With photo-real , if it looks painted or manipulated at all its a failure as a matte painting but with animation you get away with a lot more . You can push colors but you have to fit the style of the movie . <p> More movie titles in which Scott used VUE <p> With photo-real I can hit a target and its not a varying target , its pretty clear : it either looks real or it does n't . With animation its more subjective like the style " Kung Fu Panda " . It is beautiful but you break all the rules of nature because you have green skies and the green skies should influence the the shadows but they do n't , the shadows are blue . That 's not natural but that 's the challenge to make it look right without changing that style . So I like both . Photo-real is more natural to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so believable , people ca n't even point out what 's created , that it all looks like a natural environment . Then there 's the animation side where you can push all the colors and accentuate everything in the style that you cant do in photo-real at all . <p> Switching back and forth did take me time to adjust to . You get typecast in this business like with anything . If you 're a TV actor its hard to get into feature films and if you 're a feature film matte painter its hard to get into animation because they assume you ca n't do the animated look . There 's a weird stigma with both sides and to cross back over is kind of tricky . <p> The Croods Jungle - Created with VUE <p> You 've worked with a variety of studios throughout the years but you always come back to DreamWorks , why is that ? <p> SB : The culture and the people at DreamWorks is a huge plus , not to mention the movies . I came back to DreamWorks for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panda 1 " with Markus Manninen , The Visual FX Supervisor , he asked me to come back and explained the movie . He described " Croods " as a great opportunity to push matte painting and animation further than we 've done before I always like to push things , any opportunity to go further than what we 've done , I just jumped at that . I love the studio and everything but I came back for that and I think that film and what it became for us in matte painting was really pushing the boundaries of what we 've done , VUE was big part of that . <p> The above trailer shows some of the amazing environments Scott 's team created with VUE for The Croods <p> There are a few shots in there we could n't do without VUE . One of them was this time-lapse shot that the FX department really did n't have the bandwidth for and the render here is difficult obviously as with most places . There were forests and jungles and this was a time of day kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution for that . It ended up being the Director 's , Chris Sanders , favorite shot in the movie . The most important shot he wanted in the movie was that shot and VUE was a big part of that . <p> VUE Environments in the Croods <p> It was all rendered on our Linux render node farm . It was a 3K render and I believe there was a couple hundred frames I had to leave overnight with the render farm . 3000 pixels wide , and it was all fully animated and lighted . All the clouds were time-lapsed so I did that in VUE , it was pretty great . <p> So that 's why I came back originally but also , in animation , DreamWorks is probably the only studio I know that really embraces matte painting the way they do . Other studios try to render everything and they do n't really embrace this creative way to look at environments . They are more literal about the pipeline : model it , surface it , light it , model it , surface it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting can contribute and use all the creative techniques we have and creative approaches with different tools like VUE . Instead of having to fully render all the time how about we paint it and project it or we render and sweeten it with matte painting for example . So I think from the beginning we 've kind of progressed the reputation of matte painting here at DreamWorks and I think " Kung Fu Panda 1 " was a big eye opening moment for them , that was all VUE . <p> Kung Fu Panda has a huge amount of matte paintings , all rendered with VUE <p> " Kung Fu Panda 1 " was the first time I used VUE in production . That was the first film where it was just a huge amount of matte paintings all rendered with VUE , then painted on top of and then re-projected . That was a pretty solid base , most of the vegetation was all VUE rendered and that was the first eye opening experience for the studio like " wow we can really do all this stuff with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an army of 40 " . They keep embracing it and that 's why I 'm here . Its partly the creativity of films like " How to Train Your Dragon " , as long as we are doing those kind of environment movies . That 's really appealing to me and challenging , and I can use VUE . Haha , I always like to use VUE . <p> The Croods Coral Fields - Created in VUE <p> Who brought you to VUE ? You said it was during your time on " Avatar " ? Was VUE already installed there ? <p> SB : Yeah it was already setup . They did a test to show what kind of mapping you could do for " Avatar " because they had a hard time rendering in Pandora as they usually do with those kinds of things . Brenton Cottman , I think it was , did a test flying over some of the floating mountains in VUE and that convinced to Joe Letteri that we can do these things in matte painting . <p> I originally found out about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew Chris from when we were both working at Matte World . When I was at DreamWorks Chris had mentioned VUE , he said " Hey I can render all these trees and I do n't have to get a photographic reference now , I can light them anyway I want and they look great and I can put them on a painting " That was what they did with the jungles in " Pirates of the Caribbean 2 " ( Dead Man 's Chest ) . So I lobbied to get that here for " Kung Fu Panda 1 " . Throughout the movie , there was probably about 13 or 16 different scenes with different times of day so the tricky part was like why do n't we just build it like an asset and cover it in foliage and then light it . Then the artist can have the same template every time to start with to modify that so it will look consistent . So that 's how I got into VUE originally , from Chris Stoski recommending it . <p> Great use of VUE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you consider the most fundamental difference between VUE and any other traditional 3D programs or the more traditional matte painting pipe line , where does VUE stand out in there ? <p> SB : Lots of places for me , the biggest thing is the quality of the atmosphere and light . I think the render is really really fantastic in its ability to emulate what nature does . The quality of lighting in the atmosphere is huge , how light diffuses and refracts , I think it looks beautiful . There 's no other program I know that does that . The next thing would obviously be the foliage and the ability to manipulate , edit , groom and compose landscapes with VUE using the tools e-on software is developing with scattering plants editing those scatters . <p> Here we are simply art directed all the time and its not just for happenstance , sometimes you get a random thing that looks great but mainly we are very deliberate and art directed . So the ability of VUE to go in and move trees around individually and compose things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The primary thing we use it for is the quality of atmosphere ... and now the clouds ! We 're using the clouds in " How to Train Your Dragon 2 " quite a bit . In that first sequence where they are flying through the clouds that 's all VUE based clouds , its half FX but a lot of them are all VUE clouds and you cant tell the difference between the two . <p> Check out the amount of details in How to Train Your Dragon 2 environments <p> You sound like you know a lot of the program and all that it can do . How did you train yourself to learn VUE did you find any programs /workshops or did you basically teach yourself ? <p> SB : I think it was a mix . I had just finished working on " Flushed Away " and " Kung Fu Panda " was n't for another 3 or 4 months so I had some time in between . That 's when I just delved into VUE . I cant remember what version , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lot of the eco-painting tools so I was just trying to master that level of lighting and scattering with plants for " Kung Fu Panda " . Since then over the years I 've continually gone back to it . <p> I think I took a class from Dax Pandhi a while back just to push myself to go further with some things and that was definitely helpful but most of my background in VUE is self-trained and of course I watched the tutorials that came with the program but from there I just trained myself . <p> Above the VUE clouds , in How to Train Your Dragon 2 <p> Do you feel like you still need some training on it ? <p> SB : Oh I think its so deep of a program I could always use some more training . The great thing about VUE are all the different levels of it . On the surface its very user friendly because you can grab things and move them around , it simple . The GUI is well laid out so you can click on buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to dive in and get very complicated like some other programs . However , if you do want to go deeper control things on a real minute level you can go into the function editor and go really crazy . I think that 's why I 'm probably not as sophisticated on the highly detailed aspect of stuff , I 'm always pushing myself into it though . I 'm a pretty proficient user of VUE but I can always get better , its such a neat program . <p> More of Scott 's team environments for The Croods and How To Train Your Dragon 2 using VUE <p> You 're teaching a VUE class at StudioArts . Can you give us some information about that ? <p> SB : This is my 3rd class , I 've taught two semesters already . The approach of the class is how to use VUE as a tool for digital matte painting . A lot of the artists are coming in from various studios . We had a couple of artists come in from Stargate Studios which is more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ) , they do a lot of " Walking Dead " and things like that . Also some students from Nickelodeon and lots of different studios . The StudioArts program is not for student level , its a very professional high level program . The people taking the class are professionals in-between jobs that want to train and pick up new skills . <p> Scott used VUE EcoSystems , rocks and terrains in this Matte Paintings for Land of the Lost <p> Could you tell us what your students find the hardest , vs. the easiest . what they like the most what they do n't like ? <p> SB : I think what they love the most about it is the interactivity once they get into the GUI , how easy it is to move around VUE and navigate . That 's a big plus because you get a lot of artists that do n't have a 3D background and I 'd say VUE is more user-friendly . You go into Maya or other programs , especially like Z-Brush and they have more complicated interfaces , there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can jump in and start doing something right away . The great thing about the render window is the feedback you can get , it 's pretty accurate . You see what you 're doing as your working and it updates quickly , instant feedback . <p> They like the eco-painting , that 's fun . They are blown away by instancing that many plants and having that much control over it . Lighting is another one , they like that because the quality of the light looks great right away and the atmosphere is always good . <p> " The Kung Fu Panda style is beautiful but you break all the rules of nature because you have colored skies , which should influence the the shadows but they do n't " - Scott Brisbane <p> They struggle with the functions of the more complicated stuff . Sometimes getting into the shaders are complicated for them because they get confused on the basic shader vs. the layered and the eco-system shader . How that whole interface works confuses them . Say it 's the eco-system and also mixed material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reset things by accident instead of clicking below in that little out-liner . So I think that layout is a little confusing for some people , how its all connected . <p> During this ten weeks class , what are the main topics you cover ? <p> SB : It 's an intro class for VUE , the angle and approach of what VUE is good for with matte painting and how to use it . We do n't cover animation , its more about using VUE as a tool to create reference or to create a base or even just use VUE fully for the final image depending if its animation or photo-real . So its more of those approaches , showing some animation techniques and some photo-real techniques . It covers all the main areas of VUE , we go through the basics of all the applications in there . <p> Scott 's team used VUE for the Monsters Vs Aliens environments <p> Could you share your killer tip in VUE , A super secret that you have ? <p> SB : Good question , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that I do all the time , but its not a secret , just a work-flow that I rely on VUE for . One thing I 'd say that has been really beneficial for us is the ability to render clouds from above at any angle that we needed , like on " How to Train Your Dragon 2 " . We usually use photography or we hand paint everything but then it ends up looking hand painted , so we usually have to rely on photography . But , how many times do you have photographers shooting down on clouds ? Unless they are jumping out of an airplane you 're not going to get that angle . So the ability to use VUE for shooting down on clouds is a huge benefit . Its happened on " Shrek 4 " and its happened on " How to Train Your Dragon 2 " . I think we even used it at Rhythm and Hues . That 's huge for me because I do n't know how else I 'd do it . It has to look tangible and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dragon 2 " look was . It was n't as stylistic as " Kung Fu Panda " . <p> " The ability to use VUE for shooting down on clouds is a huge benefit " - Scott Brisbane <p> Other than that I think I use it primarily for time-lapse , that open shot in " Croods " , which I just could n't have done without VUE . I believe it was used in " Madagascar 3 " for this dreamy sequence of time-lapse clouds . The ability to animate clouds in VUE and change the way they recede on and off , naturally forming and moving throughout that 's a huge benefit that I do n't think any other program can do that quickly with feedback . So we used that on a couple of films now and every time I show people those shots they 're like " oh I want a time-lapse shot ! " Otherwise they have no idea how they are going to do it because if you shoot real photography it looks too real or you can try to do it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times . So yeah the time-lapse stuff is one thing we use it for quite a bit . Its just an essential part of our work-flow here . Even for plants , scattering plants or rendering landscapes with plants , its our first go to program for all of that . Also , I think the eco-system tools are amazing , the flexibility of those . <p> But I do n't really have any top secret methods , its just using VUE as part of the work-flow to create imagery and its been great . <p> " In Kung Fu Panda , most of the vegetation was all VUE rendered and that was the first eye opening experience for the studio ! " - Scott Brisbane <p> SB : We are very eager to test it for our pipeline , how we create foliage at the studio . We have some proprietary tools that we use for plants but those tools are n't as editable as we 'd like them to be . We want very deliberately designed/created plants that are n't just randomly generated and Plant Factory seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to design crazy outrageous plants . Like in " Croods " , the trees look very alien so we had to model those by hand , the old CG way and we are looking for a solution for that . To have the procedural modeling that you have in Plant Factory would be pretty powerful so I think we are looking at that as an overall pipeline benefit in creating foliage . We are also interested in it for a tool to create more interesting plants in our matte painting , its a win if get it for everybody . <p> " I think from the beginning we 've kind of progressed the reputation of matte painting here at DreamWorks and I think Kung Fu Panda 1 was a big eye opening moment for them , that was all VUE ! " - Scott Brisbane <p> Do you follow any VUE communities online ? <p> SB : Yeah I do , I follow some of the Cornucopia3D stuff . I talk to a lot of people in the Industry and other artists that are using VUE as well . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to see because when I first started using it , it was n't as well known . Everyone was like " what is this VUE thing " , so I show people and they are blown away . I talk to fellow artists about it more than anything , professionals in the industry at the various studios that I know are using VUE that way . <p> San Francisco Matte Paintings for Monster Vs Aliens , environments are VUE based , and the buildings were purchased on Turbosquid and lit/textured in VUE <p> So in the community you 've actually brought VUE to a lot of people and showed them the product ? <p> SB : Oh yeah I 'm like the VUE Ambassador . Every time I show people what I do with it they go " that 's amazing ! " Of course they say " well I ca n't do that " and I tell them yeah you can . Then they use it and get frustrated because it does n't just happen , but with any tool you have to gain a mastery of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Maya without knowing how to use Maya . There 's that first initial " oh it looks so easy " and it is easy but it takes practice and training and experience to really gain full control and understanding . So I think that 's the thing I 'm always showing . <p> Check out some of the amazing Environments in Kung Fu Panda <p> After " Kung Fu Panda 1 " , I went on a tour around DreamWorks demoing VUE and what it could do for art . The art department should be using VUE because they can interactively change lighting on their design and paint over it and its fast . I became the VUE demo guy at DreamWorks . I 've got a couple of people in art using it now and they 've been using it for years . Now lighting is starting to use it in our studio for the HDR skies . We usually shoot those with photography but I showed them we can do it in VUE and they are like " Wow ! We could just design our own skies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go out and shoot those things " so now the lighting department is using VUE as well . So I 've got a couple of departments using it here . The classes are a big component of it , every time I teach a class people are just amazed by what the possibilities are and they get excited about it for matte painting . I like exposing people to the possibilities . <p> " Croods was a great opportunity to push matte painting and animation further than we 've done before " - Scott Brisbane <p> On behalf of e-on software , thank you ! <p> SB : Sure yeah ! That 's the thing , everywhere I 've gone I 've used it . When I went to Rhythm and Hues they did n't have it and I recommended they use VUE for this one shot . It was on " Land of the Lost " and it was a fly-over these trees over the prehistoric forest and I said we can do this in VUE , we need VUE . So they got VUE for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So yeah it was in every studio I 've been in except for Matte World because I did n't know about it at the time and that was just more traditional matte painting studio , no animation . The more people see it in movies like " Avatar " the more they want to use it . <p> " That first sequence in How to Train Your Dragon 2 where they are flying through the clouds that 's all VUE based clouds - Scott Brisbane <p> Seems like you 're really a busy guy do you still have time for personal projects in regards to CG because I know you do a lot of music stuff as well . Do you still have personal projects ? <p> SB : Yeah I have n't done a lot of personal projects , I usually just work at lot at work and when I go home I just detach . I do music , I think it gives me a healthy perspective on things , teaches my objective focus , grounds me for a bit . So yeah no personal projects lately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work I do n't feel like I need to do it . Between " Croods " and " Dragons " and now I 'm working on " Kung Fu Panda 3 " , I feel pretty fulfilled at work . There 's some great stuff I just did with VUE , some great shots and they are really excited about it . <p> The city of Modesto - California , in Monsters Vs Aliens <p> Anything else you 'd like to add ? Any advice you 'd like to give to anyone willing to enter the Visual FX or Matte Painting industry ? <p> SB : The most important thing is having a strong foundation artistically and understanding how nature behaves and how lighting in nature works . As a matte painter you 're always working on what looks natural - unless its comes to DreamWorks working on films like " Kung Fu Panda " , that 's an exception . With most movies you 're always emulating what natures doing so you have to have a good sense of that . <p> Train yourself , do some fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emulate in paint . Its always a good thing to do , I did a lot of that at the academy and I do a lot of that here . We occasionally go out as a group and paint on the weekend . <p> I think the strongest foundation is having an eye , developing your eye for seeing what nature really does . VUE does a lot of that for you because it has a really good understanding of light and atmosphere in nature which is very important . But you still want an understanding of that without having VUE , using photography for your own reference . You have to really understand what looks right . Some people can art direct you into that but you really have to develop your own sense of what 's right and what looks correct . That comes with the experience of looking at and studying nature . Also studying other artists that you are inspired by and understanding why their art is so great . For instance , I alsways go back to the Albert Whitlock , a great matte painter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks very believable not contrived . It does n't look like a human hand was involved . That 's the biggest thing for me , the quality of light in a matte painting to make it look real and believable.

So I pretty much started from there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after going through the Cornucopia 3D store to see what models were available as a starting point and what he was able to find in Particle Illusion to create the effects he wanted . That was about it . <p> " Then I just started building up the scenes based on the sketches ... and frequently made some happy accidents and ended up improving a bit on the layouts as I went . In some cases , I just could n't figure out a way to do something so scrapped it and came up with a different scene . " <p> Photoshop CS was used in combination with some of the Alien Skin Eye Candy filters to create some repeating patterns to use as water textures for water . <p> Particle Illusion was used to generate numerous smoothly looped 2D animations which were then included in the Vue scenes in multiple alpha planes -- snow , rain , waterfalls , rainbows , fireworks , fire , mist , northern lights , fireflies , lightning . In some cases lighting was set up to correspond to effects ( such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene ) . <p> The only post render effect applied was a Particle Illusion effect for a desert scene at noon to create a heat wave effect on the scene . All other effects are actually put in the 3D model itself . <p> " Finally , I wrote a little application to take a sequence of . tiff files rendered from Vue and put them together as a QuickTime movie with H.264 compression and to add my signature as an alpha layer in the lower right corner . " <h> Difficulties and Ease of Use <h> Difficulties <p> " Not being a 3D expert was probably the biggest difficulty . E-on software definitely tries to make 3D approachable , but there are still many settings that I am unsure what they are about . " " In general 3D interfaces feel very ad hoc to me . Little pieces , all with tons of individual settings , and very little overall to pull them together and simplify things as new bits are added . This probably wo n't be solved for someone like me until a company turns around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <h> Ease of Use <p> " Vue does not take over the entire screen , this was a big plus for me . Finally I could have some online tutorial open and see that at the same time I was working in Vue . " <p> " If I was unsure about what I wanted to do in a model , I could leave it open ( but visible ) and work on some other things ( programming , reading emails , etc. ) and if I suddenly had an idea of what I wanted to do in the model as I was looking at it in the background , simply click to bring it forward and try it out . " <p> Vue 's support of alpha planes , including animations , enabled Mike to use Particle Illusion to generate 2D , smoothly looped effects and then actually include them within the 3D models . This made various effects such as northern lights , fireworks , rain , snow , and more possible . Moving a repeating texture with a water material enables some decent looking streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 displays a different relaxing scene . Every day that monthly scene changes appearance based on the time of day or night . Every hour Agenda 4 randomly selects from a variety of different weather variations possible for the scene . Many of the scenes are animated . <p> There are a total of 365 renderings ( stills &amp; animations ) covering 12 scenes and all the different types of weather and lighting variations within them . It took over 2,600 hours to render the finished 3D models and then each animation was then compressed using industry standard H.264 for the best balance of quality and file size . <p> This is the statistic that is really incredible though . If you break down each frame of each scene , it is made up of polygons that the computer had to convert from the 3D data into a 2D image . The 365 renderings account for a total of : 2,026,872,020,805 polygons . <p> The scene information was entered into a database from which Agenda 4 makes its random selections each hour to download and cache the data so each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be displayed from a local copy after that . <h> Current Projects <p> " There are major upgrades in the works to my Archive , Finance , and iKeeper applications and I still have plenty of ideas for Agenda 4 . The future there depends on the number of product registrations and future technological and interface improvements in Vue . There are definitely things I would love to improve in the existing scenes , and I have lots of ideas for new scenes .

I then moved to New Zealand for four years to work at Weta Digital Studios on the " Lord of the Rings " movies . <p> I came back at ILM for Star Wars . I had the choice between " King Kong " and " Star Wars " . It was a difficult choice it worked out for the best . <p> I have been mostly at ILM since , working on movies such as " Mission : Impossible III " , " Eragon " , " Live Free or Die Hard " ... <p> When did you see Vue for the first time ? <p> Matte Painting from " Pirates of the Caribbean 2&amp;quot <p> YD : The company was gearing up on " Pirates 2 " , and the guys were working with Vue . They showed me some of their progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3D landscapes they could create with Vue ( which was n't available before then ) . <p> Pictures had always been a source for us , for matte painters . We just did n't have any tools for landscaping other than just your standard 3D package that did n't have a whole lot of power for large nature scenes . <p> So that was my first peek at it , but I did n't touch it until the Indiana Jones project . <p> Why did you decide to use Vue rather than photo references ? <p> YD : I did some research and asked around to see what had been done before in order to cover the shots we had to do for this one sequence . For a while this sequence seemed daunting . I had to create this very , very large high view of the Amazon forest . So I looked into photo reprints and there were very few aerial shots of the Amazon or anything resembling it . The whole sequence required many shots and that 's when I looked into Vue . I got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It took me a good three weeks to become familiar with Vue . Vue is very quick to create any environment , but since it had to be a specific type of look and terrain , it took about a month for me to figure out what approach in Vue would be best for me to cover that whole sequence . <p> What was the creation process like ? Did you start with a specific Idea ( given by the art director ) , and have to stick to it , or did Vue let you go further than planned ? <p> YD : I was also the " concept artist " - working directly with the supervisor Pablo . I had done a bunch of concepts early on so I had some freedom . But the final call was Pablo Helman 's . The only direction that I really got was that we needed this vast Amazon forest from 1000 feet up and there needed to be a river at the bottom . And that was it . That was the guideline and from there I was free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you use Vue in combination with any other 3D app ? <p> YD : Since I was doing the background environment , it was mostly Vue . To get a very precise landscape layout for use throughout the sequence , the layout was done in XSI and we used Vue to populate the vegetation . We did mold much of the geometry in Vue , then took it into XSI to lay it out . We finally exported everything back to Vue , and used the Vue shaders ( mainly EcoSystem materials ) . <p> I had some very quick results within the first month . I found the trees I was looking for . We used trees and plants right out of the box and made the ecosystem without any modifications to the plants . We did n't modify any of the textures except for coloring a bit . <p> We were able to render very large images with all multi pass layers separated directly in Vue ( which is good as it avoids any stitching work afterwards ) . The shadows and highlights were done separately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's it . <p> Thinking on a sequence level with limited render power I had to figure out the best approach for this . It took me some time to narrow down the lighting settings . <p> Talking about limited render power , how many machines did you use for the render ? How long did the scenes take to render ? <p> YD : Rendering was on a per shot basis . We laid out the camera path and determine entire camera coverage throughout the entire shot . <p> We then created an extra camera to cover this with a much wider angle and a large aspect ratio . Rendering one frame at a time . We used hi res renders so that it could cover the entire camera coverage . <p> The images were 4000-5000 pixels wide . We used only 5 machines and it usually took 24 hours per image . This was a bit of a bet - hoping everything was rendering correctly and that I did n't forget anything in the render passes . <p> The renders were heavy . In the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was quite a large environment with a lot of trees in there and a very high polycount . <p> Vue really saved me on this . It seemed like it was my only option and it actually became the best option . <p> How would you have done it the " traditional way " ? <p> YD : I would have called for a photoshoot . We had some material , but not for that specific angle - a certain height we had to convey and the specific environment . I needed a 180 degree view of the whole place and there was nothing out there that could help me do this . Another option was for me to paint it by hand which would have taken forever and would n't have looked as good . <p> We are mostly digital now but the Director and DP ( Director of Photography ) were more traditional . The first Indiana Jones Trilogy established the need to have this old school look ; it fits with the story and the style of this movie . So we had to retain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was a greater challenge . <h> About Vue <p> What was the hardest thing to achieve with Vue ? And how did you manage to do it ? <p> YD : What the product gave me was great . However technical things like importing cameras from XSI gave me some trouble . I tried many different ways to no avail , yet at some point it would just work . With Maya , it was much easier . <p> Once I understood the correct procedure to bring in the camera path , it was just the matter of setting up the ecosystem and set up the layer renders and launch the render . It took me a while to get it going , but once I had it the results were great . <p> YD : The magic is in the trees ! 3D trees have been around for a long time , but lighting trees on such a large scale was practically impossible . They are always very heavy and you can use them for foreground and midground stuff . But creating entire vistas was a first in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With Vue I can get exactly what I want and it 's definitely a first for me. 3D landscaping they call it ; it 's just wonderful ! This software is really powerful and it 's a great plus for the whole industry . <p> Will you be using Vue for your personal artwork ? <p> YD : I like to keep my art traditional ( digital painting with Photoshop , etc. ) in a sense because it requires me to work harder . <p> But for any production work and especially environment production and landscape , I will switch to Vue right away now ! <p> Nowadays , environments are left out to the digimatte department and it 's up to us to find the solutions for that .

You may find additional tips and advice for specific setups not covered in this manual . <h> Standalone and Integrated Modes <p> VUE Infinite is a standalone application only . It offers all the tools that are required to create , animate and render natural 3D environments , without the need for any other applications . Obviously , it also offers many tools to help integrate your VUE work with other 2D and 3D applications " but using other applications alongside VUE remains optional . <p> VUE xStream , on the other hand , is primarily designed to run inside ' another 3D application ( the target application ) as a plugin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside this 3D application , and automatically combines the VUE objects with the native objects of that application . Thus , the VUE environment is integrated ' inside the target application . <p> Note : <p> VUE can also be run outside ' of its target application . It is then running in standalone mode and is operated , in all ways , exactly like VUE Infinite . <h> VUE Licenses <p> It means that a single VUE license let 's you use the integration plugin in all your compatible 3D applications and renderers . If you want to use VUE with a 3D application , simply make sure the plugin has been installed for the application . <h> VUE Installation <p> During the installation of VUE , you will be asked which versions of the integration plug-in you want to install . All supported applications for the current architecture ( 64bit ) will be listed . Please select the versions for which you want to install the VUE integration plug-in . <p> If the installer detects the application on your computer , then the corresponding item in the list will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already be filled . Otherwise , you need to : <p> Check the box near the application version ( you will be asked to browse to the location where the application is installed ) <p> Or select the application version , click on the Browse button , and then check the box . <p> With Windows , the installer will detect if the application you selected is already running , and will ask you to close it before continuing the installation . This is to ensure that the plug-in files are successfully installed and that the configuration files of the host application can be edited . To avoid any mistake during installation , the installer will only allow the installation into a folder if it can detect the application there . But , the installer has no way to tell which version of the application you 're selecting in the browser .

Unless you have modified the Mental Ray default configuration , you can safely ignore this step . In the other case , be sure to select the correct path to the mental ray configuration file . <p> If you have n't selected any Mental Ray-compatible application , then this step is skipped by the installer .

This is not the case for other Mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With the current version of VUE , V-Ray for 3DS Max and Maya are supported . You must select the correct version of V-Ray during installation ( V-Ray 1.5 , 2 or 3 , depending on the Maya/3DS Max version ) . The VUE for V-Ray shader is automatically installed in your host application folder , along with the general plug-in . No user action is required to install VUE for V-Ray . <h> Supported Versions of the Host Applications <p> Only applications listed on our website , on the Requirements page of the VUE xStream product , will be able to load the integration plug-in .

For most applications , this is done automatically when the target application loads the plug-in . <p> You do n't need to add the VUE menu or toolbars if you wo n't be using VUE inside your application ( e.g. if you install a plug-in for an application that will be used only for network rendering ) . <h> 3DS Max <p> The plug-in is automatically loaded during 3DS Max startup . The VUE menu is added automatically by the plug-in . You can access the VUE menu in the 3DS Max menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Help menu entry . <p> Check that the plug-in is loaded by opening the Plugin Manager ( from the Customize main menu ) . There should be at least one entry for VUE : <p> Vue xStream.dlb is the main VUE file for 3DS Max plug-in , <p> Vue xStream.dlr is the VUE file for VRay plug-in . <p> To add the toolbar , use the Customize Customize User Interface menu command of 3DS Max to display the customization dialog . Then , select the Toolbars tab , and click on the Load button . Browse to the ui subfolder of the 3DS Max application and load the xStream.cui file . <p> The VUE for V-Ray plug-in is automatically loaded during startup . If V-Ray is the active renderer at the time you create or load a VUE scene , the 3DS Max integration plug-in will automatically setup everything for the V-Ray renderer . If V-Ray was not the active renderer , and you later want to render with it , you need to open the Rendering/Environment dialog in 3DS Max . Then , in the Atmosphere section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When this atmospheric effect is present ( either added automatically or manually with the step above ) , and you render with Mental Ray , you will get an error message telling you that this effect is not supported by the Mental Ray renderer . This error has no other consequences other than displaying this message , it wo n't affect the renderer in any way . If you want to get rid of this message , you can remove the atmospheric effect from the list whenever you switch to Mental Ray , and add it again if you revert to V-Ray . <p> Depending on the active renderer at the time of the VUE scene creation , the integration plug-in will also try to select corresponding shadow types for VUE proxy lights . This means that if Mental Ray is active , the lights will have ray traced shadows selected ; if V-Ray is active , they will have ' V-Ray raytraced shadows ' selected . So , if you load a VUE scene containing many lights , make sure you first select your preferred renderer in the 3DS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of manually editing each light to select the appropriate shadow type . <h> Cinema4D <p> The plug-in is automatically loaded during Cinema4D startup . The VUE menu is automatically created , and it 's located in the Main Menu bar . <p> You can load the VUE toolbars as Cinema4D Palettes using the Window Layout Load Palette menu of Cinema 4D . You will then have to browse to the **31;598;TOOLONG subfolder of your Cinema 4D application ( not in the user folder ) and select one of the palette files available . <p> You can also load the complete VUE layout using the Window Layout Load Layout menu of Cinema 4D . You will then have to browse to the **29;631;TOOLONG subfolder of your Cinema 4D application ( not in the user folder ) and select the xStream.l4d file there . Please note that this will replace the current layout . <h> LightWave <p> The plug-in is automatically loaded during LightWave startup if you have the AutoScan Plugin option enabled , if not you need to add the plugin manually . This option is under Preferences General , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this option on Layout is ON . <p> This menu needs to be added to the interface manually . This operation only needs to be performed once . <p> In the Menu Editor , click on Main Menu in the Menus list ( the list on the right ) . <p> Right click on Main Menu and select Import Branch . A browser will appear ; browse to the VUE application folder , open the **27;662;TOOLONG subfolder , and select the VuexStream2016G " Menus.cfg file . <p> This will add a VUE tab menu in the menus list . <p> Now you can drag and drop the VUE tab to place it where you want . You can , for instance , move it after the User Tab . <p> Due to limitations in the SDK of LightWave , there are no toolbars or icons available . <p> The current VUE is not compatible with LightWave 9.3 . <p> VUE xStream only <h> Problem with Menu Display - Incomplete Menus <p> If the previous version of xStream menus have been loaded in LightWave , you may not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Before adding the VUE new menu , you must remove the xStream menu from any previous version : In LightWave , open the Configure Menus dialog , using the command Edit Edit Menu Layout . <p> In the list of menus ( on the right ) , select VUE xStream and press the Delete button . Close LightWave and reopen it . Now you can add the VUE new version of the xStream menu . <p> Warning ! Even after removing the old menu with the LightWave interface ( see above ) , the VUE current menu can still be incomplete . The bug often happens in Vista/Windows 7 . It is certainly caused by a problem in the handling of menus by LightWave . <p> Where xxx depends on your version of LightWave and your system ( for example LW9-64.cfg ) . <p> 3 . Open LightWave again , and add the VUE menu again . <h> Maya <p> The plug-in is not automatically loaded during Maya startup ; in order to load the plug-in , open the plugin manager ( Window Settings/Preferences Plugin Manager ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load the plug-in . If you want the VUE plug-in to be loaded each time you start Maya , check the Auto load checkbox . <p> Once the plug-in is loaded , the VUE menu is automatically created . It can be found in the menu bar , at the left of the Help menu . If you have checked the Auto load option , the next time you start Maya , VUE will be accessible . <p> Note : <p> if you want to render with VUE and the Mental Ray renderer , you should ensure that the Mayatomr.mll plugin entry ( Maya to Mental Ray plug-in ) is also loaded ( and auto loaded ) in the Plugin Manager . If you load the Maya to Mental Ray plug-in after having created a VUE scene , the VUE shaders for Mental Ray may not have been successfully created ( resulting in a black render when choosing mental ray as the renderer ) . It is recommended to always load the Mental Ray plug-in during Maya startup . <p> In order to load the VUE toolbar shelf , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the VUE menu . <h> Softimage <p> The plug-in is automatically loaded during Softimage startup . The VUE menu is automatically added to the menu bar , between the Display and the Window menu entries . <p> If you want to check that the plug-in is correctly loaded inside Softimage , open the plug-in manager ( File Plug-in Manager ... ) . The VUE plug-in entry should be located in the Factory Root plugin tree . <p> You can access the VUE toolbars from the View Toolbars menu of Softimage.

He now works for INDG Amsterdam . <h> Discovering 3D <p> A Passion for CG <p> " I 've always been attracted to graphics , ever since I was 10 . Back then , when we only had some old Commodore computer , I had to write a couple of lines just to draw a circle : that was the beginning of my CG exploration . It is when I saw Jurassic Park that I was trully amazed by the CG potential .

That 's because , when I first tried it a long time ago , creating a logo in Vue was quite a challenge . Two years ago , a good friend of mine , Corneliu Ticu , showed me this ILM project with the Pirates of the Caribbean and I could n't believe my eyes ! " <p> " Vue turned out to be an amazing piece of software , a huge upgrade from what I knew about it , and I have to congratulate the team behind it for creating such a wonderful tool .

After all , it would be a terrible waste of space right ? " <p> " This personal project grew in my mind because I got a bit frustrated by the fact that most matte paintings are simply 2D static backgrounds and photo-based collages . <p> From there , my ambition was to create a full 3D matte painting with Vue . " <p> Project Implementation <p> " To start this project , I tested different terrains , ecosystems and atmospheres in Vue . The easiest and funniest part was playing with Vues amazing atmosphere editor , I spent 1 day just playing with it . But my favourite feature is the EcoSystem , its unbelievable how Vue can handle so many polygons ( the " Terranova " scene has over 20 million polygons ) . " <p> Early test render in Vue <p> " When I got satisfied with the atmosphere , I started paying more attention to the landscape shape and camera composition . I wanted to add a mothership structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vortex view , so I dropped that idea . The mothership would have helped the story but also would have made the image way too complicated , and I 'm fond of clean compositions . I also wanted to remove one of the cliffs to kill the picture symmetry , but in the end , I decided to keep it . " <p> " While Vue was rendering the frame , I started working on the ship in 3DS Max . The render took almost 15 hours at 4000 pixels wide and ultra settings . " <p> " I painted over the result in Photoshop , keeping the actual Vue shape for a future camera projection . The spaceship made in 3DS Max received some heavy paintovers in Photoshop too . " <h> Projection Mapping <p> " I was testing the export feature from Vue and I was surprised to see you can export terrains , lights , cameras ... nearly everything that can be used again later on for a camera projection in 3DS Max ! I tried to see if a mix between Vues features and 3DS Maxs projection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just render the first frame in Vue , paint over in Photoshop to enhance the rock textures , paint the sky and so on . Just leave the ecosystem as it is . " <p> " Then you just render the full animation in Vue , import the terrain , lights and camera in 3DS Max and use the camera projection technique with the first frame you already painted over . <p> At the end you just blend the two animations in any compositing software available . Unfortunately I did n't  get the time to finish it , but I did render the animation in Vue . " <h> Inspiration <p> " I get my inspiration from nature , photography and movies . But going out for a walk also helps sometimes . " <p> " I think the greatest challenge for an artist is to be a good critique of his work . Be ruthless when it comes to judge your work .

What sets Vue apart in my opinion is the combination of very advanced capabilities in a simple , easy to use package . " <p> Dave Burdick has been involved in the computer graphics field for about 25 years , as a consultant to users and vendors in the engineering and technical graphics applications area . He created SkinVue in a desire to achieve something closer to photo-realism for 3D human character type renders . <h> SkinVue History <p> From Photo Manipulation To 3D <p> " When I met my new wife Victoria ( who is an actress and model ) in 1999 , she convinced me to try and develop some cool , artistic images based on photos of her " , recalls Dave . " As a geeky engineer with absolutely no artistic talent , I thought this was a rather crazy idea . But I began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something that resembled art , first in 2D using programs like Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro and then in 3D , using Poser and Vue . Initially , I started with Poser which is great for creating , posing and animating characters , but it has a number of shortcomings in the rendering area . Also , I was looking to combine 3D character rendering with a 3D landscape tool which led me to Vue . I became aware of Vue in 2004 when my son showed me some images created with it . I began using Vue 4 Pro in 2004 . " <p> The Beginning of SkinVue <p> " I started SkinVue about a year ago right after Vue 5 Infinite was introduced . With the new rendering engine and the new function editor , I became convinced that Vue 5 could become a superb platform for photo-real , 3D character rendering . I developed the script because I wanted to completely automate the process of creating great looking skin without any manual intervention . With SkinVue1 , the process was only semi-automated and required the user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original texture maps . With SkinVue2 , this is now completely automated with the new VuePython enhancements . " <p> The Challenge <p> " SkinVue was my first Python Script , but I had done a lot of programming before , so it was relatively easy to pickup . I gave myself a " crash course " in Python and then I eventually had to learn wxPython to build the SkinVue2 user interface . Python is very " C " like in many respects , so it took me only about a week or so to learn what I needed to know . " <p> " The hardest thing to create in SkinVue was the skin specularity model . I must have tried about 100 different ways to do speculars until I finally came up with a model that produced good results on a consistent basis . The model used in SkinVue2 is actually a hybrid of the popular Blinn model and a new approach I came up with called variable wavelength speculars which provides a bit more control on the intensity , location and realism of specular highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could develop plugins which would allow SkinVue to adapt to many different types of 3D character models without having to change the main application . " <p> Goals For The Future <p> " The reaction from users has been extremely positive . I would say that about 30% of the Vue character-based renders you see on the major art sites use SkinVue . The only downside is the lack of a Mac version of SkinVue2 which probably will not happen until Vue 6 . " " I 'm currently working on a way to simulate wet looking skin complete with water droplets and drips using a much generalized procedural method that will be added into SkinVue2 as a new Skin Type . My next major goal is to come up with a way to create and render human hair and animal fur . I 've played with the idea of using EcoSystems to generate hair along with particle systems , but I 'm still a long way from a workable , generalized solution . " <p> The Vue Advantage <p> " One of the greatest things about Vue is its ease of use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , but its just lip service . Anyone can easily learn Vue in a couple of hours and start creating very cool art . My sense is that e-ons approach to designing Vue is really from the " outside-in " rather than the " inside-out " . I 've used dozens of different 3D packages , and most of them feel and behave like 20 year old computer science technology . What sets Vue apart in my opinion is the combination of very advanced capabilities in a simple , easy to use package . " <p> " I built a website www.SkinVue.net which contains a number of Vue-oriented tutorials that users may find interesting in the areas of function editor tricks , rendering , lighting and of course how to make better looking skin ! SkinVue 2 is available on the Cornucopia 3D store www.cornucopia3d.com " <h> Biography <p> " Most of my professional career was spent in Silicon Valley , California but I now live in the Reno/Lake Tahoe area of Nevada where the air is cleaner and the taxes are lower . Im married to a wonderful woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration for all of my artistic endeavors . I have two sons who are attending college and one of them is about to make me a grandfather in 6 months ! I started in 3D in the late 1970s as a design engineer on a 3D CAD system called Anvil running on an old DEC PDP system ( from the famous Dr Hanratty ) . I fell in love with the idea of doing engineering and graphics on the computer versus the drafting board , so I left the engineering world and joined the computer graphics world in the early 1980s .

Joachim studied Cinema at Sorbonne Nouvelle in Paris and started to work as an Editor in 2002 . Corentin studied Visual Arts . <h> About the Artists <p> Joachim and Corentin <p> E-on : Tell us a little about yourself ? <p> Joachim Mazeau : After my cinema studies in Paris at Sorbonne Nouvelle , I began as an Editor in 2002 . Quickly I felt the need of creating my own images , so I naturally became Director/Motion Designer . In 2008 I founded Winship , a small creative post-production studio in Paris . Our main obsession here is to create moving images , whatever the technique ( shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way possible to create emotions . <p> Corentin Seguin de Broin : I am passionate for anything visual . The type that 's always doodling anywhere instead of listening to the teachers , always watching around me , how light travel everywhere and so on . I had the luck to pursue studies in Visual Arts , where I could draw AND listen to teachers , great ! I did many different jobs in that field : Illustrator , Graphic Design , Illustrated Books/Publishing Layout Artist , Fashion Magazine Layout Artist , Magazine Art Direction , Comic Strip/Cartoonist , Musical Video Clip and so on , moving to scenography and architecture visualization to finally work full-time in 3D animation , mostly broadcast work . <p> How did you get into 3D ? <p> JM : : About 7 years ago I wanted to create an abstract city for a broadcast-design project , the identity of a French music channel ( M6 Music ) . 3D was the best way to do it , so I started to learn Cinema 4D . That was the time when I met Corentin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> CSDB : With my mother being a Paleontologist and my father being a computer engineer , I quickly tried to reproduce nature with computers in a visual way . Back in 1995 , after my studies , 3D software was still pretty basic compared to what we have nowadays in the market , and really powerful computers were way too expensive for a young artist , so for an amateur and hobbyist in 3D with average/low hardware , the easiest way to do things was pretty blocky/simplistic . Around 2002 , my first professional 3D work was for a comic book , a crazy Science Fiction project . Lot of hard work , but I learned a lot while working on it . After that I slowly started to do magazine illustrations in 3D rather than in 2D , started to sell more and more 3D images , until I finally could support myself only with 3D . <h> Nespresso Onirio Project <h> Technical Aspects <p> Tell us a bit about your project ! <h> The Brief <p> JM : The base of this project is that Nespresso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onirio to be shown in all their magazines worldwide in 25 countries . They had already done the communication elements . The idea was to express the sensorial experience provided by this coffee in a global concept . It was about focusing on the taste of Onirio that reveals flower notes , that 's why there 's an omnipresence of petals . In January 2011 , the production Chez Louis contacted me to get in the competition . For the competition , they wanted a 2-minute film that would respect totally the identity of this communication , and that would necessarily show the 3 characters of the print elements . <p> So when I began to think about a story , I immediately thought that the film should bring the Onirio 's taste experience to life , as if we were showing this imaginary journey . We would follow the petals flow to discover a dreamlike world in which we would meet the three different characters . I quickly realized that this little trip would essentially create more interest if the landscapes surrounding us were stunning ! So I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole proposal ( storyboard , references , styleframes ) for about 6 days . We won the competition and then the 3D production started at the end of February for a delivery mid April , so the project took about 1 1/2 months to complete . Globally , all the landscapes ( mountains ) and clouds have been done in Vue . All the detailed elements ( growing flowers , capsules etc. ) were modeled , animated and rendered in Cinema 4D . <h> Storyboard <p> This storyboard was part of the proposal we prepared for Nespresso . It 's a really rough storyboard I prepared myself to explain the film the best I can . I would have loved to prepare a more attractive and detailed one with a real storyboard , but we ran out of time <h> Pre-Production <p> Corentin made these images which are pure Vue renders . They have n't been shown to the client because they were only our studio 's research . They had a double function , artistic and technical : on one side , I gave Corentin references to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mountains as Huangshan , and on the other hand it was a perfect way to get familiar with Vue . The Chinese inspiration has finally been abandoned , because it was n't neutral enough for the client , but it still has been a good training ! <h> Styleframes <p> These are the very first rendered images we showed to the client . His principal worry was to be sure we would reproduce the color codes of the communication visuals perfectly . It was n't perfect yet , but he began to be confident . <h> About Vue <p> When did you first start using Vue , and which version was it ? <p> JM : I had a quick look on the demo version of Vue 6.5 in 2005 . It was enough to give me an idea on the potential of the software , but I did n't have the opportunity to work on a project that would need it . And this year , when I began the pre-production of Nespresso with Corentin , it seemed to us like the tool we needed . So again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested it for a few days , and then bought it ! <p> CSDB : I had abandoned a couple of products to concentrate on the use of Cinema 4D , even though I always surveyed many other 3D packages on the Internet . When Joachim showed me what was going on with Vue 6.5 , I thought that was the perfect time for me to jump back into natural landscaping , plus the xStream concept allowed me continue working with Cinema 4D . Quickly after testing Vue 6.5 I felt in love with it . But just like Jo , did n't get opportunity to really work with it professionally until this project ! <p> Why did you prefer Vue over another similar product ? <p> CSDB : For me it 's a great thing to have a general 3D package in one hand , which I 'm used to , and a really **25;691;TOOLONG dedicated program in the other hand . I love the philosophy . I guess it allows more power for big scenes and less time consuming in post production " cheating " . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are forced too , but we would most likely use full virtual environment if we could , do n't you think so ? The integration of Vue xStream is such a great concept , it 's the closest to this idea . I do n't know about another package that does it so well , and since I feel comfortable with Vue <p> Do you have any tips and tricks to share with the Vue users community ? <p> JM : If you 're working in full 3D animation , the background of some shots can take a while to render . It is sometimes interesting to calculate only 1 frame to use as a matte painting technique for the very background , to keep some rendering time for more elements close to camera ... Moreover , it 's a good way to avoid background flickering . <h> About Winship <p> Winship is a Paris based studio founded in 2008 by director/motion-designer Joachim Mazeau .

This panel displays a detailed view of the output of the currently selected node along 3 axes . This is a toggle icon . If you close the Function Graph with this panel open , it will automatically open next time you open the Function Graph . Please turn here for details on the Function Node Preview panel . <p> Function Output Observer : click this icon to open ( or close ) the Function Output Observer panel . This panel displays a contextual preview of the function 's output . If you are editing a material function , a preview of the material will be displayed . If you are editing the altitude function of a procedural terrain , it will display a terrain . This is a toggle icon . If you close the Function Graph with this panel open , it will automatically open next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for details on the Function Output Observer panel . <h> Nodes Toolbar <p> The nodes toolbar is the vertical toolbar on the left of the Function Graph . The nodes toolbar is used to add or replace nodes in the function graph . In order to make the creation of elaborate functions an easier process , the icons in the nodes toolbar will either add new nodes , or replace existing nodes , depending on the context . This unique e-on software technology , inspired by artificial intelligence systems , is known as SmartGraph . <p> Here is the description of the different icons in the Nodes icon bar : <p> Input Node : click this icon to create a new input node . The Input nodes appear in a column on the left in the graph area . <p> When editing an Object Graph , the list of available input nodes depends on the type of object being edited . Most objects will have a Position , Size and Orientation input node , but other properties may also be available as inputs ( e.g. Light Color when editing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recall Dependency nodes that will let you import values from other graphs . <p> When editing material functions , the list of additional input nodes that can be added to your function graph is as follows ( depending on context , some of these input nodes may not be present , or may not generate intelligent values " for instance , when editing the altitude function of a procedural terrain , the ' Incident Light Angle ' input will always return 0 ) . <p> Position Options : this is an advanced version of the position node above that let 's you select the coordinate system in which the position vector is expressed . This input node displays a drop-down list that let 's you select the coordinate system for this instance of the node ( you can create several ' Position Options ' nodes with different coordinate systems ) . The different coordinate systems are the same as the coordinate systems available in the Material Editor'sMapping list . You can specify the Distance unit in VUE units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version of the Normal ' node described above . This input node let 's you define the coordinate system in which the normal vector is to be expressed . The node displays a drop-down list that let 's you select the coordinate system for this instance of the node ( you can create several ' Normal Options ' nodes with different coordinate systems ) . If you select the Object option , the normal vector is expressed in object coordinates , and hence is independent on the orientation of the object . On the other hand , if you select the World option , the normal vector will be modified by the orientation of the object . <p> UV Coordinates : this input node returns the texture coordinates of the current point , according to the selected texture mapping mode . It is created automatically when you create a Texture Map node . This node is typically used to drive the mapping of a texture . Please see the options of the UV Coordinates node for further details . <p> Time : this input node returns the current time in seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time-dependent node ( such as the Open Ocean node in the Fractal category ) , a connection to this input node will automatically be created . <p> Angle of Incidence : this input node returns the angle of incidence between the incoming ray ( the ray coming from the camera , the reflected ray coming from a reflective surface , etc ) and the surface of the object . If the surface of the object is exactly facing the ray ( the incoming ray is perpendicular to the object surface ) , the input node returns a value of 1 . At low incidence angles ( when the ray is tangent to the surface ) , the return value is 0 . If the ray hits the surface from the inside , the return value will be negative . <p> Ray Direction World : this input node returns a vector that indicates the direction of the incoming ray expressed in world coordinates . <p> Ray Direction Object : this is the same as the Ray Direction World input described above , except that the incoming ray direction vector is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useful if you want to create a function that depends on the direction of the incoming ray , but is not affected by the orientation of the supporting object . <p> Position On Picture : this input node returns a vector representing the position of the point in the final picture . The X and Y components of this vector respectively indicate the horizontal and vertical position of the point in the picture , where -1 is the left/top edge and +1 is the right/bottom edge of the picture . The Z component of the vector is always 0 . <p> Distance to Camera : this input node returns the distance between the point where the function is being evaluated and the camera , whatever the ray recursion depth . The distance to the camera is at most equal to the actual distance traveled along the ray . You can specify the Distance unit in VUE units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance on Ray : this input node returns the total distance traveled by the ray from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the point where the function is being evaluated was hit by a reflected ray , the distance on ray would include the distance traveled by the reflected ray plus the distance traveled from the ray 's origin to the point where it was reflected . You can specify the Distance unit in VUE units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance to Object Center : this input node returns the distance between the point where the function is being evaluated and the actual center of the object that was hit by the ray . This would yield a constant value on a sphere , since , by definition , all points of the sphere 's surface are at the same distance from the sphere 's center . This is however not true for other geometries , and can also be useful when evaluating volumetric materials . You can specify the Distance unit in VUE units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance to Object Below : this input node traces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluated and returns the distance to the first object encountered . This could be useful for instance to evaluate the depth of an ocean and create foam ( or waves ) near the shore . Warning : because this input requires the actual tracing of a ray , it is very slow to process . You can specify the Distance unit in VUE units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Distance to Surface : this input node returns the distance to the surface of the object . It is only defined for primitives and Metablob objects and is only really useful when computing volumetric effects ( because it returns the distance to the surface , this input node will always return 0 when evaluating a standard material ) . You can specify the Distance unit in VUE units , Display units or any other unit available in a drop-list for selection . <p> Object Center : this input node returns the coordinates of the center of the object that was hit by the ray . Obviously , this value is constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be particularly useful to switch textures in an EcoSystem population ( see the tutorial on Varying Materials on EcoSystem Populations for an example use ) . <p> Incident Light Angle : this input node returns the angle of incidence between incoming light rays and the surface of the object . If the light hits the object 's surface perpendicularly , the value returned by the input node is 1 . If the light hits the object 's surface at a very low angle of incidence , the value will be close to 0 . This is useful e.g. if you want to create a custom BRDF ( Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function ) for your materials . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . This input is only valid when evaluating the specular contribution . <p> Specular Light Angle : this input node returns the dot product between the direction of incident light and the direction of reflection of the viewing ray . This is useful for create custom specular reflection effects . Obviously , the value returned by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Light Direction : this input node returns the direction of the incoming light expressed in world coordinates . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . <p> Light Color : this input node returns the color and intensity of the incoming light . Obviously , the value returned by this input node is usually different for each light source . <p> Reflected Direction : this input node returns the direction of reflection of the viewing ray , expressed in world coordinates . <p> Anisotropic Direction : this input node returns the direction of the scratches ' used to compute anisotropic reflections , expressed in world coordinates . <p> Transformed Z Vector : this input node returns the direction of the upwards vector transformed by the object 's transformation matrix , expressed in world coordinates . This basically tells you which direction is up ' on an object , taking into account the rotation of the object . <p> Note : <p> The resulting vector is not necessarily of length 1 . <p> Transformed Left Vector : this input node returns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's transformation matrix , expressed in world coordinates . This basically tells you which direction is up ' on an object , taking into account the rotation of the object . Please note that the resulting vector is not necessarily of length 1 . This , together with the ' Transformed Z Vector ' provides all information about the object 's transformation matrix . <p> Sea level : this input node returns the value of the current sea level . The value is set either in the Options panel , Units &amp; Coordinates tab , or by moving the sea level directly in your scene . <p> Object specfic ( formerly known as Impact specific data ) : This function is used when building materials for VUE rocks using local convexity information . It provides a measure , at any given point of the rock , of how much the rock is protruding at that point ( or caving in ) . This information allows realistic customization of the rock material , taking into consideration that convex areas of a rock are more exposed to interaction with the environment ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect will therefore evolve very differently . There is one parameter , a scalar in 0 ; 1 - Account for larger features . This controls whether the convexity information returned should focus on small scale details or on larger scale features . In other words , with a value of 0.0 , the node will return the local convexity at a small scale which helps identify small pointy ' bits on the rock . On the other hand , with a value of 1.0 , the node will give information on the overall shape of the rock . When this node is called on something which is not a rock , the default value of 0 is returned . <p> The following input nodes are all EcoParticle system related . Functions related to collisions can be used for any object material , whereas other nodes can only be used for EcoParticle material . <p> Particles Collision Density : this is a way to get data from the collision grid . You can either get a collision count or an energy clamped to a maximum . You have to select @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Atmospheric Particle Collision Density : this is the same as Particle Collision Density , except it is for rain and snow . <p> Particle Speed ( m.s " 1 ) : the velocity of the EcoParticle in meter per second . <p> Particle Mass ( kg ) : weight of the EcoParticle <p> Particle Adhesion Coeff 0 ; 1 : how the EcoParticle will stick when it slides on a surface . <p> Particle elasticity 0 ; 1 : how the EcoParticle will bounce when it collides . <p> Particle Age ( s ) : how long the EcoParticle has lived . <p> Particle Last Collision Time ( s ) : Particle Collision Count 0 ; GP <p> how much the EcoParticle has collided. : Particle Radius at Birth ( m ) <p> the size of the EcoParticle at birth in meters : Particle Last Collision Normal <p> it is used to quantify the drag or resistance of an object in a fluid environment such as air or water . A lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have more aerodynamic or less drag . The drag coefficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Birth Time ( s ) <p> when the EcoParticle was born in seconds . Time here is the same as in the Timeline. : Particle Death Time ( s ) <p> the age of the EcoParticle when it will die . Time here is the same as in the Timeline. : Particle Life Duration ( s ) <p> this is only useful for a child EcoParticle ( emitted from another EcoParticle ) . It will be the normalized rank of the emission . For example a mother EcoParticle will emit 3 child EcoParticles . The first child will have 0 in this node ( 0/3 ) , the second 0.33333 ... ( 1/3 ) , and the third will have 0.66666 ... ( 2/3 ) . : Particle Count <p> the total EcoParticle count of the EcoParticle system in which the EcoParticle exists. : <p> Output Node : click this icon to create a new output node . The Output nodes appear in a column on the right in the graph area . The choice of possible output nodes depends on what the function is being used for . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altitudes of a procedural terrain , this will be the only output node . But if the function is used for a material , you can create new outputs for other material parameters . If the function is used as an Object Graph , there will be output nodes for all of the object 's properties . Also , the Custom Dependency node let 's you output any kind of data for retrieval in another graph . <p> Noise Node : click this icon to create a noise node . A noise node outputs a number between -1 and 1 . If a fractal node is selected , it will be converted to a noise node of the same base noise as the fractal . See the different types of noise nodes for details . <p> Fractal Node : click this icon to create a fractal node . A fractal node is based on a noise that is repeated at several different frequencies in order to create much more elaborate patterns as the standard noise node . Fractal nodes create patterns that exhibit details over a large range of frequencies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clicking this icon , it will be replaced by a Simple Fractal node based on the same noise as the noise node . Please see the different types of fractal nodes for further details . <p> Color Node : click this icon to create a color node . Depending on the context , color nodes either output a color based on the value of a number , or converts a color into another color . If a node is selected at the time of clicking this icon , again depending on context , a color node of the appropriate type will usually be added behind the selected node . Please see the different types of color nodes for further details . <p> Texture Map Node : click this icon to create a texture map node . Texture map nodes are used to map pictures ( texture maps ) onto objects . The texture map node is also created together with a Projection input node . The projection input node converts the current position into mapping coordinates used by the texture map node to map the texture . Please see texture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click this icon to create a filter node . Filter nodes take a signal as input and output another signal . Clicking repeatedly on the Filter node icon will add as many filter nodes . Please see the different types of filter nodes for further details . <p> Constant Node : clicking on this icon will create a constant node . If another node was selected at the time of clicking , the selected node will be replaced by a constant node of the appropriate type . Please see different types of constant nodes for further details . <p> Turbulence Node : clicking on this icon will create a turbulence node . Turbulence nodes take a vector as input , and return a vector . They are usually plugged into the Origin noise parameter , as this is where they will behave as actual turbulence . Please see the different types of turbulence nodes for further details . <p> Combiner Node : click this icon to create a combiner node . Combiner nodes are used to combine together different values . Most of them work on all types of data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one provided in input . Please see the different types of combiner nodes for further details . <p> Math Node : click this icon to create a math node . Math nodes are used to perform all sorts of operations and conversions between different data types . Please see the different types of math nodes for further details . <p> Dynamics Node : click this icon to create a dynamics node . Dynamics nodes are mostly used to create dynamic connections between object properties . Please see the different types of dynamics nodes for further details . <p> Load MetaNode : click this icon to load a MetaNode from disk . A Standard File Browser will appear , letting you select the MetaNode you want to load . You can also create MetaNodes of a specific type using the popup menu . Please see the MetaNodes for details . <h> Function Graph <p> The function graph is the large area that sits in the middle of the Function Graph dialog . It is used to assemble the different nodes and links that will constitute the function . <p> You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoom icons ( and ) , or by dragging the mouse up/down with the Control key pressed . There are limits to the amount of zooming in and out that you can do . <p> You can move the graph around by pressing space and dragging it , by dragging the graph with the right mouse button pressed , or using the scrollbars . <h> Node Selection <p> You can select nodes or links by clicking on them . Selected nodes appear with a red frame , while selected links appear bold . If you want to select multiple nodes , click on all the nodes you want to select with the Shift key pressed , or drag a marquee rectangle around the area that you want to select ( all nodes in that rectangle will be selected ) . <p> You can also select an empty spot on the graph by clicking on it . A red square will appear around the selected area ( clicking one of the node icons will place a node in that square ) . <p> In order to facilitate the understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a node is selected , all the other nodes that are connected to it will appear with a drop-shadow . <p> Also , if the function has more than one output , the Master output together with all connected nodes will be displayed in solid text , whereas other nodes will appear in pale color . <h> Adding/Replacing Nodes <p> There are three ways of adding/replacing nodes : <p> Click on an empty area of the graph ; this will select a square in the graph . Click on one of the node icons , or pick the desired node from the popup menu . The new node will be placed at the selected location . <p> Select a node and click on one of the node icons . Depending on which type of node was selected , and which icon was pressed , the selected node will either be replaced with a node of the new type , or a new node will be added beneath the selected node ( e.g. pressing Fractal when a noise node is selected will replace the noise node by a fractal node of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ node is selected will connect a filter node on the noise output ) . If the selected node was already connected to another node , SmartGraph ( see here ) will attempt to insert a node of a compatible type from the desired category . If no such node can be found , a message will appear asking you if you want to break the connection . <p> Select a link and click on one of the node icons or pick a node from the popup menu . The new node will be inserted in the link ( the output of the first node will be connected to the entry of the new node , and the output of the new node will be connected to the second node on the link ) . If the node you are creating can not be inserted in the link , nothing will happen . If you picked a node from the menu , the node will be created anyway " but it wo n't be placed on the link . <p> To delete a node , simply select it and press the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open link . <h> Connecting Nodes <p> When you move the mouse on top of a link , a little round handle will appear at each end of the link . Grab one end of the link by clicking on the appropriate handle , and drag it onto another node . As soon as you begin dragging an end of the link , all compatible nodes will be marked by a little circle . Drop the link on one of the compatible nodes , and the new connection will be established automatically . To cancel the operation , simply drop the handle on an empty part of the graph . <p> Under certain conditions , a small cross may appear at the center of the little round handles . This is a hint to help identify connections that are probably not appropriate in the current context . You may however still establish the link if you are sure that the connection is pertinent ( a warning will appear when you establish such a connection ) . <p> To delete a link altogether , select the link and press Delete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its handles ) , and drop it outside of the graph . <p> Note : <p> It is possible to change the color display of every node in the Function Graph to improve visibility of the graph . When a node is selected , under the preview of the node there is a color box . Click on that to select a display color for that node . <h> Published Parameters <p> The Published Parameters feature copies specific settings from the Function Graph that you may need to change often and places them in a more convenient location for easier access . If you have accessed the Function Graph from the Terrain Editor , the selected parameters will appear on a special tab in the Terrain Editor . If you accessed the Function Graph from the Materials Editor , a special tab will appear in the Advanced Material Editor . <p> To select a parameter for publishing , just click the underlined field name of the parameter . A parameter name is supplied and a group name is asked to improve the display of the published parameter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of the Function Graph that sits below the function graph . As its name indicates , this area displays details on the currently selected node or link . <h> Node Details <p> When a node is selected , the category of the noise appears as the title of the details area . Alongside this title , one or several drop-down list boxes will let you change the type of node in that category ( e.g. when a Noise node is selected , two drop-down list boxes let you select the noise type used in that node ) . <p> To the right end of the details area title , you will see a pair of buttons that let you browse to the previous and next nodes . <p> A preview of the node 's output is displayed on the left end of the node details area , below the title . Check or uncheck the Show in graph option below the preview in order to adjust the size of the node preview in the function graph ( if the option is checked , the node will appear large ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodes using the Title and Description fields . This is useful when designing complex shaders that should be used by other parties . If no title is provided for the node , the name of the node is used instead ( or the value of the constant for constant nodes ) . The description will appear as a tooltip when you float the mouse cursor over the node in the graph . <p> If the selected node has options , these options will appear to the right of the node preview . The nature and type of these options depends on each node , and will be discussed further down . <h> Extracting Constant Values <p> If the selected node has options , some of these options exhibit an Extract parameter button ( ) . If you click this button , the node parameter will be extracted : a new constant node will be created and this node will be connected to the right hand side of the initial node ( parameter connection ) . When you extract a parameter , the extracted parameter node is automatically selected . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the same as that of the parameter before it was extracted . At this point , the output of the node is not affected by this extraction . But now that the parameter is extracted , you may replace it with any type of node ( e.g. a noise node ! ) . <p> If you go back to the initial node , you will notice that the Extract parameter button ( ) has been replaced by the Disconnect parameter button ( ) , and instead of displaying input controls , an indication that the node is connected ' appears . If you click the disconnect parameter button , or if you destroy the parameter 's link , the parameter will be reintegrated into the node and restored to its initial constant value . <p> The underlying power of this simple feature is truly amazing ! For instance , most noise nodes have an origin ( which is the origin of the noise wave ) . If you extract this origin , and then click the Turbulence node icon ( ) , the origin will be replaced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale parameter of a noise node to the slope input , the scale of the noise will vary automatically according to slope ! Please turn here for a few simple examples of how to use this feature . <p> Note : <p> if you clicked the Show parameter connections icon ( ) , small links appear to the right of the node on the graph . Each one of these links corresponds to a parameter . You can extract a parameter directly by grabbing the corresponding handle and connecting it to another node . <h> Link Details <p> When a link is selected , a preview of the two nodes that are connected by the link is displayed in the Link Details area , together with two small arrows that let you go to either one of the nodes . Click the left arrow button ( ) to go to the upper node , and click the right arrow ( ) to go to the lower node . <h> Multi-edition of nodes <p> If you select several nodes , parameters of the first selected node will be displayed . Edit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all selected node ( if selected node has the same parameter ) .

" <p> The project " Facing the Horizon " is a business project created for **25;718;TOOLONG di Leone Bottai . It took one week to complete this project . <h> About the Artist <p> Mattia Sullini is a 30 year old Italian freelancer , living in Florence . He has been working with Vue starting from version 6 and refers to himself as being an amateur . <p> Mattia has been working for Archviz for about seven years . Soon he discovered that he prefers working for projects of other architects rather than being an architect himself . He got into 3D during the first years of his architecture degree . Due to the fact that he has always been quite enterprising , he never attempted any real 3D course . He has assimilated his skills through trial and error . This made him experiment with several 3D applications , before he chose his favourite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Vue and Maxwell . <p> " I am always trying to provide something more , something better , something newer than what has already been seen . I believe quality can be provided even for smaller tasks , when you have the right tools . Vue definitely is one of these tools . " <h> About the Project " Facing the Horizon " <p> " My project had to be approved under the environmental impact . Literally , there would have been no other way than using Vue to achieve such a photorealistic compositing . Well , I could have used my traditional applications with billion of 3D trees looking almost identical to each another . I would have found an hdr to simulate the environment ... but for such a small project , this would have exceeded time and costs for my client .

" <h> Background <p> Having decided which views are the best to describe this project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on site to take some pictures . He used these pictures to composite the panoramic views , paying attention to the plans of the point he was shooting from for a trustable camera positioning in the virtual model . The starting point for this project were his 2D . dwg files and the topographic survey of the site . <h> Creation <p> Mattia created a rough mesh of the terrain from Archicad following the curve level of the survey . He did n't model yet the changes shown on the original plans , because he found it would have been almost impossible to project the terrain movements correctly on such a complex site in 2D . So he exported the mesh and used it as a background to recreate it in Modo .

@@74102395 @2802395/ <p> With VUE Studio 2016 , we 're introducing a brand new terrain modeling technology , more flexible and a lot more powerful , called " Heightfield Terrains " . <p> This new technology allows you to add terrain effects that were previously impossible to achieve , such as Hydrological &amp; Thermal Simulations ! <p> Similar to procedural terrains , Heightfield Terrains are based on a function graph , but baked on a fixed-resolution grid . This will give you more flexibility and add more realism to your terrains . Heightfield Terrains are also significantly faster to render ! <p> Heighfield terrains are manually sculptable and parameters can be animated - e.g. to simulate a terrain erosion over time for instance ! <p> And finally , you can easily set up your graph outputs to drive your material presence , directly from within the Terrain Editor interface . <p> The Heightfield Terrains technology comes with its set of new dedicated nodes and presets , like 9 different Erosion presets and Slope , Convexity , Blur or Terrace nodes . <h> Hybrid GPU/CPU Interactive Path Tracer <p> GPU rendering comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renderer naturally and automatically simulates real-life lighting , and automatically calculates many effects that have to be specifically set with other methods , such as depth of field , caustics , ambient occlusion , and indirect lighting . <p> Path tracing in VUE Studio 2016 is available as an interactive rendering quality in the viewports , as well as an offline rendering engine . <h> EcoSystem Improvements <p> Easily and quickly add more realism to your scenes.Improve your productivity at the same time ! <h> PlantFactory Preset Variations <p> PlantFactory 2015 introduced the concept of Presets . PlantFactory 2016 now introduces the concept of Preset Variations . <p> Preset Variations allow you to immediately include subtle differences to your plant ( change the number of buds on a blooming flower , or its petal colors for instance ) . <p> This new feature allows you to easily add variety to create realistic environments with one single plant species ! <p> Within VUE Studio 2016 , you directly get access to the PlantFactory species presets and variations within the Plant Browser , the Plant Editor and within your EcoSystem population list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at every step of your scene creation process , you are able to select the species you want , the preset you want and the variations you want ! <h> Multiple Global EcoSystems and EcoPainter Improvements <p> VUE Studio 2016 now allows you to populate your scenes with multiple Global EcoSystems layers ( i.e. not linked to any underlying material ) . You can save your Global EcoSystem populations as EcoPainter brushes , and re-use them at any time , in any scene ! <p> VUE Studio 2016 ships with 12 EcoPainter brushes to get you started . Populations in your EcoSystem brushes can also be used in any standard EcoSystem material ! <p> VUE Studio 2016 includes 20 EcoPainter effector brushes , including a new Rotate effector to dynamically alter the placement of your EcoSystem populations . <h> Memory Saving Technologies <p> You can now optimize memory consumption by using baked ( static or dynamic ) versions of PlantFactory species for your EcoSystem populations , or by converting any referenced assets in your scenes to EcoSystem Instances ( requires the EcoPainter module ) .

First , I was required to convey the mood , color palette , and lighting according to the design prototype concept by the Studio Art Director . When you work according to a well-defined concept , you are bound by the constant reference to how the final elements of each scene should appear . Second , this was a scene with night lighting , and with both natural and additional light sources . This kind of a lighting scheme is significantly more complex than the usual daylight design , with a single natural light source . In addition , though it was a fairy tale , we researched what species of plants grow near bodies of water , so that the scene looked authentic . <p> Pushkin - Matte Painting by Olga Antonenko <p> For this scene we needed a pond surrounded by rocks , so I modelled the main terrain as well as complex elements - trees and stones - in Zbrush .

Malevich we also prepared nature building blocks to use as EcoSystems in VUE , such as twisted leaves , long branches , grass .

I love the idea that every plant is unique ! " <p> Daniel Dugour has had a professional art education at the Utrecht School of Arts , with a BA in Image and Media Technology . He lives and works in Amsterdam since 1995 . For the last ten years he has worked in his home office , under the name Anitime . Daniel told us the story of his " Escher ride " project , a story that started back in 1998 and ended ( happily ) in 2005 . <h> The Old Ride <p> " The Escher ride , or Escher Revisited in VR Valley , was originally made for an exhibition at the Rotterdam museum " De Kunsthal " , in 1998 . Back then it was a huge succes , and I am always surprised at how many people have seen it and liked it back then . " <p> " I have never been completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( not done with Vue ) were not to my liking at all . Landscape rendering was in its infancy in those days , and there had n't been enough time to get to know the software or find other software that gave better results . " <p> The Vue Revelation <p> " In july 2001 , I had a question from a client about some massive landscape rendering , and was looking around for better software than what I used for Escher in 1998 . So I bought Vue d'Esprit ! The first real use was with the new Escher ride , and for that I upgraded to Vue Professional . I was too early for Vue 5 , I 'm sorry to say , as the new features look really good and would have helped me a lot in gaining an even higher image quality . " <p> " Over the next 7 years I have been pestering the producer Wennekes Multimedia ( **26;745;TOOLONG ) for a remake , but there was never any budget . At the end of 2004 Minimundus in Germany ( **26;773;TOOLONG ) gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaited complete remake of the ride . " <h> The New Ride <p> " Originally , the buildings were the hardest to bend my mind around . Since Eschers work is mainly based on the impossibilities that can follow from a 3D interpretation of a 2D drawing , making that same 2D drawing into a 3D object was very hard . Since I already knew what to do , recreating the buildings for the remake was the easy part . " <p> " Escher worked mostly in black and white . I seem to be particularly fond of bright , fresh colors , I notice . And that 's what I used a lot . In this case I wanted the look and feel of a romantic landscape , with dramatic rocks and full trees . The lighting had to symbolise the passing of a day , with morning light , mid day , and early evening . " <p> Synchronisation With Lightwave <p> " Since I wanted to render the Escher buildings in Lightwave , I had to composite hem all into Vue landscapes after rendering . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lightwave2 . Make the landscape in Vue3 . Import the model in Vue , check and adjust the placement in Lightwave and re-import until it has te right position in Vue . This sounds more complicated than it is.4 . Export the landscape from Vue to LW.5 . Import the landscape model , cut off extraneous bits , and use as a matte object ( black with black alpha ) while rendering your model sequence.6 . Use the LW-model in Vue as an invisible object that does cast shadows . " <p> " If you have landscape or plants passing on front of your model , you will need alpha 's for them . Using a white LW-object in a black landscape ( or vice versa ) does n't work properly , because there is a slight difference in outline between the rendered object in Vue and LW . In stead make the landscape black , except for the parts that you would like to pass in front of your LW-rendered object . Render the sequence , and use as alpha for the foreground layer . The compositing was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial incarnation ( 1998 ) was about three months of full-on work , with two people . Next another six weeks of rendering ( no renderfarm ) . It was a tight schedule , so the concept was pretty basic : three landscapes with three buildings , and a start and end sequence that made the ride a loop . The rest was up to me . " <p> Turn around Escher 's WaterVal <p> " This time ( 2005 ) I had slightly more time , but I was working alone . Juggling two projects for the same producer , I had to divide my time between Escher and the other project . That meant working triple shifts , and getting a couple of hours ( usually 4 ) in between . After four months of this ( with two renderfarms this time ) , both were finished . It sounds crazy , and it was . Nobody required me to put this much effort in , but after seven years of hoping for a remake , I was bound to make it as good as I could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original ride from 1998 . The remake is based on the original , and was finished in April 2005 . " <h> History <p> " Back in 1984 , when I was fourteen , I was visiting an exhibition in the Paris Centre Pompidou . The featured 3D animation was the first I had ever seen that was made for fun , and not as a scientific visualisation . I realised immediately that that was what I wanted to do . After trying to do 3D on a Commodore 64 , I heard about a fledgeling study that specialised in 3D animation , at the utrecht School of Arts . After graduating , I got a short real job at Toonder Studio 's , but decided immediately that I wanted to be my own boss . And so I started Anitime from a grubby one room apartment , sleeping next to the renderfarm , and it has been working ever since . "

In fact , every type of object , including imported meshes , can be used . You can create sprawling cities , huge crowds , giant ship armadas ... the possibilities are limitless ! <h> Density Control <p> Controlling millions of Ecosystem instances altogether can be tough , especially if you need to work only on specific parts . <p> To ease up your control over EcoSystems , use group or individual layers , and create layers affinities to get the perfect homogeneity . <h> Dynamic EcoSystem Population <p> The Dynamic Population Technology featured in Vue let 's you create dense EcoSystems that extend way beyond the horizon , without concern over the number of instances ! <p> This revolutionary technology is capable of handling the near-infinite number of instances required to populate terrains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also dynamically populate areas of your scene , only as they become visible to the camera . <h> The EcoSystem Material A Breakthrough Concept <p> The EcoSystem behaves just like a regular material ! <p> You can save it as a material and create a whole library of EcoSystems , which can be used later for other scenes and objects . <p> It also means that , just like mixed materials , you can mix two or more EcoSystems , with environment influences such as altitude , slope and orientation ! <h> Unprecedented Control <p> The fact that the EcoSystem is treated like a material means that you can take advantage of Vues powerful function editor to control almost every aspect . <p> For example , use a fractal noise generator to control the distribution of EcoSystem objects , or use a bitmap to limit distribution to specific areas . You can add color variations to the EcoSystem for even greater detail and realism . <h> Layered EcoSystem Materials <p> EcoSystems behave just like regular materials .

In addition , each layer can have its own independent reaction to altitude , slope and orientation . <p> Layered EcoSystem materials give you precise control over the EcoSystems characteristics , and let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ density and size to color variations . <p> In addition , all the tools available in the EcoSystem painter and the instance selector can be used to interactively paint and modify layers inside an EcoSystem material . <h> Affinity and Repulsion <p> Layers in an EcoSystem material can also influence one another . By using the affinity and repulsion parameters , its possible to define a relationship between two layers . For instance , using affinity , trees in the first layer can affect the distribution of grass in the second layer , so that the grass grows only around the trees . <h> EcoSystem Phase Control <p> The EcoSystem module , together with the KronosFX module for Vue will allow you to individually control the phase ( animation offset ) of animated elements inside your EcoSystem populations . Thanks to new advances in the EcoSystem technology , Vue can now automatically add phase variations on top the geometrical and material variations that are present in SolidGrowth-based EcoSystems . <p> You can fully control this phase on a per instance basis , using the function graph ( Also requires AdvancedGraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blowing across fields of grass , or violent explosions that blow out surrounding trees . <p> This new ability to control animated instances on an individual basis is not limited to SolidGrowth plants . You can control any type of animated object , including pre-animated meshes ( e.g. to create crowds of people that do n't all walk together ) . <h> EcoSystem Fast Population <p> A new population mode is available in the General tab of the Material Editor , called " Fast population mode " . Each parameter modification ( e.g. instance density , scale or orientation ) is instantly applied to the population and refreshed in the viewport . <p> Once you are happy with the look of your population , you can optionally press the " Accuratly reposition on surface " to precisely place your instances on your geometry . <h> EcoSystem 360 Population <p> Vue can now automatically populate EcoSystems from all directions including below objects .
